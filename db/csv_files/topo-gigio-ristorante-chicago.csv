Topo Gigio Ristorante
"I came to the restaurant for different occasions in the past . The last time I was here was about a week ago because my sister and her family were visiting me from Poland. We were seated promptly by a very friendly host when we got there. We ordered grilled calamari and mussels with marinara sauce for appetizers, and we ordered a few pasta dishes, risotto with grilled beef steak, eggplant parmesan, white fish dish for our main dishes. Even though the portion of each dish was huge but we finished almost all the food on our table. Everything was so good. A friend of mine and I ordered a glass of house Cabernet for each of us, and it tasted much better than I expected. It was smooth and fruity but it still has body. They were also very generous with the amount served in the glass. I can't wait to go back! Maybe I will sit at a table either at the back patio or at their outdoor seats in the front if weather permits."
"This place is one of those places that you must stop by and grab a bite to eat. Have lunch, dinner whatever you choose.   We stopped at topo's after spending the after noon enjoying some recreational activities at the beach.   I'd have to say that I am very pleased with this restaurant, as well for their food.   There was a 30min wait. Which I'd have to say is worth it once you try their food."
"Best Italian food in all the city. Best waiters around- Alex and Ceasar are our favorite!Favorite dishes include the petti de pollo, pasta arrabiata, and eggplant parm. Really can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes though. Fresh sea food as well.BEST. CAPRESE SALAD. EVER. Real buffalo mozzarella. Over all amazing. Family place. In love with it."
"Favorite restaurant in Chicago. Food is amazing!!!!! On Saturdays they have a pasta with a lobster tail.... Best meal of my life maybe. Cons: it's always busy so you'll have to wait for a table, even if you have reservations. And it's also really loud."
"I'm one of the many Yelpers who dream of doing half-stars.  Topo Gigio is a little better than a 3, but not quite a 4.  I love the venetian plaster walls, and the classic Italian restaurant decor.  And who wouldn't love a theme restaurant that pays homage to an early 60's Italian mouse puppet.  I was the first one who arrived from my party of 5.  When I told the hostess I had a reservation she was surly, and can I say bitchy because the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet. Hostess lady, you're supposed to be welcoming, not like the freakin' troll who controls passage over the bridge.  Be nice!  Anyway, I loved the house Chianti and was pleased with the generous pour.  The bread came to the table piping hot and there was also a hot whole grain bread in the  basket.  I love that because then I can justify eating more carbs because it's ""healthier"".  I had grilled portobello with polenta which was really pretty delicious.  The peach sorbet was peachy and refreshing with nice chunks of peaches in it.  My pals got a variety of dishes from black pasta to soup with clam shells floating around in it.  Everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  I seriously wasn't paying attention because I was busy tending to the Chianti.  I also have to say that the service was excellent.  We let our server know that we had a play to catch across the street at the Red Orchid.  The service was perfectly executed to accommodate our schedule.  Overall the experience here was really pretty good.  I think I just got a bit jaded because of the snarly, snarky attitude of the hostess.  Sometimes those first impressions are hard to shake."
"Exceptional Italian restaurant, the flavors are delicately balanced, rich and full of flavor. This is a must have. Conchiglie Mediterranea is terrific, the scallops are perfectly cooked and there's the perfect amount of spice, not overpowering but enough to notice. The eggplant parmesan is one of the best around. Perfectly breaded so you can still taste the eggplant, the right amount of sauce and cheese. Not too much that you're overpowered but enough that you get all the flavors and enjoyment necessary. We had another linguine pasta, I don't see it on the menu listed here, jumbo prawns and capers, red sauce, it's simply to die for! One of the best made pasta dishes I've had. Perfect flavors! Finally, Joe's Salad is a must have! What a treat!! Avocado, potato, tomato, red onion, buffalo mozzarella and aged parmesan, artichoke, capers and just enough vinaigrette . Highly recommended!"
"the only word I can think of is ""basic"" very bland dishes we had. Then I thought, maybe it's the gold coast clientele and their older people that are use to these non-flavored dishes they've been use to for years.  very disappointed I wasted a lot of money here. we should have known when we noticed all the nick knacks on the walls, especially the mice statues all over the place, very bazaar, like some little child decorated the place.. seem dirty too. strange place.."
What an excellent restaurant! The atmosphere is warm and fun and the food is absolutely fantastic. I was so happy with how eager they were to accommodate their pasta dishes to fit my vegetarian diet.
"Topo Gigio is a hidden gem in Old Town! They're very old school Italian, authentic and reasonably priced. The pastas are one of my favorites in the city, and they have a penchant for making incredible sauces. Here are some of my highlights:Garganelli - handmade pasta with very tasty sausageConchiglie - simple but far from plain; never knew shrimps and scallops in tomato basil sauce could taste so goodSpaghetti Ai Frutti Di Mare - marinara sauce is rich with seafood flavor, almost like the calamari, mussels, clams and sea scallops melted into it! Portions are generous for one person, but I usually enjoy my meal so much, I have to resist stuffing myself.  Excellent service and food during the many times I've visited. I would not hesitate to recommend Topo Gigio."
"The food is prepared pretty well overall but this place is as pretentious as it gets. And the inside manager is one of the biggest dickheads I've ever come across in the service industry period. Shocked by his poor attitude and rudeness. Not spending my money there because of his poor treatment of us-I've literally never been so insulted. This guy ushered me outside and dropped some major ""rules"" on me like I was some brat trying to skip the line. He kept saying ""you should know the rules since you've been coming here before""???? Sorry I didn't read my topo Gigio manual before I left my apt. It's also sweltering hot outside so I went inside to get the scoop-obvious hoping for a table inside but more than willing to be out. All he had to do was be a little nicer about it, like use basic customer service skills and people skills, and we'd been spending some loot there right now."
"Very yummy fresh food with reasonable price , service are excellent . And dont miss the dessert especially the daily fresh tiramisu"
"I will be having dinner at this restaurant this evening, I expect it to be quite good as it was a recommendation.  Yesterday I messaged them to secure a reservation for tonight 4/8 through Yelp as that is an option Yelp offers for this particular restaurant. I hadn't heard from them they so I just phoned to make sure I had a table. As it turns out the restaurant does not follow or pay any mind to Yelp or the messaging feature. So heads up to Yelp. Perhaps you ought to be sure that businesses you suggest messaging are actually are participating in your program. I spoke to a very nice fellow who confirmed a reservation for me. So to all who are looking to be in touch with Topo Gigio, call them. Don't bother with the Yelp messaging As a follow up to my earlier remarks I can now say having had my dinner experience at Topo Gigio that it is a meal not to be missed. Wonderful food, exceptional service and a lively electric atmosphere. This is an old family owned Restaurant and when a place is packed on a Wednesday night at 8pm, you know you're in the right place. Vince and Angela could not have been nicer or more welcoming!"
This is not about my second time here because I never went back. But someone we knew also went to this place few weeks ago and said similar things about the hostess. We found this funny.
"I came here with my parents before a second city show and I'm so glad I chose this place!  This is probably the best italian food I've ever had.  I made reservations for a Friday night a few days beforehand, and we got our table right when we arrived.  We decided to sit inside, but there's also a patio outside and a bar outside as well that a lot of people were at. We started off with the grilled calamari with wine sauce, it's a little more chewy than your typical fried calamari but the flavor of the sauce was very tasty.   Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to give us great recommendations.  We shared the filet mignon and the shrimp pesto pasta.  They actually split both dishes for us on two separate places which was very considerate.  The filet was perfectly cooked, the mushroom sauce was tasty and not too salty, and the dish had a big helping of spinach and tasty potatoes.  If they had been mashed potatoes that would have been more epic, but these were still good.   For the shrimp pasta, it was loaded with jumbo shrimp and  a TON of pesto.  It was extremely filling and we were able to take enough for a whole meal home.  For what you get this place is priced just right, not too expensive and I loved the atmosphere.  There are also really cool pictures of famous actors & politicians that have dined here (Bill Clinton, George Clooney and Jay Leno to name a few).This is my favorite restaurant I've been to in old town.  Will definitely be back!"
"First time dining at this restaurant and it was suprisingly good. The ambiance is very welcoming and the staff is really attentive. We started the night with a bottle of wine, which are very affordable. I was surprised to see that I was not looking at $70/$120 bottles of wine. I wanted to order everything off the menu, but my date did not eat seafood.. ""bummer""... We ended up ordering the caprese salad and the carpaccio appetizers. They were both fantastic. For main course, I ordered the grilled scampi & sea scallops, and my date ordered the veal santimbocca. They were equally good."
"I ventured out here last Friday night with four girlfriends - without a reservation(!) - and we were seated with very little wait time.  The hostess who sat us was very rude, but our waiter for the evening was great and definitely made up for it.  For an appetizer, we split the Portobello E Polenta - which we decided was ""just ok"".  But we were all pleased with our main pasta dishes - which, by they way, are served al dente.  For vegetarian dishes, I definitely recommend the Eggplant alla Parmigiana (with a side of pasta), or the Campanelle alla Norma (which has a bit of a kick to it).  I have been here many times - it's perfect for a date spot, family dinners, or a night out with your girlfriends.  The food (and wine!!) is consistent and delicious."
"Let me start by saying I am not a big fan of going out to eat Italian food. It is just not that exciting to me and I tend to leave feeling like I could have made the dish better at home. That said, I actually loved Topo Gigio! I went with a group of 8 people and made a last minute reservation. The waiter was a really pleasant and humorous Italian gentleman who was very attentiveness. We ordered a wide variety of items including the pesto pasta with  shrimp, the seafood pasta in marinara, spaghetti and meatballs, caprese salad, grilled scallops, and a few other items as well. I did not hear any complaints about the food. They were very generous with the seafood and the dishes were overall quite flavorful. The pasta portions were definitely large as well. However, like most Italian restaurants, the dishes were very heavy and caloric. I definitely needed a nap afterwards. Nonetheless, I would come back here again if I was ever in the mood for some Italian."
"It's got mice! Lots of them! On the walls, on the tables, on the floor.  Jerry Seinfeld doesn't seem to mind.  Neither do Bill Clinton and James Earl Jones. Smiling post-dinner photographs of these and multiple other celebrities adorn a wall attesting to their satisfaction with the restaurant.The mice are of the cute cartoon variety featured in the Italian TV show Topo Gigio.  The restaurant is named after that show and the mice schtick is exuberantly embraced. Topo Gigio features an outdoor garden, sidewalk seating, and a covered outdoor bar in addition to their indoor dining room and bar. Though garden and sidewalk seating cannot be reserved, when we arrived with our reservation for the dining room we were offered the option of sitting outdoors. My dining companion, who gravitates towards salmon pastas at Italian restaurants, claims the Farfalle ai Due Salmoni is the best in the city.  The bow tie pasta is served with two types of salmon, Norwegian Smoked Salmon and North Pacific Salmon, in a tomato cream sauce. My Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare was very enjoyable too.  The pasta is mixed with calamari, mussels, clams, and sea scallops in a marinara sauce.The service was efficient albeit a tad perfunctory.  We got the feeling the waiter had been at his job for many, many years.  Topo Gigio has been around for several decades. With the quality of food they continue to serve, it's easy to see why the restaurant has become an institution in Chicago."
"This is more like 3.5. As someone who leans toward Asian food than Italian food, my ears perk up when I hear this place. I've been here twice and I have enjoyed the food and service to  recommend it to people. I came here once on a date and once as a group.Though I don't care for pasta (it's bland with carb-y caloric), I remember liking their Sausage Orecchiette  - it was in a creamy vodka sauce with peas (and I abhor peas). Their octopus apps were good. Their food is generally flavorful. the 2nd time I went, I had their special one night: grilled bass - very well cooked. the waiter was nice to enough to exchange the mash potatoes for spinach. Reservations are tough to get and the place gets packed fast for dinner. I don't recommend sitting in the covered (out door area) in the winter. your feet still get cold even with the heat lamps around."
I took my family here before a Second City show and we all had a great time. I can't think of anything that I'd like for them to improve. I had the conchiglie alla sarda and it was plate-licking good.
We had a very large part in the outdoor garden last Thursday. Service was impeccable (as well as patient)! Wonderful food.
"This may not be a progressive, overly creative Tuscan restaurant, but what they do, they do well.  When we walked in the aromas from the kitchen just felt like a warm hug on a chilly evening.  The charming atmosphere, complete with mice mascots, just provided a comfortable and subdued vibe.We started with the prosciutto di Parma with mozzarella di Bufala and roasted peppers.  With quality ingredients such as these, there is not much to mess up.  Each was left to shine in it's own spotlight.  It was delicious.Entrees included one of the night's specials - pumpkin ravioli with a pink sauce, home made spaghetti with a porcini, sausage and parmigiano reggiano ragu, and veal scalloppini with capers, lemon and wine.   We all sampled each other dishes and there was no dissenters.  Everyone was very happy with their meals.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu.  Although light and creamy, it was a bit too mellow taste wise.  The texture was more prominent than the flavor.  I kind of felt like I put  a nozzle of a whipped cream container to my mouth.  Lots of fluff. There are so many good Italian restaurants in Chicago, so a repeat visit may not come soon, but Topo Gigio definitely qualifies as a contender to keep in the back pocket when we crave some hearty fare in a comfortable environment."
"I've decided that this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago!I decided to bring my mom here after having a really good first experience with my boyfriend. My mom and I came in and I was just as impressed as the first time. My mom ordered a seafood linguini and I ordered the rack of lamb. Both were absolutely delicious. I can't get over the quality of food this restaurant is able to produce. The rack of lamb was so tender and juicy and the linguini was probably the best that I have ever had. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and it was just as good as the first time. I'm constantly blown away by how amazing this restaurant is and I would highly suggest it to anyone and everyone!"
"One of my favorite Italian places in Chicago! Have never been disappointed with a meal here. Even my dad, who is really hard to please, was impressed with his chicken dish. Highly recommend!"
"Fantastic Italian restaurant, the food is so good you may want to eat it every day. Whether you are seated inside in the dining room or outside in the garden, the atmosphere is always pleasant and comfortable to be in. There is a fully stocked bars and an extensive  wine list with a lot of very fine Italian wines. In addition to the bar they have a very knowledgeable and personable bartender who knows how to interact with people. It is important to make a reservation before coming to the restaurant in colder weather , Topo Gigio is a very popular place to go. In the warm weather the outdoor garden and sidewalk seating is very popular, you might have to wait 30 minutes because they don't take reservations.Entering the dining room guests are greeted with an array of antipasto selections on platters. In addition you can order appetizers off the menu. The portions are large and entrées come with house salads. I enjoy starting with the "" Capesante Al Vino Bianco scampi and sea scallops, sautéed with mushrooms, chardonnay & lemon sauce."" In addition I enjoy the fried calamari, it is always crisp and tasty. My favorite pasta is the ""Rigatoni Al Filo Di Fumo rigatoni in pomodoro sauce, with pancetta, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil, topped with pecorino cheese,"" it is probably very fattening but it is wonderful. Everything. I have had has been perfect, the fish seasoned just right, the steak tender and flavorful, even the vegetable are amazing. Deserts and coffee are fantastic many Italian specialties. The service is great the staff is always very pleasant and efficient. The only downfall is the popularity of the restaurant in the warm months has many people waiting along 30 minutes to be seated outside , along with the regular people who sit at the bar, it can get a little noisy. Even considering this fact I have given Topo  Gigio five stars for outstanding food and service."
No need to look for better Italian cuisine in Chicago after finding this gem. Romantic for a first or last date. Literally everything on the menu is delicious and the service compliments the food with intelligent servers who know about the dishes and add to the appeal. I know this is a short review but you have to experience this place to truly have good Italian in Chicago.
"The bartenders know you, know what you like to drink and the food is always on par with higher star restaurants! The food, ambiance and liquor is par excellence. Cannot recommend it enough!"
"Found this restaurant on Yelp before going to see a Second City show only a few blocks away. What a fantastic choice! Everyone at our table got something different, and everyone was extremely satisfied. Even as an Italian myself, I have had a wide sampling, and the Eggplant Parmesan was, I think, the best I've ever had! Even as a resident of the suburbs, we will make sure we end up back here in the future. Highly recommended!"
"Last Monday night (08/18), after we laughed our heads off at The Second City improv show, my boyfriend and I decided on Italian and chose this place. It was rather empty inside, which was bit troubling to me, but then again, it was a Monday night, and well past the normal dinner hour, so there you go.I ordered a glass of red wine and eggplant Parmesan. I was not prepared for the amount of food presented to me...holy cow. I like eggplant, but man, this was huge. I did my best with it, but it was simply too much. The texture and the flavor were very good, and the cheese on top didn't overpower the dish. I also liked the tomato sauce on it; I could tell it was a homemade recipe and not something from a jar, which sometimes happens in so-called ""Italian"" restaurants.The manager of the place was very nice and kept stopping by our table to chat with us; it turned out he worked in Hoboken for a while before heading out to Chicago, and we traded stories on baseball team loyalties. It was a fun time.If we ever find ourselves in or around Wells Street in Chicago again, I wouldn't mind coming by here again."
"On first bite, Topo was delicious. Portions were big. And many of their plates had housemade features on them...which is pretty great. But some things left a little to be desired...We started our meal with the baked clams. First off, this dish only comes with 6 mini clams but a whole lot of onions...and another thing to keep in mind is that 75% of the clam was breading. Soggy breading. Not impressed at all. We then followed it up with the homemade chicken and rice soup. You could definitely tell it was homemade...it was light, but flavorful. Very delicious in my opinion.  For my entree, I was deciding between the tortellini and the clam linguine...ultimately deciding on the linguine. I like noodles, what can I say. And Topo definitely doesn't skimp on them either. Nor do they on the clams. But I have a feeling they mix canned clams with fresh ones. Why? Well I had about 10 clams in shell on my pasta, but I also had a mountain of clam meat atop my pasta as well...and that kind of took away from the dish overall. I would have rather had a lighter pasta with less clams where I could really taste the freshness and sweetness from just the clams in shell. But what I got was a clam heavy pasta with more clam juice flavor then clam. In terms of service, our server...actually, the only server in the back patio, spent a good amount of time playing with his smart phone on the back corner. All he did was take orders then go back to his corner. Runners did the rest. He even got mad when the welcoming hostess tried to sit a party near the back, next to his hideaway. He immediately re-sat them in an area closer to the front.What was he trying to hide? But anyways, if we are going for food alone - it's alright."
"I can't believe I have never been here!!!We ventured here on a Sunday evening a couple of weeks ago with a few friends.  We were all starving.  Rudy was our bartender and waiter.  He was AMAZING!!!  He fixed our wobbly table, got us our food, gave us suggestions, and kept drinks and water in front of us at all times while also taking care of every other table and bar patron.  He was also very friendly and funny.We had such a good time that we decided to hang for a while after dinner and ended up closing the place up.  We will definitely be back.  The food was amazing and the service was top notch thanks to Rudy!!!"
"During the art fair yesterday, we were enjoying a Starbucks coffee on the sidewalk, considering places to have dinner. Due to the coffee being overly full, we poured a bit out on the sidewalk so it would not spill. Immediately, a bouncer grabs the full cup and tosses it in the garbage. No words, nothing. No apology. We were appalled that this happened. When we asked to enter to talk to a manager they wouldn't let us enter. Will never be entering again nor will anybody we know. Horrible customer service."
"Extremely rude treatment from the hostess.  If not for the service recovery efforts of Tony, I would not have stayed.   The hostess first chastised us for not having a reservation and then said:  if you don't want this table, I'll give it to someone else.  She should.  I just don't want it that bad.  I had to check the sign to make sure I wasn't at Ed Debevics.  My fiance and I met at Topo.  But, I'll struggle to ever want to go back.The food tonight was very good tonight and it's hard to beat the romantic ambiance.   But over the years the food has ranged from amazing to downright horrifying.  Inconsistent performance (don't order the mussels)..anyone can make a great meal once (or twice..the eggplant parm).  Buyer beware.  Consider eating at home and having an appetizer and drink at the bar...and ask for Tony."
"Have been here twice with my husband and another couple and can't recommend it enough. Definitely the place to go if you have friends/family visiting and want to try authentic Chicago Italian.Both times I've tried the calamari, once fried and once sautéed, and both times perfection. I hate chewy calamari (and won't eat the squidy looking ones) but both preparations of this were spot on.  They have a wide variety of salads to choose from as well. The last time we went, my husband and I split a Caesar salad which was still HUGE for two people. If you get an appetizer, split a salad and get your own entrée that is definitely enough food.There aren't a large variety of vegetarian pastas to choose from, but they can make almost any vegetarian. The first time I tried the Tortellini alla Panna and had them omit the pancetta so it was just the tortellini with mushrooms and sweet peas, and of course cream and cheese. I don't normally like peas but this was very good! The second time I tried the Rigatoni which was basic and delicious; real pasta, not something dressed up too much.The staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in making suggestions. Will come back over and over."
"If you're in the area and are in the mood for Italian, it's worth stopping in. That said, if there's a super long wait, you might want to stop by another time. Compared to other similar Italian restaurants in the city, it was just okay--pretty standard; nothing overly unique. However, the ambiance was enjoyable."
One of the most underrated Italian spots in all of Chicago! This is classic Italian and everything is spot on. Homemade pasta is killer! Loved the sausage pasta especially. Grilled octopus was cooked to perfection. Great service but they were sold out of the tiramisu :( bummed!!
"I have gone to this place for 10 years and read the reviews online about the hostess and owner and couldn't believe it until I experienced it myself.  My friend and I went to have dinner - we were on the patio which is self seating.  A table got up that was by the heater and we moved - the hostess comes over and says we have to move that we can't sit there she has someone who is a party of 5.   We had already been sitting there - I looked up at her - and she put her face and hand in my face and said ""don't even"" I said excuse me? and she screamed ""you heard me - I said Don't even!"" I said I'm a customer who the hell are you talking to like that?  She started screaming and throwing her hands around like she was on the street in the south side.  I asked for the owner - the owner was 100 times worse - came out screaming and cursing and calling me a fat bitch and that I should leave.  I will never give another dime to such a degenerate group of people that have no respect for their customers.  There are too many great Italian places in Chicago - whom have class and respect - if you want to be treated like you live in the Ghetto.  Please make a reservation."
I was looking for a place to take my parents for lunch. They love italian food and they usually are very picky about it. Guess what? I hit the right place. The menu is really good and everything we ordered was great. The ambience is really nice and cozy. Prices are great. Enjoy!
"It's a really crowded place in a nice neighborhood. I got the seafood pasta (forgot the actual name), but it had shrimps and scallops. The portion size is nice, but the sauce wasn't too great. It was wayyy too salty for me and the seafood taste lingered more than it should. The salmon pasta dish had salmon already cut into small pieces, which makes it less messy to eat. Other pasta dishes were okay, too. This place is decent, but not phenomenal. I can say I tried it, but this isn't a place I would opt to come back after trying it."
"I went there with a group of 12 people for a friend's birthday. The place was perfect for the event: nice atmosphere, friendly waiter and my sea food pasta was excellent."
"If you want to base your opinion of the restaurant by their bread, then this place is amazing! The pasta dishes are superb and the service was excellent. The overall experience was something I'd gladly have again!"
"Yummy food, especially the pasta! Nice warm atmosphere, great service. We loved it. Great for a group, festive, nice lighting."
"I've been going to Topo Gigio for quite sometime. It's conveniently located near a myriad of entertaining venues and their food and service is generally sublime. Yet each time I've come lately the service and food quality has diminished. My last occasion was the worst and will have me dining at the other nearby eateries more often. My girlfriend and I stopped in before a show with the intention of ordering a bottle of wine, eating a few appetizers and romantically sharing our entrees. We began our visit with a server aggressively offering to sit us in his section to avoid waiting. We enthusiastically accepted as he sat us by the door in the bar. The meal started with us ordering two glasses of wine with the idea of perusing and pairing with our first appetizer while deciding on our bottle. While serving our appetizer, our server inadvertently broke my girlfriend's glass of Pinot Noir and most of it spilled on her custom blouse. We both were servers once upon a time so we understood and it was no big deal. Unfortunately the server continued to teasingly berate my girlfriend that it was due to her errant placement of her glass that caused his blunder. Once or twice, fine but it was constant, throughout our entire meal and painful as I watched her forcefully try to laugh it off. ""Why were you tasting his wine?"", ""Why was it moved so close..."" and so on. Had the busser not been there constantly making things better I would spoke my mind. The food. We first quickly ordered the Carpaccio Piemontese and it arrived looking very different from what I remembered. Luckily our server broke some glass into it and presented us with a new one that was presented and tasted SPECTACULAR and how I remembered. I was REALLY looking forward to eating the antipasto freddo and the capesante con pesto but we moved onto ordering our pastas: fusilli and campanili and completely forgot to order the lamb. The campanili was delicious as usual but the fusilli was surprisingly dry as if sitting under a heating lamp too long. We ended our meal with my first time ordering gelato from here which was delicious. It ended up being completely melted because our server disappeared for an uncomfortable amount of time. All in all everything ended up being plated well with large portions and tasting good enough for me to give this review three stars because it was 'eh-okay'. I'm disheartened that I would recommend other neighborhood eateries but I must. Perhaps their success has reduced its pressing need to be fresh and mannered but now there are definitely better venues."
One of my favorite places to eat. Black linguini is the best. I could do without the calamari which is too crispy and dry.
"Friendly staff. Tasty sauces. Cute ambiance. No gluten free menu or options. Two meals over done. Tilapia and Steak ordered medium rare. Both were so overdone! Like they were 5 day old reheated food. The worst I've ever had. We were starving. Food took awhile to come out, so we just ate what we could muster, and had to leave for a show."
"My partner and I went here during the Old Town arts festival, so it was extremely packed!  The hostess was really friendly and energetic about getting us a table.  We were sat on the patio and seen by our waiter promptly and he was quite professional and knowledgeable; attentive without being annoying.  We were enjoying our bread and olive oil and wine when it began to rain on us.  The entire waitstaff began to mobilize to find us an umbrella so that we could continue our meal! The food was excellent, I had the tortellini with a crème sauce and ham chunks, and my lady had the some beef with a red sauce and risotto.  The beef was tender and the sauce was a bit sweet and a bit tangy, a perfect dish!  The wine we had was a perfect pairing for our meal and was suggested by our waiter.  There was a bit of a dust up with a neighboring table and the hostess resulting in some threatening words being exchanged and those patrons being ejected.  We the thought it was amusing to me and my partner but the owner and the host apologized to us and offered us a free dessert, which we happily accepted!  Great food and a friendly family like atmosphere and professional staff!"
I ended up here with my friend after we unsuccessfully tried to go to another place that was closed. It was around 3 or 4pm on a Monday so many places nearby were closed. We sat outside and the service was great. We weren't starving so we shared a pasta dish with some wine - a great end to a great weekend in Chicago! Also it was really nice that the waiter told us we didn't have to pay the normal fee for sharing a dish that was listed on the menu. If I was in the neighborhood I'd go back.
"Let me start by saying that this one-star rating is solely for management; the wait staff is clearly hard working, friendly, and professional (as I suspect the kitchen staff is as well). I have been coming here since I moved to town in 2012- for the most part we have enjoyed our meals here: good food, nice waitstaff. However, reservations are NEVER on time. Today was the last straw for me. We had a reservation for 8:30, and to be fair I was warned that we may not be seated until ""a few minutes after our reservation time"". That's fine, and quite frankly expected on a Saturday night in the city. What is not acceptable is when ""a few minutes"" turns into 40. When we were finally seated, we promptly warned our waiter that we had somewhere to be at 10:15 and would only be ordering entrees as a result of our time crunch. He said he would do his best, but warned that the kitchen was backed up. We didn't get our food until after 10:05pm (an hour and 35 minutes after or reservation time). We ended up missing our plans at 10:15 , which was a bit upsetting. I didn't bother saying something to the waiter bc it was evident it was not his fault. Instead, I asked if there was a manager I could speak with on the way out. I spoke to the female manager (Ashley I think). I wasn't going to originally, but I felt it was only fair that I tell them directly before posting something online. The manager I spoke with was, quite frankly , rude and unprofessional. I was careful to word my complaint in a productive and non-combative manner. She never once apologized for our inconvenience, all I received was an ""ok"". It was clear she didn't give a crap about her costumers. As we were walking out the other members in my group also commented on how rude she was. Prior to my incident with her this was going to be a 3 star review- but she cemented the1star rating.It seems the management at Topo Gigio cares more about making an extra buck than they do about the experience of their customers. It would serve them well to hire a new manager (or at least train the current manager in how to actually manage and deal with customers in a productive, and professional manner). Sadly, I won't be going back until these issues are addressed. It is embarrassing to bring guests here only to have them stand waiting for their reservation, wait over an hour for food, and be treated rudely by management."
One of the best cold seafood salad EVER!
"A very popular place, and it's easy to understand why, after you taste the food!  I was getting Rigatoni al Filo di Fumo (Rigatoni in Pomodoro Sauce, With Pancetta, Fresh Mozzarella and Fresh Basil, topped with Pecorino Cheese), but I was getting it to go and needed it packaged in two separate containers...they not only did it easily, they even packed the accompanying salad and bread in two separate containers, without me having to ask!  Thank you for smart folks with initiative!  The rigatoni was wonderful, and I sat at the crowded bar while I waited and saw and smelled all of the wonderful foods going by...I can't wait to go back!"
"Topo Gigio is easily one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to and is definitely one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The atmosphere is awesome-- tons of cool decorations inside, a covered outdoor area, and an additional back patio area. I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table. They serve bread while you're waiting, but make sure to save plenty of room for the main course!My personal favorite is a special they have somewhat regularly: Black linguine with shrimp and I think scallops (and sometimes it comes with lobster tail). It is served in a light creamy tomato sauce and is absolutely to die for! The shrimp are massive and cooked perfectly-- normally I'm not a fan of large shrimp because of the texture, but these are awesome.  The serving is huge, so I almost always end up having leftovers.  I've also had to pesto pasta.  I love pesto and this dish is smothered in it...if the black linguine isn't available, this is my second go-to.  My friends have also gotten the sea bass (amazing!) and fettuccine Alfredo (just as good, super filling).  If you're getting Italian in this city, no question: go to Topo Gigio."
"i figured if 425 people have reviewed this place, what's once more?A good place as any to start your night out Wed- Sunday (6:30, 7PM)Throw in some pasta and some good friends and that truly is a good time indeed. They have a good wine selection. That is probably an understatement.It's a nice calm place to have a conversation or two. Apparently if you look on the wall, it has a signed pic of Jerry Seinfeld. I guess this means he says its ok to eat here. Thanks Jerry :)Whenever I come here, Rudy The Bartender asks me if I will have the same thing as I had since the last time I was here. That guy has a good memory. That type of service is hard to come by in big cities today.  If you like veal, this is also a good place. That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
The exterior and interior gave an actual Italian feeling. It had a full bar which was a plus point. The service was top class. Ordered a Gnocchi...it was world class. Do check this restaurant.
"The last time I had dinner here I felt like they rushed us through the meal.  Entrees came out about 2 seconds after when got our starters and the busser was stalking our table, even tryed to take my plate when I still had the fork in hand with food on it and my plate.That being said... this restaurant is a neighborhood favorite.  And the food is great!!"
Just perfect everything from the hostess to the dessert was spot on. If you are in the area this is a must. Even if you have a favorite Italian dish that is not on the menu they will make it for you.
Very good. Great service. Great food...busy even on a Tuesday night. Highly recommend. Even half portion sizes available which were perfect.If in the area of this restaurant I would definitely go here for good Italian food!
"A series of dining disasters led us to this restaurant on a night when we had tickets for Second City. The place was bustling outside when we arrived but nearly empty inside, so we opted for indoor seating. Our waiter was an older heavily-accented Italian gentleman who was brusque with us the minute I said I wasn't sure what wine I wanted, so that was fun. I actually decided against the wine altogether, in part because of his rudeness, and that just made things so much worse. Questions I asked about the menu were met with more rudeness and irritation; I was uncomfortable from the start. (Later, a family from Italy was seated near us and he LOVED them - they spoke Italian to each other and laughed and he was at their table every five seconds cracking jokes. So maybe our crime was NOT being Italian?)It was a hot, sticky evening, and all of the food on the menu looked super-heavy - it just wasn't what I wanted. But, we were running out of time and so stuck around. My husband ordered the Conchiglie Alla Sarda while I opted for ""Joe's Salad,"" which sounded like a bunch of wrong things that might just be right - it had everything from endive to raisins and avocado in it. I asked for the balsamic vinaigrette on the side. When my dressing arrived, it was fully broken - a whole lot of oil with a few dark drops of balsamic in it. I was trying to stir it into something not broken when the waiter came back and asked me what was wrong. I told him the dressing wasn't mixed properly, and he took the spoon from me, stirred it a few times, then practically threw the spoon down and said, ""That's what happens when you order it on the side."" AND THEN WALKED AWAY.I should note that I was expecting the salad itself to be more of a regular salad, or even chopped, but it was this large composed piece with like a wheel of fresh mozzarella on one side and hunks of avocado on the other. And it was on a plate so it was hard to incorporate things together. On the whole it was very bland, and a broken dressing didn't help. At this point, the waiter threw a thing of balsamic vinegar down on our table and said, ""Here, maybe you just want vinegar,"" and walked away again. This was my breaking point. I went and asked for a manager, at which point our waiter was suddenly up in my business, asking, ""What's wrong, what did I do?"" I told the manager that our waiter had been rude and that my salad was terrible. I asked for a to-go box for my husband's pasta and said I would not be paying for the salad. I did this all quietly, so as not to cause a scene, but the waiter kept saying, ""I'm so sorry if I was rude, I didn't know, you didn't tell me, what can I do?"" He followed me back to the table, where I went to wait for my to-go box and the check, and kept saying, ""How can I make this right? I make my living from you; if I've done something wrong, you should've told me, told ME, not go to the manager, what can I do to make it right?"" I said I'd just pick at my husband's pasta (which was tasty, albeit as heavy as I feared), but the waiter insisted on bringing me something else. He asked me about what I liked and then decided to bring me a piece of chicken and some grilled asparagus. I kept saying not to bother but he insisted. He put the order in and then proceeded to come back to our table every three seconds to apologize and tell us again that we're how he makes his living and we should've said something to him not the manager. It felt like a sketch we'd see at Second City after the meal!The chicken and asparagus came out and were actually really good - the chicken was juicy and had a nice balance of lemon and garlic flavor. The asparagus was larger than I liked but the char on them made them yummy. This is, by the way, the ONLY reason I'm giving Topo Gigio two stars instead of one. After, the waiter kept saying, ""Can I bring you some tiramisu? Oh, it'll be delicious, it's homemade, let me make this right."" But we wanted to get to the show and by this point, my poor husband (who ate 75% of his pasta and half my dinner) was stuffed.Here's the best part: When we got our check, the waiter actually charged us for the chicken and asparagus he insisted on ""giving"" me to ""make things right."" AND HE CHARGED US THREE FULL DOLLARS MORE THAN I WOULD'VE PAID FOR MY HORRIBLE SALAD. I looked at the bill and just started laughing. My husband was horrified and was waiting for me to say something, but sometimes you just have to let this stuff go, right?I didn't even stiff him on the tip, because I'm like that. I just tipped closer to 18% than 20%+ (my usual). But seriously? What a classless move."
"First off, I love the atmosphere. Secondly, whenever my friend & I go to dinner we always get risotto, so we have some experience with it!  Their risotto came with filet, but since she is not a red meat eater, we opted for chicken instead. The waiter gave us that choice after explaining he didn't want to charge us $20 for a plate of just rice when we said we wouldn't be getting the filet. The waiter was really great by the way!  So the risotto was great, came in a tomato sauce with mushrooms and chunks of tomatoes. I myself would like to come back and try it with the filet."
"Topo Gigio is a staple in my restaurant repertoire.  It seems to be perfect for so many occasions.  The price point is excellent, particularly for out-of-towners who may be unaccustomed to spending Chicago prices on a nice meal.  Beyond this, the food and ambiance are exceptional!Reservations can be made to be seated inside, however you cannot make reservations for dining outdoors.  While we chose to wait an additional 20-40 minutes to be seated outside, the hostess was attentive and providing frequent updates on timing, and the bar provided an excellent spot to enjoy a drink while we waited.  Sitting outside was well worth the wait!Our table was charming and candlelit and the service was impeccable.  Our Italian waiter steered us towards an excellent, fairly priced wine and recommended a couple of his favorite dishes.  We indulged in grilled calamari, conchiglie alla sarda, and eggplant parmesan.  I am the first to critique any dish, and I can say that we did not draw a single criticism on any of the three.  The serving sizes were large and will provide a second meal for almost anyone. Overall, another excellent experience at Topo Gigio and it will continue to be one of my favorites!"
"I have been to Topo Gigio at least seven times in the past several years.  I never miss an opportunity to go.  Every year, I go to the Zoo Lights at LPZ with my friend and our moms, but I think the real tradition has become to go to Topo Gigio.  It is delicious!I have two ""go to"" dishes: tortellini alla panna and spaghetti ai frutti de mare.  The tortellini is served in a cream sauce with prosciutto and peas (I order without the peas because I hate them).  The spaghetti has TONS of seafood.  I ordered it for the first time last year and thought they were giving me a lot because it was the end of the night and they wanted to get rid of everything, but no.  I ordered it on my most recent trip and I still got a TON of seafood.Their specials are excellent too.  You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  You are served bread, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese at the beginning of your meal, a definite fave of mine.So why not five stars if I have so much love for the place?  The service is sometimes great, other times it's less than stellar.  On my most recent trip, our server was not very attentive.  We noticed he was paying significantly more attention to the larger party next to us (7 or 8 people versus 4) who were drinking wine.  Not okay.I'd highly encourage anyone in Old Town to stop by.  Try the al fresco seating when it gets warm out!  The patio out back is really cute!"
"I have been going to Topo Gigio for over 20 years. It's a place that consistently gets better every time I go. Last night we ate there with family. We decided to go last minute. I called a few hours ahead and although there were no reservations available, the hostess said that we could come in as walk-ins and that she'd do her best for us. We arrived at 6:30. We were greeted by Ashley (the hostess), who remembered my name from our earlier conversation. She said that she would have a table inside (they have a heated patio outside) but that it would be a little bit of a wait. This is a blessing in disguise because the people watching in Old Town and Topo Gigio is so much fun. So we hung out and watched the world go by as the place was packed. There was an incredible vibe and we were right in the middle of it while waiting for our table. Every 5-10 minutes Ashley checked in with us and gave us a status update. Her communication was first class. When our wait exceeded her expectation, we were each treated to a glass of wine. Shortly after receiving the wine our table was ready.We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant with great views in every direction. The waiter was fantastic and knew the menu very well. The classic Tuscan menu was diverse. Our food arrived and the plates were beautifully prepared. Dessert was incredible too, especially the Tiramisu in a bowl! Genius. On our way out, we were thanked for our business by the waiter, the manager, and Ashley the hostess. The overall experience was exactly what it has always been for me- perfect."
"My family. They're not Italian, but they like to pretend. My mom tries to say the names of pastas and cheeses with a phony-ass Italian accident that'll drive you up a F*cking wall. She lives off pasta, lives for pizza and pretty much can't get enough of any vegetable deep dried and served with a side of marinara and grated cheese. I, on the other hand, am just not into all that jazz. I can't appreciate Frank Sinatra and Italian food is my least favorite cuisine. I can't stand pasta. White sauce makes me gag. Spaghetti is tied for my #1 most hated food along with custard. I can't stand desserts with lemon incorporated into them with the exception of Italian Ice, in which lemon is the only acceptable flavor in my book, but somehow, I really, truly enjoyed Topo Gigio. I was the first of my group to arrive and was promptly excited to see they offer valet right in front the restaurant so I didn't have to park in one of the areas grossly over-rated parking garages, though the valet service only runs until 10pm. I walked into the bar area with indoor/outdoor heat lamps blazing, working hard to defrost my freezing and chapped flesh. Oooh it felt so good. The customers and bartenders looked at me as if I'd actually gotten that face tattoo I'd wanted when I was a kid. Not sure if it's because I was about 40 years younger than anyone else there, or just because I'm a generally odd-looking fellow, but I definitely felt like an outsider walking into a small town bar. I continued to the rear and then through to the left restaurant side of TG to claim our group of eight's table. Our server promptly greeted me, with his thick old-world Italian accent and treated me as if I was neighborhood youngster who might be friends with his grandchildren, which sounds more condescending than it's meant to- he was warm, welcoming and wanted to be sure I was comfortable in what was obviously my first TG dining experience. I got a glass of their very best and only house Chianti because I don't know much about wine beyond that I like it red and to come with a good Silence of the Lambs reference and for my meal I opted out of pasta as it's not really my thing, plus I was still pretty full from my earlier lunch, and got the grilled calamari appetizer. It was about the size you'd expect for it to be as an appetizer and though it was a bit on the chewy side, the char-grilled flavor really out-shined any lesser qualities of the cephalopod and with just a squish of lemon, it was light, yet filling and exactly what I was looking for following the aforementioned (monster) lunch I'd eaten.   I'd also got to try a bit of my of the Campanlle alla Norma (see pics) which was probably one of the best pastas this self-proclaimed pasta hater has ever tried. I'd make that dish my one exception to the rule, for sure. Oh, and the past portions are mountainous. An appetizer and one pasta portion is definitely enough for two.I can see myself taking my mom and/or grandma here for a meal in the future as I know this is right up their Italian-American-loving alley."
"Found this place through Chicago Yelpers. Great choice. Service:  I want to start with the service because it was excellent. We Got service and a quick sitting for two on a for crowded place. The restaurant was very packed.   THe waiter was very attentive for all of his tables. 5/5 Food: Started w the grilled calamari and prosciutto - Calamari was a bit over cooked but well seasoned. The prosciutto appetizer was great.  I got the  veal for dinner - it was again over cooked.  But it was very well seasoned. However, The spinach  cooked well on the bottom of the veal. For dessert,  I  Got a homemade tiramisu!  Yum, it was really good.  Overall, the pricing of the food was right on point. I have no complain.  4/5 Atmosphere: It was very well decorated.  this place was jamming for a super busy Friday night.  However, the tables are so close to each other. You have tug your stomach in to walk to the bathroom. You can easily ease-drop people conversation. But they set up those table like that because they wanted to fit more people.   3.5/5Overall, I am coming back here to try their pizza and other dishes.  good place in old town."
Delicious Italian food. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it did not disappoint! Fresh breads and salads and an unforgettable olive oil! Authentic Italian!
"Solid Italian restaurant that you can bring a date, girlfriends, or older traditional folks. The portions are pretty huge, the pasta is made in house (and you can really taste the difference). I had a seafood pasta with tomato sauce in fettuccini and loved it. I sampled mushroomy pastas from my dining companions and also loved that. If you're scratching your head for a place to dine, this is a solid 'traditional' choice."
"Finally made it to Topo Grigio this weekend for Friday dinner. Glad we made reservations as it was packed when we walked in! We were seated to a 2 top table by the front window by the bar.. Which was great as it seemed really loud in the main area of the restaurant! We were greeted with water and fresh warm bread right away. The waiter recommended an Italian red that we both loved - very generous pours and so reasonably priced! We both had the Conchiglelie Alla Sarda and it was unreal. Definitely enough to take home and great for lunch the next day. Great service, great menu, and good atmosphere minus the noise level. Can't wait to to back soon to try more of the menu!!"
"The food here was WONDERFUL and the service from the man at the bar outside was also top notch. That's the only thing which saved this review from going south quickly. Our server was very fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but seemed to rush us through dinner. When I called to make a reservation the hostess was SUPER rude and lived up to her personality when we came in. We arrived 15 mins early and after checking in I noted we would wait outside for our table. She made me feel stupid that I even thought our table would be ready and not 2 minutes later she rushed out to say ""you better take the table that just opened or I can't guarantee you'll have a spot, we're filling up."" (No sh*t hunny, but that's why I made a reservation. Slow your roll.) Just not the way to make a guest feel warm and welcome on a very busy Saturday night."
"Great red sauce Italian restaurant! The prices for the value and quantity of the food is great. The 2 times I have been there, I had the waiter make dishes which weren't on the menu. Fairly descent priced wine menu too."
"I don't usually write Yelp reviews, but this was a true five star experience so I had to. We ordered a bottle of champagne; I had a veal special, and my date had a fish special. Both entrees and the champagne were absolutely delicious, including the sides of spinach that came with my veal.The atmosphere was intimate but just casual enough for a first or second date, and our server was a very prompt and professional gentleman.I'd definitely come back."
"Topo gigio was the first stop on our girls night out this past weekend and it definitely lived up to the hype. I received a recommendation from a friend so decided to give it a try. To start, the bread the put on the tables is SO good. Of course I drowned it in oil and Parmesan cheese, but what kind of Italian restaurant would it be without that?! My friends and I had two nice bottles of wine, which the wait staff was sure to fill once our glasses were remotely close to being empty. The main dishes are very large, so I would recommend sharing. My two friends and I split two pastas and still had a ton left over. We ordered a salmon farfalle dish and a tortellini with pancetta. My mouth is watering thinking about both of them now. Would definitely recommend this place for a classy dinner in old town! We went before a comedy show and it worked out perfectly."
"Ambience - was nice, warm & charming.Food - I ordered the fusilli ala topo gigio & it tasted really fresh, flavorful & light, would order again. My friend ordered rigatoni al filo de fumo which was pretty good.Service - we had to wait a while to get our food, & even longer to get the check. We were there on a Wednesday night but the place was really busy. Overall we really liked this place & would return again"
"I am not sure why I haven't written a review yet. I have been here a dozen times and it is consistently wonderful.I am not going to write what you should get, yadda yadda yadda. I have tried all sorts of items and they are all executed well. Food is top notch, service is perfect, atmosphere is great. It's an equally good place for a date as well as a night out with a group of friends.Bottom line: if you are even considering going here, do it. You will not be disappointed."
5 stars for the excellent food and 5 stars for the excellent wait staff.  The atmosphere is amazing.  We really enjoy eating here.  One star for the host/hostess staff.  If you can get past how consistently rude the staff is when you call to make a reservation or walk in the door to request a table the rest of your night will be a 5 star.  I need of remind myself of this every time I call or go here before I change my mind.  Management may be on the 1 star list if Ashley truly is management.  I find it difficult to believe that someone so unprofessional truly is management like she claimed to be.
"An old school Italian Spot with Great Food and Atmosphere. My Family has been coming here for generations and will continue to do so because of the Amazing food, service and overall experience at Topo!The Menu is full of Great options, here are some of my highlights.Appetizers:Fried Calamari (One of the Best in the City)Mussels in the Red Sauce (Great for dipping bread in after you finish)Brushchetta (Lunch version comes with Proscuitto and Mozzarella Cheese, which is very tasty!)Soups & Salads:Joe's Salad (One of my favorite salads anywhere! Their Version of a Garbage salad)Tortellini Soup (Very simple, Very Good)Pastas:Rigatoni Filo de Fumo (Panchetta and melted Mozzarella Cheese makes this dish)Fusilli alla Topo Gigio ( Their Signature Pasta Dish w/ Chicken, You wont be disappointed!)Entrees:Veal Saltimbocca-Parmigiana (Great option instead of Chicken, full of flavor)White Fish Limone (Clean Tasting and good sized portion of fish)Chicken Breast Valdostana (Stuffed Chicken Breast with a Mushroom Sauce = Must Try)Desserts:Tiramisu is My favorite here and the presentation of it is very nice!A True Hidden Gem in the City!"
"Great place for lunch and I look forward to going back for dinner sometime.   Great ambiance and decor.  Food was great!   We shared the grilled calamari and I had the spinach salad with shrimp, green beans, red peppers and capers. Delicious!!!"
"Cuisine was stellar, service by our server Mr.   Cesar was remarkable, thee barkeep & the BOH was speedy 'n on point; let me tell you about the Tiramisu- it was, well..., if the restaurant was empty I would have licked the vessel it came in. The very pretty, burnet, snooty 'n rude hostess is the only reason I stopped at 4 stars. All because my twin and I requested a different table. Really sad. It's sad that the guests first and last impressions, which are so easily done well- was an EPIC fail.And to prove a point- as we were walking out she didn't say good night yet just stood in silence, SMH."
I really enjoyed my squid ink dye Linguine pasta and baked clams! Everything was delicious :-)
"The inside decor was great.  It seems there was construction going on so the entrance was kind of weird. The bar area is small, but nice and the bartenders are friendly.  The food was a little pricey, but it was also high quality.  My meal was excellent as was my guest's.  If you get a chance, try the smoked salmon for an appetizer.  You won't regret it."
"I came here with a friend on a Monday night.  There were open tables, but we were trying to keep things low-key so we sat up at the bar.  Honestly we had the most amazing service throughout our meal.  After reading other reviews that describe poor table service, I'm thinking bar is the way to go no matter what. We got a fantastic bottle of Sangiovese that was well priced. Warm bread and evoo, two sides of veggies, and the bowtie salmon pasta to share and we were full!  Of course house made tiramisu was impossible to turn down and we enjoyed some limoncello compliments of the bartender. I will absolutely be back for more tasty pastas and tiramisu, but I'm also really looking forward to some patio time here come summer."
"Our night ended with the owner calling my friend a RUDE FU*KING BI*CH - in front of the entire bar area. He then told her never to come back again. There is no exaggeration there. So what happened?Myself, my gf, her two roommates, her roommates parents and little brother went to Topo Saturday Feb. 8th for a birthday dinner. Being 7 of us on a Saturday night we knew it would be difficult to get a table. Her parents got there 40 minutes ahead of us, hoping to get a table.The only thing they had available for us was on the outside patio which was of course tarped off for the winter. It was freezing cold in the back. They had one little heater but it didn't do any good. The metal chairs were so cold it took us all a while just to get comfortable once we were seated. There was water that kept dripping on everyone every so often. You never knew who was going to be the next person to get wet. Our server came and took our drink order, only one of us ordered wine. The others just didn't feel like drinking. Right away that must have been our first mistake. We didn't see our waiter for a long time after that.We finally were able to order appetizers (calamari and portabello mushrooms) and they were good. However, the air temperature was so cold the food got cold in a matter of minutes.My gf got another coke and there was lipstick on the glass. We asked for another one and got it with little problem. The food came out and it's good food. There's nothing wrong with that. By the end of the meal my gf's roommate asked to speak to the manager because there were just a lot of little things that had gone wrong He came to the table and was combative with every thing she pointed out. He was rude and pompous and honestly I've never seen a manager act like that. He left our table without apologizing or anything.My gf's roommate couldn't believe how that had went. After a few minutes she went to the hostess and asked to speak to the general manager or get his information. The hostess explained that the guy she just spoke to was one of the owners. While she was up there the owner came back and they began talking in the bar area just a few feet from our table. She let him know that she felt that she hadn't been treated properly and he was very argumentative while she was simply pointing out why the meal had been so poor.He again got all defensive and said she would be the only person who would complain all night and that she was high maintenance and a RUDE FU*KING BI*CH. He didn't just say it, he yelled it for the surrounding tables and the people in the bar to hear. Watching everyone's mouths drop after hearing that was crazy to see.She walked back to our table and just sat there. The table next to us said that what happened was typical. They kept going back there for the food but the service was the worst. After a few minutes the owner came back through the credit card on the table and said ""I comped your whole meal and NEVER COME BACK.""My friend was humiliated and rightfully so. No one in the service industry should EVER use those words with a customer. To think that he had to tell her never to come back is kind of a joke. Of course she isn't going to come back and neither are any of us. From reading some other 1-star reviews it seems like the owner has used this language in the past. Not only will we never go back but I will make sure I tell everyone to go to one of the hundreds of other Italian restaurants in the city. To the editors of Yelp - it's places like these that make the site need to have a 0-star rating."
FANOMINAL!!! Authentic looking Italian place with absolutely great and tasteful food. I would recommend this as a must do when in Chicago.
"I have never been more shocked and disgusted at a restaurant's service in my entire life.If you want to know what happened, see my fellow diner's review: yelp.com/biz/topo-gigio-…But all you really need to know, is the owner told my table to ""never come back"" and that my best friend (whose father was celebrating his birthday dinner) that she was a ""high maintenance f**king b*tch"" after she informed him the food was cold.Stay classy Topo's we will never be back."
"A stellar restaurant with high quality food.  I think everything I had was remarkably delicious, and my fellow diners said this of their food as well.  We went there early-ish on a Thursday evening, but it was still quite bustling.  I'm glad we made a reservation.  We got the calamari and the portabello e polenta to split as appetizers between the three of us, and it was absolutely delicious.  Even my co-worker who didn't like mushrooms liked the portabello dish.  The calamari was perfectly cooked: not too greasy or overdone/chewy, but very light and crisp and tender.  The bread that came to the table was warm and crisp and perfect.For the main entree, I got the linguine with clams, and it was probably the best linguine with clams dish I've ever had.  Rather than being drenched in butter and oil, it was perfectly light, fresh, and tasted like the ocean.  Delicious!  The pasta itself appeared to be totally homemade, which you can tell from the occasionally uneven shape.  Nothing better than fresh pasta!I'm always looking for a non-mediocre italian place, and I think I finally found it!"
"A big round of 'meh' is in order for Topo Gigio - A cozy restaurant that is obviously well established within the neighborhood. That being said, I'm afraid our server had 'neighborhood expectations' that we simply didn't live up to. We didn't plan on spending 100s of dollars on dinner or ordering many glasses of wine, but rather a simple meal that would keep us happy on a cold Chicago night. Service fell flat on its face.Once our server was aware that we didn't have intentions of spending a lot on our meal, he was simply a ghost. Never once stopped to check in on us, or offer us anything else. A quick ""dessert?"" followed by the thud of the bill on table. The biggest disappointment of all being the obvious sigh from the server after he retrieved our signed receipt BEFORE we left the restaurant. CRAP service, Topo Gigio. It's great you have a following, because with the amount of quality Italian restaurants in the city I only hope people will steer clear of your terrible establishment. Service is what makes a great meal even better and you are so poorly lacking."
"Awesome pasta, wine list and appetizers. Nothing seemed overpriced and for what we ordered it seemed like it should have cost more. Will be visiting again."
"I dont know if this is gourmet italian food but whatever it is its excellent! Not over priced considering the location, good portions for the entry, and great service! What else can u ask for? Of course good ambience. I love the out door area very nice and cozy."
I ordered the Farfalle Salmoni and it was fantastic! I am normally not a fan of creamy pasta sauce but this dish is the perfect blend of cream and tomato. I also really liked the Conchiglie Mediterranean that my friend ordered. The scallops and shrimps were huge and the sauce was to die for.
"This is my favorite restaurant. My FAVORITE restaurant. Like, last meal on earth (if I don't happen to be in Italy when I'm dying) restaurant. However, on my last visit I witnessed a really unfortunate case of terrible customer service skills (the worst I've ever seen), so where a first timer might give this place one or two stars I dock it only one because I cannot help but go back. I'm going to run through that scenario so we can just move past it:Someone didn't want to pay for their food, waiter told manager, manager came over and yelled in man's face, threatened to call the police, entire restaurant disturbed by the scene, many expletives follow by man and manager, my dinner guests and I become frightened, man eventually pays for food and everyone continues to eat in nervous silence.Besides that added ambiance....My favorite meal is here: a glass of potent Pinot Grigio, a plate of ANY of the pastas here (yes, I can eat the whole thing when it is normal to only be able to finish half) followed by a cappuccino. I am convinced you cannot find anything better than Topo Gigio within or under this price point. Pasta Palazzo has great pastas BUT no cappuccino and feeling super fancy in the middle of my Saturday. I honestly come here to treat myself and enjoy pasta that's always served fast and piping hot. I can't even get it that hot when I make it in my own kitchen. HOW DO THEY DO THAT?!Now, even though I am in love with the food here and think the wait staff is amazing (albeit with a bit of a terrifying manager), I feel like I can't bring friends or family here because what if, heaven forbid, they don't like something and want to send it back and don't want to pay for it? I don't even want to think about it. But I'll continue to go here alone because I would NEVER send a dish back here. No way, no how.There you have it, Yelp, one very stubborn review."
"I could honestly eat at Topo every day. I have never had a bad meal and am addicted to the conchiglie alla sarda and the linguine cinque terre. Both are spectacular. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu and the service is fantastic! This place makes me feel at home, it is authentic and old school Italian. What a gem!"
"While there are many, MANY fabulous restaurants in our fair city, this one is most undoubtedly a contender for having the best damn food in all of Chicago.  ""Not possible!"" you gasp?  Well believe it, people.  Topo Gigio does EVERYTHING well... and I mean EVERYTHING!  And it doesn't break the bank... which definitely plays into its favor in my heart. ;]Their bread -- Mmmmm... warm and light and fluffy... with olive oil and freshly grated parmesan that would tempt even the toughest of wills to spoil their dinner by filling up on bread alone.  But then comes the TORTELLINI in BRODO - a light broth filled with small, perfect, homemade tortellinis with just the right amount of salt and seasoning to leave you slurping every last drop... and then wiping up the rest with bread from that second basket you asked for.  Entrees?  Go with the TORTELLINI alla PANNA - tortellini in a cream sauce with mushrooms, pancetta, sweet peas, and parmigiano reggiano.  It looks pretty, tastes amazing, is super heavy/rich/creamy so will leave you absolutely full, and combined with the soup will run you about $20 before tax and tip and can TOTALLY be split by two people and leave you full to the brim.  (I mean, you know... if we're not forgetting the bread...)So, for my good-food-loving though penny pinched spouse and me, this takes the cake in Chicago for a luxury meal that's still affordable.  We can get dressed up and head to old town and feel like we're really having a night on the town, but for a price that doesn't leave going here a treat reserved for special occasions only.Parking sucks, but it's Old Town Chicago so you should probably have taken the train here anyway.  Service is great.  The place is quaint and adorable.  Outdoor patio has heaters.So to all of my insanely rich, money-is-no-object-to-me readers out there, just move on and enjoy your $$$$ meals that you believe blow this place out of the water.  But for the rest of us, oh for the rest of us, thank God for Topo Gigio and all of its affordable bliss. :]"
"The dining room decor, the food, the lighting, the cocktails were very good but the incredible noise of this crowded place ruined our meal.  Even screaming into each others faces didn't work.  We just had to get the hell out.Advice - eat outdoors!!  The dining room is impossible."
"With over 300 reviews, I'll keep mine short.  Great ambiance, but a little loud during the weekend.  The wines we ordered were great and they practically filled the entire wine glass...hooray!  The restaurant has a dish on the menu that's vegan and they're also willing to make other items vegan -- as confirmed when my bf called the restaurant.  My pasta dish was made with red sauce and filled with many veggies, it was surprisingly very good.  My bf had a seafood pasta dish and loved it too.  We'll be back."
"I really want to rate this restaurant higher the problem is our experience here over the last two years has been inconsistent and seems to be getting worse over time.  When we first started going we enjoyed excellent Italian food and what I would call old world charming service.  Bringing my baby to dinner with me was never a problem and the waiters went out of their way to allow us a comfortable fun experience.Something seem to have happened over the last 6 months, in particular, where we have gotten varying food quality and inconsistent service.  Whereas, I used to feel like anything form the menu will be great, now I'm much more cautious. Service seems to vary wildly depending on your waiter.  There is one or more who act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to dine there and gone are the days when I can feel comfortable about bringing my young son.  Better front of the house management will go a long way to bringing back the old world charm."
"As an Italian American it's hard to find places that are true to my Nana's home cooking. Most places I've visited in Chicago are your stereotypical mom and pop ""red sauce"" joints that cater to the American taste buds, usually adding copious amounts of processed tomato sauce or cream sauce to the dishes which leave you feeling queasy and in need of a bathroom as soon as you arrive home. Topo Gigio is not one of those places.I took my dad (fresh of the boat from Boston) to Topo Gigio, because he refused to eat anything but Italian food. He wanted to see how it compared to Rome and the Little Italy we have back in Boston.  After searching long and hard for a restaurant on the North side that didn't look like your typical red sauce joint, I decided on Topio.My dad and I ordered a pasta to start. I could tell after the first bite that the sauce was homemade. The pasta was al dente (the way it should be)  and was not drenched in heavy, over sugared tomato sauce. It was light and full of flavor. In addition to the pasta being quite tasty, it was very large in portion. My dad and I split it and we were perfectly full afterwards.For the main course ( I was already so full!), my dad ordered the filetto di manzo and was very happy with his choice.  I ordered the saltimbocca alla romana, which is a popular veal dish found in Italy and Southern Switzerland. I've tried it many times in Rome, and Topo Gigio was comparable. Overall, My dad and I were quite happy with our experience. In the future, if another family member decides to drop in on me and insist on Italian food, I know where to go."
"Fantastic food, very nice atmosphere. I'm very particular when it comes to Italian food and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste of the pasta. I loved the spicy tomatoes and chunks of garlic in my pasta, wasn't over done or gummy. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!! Better than Taylor Street!"
If I could give zero stars I would!! Awful service by Alex and Tom the manager is even worse!!! My fiancé had an overcooked steak and the server argued with him about it. The manager argued too!!! We are in the business and live around the corner and they were terrible to us. We will never go back. Very condescending staff. Don't waste your money there are many places in old town to eat.... First time we ever stiffed a server and left hungry
"Topo Gigio has consistently great food. I have eaten here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. They always bring you a basket of fresh bread that you can dip in olive oil and fresh parmesan--simple and delicious. My favorite entrees are the conchiglie alla sarda and the tortellini alla panna. The conchiglie alla sarda comes in a flavorful tomato-cream sauce with ground sausage, peas, and pecorino cheese. Although I'd like to try other dishes on the menu, this is so good that I often can't resist ordering it again!When I went last night, my boyfriend ordered their special, which was black linguine with shrimp, scallops, smoked salmon, and a cream sauce. I tried a taste of it, and it was excellent. I also appreciated that, when I asked if they had caesar salad, the waiter said that although it isn't on the menu, he would put a salad together for me. Not only did he put together a caesar salad, but it was really good too! The main dining area is nice, and they also have a nice patio where you can sit when it's warm out."
"It's simple - professional service, very good food, large portions, authentic, it just all works. Definitely one of the best restaurants on north wells street, and you should try it out!"
"We ended up at Topo Gigio since we were going to Zanies down the street. We picked this place by default since it was one of the few restaurants in the area with an overall 4-star review. We got there early, around 5:30-ish but it was already starting to get packed. We braced ourselves for a long wait since we didn't have a reservation but we got right in. Happy face!We loved pretty much everything we tried, although the eggplant parmigiana was only okay for me and not the best I've ever tried. The mussel appetizer was the star of the show and I highly recommend for any seafood lover out there.Our waiter was very attentive despite him serving a bunch of tables. Like everything in Chicago though, the tables are pushed too close together and I found my chair continuously being bumped. When we tried to get up to leave, it became a game of sorts to find a table with a big enough gap to fit through. Having to go through the bar area to leave was even worse than the over-crowded dining room because people refused to move. Eventually I stopped being polite Courtney saying excuse me to everyone I encountered and just pushed my way through.If you come here for dinner, I'd recommend getting there as early as possible to beat the rush."
"I was really excited to go here. The reviews were really good and it seemed authentic. I am always up to try new italian places.The food was italian american. Not horrible, but by no means authentic or high quality ingredients. My real problem with the restaurant comes from the price. With an average of $16 per pasta dish I expect something that taste better then olive garden. Atleast u get the free bread sticks there. This place is basicly Olive Garden at 3x the price.Overall, food 2.5, price 2, service 4, cleanliness 3.5Hope this helps"
"Awkward entrance, perfectly-prepared pastas, wonderful apps, warm service.Five stars. Period."
"Topo Gigio? Isn't that the mouse from The Tonight Show back in the Johnny Carson days? I believe the character was written and voiced by Joan Rivers. A little history that I came to realize when the name struck me as familiar and I googled when I got home. However a cartoon mouse from the 70's/80's has little to do with this restaurant other than sharing a name. As a Yelp team dinner before hitting up Second City landed us here I was immediately impressed with the high ceilings, exposed brick, classic italian table tops and scores of signed celebrity head shots which adorned every single wall.Our group broke bread and shared wine before going to absolute town on a shared caprese salad appetizer. I really loved this, the tomatoes were perfect the dish reminded me of Sunday lunch at my parents place!Most of my team benefited from the huge portions for my pasta and the Osso Bucco portion looked like a small calf on a plate. I was immediately jealous and annoyed that I chose tonight of all nights to be ""healthy"". That decision had me dining on the fish special which on this night in particular was a pan seared seared cooked in a butter sauce with mashed potatoes and asparagus. A+!!! I loved it but still looked longingly at my pasta faring dining companions. Marking Topo as a do over when I return to the windy city - I want that Osso Bucco...badly!Eatcrest OUT!"
"Tim Allen (Santa) gave em a shout out in an old school Christmas flick youtube.com/watch?v=kLOU… so they must be good, right? Ok...so he didn't exactly say Topo Gigio, but it's definitely a good spot for some Italian. Besides the fantastically fresh caprese and extremely tender osso bucco my favorite part of the place was how authentic everything was. From the decor to the gigantic portions to the thick-accented severs I felt like I was in Italy. Not that I've ever been to be able to compare, but I've seen enough Sopranos to get a good feel. Once the weather gets warmer I'd definitely hit it up for a date on their awesome patio or just to enjoy a tasty meal under some heat lamps."
"I give it 4 stars because of service. Our server was kind of rude and was not attentive. He came up and quickly walked away when we said we're good on drinks (ordered them at the bar). Food was really good and delicious. The place has a big variety of pasta dishes and my dish Spiedini Adriatica was fresh and absolutely delicious with each bite. Generous portions. Very loud in the dining room, in a group of 6 it was a bit tough having a conversation as we felt like we were yelling. Also, keep in mind if going as a group...they do not do separate checks."
"Bellisima! A beautiful meal in a cozy, cozy spot. Yes, indeed, I'm a fan of Topo Gigio. Some of the Yelp family popped into Topo Gigio for some good old fashioned Italian eats before we jetted over to Second City. Inside, this place is just precious. Warm and intimate but still open enough to accommodate a fairly sizeable number of seats. I was especially fond of the (currently winter enclosed) brick paver patio - a perfect spot to grab a cocktail before stuffing yourself full. Service was certainly on point and paired perfectly with the tasty eats that I indulged in. Favorites included the melt-in-your-mouth buffalo mozzarella that accompanied a lovely caprese. Seriously, that cheese was too legit to quit. I was a bit surprised that it didn't come with any balsamic though...? As for my meal, I ordered the campanelle alla norma - a delicious pasta dish complete with strips of sauteed eggplant, arriabiata sauce and tops with bits of aged ricotta. It was plentiful, a touch spicy and filling. And I certainly enjoyed it the next day as well. While Topo Gigio isn't anything overly fancy or off the wall, it's a lovely place for a romantic date where you can score some super solid Italian eats."
"Oh Topo.. how you always steal my heart! The food is always delicious and satisfies every need that I have. Although, it can get costly and the service can be very slow, it's well worth it. It's just down the street from me, so its a local favorite. For anyone who is asking, they will do carry out!"
"One of my favorite restaurants in the city and one of the best patios. Great food and great people watching. Come here alone, come with friends, come with a date, come with your parents. All will feel at home and enjoy great Italian."
"An excellent Italian restaurant in the heart of old town. They have a great selection with a very diverse Italian menu. Outdoor seating during the summer time is nice, but the indoor portion is great as well. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for great Italian in Chicago at a great price!"
"I came here on a weeknight when I was craving some well made pasta.  I was immediately sat at the pretty full bar. The crowd her eon a weknight is definitely 40+. A lot older than what I'm used to but still a  great atmosphere nonetheless.Linguini with clams - exactly what I was hoping for. Nice and simple with fresh ingredients and a touch of cilantro for freshness.  This is considered my comfort food so I was happy that they made it perfectly.Tiramisu - I normally don't get dessert but the friendly bartender convinced me otherwise.  I'm glad he did!  This was easily one of the best that I had.  Creamy, decadent, and perfectly sized to share."
"I really love Topo Gigio.  From it's spot on N. Wells, to the ambiance, to the servers, to the wine,  to the food-I love it all.  It can get pretty busy in the evenings but if you don't have a reservation you might be able to snag a seat at the bar.  Bartendars and patrons are friendly and don't mind giving advice on what to order, so that's a plus!  I ordered the Conchiglie alla Sarda which is a Seashell Pasta in a Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese and I added mushrooms.  It was absolutely delicious!  All the portions are huge so you could definitely share, but leftovers of these delicious dishes are not a bad thing.  As a tiramisu aficionado I can also vouch for their delicious tiramisu, so make sure to leave room for that!"
"I had lunch on the patio while on vacation in July. I had been shopping and just stopped in and am I glad I did! The staff were very friendly and I had one of the specials that day, chicken marsala with cooked spinach and it was divine! Neither were over cooked or heavy and paired well with a glass of white wine. I will definitely come back when I am in the area again!"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said.  I've been here maybe three times and each time I loved my meal. I went on Saturday night, I had the minestrone soup, which was very good. I ordered the white fish with capers, which was really good. My friends got the pasta which they loved. One friend got tiramisu and he said it was good. The last time I was there I got the chicken breast which is also good.The service is always A+ can't say enough how great the staff is here. Good drinks not watered down.It's a little loud in the restaurant but not that bad. In the summer eating in the beer garden or outside patio is great. Great place to go before a show or before hitting benchmark, which what we did. Only complaint was that we waited about 10 minutes after reservations but the table was cleaned seconds after the people left and they were very nice to us. I will definitely be back here, forgot how good this place was!"
Tried Topo Gigio for the first time on a Monday night. Loved the warm atmosphere and candlelight on the table but yet found it very interesting you have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant in the back of the building. The hostess was very friendly and sat us right away. Waiter/Food: Our waiter was very friendly and let us take our time ordering wine and dinner. I had the Petti di Pollo alla Fiorentinal. Delicious chicken breast with cheese and spinach and a side of asparagus...I couldn't even finish my plate!Downfall: very loud in the restaurant and a little challenging to have a normal conversation across the table without having to repeat the conversation.Would love to go back again on a weekend of in the summer.
"So many restaurants on Wells St, but this is one to bookmark for future visits. The food is amazing with huge portions! Started off with the tortellini soup, whose broth I would've slurped from  the bowl if it were social acceptable. The osso bucco veal shank meat fell off the bone, and its accompanying risotto was cooked perfectly and complimented the veal. Don't forget to scoop out the bone marrow with the mini-fork also. The farfalle with smoked salmon was delicious as well. They've got outdoor seating in the front and back so it's a great restaurant to go to all year round."
"Topo Gigio is my favorite traditional, neighborhood Italian restaurant in Chicago!  With an extensive menu, there is something for everyone at reasonable prices for Old Town.  Don't expect wildly gourmet dishes; Topo Gigio does the basics best.The service is always helpful.  The restaurant is a bit crowded; it'd be great to have a bit more space between tables.  The atmosphere can get fairly loud but in a comfortable, cozy rather than a trendy scene way."
"Great food but the service is horrible. Some of the waiters even have B.O., GROSS! If you're planning a private party here, dealing with Teres is a nightmare, she's rude and acts as if you're putting her out every step of the way even if you just ask simple question. Bottom line good for a cheap Italian meal in old town, but go elsewhere for parties and private room."
"I know what you are thinking Jessica.......... Another Italian place. Shut up! I went here for the rat. You know the character from the cartoon Topo Gigio.No, there are no little topo gigios running around, this place is pristine. I took my wing man here for his birthday and he took me here for my birthday. He is not that creative. I am kidding, I really love this place and every time I go service is on key and that is why he took me. The servers are very knowledgable about wine selection and food. I always get a bottle of red and either a pasta or chicken. However, I must do this place poetic justice and tell you item by item of what I reccomend, because lezzbiahonest I reccomend that shhhiii you crave..Let first start with Carb Option #1: bread basket- How can you go to an Italian joint and not eat some damn bread? (I know you have the bread basket when you go too these places dont lie! phuck yo diet!) The bread is, of course .. bread but the oil and cheese make the experience go hand in hand..Now you got to get some wine:- Ask your server.. I personally like red..cab or pinot noir would be ideal I guess it all depends on what you are eating all I know is when I go out I needz me some alcoholCarb Option #2:- Bruschetta : for the basic bitches..but I am not basic..so moving forward-Carpaccio: not so carb more so protein and fats but what the hell.. raw meat, lemons, cheese, and capers sounds really weird TRUST ..it is amazeballsCarb Option #3:- If you want pasta they have plenty, but I got the rigatoni with vegtables in a oil sauce let me just say .......( I am giving you that blank stare because you already know it was amazing) .. yeah plain.. but still not a basic bitchIf you do not want past you can have chicken and or steak. Boo got steak we did not even have a conversation during dinner because the food was just that good.. I had the chicken with lemon garlic sauce also very yumnomzDessert: I do not like sweets but if Tiramisu is on the list, I better be getting it. One spoon and I was imagining myself doing myraids of cart wheels around Topo Gigio ..yeah okay .. yeah"
"We called on Thursday to make a reservation for Saturday and they were already booked until 8:30 PM, so keep that in mind if you are wanting a reservation. Plan ahead. It worked perfectly for us because were heading to a 11PM show over at Second City.Our decision to come to Topo Gigio was based entirely on the fact that it has so many highly rated Yelp reviews, and thankfully it did not disappoint. If you are looking for fresh, truly fresh pasta that's packed with flavor, this is where you want to be. I had the Tortellini alla Panna and it was pretty much one of my most favorite pasta dishes that I have ever had. Ever. The cream sauce wasn't too heavy, and I adored the trio of pancetta, fresh mushrooms, and peas. Hubby had the Conchiglie alla Sarda which I sampled and thought it was equally delicious as what I ordered.Everything is priced really reasonable, and the pasta portions are huge!"
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday evening around 7:30 to have a quiet dinner together. When we showed up 40 minutes late for our reservation (of course, that was my fault), we had to wait another 35 for a table for two. We scooted into the bar area and sat down at the last available seats against the wall and were promptly greeted by the bartender. I ordered our drinks: gin and tonic and a vodka water with a *splash* of cranberry. I'm usually and pretty consistently disappointed in my ""vodka waters with only a splash of cran,"" but this bartender nailed it and knew exactly what I was asking for. Diluted vodka that's only a little bit pink. THANK YOU for getting it right! We ended up heading out before our table was ready to go to a quieter and slightly more intimate location. Having dined here previously though, I know that one day, we will be back! In reference to my previous visit: GET THE CALAMARI. Best calamari I've ever tasted. Waiters are fun and friendly, although that could also have been because we were a table full of women (of all ages, thank you very much) that were full of goofy questions. Oh yeah, and lots of wine."
"Went for dinner last night, the tortellini is ridiculously good and the service was great. Despite being busy, the waiter was still attentive and the food was amazing. Will definitely be back on my next trip to chicago!"
"Where to begin? After waiting 40 minutes for a table, we were seated in the patio covered by a tent with a very small heater while sitting in metal chairs. This is Chicago in freezing temperatures...who thought this was a good idea? Because of the extreme temperatures, our food was cold in a matter of minutes. My glass came out with a lipstick mark and my friend did not get a glass of water for 30 minutes. My friend asked to speak with the manager and the OWNER came out. We were all expecting an apology at the very least, but instead he proceeded to call her a high maintenance, rude f*cking b*tch. Is this guy a joke?I have never had a worse dining experience. There are plenty of other high quality Italian restaurants in this city where they don't scream insults at their paying customers. He told us to not come back, which was completely unnecessary because I wouldn't go back if someone paid me."
"We had dinner here with our friends on the eve of our wedding day. Everyone LOVED their food, the environment was really nice and the portions are BIG. The wine flowed and the waiter was even very accommodating to our multiple credit cards. The tortellini was very possibly the best I have ever had in my life."
"Fantastic food and service.  The waiter Peter P. was extremely knowledgeable as was the other staff.  The staff was also very helpful with our huge stroller and 1 year old.  Outside of the service, and more importantly, the food was very good.  We ordered the linguine with spicy marinara and soft shell crab.  My wife had the linguine with shrimp and pesto and both dishes were very fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend it and would definitely go back."
"Great, tasty food, but if you're vegan, this is not the place.  My fiancé and I went here after calling the restaurant to make sure we would be able to order dishes that were vegan. The person we spoke with assured us it would not be a problem. When we got to the restaurant, though, our waiter was very friendly but he told us that everything, including the pasta, had butter, cheese, or egg.  He offered to have the chef make the veggie pasta dish with spinach instead of pasta, so we ordered that and got a salad with no dressing (dressing was not vegan either).  The veggie dish was tasty but not as satisfying because we mostly just ate sautéed veggies. We appreciated the honesty of our server, though.  It is a nice place, but based on our diets, we probably won't return."
"Staff was attentive and very nice. We had a bottle of wine, the Prosciutto for an appetizer, the chicken and the rib eye steak for dinner. Pricey meal but definitely worth it. The restaurant was packed so it felt you were always on top of someone but the atmosphere was great. Worth going for a great meal."
"Overrated   Seafood chowder was soup of the day in a red base  sounded good and tried it   Came out cold and sent back  - when it came back ot was hot.   But, it had little taste - salt, pepper and olive oil did not help and most left over   Veal piccata was way to lemony, veal not dredged and left half over .   Friend ordered the special lamb chops - ate 2 of 4 and left rest over - not good.  Sister in law had fish and enjoyed   Pumpkin raviolli was fair  all in all a very disapoonting meal -- food not good and for the price we wpuld not return or recomend   Service was, however, good -- too bad they didnt serve better food.   For what we paid we definately deserved better food"
"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. Whenever I have friends or family in town visiting, I try to bring them here. I've never had anything other than amazing in terms of food, and all my guests have been equally satisfied. The conchiglie alla sarda is my favorite dish."
"Authentic.  I'm no expert on Italian but this came across as very authentic, very tasty, Italian food.  I got the shrimp conchiglie dish which was really good, the shrimp wasn't over cooked and the pasta wasn't too soft.I remember their drinks being pretty strong too."
Delicious food!  Amazing service!  This Texas gal feels like she's in Italy all over again!
This is a very typical restaurant for an entertainment district. The service was better than reviews suggested and the food was not as good as reviews suggested.
Food and service were decent.  Nothing to go write home about.Place could get better reviews with better service.
Unfortunately I never got to try this place out because the owner was an extremely rude host!! After asking how long the wait would be (I had a reservation for two) he told me he would be back to let me know and when he came back and didn't answer me I asked again. After that he blew up at me and pretty much told me to leave.I heard great things about this food but after the most pitiful and rude customer service I will never go here. There are plenty of great restaurants in Chicago with great food but nothing makes food better than great customer service and this place falls far far from those standards!!Very disappointed and sorry for the rest of the staff that has to work with that low life!
"Food:  This was some of the best tasting Italian I've had in a while.  I don't know if I have just had a lot of blah Italian or if it really is as good as I think.  Let's go with it IS as good as I think.  I had the shells with peas, sausage and something.  Great memory here.  I ordered a side of alfredo sauce to add to the marinara it had.  Yes, I like clogged arteries and high blood pressure.  It was mouthgasmic!  It was a big serving.  I had it for lunch the next day too.  *(It's better fresh.)Service- Our server was a very nice guy.  It was difficult ordering the side of alfredo for some reason.  The conversation went something like...JG-I want a side of alfredo with that. Server (S)- We make our sauces to order. JG-Ok...I want that with my order.  S-No, we make them fresh.  JG- I get that.  I want you to make it to order for me and put it on the side.  S-(Looking confused) It has marinara.  There will be a charge for that.  JG- I know. Of course there will be.  I don't care.  I WANT a side of alfredo made with my order!!!! Can you not do that? *(Ok, so I take responsibility for the miscommunication, but just give me what I want.  I will pay for it. I don't expect anything to be free.)We did the outdoor seating option.  It was gorgeous out, and I like to people watch.  Parking- Metered Street Parking.  Pain in the butt.  They have a valet lot that was like $12.  GF Friends- My GF date had a big salad and some salad that tasted a bit like licorice.  What is that called?  LOL!  Fail...I don't know.   It was good though."
"Great food, decent service. The pasta here is top notch and definitely one of my favorites in the city. The conchiglie alla sarda is amazing and I get it every time I come here. We've never had great service here, but the pasta is so good that we still come here occasionally when we're craving a good pasta dish."
"My wife and I decided to head over to Old Town and walk around on a friday night.  We called Topo at 3pm and there were only 2 reservations open that night, 5 and 9.  Most definitely call for reservations because I doubt you will get in without them.  Very clean set up, white linen table cloth on the tables and attentive staff.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly, gave us our space but was very informative.  Not only did he wait on us, but another waiter stopped by and asked how it was going and if we needed anything.  Our glasses were always full which is how I typically determine how much tip I give.My wife ordered the gnocchi with mushrooms and peas.  If I remember correctly, the gnocchi is not on the menu but if you ask, they will make it for you.  She loves gnocchi and mentioned that it was the best she has had in the city.I would recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely be going back."
"Topo Gigio is my favorite restaurant in Chicago!  We moved out of Chicago over 20 years ago and visit ~2X/year.  Topo Gigio is a spot we ALWAYS go to.  The food is delicious; I especially love the Fusilli Alla Topo Gigio.  My daughter loves the Tortellini In Brodo and my son loves the Tortellini Alla Panna.  The wait staff and hosts are gracious and I have never had a bad meal there.  On many occasion I have had a change in my reservation (usually adding more people) and the owners, Tom and Frank have always been able to accommodate my requests with a smile.  I recommended several (over 50) colleagues go to Topo Gigio from out of town and I have never heard anything but praise and positivity about Topo!  Topo Gigio is a truly fine Chicago Restaurant!  Love it!"
"Favorite in the city. Food, wine list and drinks are great. Service is especially great -- the restaurant is obviously run by and staffed with people who care."
"A surprisingly tiny, mediocre Italian restaurant.I came here on a first date and we arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday, a few hours before the crowd really flooded in.I ordered the petti di pollo marinato alla griglia (Grilled chicken breast marinated in herbs & spices.)  It was... alright.  Underwhelming, I suppose.  For a chicken breast, it was not particularly tender or juicy.Glasses of wine run about $10 each.The bread at the table was not hot or soft.  I hate it when an Italian joint drops the ball on that.Service was quite good.  But at 8:30, as we were preparing to leave, the hostess came over to kick us out.  Yeah, we get it, lady.  We were leaving.  Chill for a second.Topo Gigio isn't all that romantic.  Too loud, too bright and too crowded.  And unless your date has a thing for mouse dolls (Topo, himself), the decor won't score you any points.I keep visiting Italian restaurants in Chicago and nothing surpasses Italian Village.  I doubt I'll ever return to Topo Gigio."
"Great little italian restaurant in Old Town. I ordered the halibut with asparagus and spinach, absolutely delicious! They told me it was a special, I guess I was a bit surprised when the bill came and realized it was $25 (most entrees on the menu are less than $20). There's a very cool outdoor patio, perfect for a small groups. Unfortunately it was scorching hot so we decided to give the inside a try an reap the benefits of the AC. This is a great spot because there's a few cool bars in the area you can hit right after dinner."
I've been here a few times with family and have never had a bad meal. Pasta is delicious. Saw Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan from Forrest Gump) there with his family too! So cool!
"I would have given this place a better rating if their service and food were consistent, but this place is as authentic as you can get for Italisn food. The restaurant was decorated in traditional Italian flavor like wine bottles and old black and white photos. We were greated by a friendly, older Italian gentleman.I would definitely say that they know how to make mean soup here. Their signature tortellini soup is delicious. When I went, they also had some kind of tomato seafood soup which was out of this world. So good. I was very happy with the food so far. Then came out our appetizer.We ordered portobello e polenta. We found a hair in it. Gross. When we told the waiter, all he did was give a noise and take it to the back. He didn't even apologize or anything. His service just kept getting worse and worse towards the end of the meal. We also ordered two pasta dishes to share among five girls, Rigatoni al Filo di Fumo and the Conchiglie alla Sarda. The conchiglie was perfect and the best of the two. The rigatoni was undercooked and it made the pasta hard to finish. We had plenty left over. The food could be great. I have seen what their best is, but the restaurant isn't consistent, plus the service could be better, a lot better."
"I am never disappointed when I dine at Topo Gigio. I usually get the same thing everyone, in which is the Joes Salad.  This is the best salad I've had in this city, wonderful variety of cheese and veggies. I have tried several pasta dishes as well and I just love everything I've ever had. Not only is the food amazing, the staff is great as well and are very personable. I highly recommend checking this place out!"
"I've been here a number of times, and it's always bustling and lively!  The food is delicious, and the service is surprisingly quick for how packed it always is (almost too quick).  Last time we went, we were able to grab a seat at the outside bar while we waited for a table, and you can order food there if you don't want to wait, which is good to know.  There's a really nice bartender out there."
"Topo Gigio is amazing! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, and I feel that the pricing is very reasonable for great Italian food.I've been many, many times and usually order the same dish: Fusili a la Topo Gigio. There's no description on the menu, but it's corkscrew pasta in a tomato cream sauce with chicken, pancetta, and mozzarella. TO. DIE. FOR. With that said, I always share and/or try the entrees of my dining party and honestly haven't had anything I didn't like. You really can't go wrong! They also have a great wine list.Recommendations: Calamari Fritti, Fusili a la Topo Gigio, Tortellini Alla Panna, Conchiglie Alla Sarda, Pistachio GelatoTips: make a dinner reservation because it's always busy, and you have to call (they don't use Open Table). They sometimes have wine specials for $30-40 a bottle, be sure to ask."
"Came here after a comedy show around the area.  Cool outside patio and bar.Wednesday 9:00PMWait time: NoneSetting: Nice outdoor area, pretty simple interior, saw a healthy mix of dates (old guy with hot girl) and groups.Service:  Waiter could have been better.  Asked to fix the wobbly table, no love in the club.  wtf?Food: Dont remember the names of any of the pasta.  But the tortelline was delicious, the garghanelli was amazing, and the sea shell thing was equally amazing.  Would come back for drinks outside, and a nice pasta.  -2 for waiter."
"Good italian comfort food, and lots of it.The indoor seating area as very loud, especially thanks to a group of girls that behaved as if they were the only ones in the place -- the outdoor seating would have been more comfortable."
"Another typical Italian experience: pushy condescending waiter; overpriced ala carte menu; specials without prices; too many tables in too small a space. My share of the check for six people (my wife and I got two drinks each, a piece of chicken breast for me and some over-cooked bland unaccompanied eggplant for my wife -- yes, the two cheapest items on the menu) came to $100 with tip. Im done with white-table cloth Italian restaurants for good and forever. They're fired!"
I love Topo and have been going there for years at least a couple of times a month.  There food and service is always amazing and delightful.  I love their friendly staff and they always take the time to get to you know you.  I feel at home there and wishing many many more enjoyable lunches and dinners there.
"I love this place! It is my favorite Italian restaurant without question. The food and service are both exceptional. They have a good little bar area and a patio. The Conchiglie alla Sarda is my favorite thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with anything. Good wine on the menu too!"
"Unbelievable meal.  It was amazing.  I'm dreaming of ordering some of the other available options.  Can't wait to go back.Love the family feel.  Great Time!Really reasonably priced.  I know people that are angry are often the only ones who take the time to review but we had a great time, great food, and not too much out of the wallet.Thanks"
"Just arrived in Chicago for a few nights -- tired but wanted to eat out near the hotel.In London there used to be a great/horrid restaurant called Topo Gigio in soho which was sort of mine and my fiancees spot.  Looking for somewhere in Chicago near our hotel came up with TG Chicago with pretty good reviews on yelp.Had a great meal -- the place was very similar to it's London non-counterpart, although much less of a dump.  I loved my spaghetti and meatballs -- the sauce was a very light bolognase with 3 big meatballs.Service was great"
"Really good Italian food. Delectable pasta dishes (almost too many choices!!), and a good wine selection. Do it for a good dinner or a romantic date."
"Consistently really good food.  Love the atmosphere,  place is beautiful and urban.  Always a great pick for lunch.  Parking on street or valet.  Great bartender"
"My boyfriend and I tried Topo Gigio Ristorante last weekend for the first time. We went on a busy Saturday night, but did make a reservation in advanced and were seated shortly. The women working at the hostess stand were very nice and helpful. I understand it was a busy night, but the waiter service was ehh. I could tell that he was busy and he wasn't very warm or welcoming in his interactions. However, the great food and wine made up for the average service. I had the seashell pasta with scallops and shrimp, while my boyfriend had the linguini and shrimp in pesto. Huge portions that came to our table surprisingly fast for how busy the restaurant was. Overall, 4 stars."
"We arrived on time for a 7:30 reservation last Saturday.  We were told it would be a few minutes.  Fine.  After a half hour, with no table in sight, we asked the hostess what the story was.  She was totally flustered and called in the owner/manager.  He told us ""this is Chicago, people expect to wait on Saturday nights""  Really?  I would say restaurants here are pretty good about holding close to reservation times.  If you're not capable of doing that, why even accept reservations.  Both hostess and owner were totally unapologetic and downright hostile.  We decided to go elsewhere and the owner yelled ""f-ing a**holes"" at us as we left.  Nice.  Won't be back.  Owner should relocate his restaurant and attitude to New Jersey, where he'll be right at home."
"OK, so I have to give three stars just because the service was terrible!  The food was fantastic though and I highly recommend it.Our waiter had the bus boy bring out our dishes and never came back to check on them.  At this point, we're both out of our beverages as well as water.  Towards the end of the meal we were able to flag down someone else to come get our waiter to give us some drinks..but at a nice Italian place I would just expect better service.The food came out fast though despite how crowded and busy they were and honestly, the food was rich, decadent and outstanding.Would definitely recommend and hopefully others will get better service.  Maybe my waiter was just having an off-night :)"
"Mid tier restaurant. I would say it's like home cooked food, nothing spectacular. Portions are big! I had a fish dish and it came out with two large fillets!! Service was good. Note also, this place is loud... not from music but from the echos off the walls from all the conversation. It was a Friday night and was packed. My parents were visiting from overseas and my Dad is hard of hearing, so not ideal if you want a quieter spot."
"Outstanding Italian! This was my second time to Topo Gigio and I am so pleased. Each time we ordered the CALAMARI FRITTI - Golden Fried Calamari served with Lemon Wedges & Marinara Sauce. The Calamari is amazing, wonderful taste. There have been many times I have ordered Calamari at other restaurants and been very disappointed. I will order it here every time!I had the GARGANELLI con le LUGANIGHE - Hand Rolled Garganelli Pasta, Porcini Mushrooms and Sausage Ragu', Parmigiano Reggiano. Absolutely amazing. The sauce is great and not sweet like some Italian sauces make the mistake of doing. Sausage had a tiny kick to it and the pasta was cooked just right. My father had the PETTI di POLLO alla FIORENTINA - Breast of Chicken Sautéed with Pancetta, Spinach and Baked with Fresh Mozzarella. Roasted Potatoes and Asparagus. I tried this and it too was great. The chicken was very juicy and the asparagus was flavorful as well. I also ordered a side of meatballs to share... I make my family recipe from the motherland and their meatballs were very much cooked like my family. (We just add a TON of garlic, theirs had a hint of garlic. Nothing too powerful.)You must visit Topo Gigio!"
There's a reason Topo Gigio has been on Wells street for as long as they have. Good service. Great food and in the summer the sidewalk cafe is perfect Wells Street people watching.  Their spaghetti and meat balls are my go to dish.  But you'll succeed with nearly anything on their menu ... Caprese salad is pretty perfect as well.
"This place is great. Start out with a glass of wine or do it like me: gobble the contents of your delicious bread basket (with olive oil & parmesan for dipping, of course) while you skim through the menu and then end up stuffed by the time your meal comes although it looks so divine your begin to devour.  I went with the tortellini with mushrooms, pancetta, peas in a nice cream sauce.  Good wine selection and great service (thanks bartender, Erin).  Friendly neighborhood atmosphere that will remain a staple in Old Town for many more years and years."
"The food was great, service was NOT.I'll start with the service since its the reason for my 2 rating:I made reservations for 4 and had to wait about 40 minutes at a crowded bar before being seated.  We were on time for our reservation.  They simply overbooked reservations, and that's not acceptable.  The manager offered a bottle of wine AFTER I expressed my displeasure with them not having our table.  He never came to the table once we were seated.     While we were waiting, the manager was in dispute with another customer right in front of everyone at the hostess table  Yelling at/insulting the customer.  ""Go back to the suburbs"" was one comment from the manager directed at the woman.  I won't even get into who I think was right or wrong.  Clearly, management should not be 1) insulting customers or 2) causing a scene in front of customers waiting to be seated.Service was great once we were seated!  No problem with our waiter.   The food:Everyone was very happy with their meal.  Apps and pasta dishes were great.  I'd give the food alone 4 stars.  However, I don't know that I could recommend going here....there are many good Italian options in the city."
I'll admit I am a foodie (most specifically Italian food) so my review might be a little harsh to some. I ordered the pesto and shrimp linguine. The dish was so bland no amount of salt and pepper could help--and pesto is anything but bland. My boyfriend's dish (the bolognese) was a little better but nothing great. Still trying to figure out why people rave about this place... overpriced mediocre Italian food.
"Topo Gigio is probably the Chicago restaurant most reminisced about by my parents (they often visit me from out of state) to this day.  They've only eaten here one time but I've been here on at least five or six occasions.  The neighborhood is wonderful, the restaurant atmosphere itself is pleasant, the staff is professional, and the food is above average (don't forget about their specials).  A meal for two won't break the bank and you'll probably have leftovers to enjoy the next day.  The only negative thing I have to say about Topo Gigio is that it can be kind of loud at times but that's really only because they sometimes attract larger than average party sizes (full tables of 8-12 people) and I'm not going to hold that against them.They haven't reinvented the wheel here; rather, they prepare classic Italian dishes at reasonable pricing in a warm, familial environment.  The pastas are cooked and sauced properly, the calamari is crisp, and the fish/chicken is never dry.  Order a bottle of wine and make it a date spot if you'd like and you're likely to come away satisfied."
"Topo has moved up my list to my favorite Italian restaurant in the city and close to my absolute favorite.  Great staff, great food and a great local neighborhood vibe.get reservations....there's a reason is is packed all the time."
"Wonderful italian restaurant.  I've had several dishes here all of which were flavorful and fresh.  I recently had the Piccatina Di Vitella Al Simone, which was delicious.  It had a nice balance of seasoning.  The ambience is wonderful - perfect for a date night."
"Quite disappointing for what claims to be a ""classic Italian"" restaurant. The house salad is nothing like a classic Italian, in fact tastes straight out of a plastic bag. Paper tablecloths are tacky for the menu's price point. Service was slow but it was a busy night. Crowd consists of late middle aged couples or people a bit younger that are underdressed and overtanned."
"My favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago, hands down.  I especially love eating at the bar.  Great bartenders, hostesses, food, everything.  Definitely go for one of the pasta dishes - they are delicious.   Rigatoni Al Filo Di Fumo is my favorite.  This place is good for groups, family dinners, or a date.   Try it!"
"salads are good, service was excellent...highly recommend a reservation on the weekends.  take out is quick and delicious."
"It makes me sad to give this place 3 stars because the first time I dined here, I absolutely loved it. After my experience this past weekend I doubt I'll go back. I dined here with my girlfriend who was visiting on Saturday before going to a show at The Second City at 11. We had 8:30 reservations and were seated promptly. From there it went downhill. We started with salads, and I got a glass of wine.  After our server brought the salads, we basically never saw him again. My friend was without water for most of our time there until she could flag down a passing by server to finally get someone's attention. I had run out of wine by the time my meal came and was halfway done eating when our server appeared to clear my wine glass, not even bothering to ask me if I wanted another, which I most definitely did and I had to shout my request to him since he'd already walked away from our table without a word. Didn't even ask how our food was. (For the record it was quite good- my friend ordered the garganelli with sausage ragu and mushrooms, and I got the conchiglie with tomato cream sauce, sausage and peas). Our server seemed to be very attentive to all surrounding tables and we couldn't help but feel that he didn't pay attention to us because we weren't going to have a huge tab. My friend is pregnant so it's not like we were going to be boozing it up at dinner. The first time I dined here was earlier this year and I loved it which is why I came back this weekend. After the bad taste left in my mouth by the service this time, when I'm craving Italian from now on I'll be going to La Scarola."
WOW do I have mixed feelings about this place!!  We came across this place by accident as we were strolling down the street. We were seated back in the outdoor patio area- SO ROMANTIC feeling! It was very hard to read the menus due to lighting as it was night time. We were enjoying our time however I would have to agree with some of the previous reviews that the staff were a bit rude.  BUT that is not what I will think of when I think of this place. We were sitting there enjoying our conversation and meal when a RAT peeked over the wall at us!!!  YIKES!  Beyond the rude staff and the rat the place it'self was very romantic and I would love to take my special man there :)
"this was our 2nd visit, and we didn't have reservations.  We were seated in their covered area.  The waiter seemed to be having a bad day and acted accordingly.  Now that we've been to several different Italian restaurants, their food was just ok.  I'm not in a hurry to return."
"Must say the food was breathtaking, best Italian I've had thus far. I would give it five but the staff was a little crusty, it could use a healthy injection of youth!"
"Because the owners of Topo Gigio own that buidling and have no debt, they are able to , and choose to, offer some of the most reasonable prices for solid Italian fare in all of the Near North.It is a wonderful option in Old Town especially if you are catching a show at Second City or Zanies.Our proscuitto and fresh mozzarella appetizer was excellent.Our fennel salad in light vinagrette with mandarin oranges was superb. Large potion plated nicely for $6. That value.The Mediterranean Style Grilled Chicken Breast was superb. The sauce was great and the steamed broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower that accompanied it were cooked so perfectly.  I can not tell you how many restaurants get this wrong.My wife's Filet Medallions were solid and good portion for $28.  Choice Filet goes for $13 per lb wholesale these daysWe also order oven roasted potatoes on the side.  at other places, you would play $7-10. At Topo, $3.50.  That is nice.  It is called not being greedy.  The Potato portion they gave us cost them 30 cents.  Theyre happy making 1000% while the industry is consumed by greed and even on an item like this, want to make 3000%.Where Topo i thought was weak unfortunately was their pasta.  I own a fast casual Pasta and Pizza shop in Andersonville (PizzeriaAroma.com) and sincerely felt my marinara and meat gravy was far superior.  My pasta with meat ragu and porcini mushrooms came out way too saucy and overpowered by mushrooms. In this type of  fish, you want to thrown it perhaps 6 whole porcini cut up to give it the funghi flavor.  This dish had like 15 mushrooms cut in 1/2.  I could not taste the essence of the tomato sauce or the meat in the gravy.  Mushroom totally overpowered. Plus, we had eaten some amazing world class pasta at Po' in Greenwich Village weeks earlier. Standard was set pretty high.I told our server Gilbert (who did a very nice effecient job) that the pasta was way to saucy. I asked him to take it back and simply bring me a small side of  penne meat sauce, ez sauce.He was gracious and said no problem.Only problem was he came out with a small plate of penne meat sauce, but this plate was loaded with even more sauce.  I was full at this time, so my wife and i just picked at it.  Pasta cooked al dente, but i thought their meat gravy had to much ground beef & lamb in relation to tomato sauce and was bland.Over all, nice quaint place, good meal and real good value for downtown.  When we come bk to Zanies or Second City, id be more than to come back here for salad, antipasto, and some grilled chicken or meat."
"This place has been in my neighborhood for a long time.  The last time I dined here, I was MUCH younger and on a bad blind date.  Luckily, this time around, I can associate a more positive experience - dinner with a good friend.We picked a Wednesday evening to dine here.  With no reservation, the hostess managed to squeeze us in.  I thought that was strange, since it was a weeknight, but it quickly filled in as the night went on.The ambiance was cozy, perfect for a crisp fall day.To start, my friend ordered a bottle of Malbec.  I wish I could remember the name because it was delicious.  Bread, olive oil, and parmesan were plentiful.  For the main entrees, I ordered the special:  pumpkin ravioli in a white cream sauce.  My friend ordered the Pollo Arrosto al Rosmarino - chicken in wine and lemon sauce with rosemary potatoes.  Everything was DELICIOUS!Service was wonderful.  I think our waiter was trying to get us drunk, because he kept filling up our wine glasses after a couple of sips.  Oh my!This place definitely warrants more frequent visits.  I'm sure there's another bottle of wine I need to try and more items on the menu to enjoy!"
"I went to this restaurant on a weeknight.. on a whim, really.. I LOVED it. The ambiance inside is very calm, romantic, and old Italian.The service is excellent here- I got a great recommendation on a bottle of wine, which I enjoyed to the very last drop. I started out with the antipasto appetizer- mix of cured meats, cheeses, and vegetables. Along with their amazing bread, it was very filling!  I had their special- fettuccine in spicy red sauce with mix of scallops, mussels, shrimp, and calamari. I can get pretty picky with dishes such as this, but there is NOTHING I would change about it. Just try this place. You'll fall in love with it."
Decent food and atmosphere.
"I'm thinking that if a restaurant is jam-packed on a Wednesday night it's a good sign, and yes, I was right. Food was delicious, service was top notch (and quick), the energy of the neighborhood and restaurant was amazing and somehow I felt like the waiter was a long time friend.  I honestly don't think it's possible to order something bad off this menu. I had the linguine delle ""cinque terre""...um, yeah - can we say HEAVENLY?? I tried my best to finish the plate, I didn't want something so delectable go to waste, but I failed. The portions are enormous. This place won't disappoint you."
The mouse with the big ears is part of the decor of this establishment.  But what else seems to be a part of the establishment is great service and good cuisine. The layout to the dining room is a little strange as you walk into a bar and then go through another set of doors to enter into the restaurant.  But when you finally make it through the maze (ah maybe that's why a mouse is their mascot) you will find a great place to have an Italian meal.
"I've been to this one and also the one in Lombard/Downers Grove.  This one in Old Town is, for whatever reason, way better. The gnocchi, the gnocchi, the gnocchi.  If you don't see it on the menu ask the waiter for it anyway, because they have it (insist, I say!).  They can serve it appetizer-sized or entree-sized.  They'll also put whatever sauce you like on it, too, so go with the vodka or the pomodoro.  Ah, beautiful pillows from heaven.  You can eat an entire plate and feel like you haven't eaten anything ... for a little while.  Then those little potato lovelies settle down in your stomach and you suddenly realize that MY GOD, you've just gained seven whole pounds. Whatever.  It's worth it.  Other dishes of merit include the calamari fritti which the two men with whom I was dining seemed to love (if moaning and eye rolling is any indication), as well as the roasted chicken, spaghetti bolognese and a pasta dish made with squid ink that my friend thought was spectacular (don't see it on the menu anymore, however).I live in Denver now and so cannot eat here anymore.  This pains me beyond articulation.  You should go.  Go and then tell me about it.  Sigh."
"Good neighborhood Italian place.  Food is very good, service is all male and sort of rude.  Cute decor, nice outside eating"
"This is a quaint little Italian restaurant that offers decent food at a reasonable price. We got a great recommendation from our waiter for a reasonably priced bottle of wine. My friend got the rosemary chicken (which she loves), but I thought it lacked a bit of flavor. I got the homemade pasta special with seafood. The past was good and the sauce was neither too creamy or too much tomato. It was good. The seafood on the other hand was just not there. The scallops tasted a bit fishy and did not have that smooth texture that makes a scallop truly delicious. The shrimp were OK, but a little fishy tasting. For the price, it was probably a fair value. I think that it would be better to raise the price by $5 and try to have seafood to knock your socks off."
"Decent Italian food,  the crowd is usually in mid 40s or families spending time with each other.  The decor is on more traditional side. Good to have food with friends, drink wine and laugh."
"Topo Gigio worked out really well for dinner before an 8:00 Second City show last Thursday.  Our group of 4 sat down at 6:00, had plenty of time to order and eat (including dessert), and then made the 5 minute walk to the theater, getting there by 7:45.  The best part about Topo Gigio is the service.  Our waiter seemed really experienced and knowledgeable about the food and wine menus.  I got the garganelli pasta and it was a perfectly sized portion and not too heavy - all good if you have to stay alert during a 2-3 hour show.I was surprised to see all the celebrities who'd visited this restaurant over the years, evidenced by the signed photos near the bathroom.  I guess we're not the only ones to have grabbed dinner there before heading over to Second City."
The best most consistent food and service! I can eat everything on the menu most recently the pumpkin ravioli.  Delicious! the minestrone soup hit the spot yesterday.  I love going there when they know me well enough I dont have to make any decisions. Especially after a very busy day and I just want to relax.  Thank you Topo!
"NOPE! After almost 10 years of patronage they lost my friends, myself and any referrals from us.While dining there in Feb, someone calling himself the owner approached our table of four women with drink in hand and asked if he could ""buy us a drink"". We thanked him but said we were fine with the second bottle of wine we had ordered and just wanted to order another entree. He told us the kitchen had been closed 'awhile"" even though a table had just been seated about 10 minutes prior. When we mentioned that we were surprise our waiter hadn't given us the head's up to put in the last of our order he did a complete about face and became argumentative and nasty. Here's the thing, if the kitchen is closed, fine. To argue that we ""should have known"" and become a verbal snake, not even close to fine. He left the table with these fine words ""you'll all die old and alone"" Awesome representation of your place buddy. And while Frank Sr. was sweet enough on the phone when I called to let him know, little else was done to remedy the situation. He said to ""look for him"" next time we're in but you know, just don't want to walk into the place again. There are hundreds of places in Chicago with top notch Italian where my friends and I haven't been verbally harassed by the ""owner"".Arrivederci Topo."
"Food was really good! Had the chicken that was stuffed with spinach, cheese, and sun dried tomato. It was served with a white sauce that was really tasty. Service was good, except they dont do anything special for birthdays. Ambiance was nice."
"Love this restaurant! I always get the ""Luca"" Special. Rigatoni, add mushrooms with or without pancetta. Can also get this in a half order, the perfect female portion"
This place is so cozy & the food is delicious!! We came here on a Friday night without a reservation and they were kind enough to give us a table without making us wait forever. We only waited for about 10 minutes before a table opened up. Some of the tables are super close together but the food & service is so good that it's not too much of an issue! I had the shell pasta with peas and it was delicious!!
"3.5 Stars - Food was better than average, service was SLOW...We came here at 6:15pm before the 2nd City showing at 8pm, orders were put in at 6:30pm but the food did not arrive until 7:20pm.  All we ordered was Chicken Fiorentina and Eggplant Parmigiana, no appetizers and no drinks, somehow it took them nearly an hour to get the food out.  Our dinner was rushed through due to that.I will probably come here again for the food, but I will make sure I will not have any movies or shows to catch right after that."
"Solid 4 stars!Great option in a very dry stretch of Clark (old town) with lots of options but also lots of misses.  Classic, italian cuisine.  Can rival many of the city's authentic italian spots including the solid chains (francesca's, rose bud), but Topo Gigio has a level of fresh ingredients and homey ambiance that helps it rise above.  All of the pasta dishes are really spot on, all classic preparations - don't expect bells and whistle's, just dependable, fresh italian.  Seafood dishes are always a hit.  Sauces are all home made with great flavor.  For dessert, must try their homemade tiramisu which is AMAZING!  If in the area and looking for dependable italian fix, this is the place for you."
"Really good, really tasty Italian food.  They've got a cool patio out front, a trendy bar area, and a big patio out back.  The service was spot on, the food was super tasty on a gourmet level, and humongous portions were provided.Really, what's not to like?I suppose the outdoor seating wouldn't be very pleasant when the weather turns cold.  Also, the ""Topo Gigio"" mouse is kinda creepy to me.  But that's it.  Otherwise, this place was great!"
"So somehow this place has a full bar but is also BYOB?  I'm not sure how it works, I had too much red wine to understand by the end of the meal.  There is probably a corkage fee, again I was too far gone to be bothered by it.What I do know is that for a girl who beelines for anything with a cream sauce or bacon/pancetta/prosciutto... I got the Conchiglie Mediterranea (Seashell Pasta with Shrimp, Sea Scallops, and Pea Pods in a Garden Fresh Tomato and Basil Sauce) (yeah I copied that from the website...) it was so freaking good I ate the entire thing.  No leftovers for this fat girl who might not be as fat because it was a healthy red sauce with veggies!  Seriously so good.Dessert though... oh-ma-goodness.  Espresso cheesecake I wish you lived at my house.  So good."
"Solid dinner here on their terrific outdoor patio. Love the feeling of dining al fresco. Grilled calamari was great, as was a salad. Totally easy to get a healthy meal here, despite the temptation of the pasta (which is also delicious). Great wine list, friendly service. I will definitely be back."
"Fantastic place.  Best meal I have had in a long time.  Calamari was good, but the lentil soup, and the LINGUINE delle CINQUE TERRE.  Unbelievably good.  Ending with the best Tiramisu I ever ate."
"We came in as a fairly large party and our server greeted us.   And then disappeared.   20 minutes later he came with our drinks.   Then disappeared.    He came back for our order....you get the idea.    I spent most of the night hoping the ice from my water glass would hurry up and melt so I could have something to drink.   I will say my meal was delicious.    I was so excited to take it home as leftovers.    But then a busboy came and took my meal and my friend's meal (we had the same thing) away to wrap in the same hand.  And when he brought it back, he left it stacked on the table.    I like my friends and all, but I think this makes us married in some countries.   If the service wasn't so sucky, it would have been a great meal.   Luckily for me, there are other Italian restaurants in the sea...er...city."
"Summary in one Sentence: Basically, everything about the restaurant was what I would expect from a ""$$"" Italian restaurant; I'm giving 5 stars based purely on the quality of the food alone.  ---------------------We arrived about 10 minutes late from our assigned reservation time, so we had to wait another 15 minutes.  No worries, we just had drinks at the bar until our table was ready.I had the salmon salad, which is a great alternative to the salmon with pasta if you feel guilty for filling up on the complimentary bread.  The other 5 in my party all enjoyed their dishes as well, which were almost all fish dishes.  The waiter was polite and to the point, which was greatly appreciated..My only complaint is that the place is quite loud when full, but what do you expect in a room full of people?"
"LACKS COMPASSION. AWFUL PEOPLE.   I asked if they can make a plain piece of chicken with some oil and spices for my hungry multiple food allergic child -a simple request that has been honored by multiple restaurants all over the world.  The woman said ""no, we cannot do that"" immediately even without thinking.  Our whole group went to Tavern on the Park and were much happier.  I hope karma comes back to bite them."
Went on a Sunday evening before going to a show at Second City.  I had the Conchiglie alla Sarda  and my wife had Spaghetti and Meatballs.  Whatever was in the alla Sarda dish was  extremely delicious and the spaghetti and meatballs were also top notch.  Would come back in a heartbeat
"Nice ambiance, good service, traditional old school Italian food with lots of flavor. We started with bruschetta. It was not heaping with topping and lots of diced tomatoes but instead had small sliced toms. I think they were cherry toms, different than typical but tasty.  Then we had beef risotto milanese and a seashell shaped pasta with a wonderful creamy sausage sauce (forget the name of the dish!) Both were good sized portions, the beef was tender, risotto was just right - would recommend each."
"Was in the mood for good Italian and in the neighborhood for Topo.As always, this is a mainstay in my book of places I know I can trust to deliver.  I never order anything fancy, so you have to talk to others about the specials.  I can tell you that if you want a good cozy space for great Italian and friendly service, head over here.Update:  this is quickly becoming a personal hang out now that I have moved.  Best eggplant parmigian in town."
"Finally I've found another great Italian place in Chicago. There aren't many with really good food, but Topo Gigio wowed me big time. Portions are ginormous. My friends and I met at Topo for dinner on a Friday night to try out the place and though I encouraged them to be original, all three of them ended up ordering the same thing--eggplant parmesan. I ordered the Conchiglie alla Sarda (seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas, and Pecorino cheese). It had a nice balance of flavors and was cooked well. The eggplant parmesan was one of the best I've ever had. In fact, half way through the meal, I switched plates with one of my friends and finished up the rest of the eggplant parm.Nice outdoor patio and bar area. Indoor dining room is a bit of a tight squeeze but it's warm, inviting, and romantic. They were short-staffed that night, so we did not get good service, but the food more than made up for it. Bread served before dinner was piping hot and delicious. The shrimp pasta on a neighboring table looked fantastic, can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu."
"Hoyas in Chicago!  This is what an Italian restaurant should be--a mix of the old country with the new modern twist.  I had the scampi appetizer with mushrooms shrimp, and scallops--truly a wonderful appetizer.  I had the fettucini fra diavolo with the perfect mix of red pepper and spice.  This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have been to anywhere in some time.  It helped that I was with my Italian Hoya Hoop Club friends!  Hoya Saxa--Our first dinner at Georgetown John Carroll Chicago 2012!  We are Georgetown!"
"Lovely!Nothing better than an old-school Chicago Italian restaurant for carb-loading before the half marathon....Topo Gigio has such a fantastic menu.  A variety of pastas with the option to alter them, edit them, add to them, and basically create the pasta dish of your dreams.  And they give you enough bread that you can carb load your way to a personal best in your race!  But I digress...There are 5 places to sit at Topo Gigio: inside the restaurant (do this when it's cold outside), out on the back patio (don't do this!  it's kind of janky back there), out on the front patio (best people watching ever) and then either at the outside bar or at the inside bar.  Pick your poison and your threshold for being too hot/cold.With the hit-or-miss restaurants in the heart of Old Town, Topo Gigio comes out ahead.  If you are in the neighborhood make sure to try!"
"730pm, party of 4, on a friday, no reservations: we were seated right away!!  To the side of the bar, in a patio area with heaters nearby, I didnt mind, it was great and we could catch the bulls game on the TVs by the bar.  All 4 of us loved our dishes and enjoyed a bottle of red wine.  We all tried each others plates and liked each others selections as well.  Prices very reasonable, good portions (3 had leftovers for home), great service.  Splitting bill with cash and two credit cards: no problem."
"Service. Reasonable, accommodated our party if 8 (3 under 12 yr) arriving early for our reservation. Attentive waiter. Food. Ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. Tortilini panna. Fine. Appetizers calimari was ok, nothing special. Bruschetta was fabulous though! Drinks. Wine service fine. Felt a little rushed to get us out. Bottom line. It was fine. When we are back in Chicago we 'll try other Italian restaurants. No reason to return."
"I had the special, black linguine with seafood, fantastic. The eggplant parm was tasty but way too heavy on the cheese.Would definitely go back."
"This place was recommended to us a couple of years back, and I am glad we finally checked it out. Great location, nice patio, nice service, and delicious food = tremendous combination in my book! The antipasto was probably the best we have ever had - really, really delicious. The pasta (linguine with tomato basil and seafood) and the seafood risotto (Linguine Mediterranea and risotto Milanese) were cooked to perfection. A nice glass of Sangiovese and the flour-less chocolate cake were the final bite and we went into a delicious food induced coma. Great place and we will be back!"
"I really wanted to like Topo Gigio because I've heard so many good things about it, but I've been twice now, and it just doesn't hit the spot.You'll find typical (for Chicago) Italian fare on the menu - no surprises here. On my last visit, I had a very disappointing tortellini alla panna that lacked any real flavor.  To top it off, the noise level in the restaurant was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend across the table.Previously, I was seated in the outdoor patio area, which was covered with tents/plastic walls. It was raining that evening, however, and the patio was soaked and uncomfortable for dining. It just made for a really unpleasant experience.If you're looking to dine here, you WILL need a reservation. I wouldn't even bother going if you don't have one. Me? I'm still in search of a great Italian restaurant in this city!"
"In the mood for some casual alfresco dining one beautiful evening, my friend and I aimlessly wandered through the Gold Coast and then simultaneously blurted: ""I can't do this"".Instead, we strolled over to Old Town and as soon as I laid my eyes upon Topo Gigio, I knew this was ""it"".We were quickly seated in the charming courtyard.  A row of candles glowed against the rustic terra cotta walls, lighting up the bar area. Rudy, the fabulous bartender, took care of our every whim.  It was a bit chilly that evening, and though Topo Gigio employs the power of heat lamps, the one above me was broken.  Not only did he request for it to be repaired immediately, he came over to warm me up!  No complaints here, as he is quite the dashing gent (see pictures).It should also be noted that Rudy is the kind of bartender that likes to keep a good time going... our glasses were never empty!  I love the ""laissez-faire"" pour.  That way no one, including us, knew how many actual glasses were consumed.After 17 glasses of wine or so (ahem), we decided to split an order of pasta.  Rudy rolled out the red carpet and set an impressive ""table"" for us on the bar.  The pasta, conchiglie alla sarda, was something spectacular.  Seashell pasta in a delicious tomato-cream sauce with a liberal dose of Italian sausage and Pecorino cheese. The accompanying bread was still warm, crusty, just pure goodness once it met my olive oil and Parmesan cheese bath.We also met several savvy Italian diners at the bar... both Italian immigrants and tourists who clearly adore Topo Gigio as much as we did. A special thanks to our neighbors on the right who not only kept a great barside manner but also bought us a special serenade, ""Moon River"", performed by the talented ensemble.  Still swooning.  Impeccable service, fantastic food, easy café-inspired ambiance... this one's a keeper."
"I've been here.....Um....like 5 times during the last month.  Not sure, I've lost count.If you haven't been, you're missing out.  Their patio is fantastic.  I could gush about its fabulousness, but it's one of those places you must experience for yourself.The bar area gets very crowded, but if you are so lucky to snag a pair of seats, you will be in for a treat.  Not only will you be served great drinks, there is a nice breeze that swirls through making it very comfortable.  About a month ago, it got chilly late one evening, so they turned on the patio heaters--love that!Earlier last week, I had dinner here for the first time.  I was craving a good caprese salad.  It's still too early for tomatoes to be in season, but it really didn't matter, the mozzarella and basil made the dish shine.  My dining companion shared his seared tuna dish with me.  it really hit the spot, especially the asparagus side.Topo Gigio is definetly a highlight on Wells, whether you are having dinner or just drinks.  Prime patio weather is only around for another couple of months, so get to it!"
"One of my favorite places! The grilled calamari is to die for! Not chewy and seasoned just enough! I highly recommend the tiramisu. It comes in an oversized goblet and can be easily shared. It really is delicious, but be careful when ingesting the beginnings of the tiramisu. The ground cinnamon on top can easily cause you to have a coughing attack that's hard to calm down. Oh but it is so worth it!"
Great restaurant.  LOVE it in the summertime especially.  Wonderful atmosphere in the heart of Old Town.  You feel like you're in Italy!
"Mama Mia! I love Italian food but for some reason it is never my first choice when I want to eat out. Went here the other day with my dorm and had an unreal time! Its location in Old Town is so fitting. I felt like i was in Goodfellas while eating here! The food with its hefty portions were amazing. I def. recommend the filet minion dish with rosotto. I recommend this place for sure, especially if you want a classic Italian feel."
"We stopped in for dinner with friends on a weeknight and the place was surprisingly crowded-- always a good sign!  The waitstaff was attentive, though I have to say that the food was decent but nothing to write home about.  I actually had to look at their menu online to remember what I ate and as a food lover (specifically Italian) that's not good!  I ordered a linguine with peppers, pesto, and shrimp and while it was good (albeit really oily) there was still something missing.  My husband's spicy pasta dish was also good, but not superb. One thing that I can say was excellent was the antipasti.  I love when an antipasti platter comes with an abundance of nicely grilled vegetables and they did not disappoint there.  I could have ordered it as my meal!If you're looking for Italian in Old Town this is probably your best bet.  If you're willing to venture outside of the neighborhood, there are a few other Italian spots that I would recommend first."
"I went here with a bunch of girl-friends for our birthdays and it was really delicious. I ordered the lamb special, and probably should've asked for a price since I found out later it was the most expensive thing on the menu, but wow was it good!A couple of my other friends got the tilapia special and it was amazing! Not to mention, the portions on all of our plates were huge and we ended up having a lot leftover afterwards. The service was spot on and everything was to our liking.I couldn't help but notice there was an entire table of appetizers behind us the whole time we sat. Then we realized it wasn't for show but you could actually order the appetizer buffet. I just thought was gross because we were there for far over an hour and a half and everything HAD to be cold by then. It made sense as to why no one touched it.Overall though, it was a solid spot and I want to come back and try some kind of pasta, because after all, that's what really makes an Italian restaurant what it is!"
"Full disclosure, this is more of a review of their Frutti de Mare than the restaurant as a whole - In a nutshell, Topo Gigio is an old town staple, the patio is just lurvely in the summertime, service is solid and the ambiance inside is old school chicago italian. Blah la la, it's quite nice really. BUT - last month they had an arrabiata seafood dish on special - it changed my life. The perfect blend of spicy and seafood. Every bite was heaven. So ofcourse, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Alas, it was a special, and on my next trip - it was long gone. What to do, what to do? So, I consulted with my waiter (he was very helpful) and we came up with a solution, frutti de mare - with arrabiata sauce, extra spice and sub fettucine noodles. Problem solved! This place is delicious... Just writing this review has got me considering a walk over to Wells..."
"3.5 starsVariable quality in the food--- my friend ordered the black linguine with scallops/shrimp in red sauce (wasn't on the menu but she showed a pic from yelp lol), and it was SOOOO DELICIOUS. Would definitely order this! We all ate hers until we burst! The other two dishes were definitely just average and a little salty (Garganelli and stuffed chicken breast).The KIm Crawford Sauvignon Blanc was crisp and refreshing ($9/glass)."
Called for a reservation and was treated rudely and hung up on by the snotty girl who answered. I wouldn't go there now if you paid me. There's plenty of great Italian restaurants in Chicago. I recommend Volare!
"I loved this place. I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to go after reading some of the reviews. However, two of my friends really wanted to try it, so we made a reservation for a Friday night. While it was a bit crowded and loud, it was a boisterous and happy kind of loud. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. We each ordered one of the specials for the night, and all our dishes were fabulous. Probably some of the best pasta I've had in Chicago."
"Loved it. Loved it. What a great restaurant for any occasion. The fact that I've lived in or near Old Town for the past 5 years and have not been to Topo is a disgrace. If you haven't been, you need to go! We made reservations for 8pm last night (Tuesday) my boyfriend and my parents. The wine was flowing, appetizers were tasty, entrees were more than I could have expected and desserts and coffee, DEVINE! When you walk in, you're walking into the covered outdoor bar which leads to the restaurant itself. It's got that cozy feel to it and I felt right at home. By the bathrooms, there are pictures of all the celebrities/tv personalities that have been there. This place is very well known!Our waiter was adorable. We kept saying how much he looked like Bernie Lomax from the movie Weekend at Bernie's. I'm sure he just loved us too, as we racked up quite the tab. We started with the CALAMARI alla GRIGLIA (Grilled Calamari) which had an amazing garlic sauce. I couldn't help myself as I was like a kid in a candy shop, almost licking the remaining contents of the bowl. We also had the Steamed Mussels and Clams  with Calabrese Sausage. I'm not a fan of Mussels, or Clams but everyone who tried it loved it! The best thing about dining out with more than 1 person is trying everyone's dishes. The bf had: CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA which is Seashell Pasta in A Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese.VERY delish and I see other people have enjoyed it as well. My Dad had GARGANELLI con le LUGANIGHE  which is Hand Rolled Garganelli Pasta, Porcini Mushrooms and Sausage Ragu', Parmigiano Reggiano. The sauce was SO tasty on this one.Mom had PETTI di POLLO alla VALDOSTANA  which is Breast of Chicken Stuffed with Fontina Cheese, Prosciutto Cotto and Spinach.Baked with Sun Dried Tomatoes and Porcini Mushrooms Sauce.I had PETTI di POLLO alla FIORENTINA, Breast of Chicken Sautéed with Pancetta, Spinach and Baked with Fresh Mozzarella. Roasted Potatoes and Asparagus. So amazing. I wish I hadn't devoured the appetizers so I could consume more of this goodness. It was just covered in cheese. The roasted potatoes were So fantastic when dipped in the sauce that squired as I cut into the chicken.All of these dishes were equally fantastic and I'm sure everything else is amazing as well.For dessert we did some Biscotti, Pistachio Gelato, and this amazing Espresso Cheesecake that they were featuring for that night. We totally couldn't stuff the desert into our stomaches but we did it anyway. Overall, a really awesome night. Couldn't have picked a better spot for it. I imagine the place is hoppin' on the weekends but it was nice and low key when we were there. With wine, you'll most likely end up spending $75-$100 per person, but it's worth it for sure! Perfect. Check it out!"
"Okay, hold on they have a mouse character mascot that is based on a children's puppet show...they also sell t-shirts featuring said mouse. I was thinking how great that would go with my French Laundry running shorts. But let's not discuss my fashion proclivities. Topo Gigio is one of my favorite restaurants when I am in town...in fairness...it is usually an expense account visit...but I figure that frees me up to focus on the food and service. I have found the food to be very good - my favorites include the Carpaccio and the saltimbocca with Parma. With larger groups the wait staff has suggested a mixed appetizer presentation for the table - that has been uniformly well received. I have had the waiter suggest some wines that I was unfamiliar with and they turned out to be great. Service is mostly above average though have on occasion had to speak to the waiter about the importance of the dinner event. Overall I would say this is a great place to entertain and create a friendly environment conducive to bonding or team building. Looking forward to my next visit."
Never had the chance to try the food because reservation wasn't honored  by the restaurant more than 30 minutes after the reserved time. The manager was the rudest individual I have ever encountered in the front of the house and I refused to wait any longer to be seated. Don't support this restaurant until the swap out management
"If I could choose 0 stars, I would. The food was sub par and the service was absolutely awful.Let me note before I write a book on this awful experience that if you want REALLY good Italian good in Chicago, go to J. Rocco's or Prosecco. Don't waste your money here.Service: I picked a bottle of wine for me and my boyfriend to have during dinner. When our check came, I noticed the price for the wine was a bit more than what I saw. I asked the waiter to double check and he stared at me blankly then looked over at my boyfriend for confirmation to proceed with my request (this is a common occurance. Every time I asked a question that resulted in some sort of action from the waiter, he would look at my boyfriend for confirmation as if he didn't take me serious enough and needed the man in the relationship to verify. He would stare at my boyfriend for 8 seconds waiting for verification, like my own asking wasnt enough. This happened so many times to the point I felt degraded and to the point that my boyfriend would just say thank you every time the waiter did this because he was uncomfortable and didn't know what to say).  Finally the waiter came back and the price on this wine menu was indeed what the receipt says, I told him I thought it was $28 but he said no it looks like there is not a $28 bottle of wine on this list. So it's not like I pointed at the wrong wine and accidentally picked the more expensive one, the wine list I initially had didn't have the correct prices and most likely wasn't updated from when they switched the menus. So we were fine with paying more but I wanted to tell them to check their menus so this didn't happen in the future to another customer but the waiter explained there's hundreds of menus and he thinks I read it wrong. So now I feel stupid that he's pretty much saying I made this entire thing up. So I ask for the manager because again I don't want this to happen to another customer in the future and she says ""I'm sorry all of our $28 bottles of wine are written on the board, our current menu doesn't have any bottles for that price"" WELL that's the whole point there's a menu out there amongst your customers that's not current!!!!! Again I am being made to look extremely stupid when I am trying to HELP them out. Afterwards the waiter comes back and goes ""do you want me to take the tip off your bill I tried to do something but my manager did nothing here I'm gonna scratch the tip off"" and my boyfriend/I are saying no we are all set it's fine, at this point we want to leave, but the waiter takes a pen, crosses out this tip we left him on the receipt, and walks away with it. Funny that he kept the total the same.....Food: I got the shell pasta with sausage, peas, and a cream sauce. There were many pictures of this item on yelp and many good reviews so I thought it would be a good choice. But I couldn't have been more wrong. The pasta was bland, clearly the pasta water was not salted. Barely any sausage. The sauce was extremely bland, it had no taste. The peas were nice, I'll give them that. I love pecorino cheese, and it said on the menu that it had this cheese on it, but nope it came out without any. After I added spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese (that came with the complimentary bread) and douses of salt and pepper, it was OK. The pasta did not taste homemade, I was very disappointed. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs: the spaghetti was cooked nicely, but there was barely any sauce, bland sauce, DRY meatballs. How could an Italian restaurant mess a staple like spaghetti and meatballs up so bad??? Like I mentioned earlier, J. Rocco is THE place to go for fresh amazing Italian food in Chicago. Never will I come back to Topo Gigio, which is a shame because it is right around the block from where I live and it could have become a regular. Looks like I'll be traveling further into the city to get some quality Italian dining."
"I'd go 2.5 stars if I could. The reason I'm going with two is that  I was genuinely let down after hearing so many good things for so long about Topo Gigio. Made the mistake of coming in on a Saturday night without reservations and was told it would be a minimum 1 hour wait. Apparently others had the same idea as there wasn't even standing room available in the bar full of well-off 30-somethings. Made a reservation for the next night and left the chaotic-but-inviting scene.Came back the next night full of anticipation. The food probably would earn 3 stars. The bread was good, though it's hard to not taste good dunked in olive oil and grated parm. Shared the grilled calamari to start which tasted just about on par with any other grilled calamari I've had anywhere else. For entrees, I had the spiedini adriatica, 3-4 medium-sized grilled shrimp & 3-4 smallish scallops served over a huge bed of boiled spinach. Just ok and not a ton of defining flavor besides very subtle hints of wine, lemon, and garlic. My wife had the veal Parmesan. Decent flavor on what basically amounts to tomato sauce and mozarella cheese, but nothing to write home about. Given some of the other glowing reviews,  I'm not sure if we just ordered poorly, but overall I've had better Italian at Carrabbas (a mid-priced Italian chain in the Outback Steakhouse family, for the uninitiated).The real letdown was the service. We were seated promptly with our reservation and then spent much of the rest of the night waiting. For water. For the main waiter to appear and offer a wine list. For him to come back and take the wine order. To bring the wine. To come back and take our food order. You get the idea. Not that I was in a hurry, but there's no reason 2 entrees and an appetizer needs to take 2 hours.I'd need a very compelling excuse to go back."
"This place doesn't deserve even a one star rating, th food is extremely bland and lacks any presentation. We ordered the risotto milanese and fusili vegetarian pasta., they took a good 25 minutes to serve it only to disappoint us further. This place should be avoided"
"Yum.  With already 168 reviews there probably isn't much new I can add, so I'll keep this short. The food was good, the service was slow but good, the restaurant was loud but not crowded.  Worth the wait for a table and the price."
"Would have been a 5 but we were seated close to the bar and didn't love the tv screens there. Not a big deal to me but my friend didn't love it.As for food, we had entrees and mine was absolutely outstanding. I had quarter chicken and Italian sausage with vegetables. A few more vegetarian options would be good!"
"This is such a classy joint, everyone who works there has been with the business for 15-20 years. Outstanding customer service! This is a great date place. Pasta dishes are creamy and delicious. Bread is fluffy, hot and flaky. The amount of detail is stellar and the drink menu is thoughtful."
My fiance and I both thought our pasta dishes were OK. The tiramisu was delicious though. Our server was very slow and not very attentive. OK experience.
"Amazing. I had the Petti di Pollo Alla Fiorentina and it was UNREAL. I moved to Chicago in July and this was the best meal I've had since I moved here. Our waiter was great, good service, we had reservations made the night before for a group of 8. Definitely coming back."
"This place makes me wanna move to Old Town! The first time I went it was after dinner so I only took a bite of the seafood spaghetti, which certainly left an impression because I've dying to go back ever since. Finally made it and got an entire plate of the seafood spaghetti to myself. Love the flavor of the sauce and the al dente pasta, only complaint was that the mussels weren't too fresh, but there was a generous amount of other seafood items (big scallops, clams, calamari). Friends got the squid ink pasta with shrimp, which was to-die-for because of the handmade pasta. The sauce was a tomato cream based sauce, so it got a bit too rich after a while. Felt like eating at your Italian friend's house, everyone there seemed to be having a great time. Prices were also very reasonable. Love it!"
"So, I look really stupid with this one....When my Mom and I get seated the waiter comes up with a nice thick accent and gets our drink order.  ""Wow"", I said, ""He's right off the boat"".  Noticing the decor, we see ""DeCecco"" pasta boxes, which happens to be my Mom's maiden name.  With great anticipation, we ask our Italian waiter how to pronounce it correctly in Italian. Ready for eloquence in the romantic Italian tongue he responds, ""I don't know, I'm Greek.""Well, ok then.....I said ""off the boat', but never said which one.The food and atmosphere were great. Service splendid.  Nice al dente pasta with big chunks of mozzarella cheese.  Pasta was perfectly sauced, which is a plus. So in the end, I definitely recommend this great Italian restaurant, that's now, not all Greek to me."
Pasta! Pasta! Pasta! Perfect place for a very SPECIAL dinner for two.
"This was on the verge of being 5 stars for me. I've heard some mixed reviews about this place and finally got the chance to try it. I had one of the best past dishes i've had in a long time ... it was the special - linguine with shrimp, scallops, clams, with a spicy diabolo sauce and it was out of this world. The only thing bringing the rating down was the appetizer I had which was the Antipasto which wasn't worth trying to explain or remember. Overall - good ambiance, lively scene, good staff, enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of Italian you'll be a fan of Topo"
"i was torn between giving this place two or three stars.i'm gonna have to go with two since i was really expecting this place to be outstanding after reading so many high rating reviews on here.i honestly was not impressed at all.maybe it was the dish i chose for dinner or the overall atmosphere of the place.i ordered the rigatoni and something with it just didn't taste right, yet my boyfriend got the tortellini and he loved it. (until he started to feel sick shortly after eating it) :-/pros : the service was really good, and the bread served at the beginning of the meal with the classic olive oil and cheese was delicious. our water glasses were never empty and prices are good for italian food in this area.cons: my boyfriend and i felt like they really over packed this place with tables, we understand a restaurants gotta do what a restaurants gotta do to pack the people in, yet we felt like we were in a maze trying to get out of this place! really overwhelming and uncomfortable atmosphere.the food wasn't as special as we hoped it would be. and, the icing on the cake was we both felt extremely sick after eating our meals. :/maybe we just hit this place on an off night?yet, we both agree we have experienced better italian in the city of Chicago."
"Good place and great ambiance.  The back patio is nice and has quite a few tables to sit at.  There's also a good sized inside and decent bar area.   The crowd on a Saturday night is mixed and features mostly 30+ year olds.  I was seated immediately with no wait on the Saturday that I went.  Clean inside and out.  Quick service.  The food was good, but portions are way too big for a normal sized human.  I understand value for your money, but I would rather see a smaller portion size for a bit less money than a giant portion for a bit more.  I had bow-tie pasta with salmon in a tomato cream sauce and it was very good, but very rich.  After 5 minutes or so of eating, I started getting real full.  At least I had a second meal for another day.  Prices were average for the type of restaurant.  I would definitely visit again."
Best Italian I have had...
Meeting friends at Topo Gigio-best spaghetti and meatballs in town.  Oh how I love them.  Probably gonna have some melon and prosciutto as along as the great wait staff tells me the melon is tasty today.This place never disappoints and the large portions make great leftovers too.  I can't wait to have some more deliciousness.
"I love me some good Italian and now I love me some Topo Gigio!I grabbed dinner here before Second City on Tuesday night and wasn't sure what to expect.  The restaurant was open and airy inside and the patrons ranged from young professionals to families to big groups.  I guess I always assumed the place was a bit more upscale considering the location, but it was a perfect fit for just about anyone.We started out with the antipasto freddo for an appetizer and kept our hands full of the bread that was offered.  While the appetizer was great, it was entirely too much for a starter.  I usually think of appetizers as little finger foods, nibblers, an order of 5 mozzarella sticks, what have you.  The plate for this was piled with meats, cheese, vegetables, you name it... clearly could have been enough for at least 4 people and then some.   For dinner I ordered the Conchiglie alla Sarda, which is seashell pasta in with ground sausage and peas in a tomato-cream sauce.  The plate was deceiving - it didn't look that big but I found trouble getting through half the dish!  They didn't skimp one bit on the sausage and the sauce was spectacular.  It was so good, in fact, 3 of the 4 people at the table next to me ordered it (I saw you all looking and oggling, by the way ;).Because of the Old Town location, I was expecting it to be a little more ""Old Town Pricey"" but it was fairly cheap all things considered.  A huge appetizer, 1/2 liter of wine, two dinners and 2 desserts ran just shy of $100 tip included.  Even better was that I had at least half of my plate leftover and it made for a very jealous Lunch Bunch the next day at work :)"
"I enjoy a good Italian dinner and while this place is nicely done, very welcoming, the food was less than impressive. The service was also forced and scripted in trying to make it feel like an authentic Italian restaurant. There were a couple of options for vegetarians, but really, while the 3 of us ordered different dishes, they come out tasting almost the same except that mine had cauliflower and broccoli, my one friend has cheese and the third one had spinach and peas. Somehow, they all came out with the same pasta too even though the menu description was different - seemed as if the chef couldn't be bothered preparing 3 dishes and just tossed them all in the same pan and then diversified the veggies he added to each..!!Really, with so many excellent Italian options in Chicago, this place is quite easily forgettable."
"Ok, now I really don't like giving low reviews and I always try to look at the best things about a restaurant, but when I feel the the customer service is bad then I must speak up. I went here one evening to order some(what I thought would be) amazing pasta, but turned out to be very disappointing. I was a little indecisive on what I wanted to order,so I decided to rely on the waiter to help me out.  I politely asked the waiter what he would recommend and he gave me an attitude like I was getting on his nerves. He suggested the TORTELLINI alla PANNA which I was not a fan of and he took forever to give us water.When the food finally came, he slammed the plate down on the table...wow someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.After dinner I still gave a tip of 15% which I feel was still too generous. I normally give 20% if the service is good, but bottom line... I will not be going back."
"Topo Gigio is probably one of the best italian spots in Chicago!  I've been 5-6 times, always my go to when friends are in town for some good italiano! Ambience is great, good for anything from a girls night out, to a date, or friends grabbing dinner.  Reasonably priced for the portions and quality of food."
This is my neighborhood Italian restaurant. I always order the same thing SPAGHETTI ai FRUTTI di MARE.  The meatballs are good too!
"Overall the experience we had was fine, but not great.  I did not find the hostesses to be very friendly, although they were to the ""regulars"".  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful with getting our check paid quickly. I had the frutti de mare and though the scallops were tender and good, the calamari was rubbery.  My wife had the mushroom tortellini and thought it was good.  I will say that the prices are very reasonable, and they provide a healthy pour when ordering a glass of wine or a cocktail."
"The food here is consistently very very good.  I've been here a few times, but last time -  I had the risotto with filet mignon and it was perfect.  The beef was cooked really well, and there was actually a huge portion of it (though the filet mignon dinner itself was a lot more expensive)  The risotto was good - but a little more hard/crunchy than I prefer.  Regardless, I still had to stop myself from eating the entire portion because it was probably 1500 calories.  Everything my friends got also looked really good, and they were all happy with what they had.  I've never had a bad meal here.The only weird / negative is the hostess seemed sort of clueless & rude about not knowing where my party was.  I asked her if my friends had arrived or if they were seated (by the reservation name and by describing them in detail) and she said ""I see a lot of faces - I don't know.""   Ok...well, what about the name?  She said she had the name, but it was for a different party size - and she's was not sure if they were seated.  Huh?  Am I in a Seinfeld episode  (the one with the car reservation)?  Isn't this your entire job?  I don't know if she was a temporary person filling in for a normal host - but that was just weird.  She gave my friend the same ""I see a lot of faces"" line too.  Ok, if you have prosopagnosia (legitimate disorder where you can't recognize faces) - then just (a) seat us all when the full party is here or (b) remember the location of the table where you put people - based on the name on the reservation."
"Definitely a pleasant surprise - let me start off with that.I mean, typically, I don't like to eat at places that are named after rodents, but having to carbo-load on the night before the marathon in the city left few options.Our server was a little frazzled, the Diet Coke tasted funky, but other than that, I actually found the food to be delicious. Fusilli Topo Gigio was the big hit, but everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.I can definitely see how when the weather is nice, their outdoor patio/bar area would definitely be an area hot-spot. Anyhow, wish we could get this Old Town goodie in the Gold Coast :-("
"I met three Chicago friends there. Even though some were a bit late, they held a table and even partially seated us. The food was amazing! I had the clams ""Vic Damone"" and it was excellent. Lots of baby clams and perfectly balanced white wine sauce with tiny tomatoes. Our server was excellent and they keep everything moving without a sense of being rushed."
This place is excellent.  Food is excellent and service is excellent too! The pasta was really yummy - and the waiter was also helpful in his recommendation. I would love to come back to this restaurant! Also great ambiance for a date.
"Topo was alright for taking my 84yr old g-ma out for mother's day.  Nothing spectacular.  Nothing horrendous.  It was crowded at 6pm, which was surprising.  Service was pretty good, and the veal dish I ordered was so-so.  Lemon/caper sauce was pretty much the only flavor there.  For what it was, Topo was kind of overpriced.  Typical for this stretch of Wells.  It had been 10 years since I'd been to Topo, and for my money there are better Italian restaurants in this great city.  Maybe I'll try Topo in another 10..."
We were informed that we could not have an outside table for four on a Saturday Bc our party was two adults and an infant in a stroller.  Apparently they would rather have empty tables than three patronsSimply Pathetic. Went down the street and were accommodated.  A sleeping 4mo old infant is hardly a reason to turn away businessNote. This was 530pm and there were many EMPTY tables
"Total embarrassment. My husband and I had company in town from DC. It was their first visit to Chicago. One of the request they had made was to have dinner at a delicious Italian spot. This could be a slightly overwhelming task given that Chicago has many Italian restaurants to choose from. I figured I couldn't go wrong if I narrowed down the options to places I had tried before. Unfortunately, that couldn't be further from the truth. We arrived about 5 minutes early for our 6PM reservation. There was a woman sitting at the bar outside with another gentleman. I didn't think much of her as I walked past and made my way to the front door of the restaurant. She then spoke out loudly and said, ""Can I help you! Unless, you want to sit inside."" I thought this was an odd greeting - not the friendliest way to be approached. I then told her we had a 6 o'clock reservation for 4, but I wasn't sure if my husband was already there. She then said, ""Well you can go in and check."" The three of us went in and spoke to the hostess working inside. I told her we were looking to see if my husband had arrived and mentioned our reservation. She said that he hadn't arrived and then asked if we'd like to sit inside or out. I looked at my guests and they suggested outside. This hostess was very friendly. She collected four menus and began to walk us to a table out on the sidewalk. As she passed the bar the woman with dark brown hair that had yelled out to us before entering, popped up from her bar stool, at the bar and grabbed the menus from the hostess hand. She said I've spoken to them once, but they wanted inside. I can seat them! Why is this woman being so blatantly rude to us. We never specified to her if we wanted inside or outside we were looking for my husband! She slaps down the four menus and storms off. Back to her bar stool no doubt! The waiter immediately comes over and says, ""What would you like to drink?"" I appreciate his promptness, but I tell him that we've just been seated and haven't looked over the wine list - I order four waters for the table. My guests were still in shock over our welcoming to the restaurant. My husband arrives not even a minute later. He sits down his bag and asks if we've been waiting long and here the waiter is again. It's be less than a minute total. He asks his same question, ""What would you like to drink?"" My husband then states that he just sat down. He'd like to look at the wine list - could we have a minute. The waiter breathes heavily and then walks away. Our guests are now just looking at us with raised eyebrows. I am sure they were thinking - Seriously, is this the best Italian place Chicago has to offer. At this point the staff (other than the brief encounter with the inside hostess) has been very irritated with us as patrons and it's been far more than obvious. The restaurant was not crowded. It was early. We had a reservation and there were plenty of open tables - so why the rush from the waiter. Well, apparently the waiter thought he would do the exact opposite this time and not come back by our table at all! He literally had to walk past our table 6 times to serve other tables sitting close to ours, but never checked back once. By this point, we had made our drink selections, our appetizer and our dinner choices and still he refused to come back by our table. I was so embarrassed! Really, was this the place that I had selected. Is this the impression that will stick with our friends when they think of Italian in Chicago. What a let down! Finally, it got to the point where one of our guest apologized to us, but she was going to flag him down. She raised her hand in the air and nodded her head. He came to the table and said, ""You don't have to flag me! I've been ready, you were the ones that were not ready."" WHAT! Is he serious? I felt like getting up and walking out. There are tons of restaurants in this city - we don't have to be eating here. We chose to come here. We can just as easily choose to leave. This is absurd. I just stared at him. I was totally blown away. We ordered our wine and our appetizers. He came back with appetizer plates. He quickly and sloppily placed them on the table almost knocking over my water and basically stacking the new plate on my already dirty bread plate. Unfortunately, his behavior and that of the hostess (if that's what you even want to call her) began to dominate our total experience. We couldn't even enjoy being out with our friends who we see maybe once or twice a year. I was just really sorry I ever selected Topo Gigio in the first place. This was not at all like our first experience. The food was good, nothing that I couldn't find elsewhere. And certainly nothing so amazing that I would ever subject myself or my guest to such ridiculous and harsh treatment for. Never again!"
"My husband and I came here randomly to load up on carbs the night  before a race and we LOVED everything about this restaurant! The service was the best, given that the place was packed and the food was sooo good. When they are busy, it does get pretty packed, but I think they try to make up with the service.Every time we are in Old Town, we have to stop in and get some good Italian!I ordered one of the specials my last visit, the black ink linguine with a red sauce, and I was very impressed. We love this place and love coming back!"
Hands down the best Italian restaurant in the Old Town! One of my favorites. Every entree is delicious and fresh. My go to place when family or friends are visiting. Definitely recommend!
"Discovered this place walking by seeing how jammed packed it was. Jammed pack must mean something right? We wanted to get in some of this.....1 hr wait? OK!We decided to wait at the bar and upon arrival to the ""outside"" room..... just our luck, 2 seats opened up so we were immediately invited to sit by the bartender, Luca. Quickly after greeting us, he had the place set up all nice, lined the counter with cloth napkin and made it NICE for us to dine at the bar. Tried their Malbec and it didnt suit well so we got a bottle of Reisling. ~$28Carpaccio alla Piemontese $9.95- Paper thin was described right...never had filet mignon this thin in my life. The sweet gentleman next to me rec' the eggplant parmasean  $13.95,  saying it's so good he has to have it every 2 weeks or so.....so the Mr. had that.I had the bartender's recommendation, the Conchiglie alla Sarda, $13.95. Only thing I would have changed is to sub it with longer noodle. Im not enthusiastic over short pasta and almost always want longer pastas. I had a great meal with great company with great service at the Bar. This, I would have to say, is the best (meal) experience I had in Chicago."
"I have a friend who will not leave a six block radius of her downtown apartment. Exhausted with the prospect that I might have to get on either two buses, or a train and a bus, and then likely spend money to cab home, she agreed to meet ""in the middle"". Because her idea of north Chicago does not exceed 1500 north, we settled on Topo Gigio. I've been here before and while they don't offer the traditional plain Italian plates I wish they would (gnocci and fettuccine alfredo) they have more than a few mouth-watering options from which to choose.I went with the pasta with grilled shrimp in a light pesto sauce. And boy was it amazing! I think I definitely ordered the best dish at the table. The shrimp were huge, so I did not feel ripped off with the tiniest of shrimpies in my food. On the contrary, they were nice and plump and seasoned to perfection. The pesto sauce was awesome; not to heavy, which was perfect for a beautiful Spring evening.They keep the bread coming, which is always awesome. In fact, I filled up so much on carbs in the beginning of the evening, that I was only able to consume 1/2 of my dinner. But that was OK, because I took the rest home and ate it for lunch. It was just as good heated up as it was served fresh in the restaurant.They have a nice selection of wines as well. I went with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, which I heartily enjoyed. I didn't think the wines were too pricey either.The ambiance here is very quaint and charming. We chose this place also because we knew that had outdoor patio seating. There were three of us and we only had to wait a short 15 minutes to be seated outdoors. Our waiter was as friendly as could be. The food, excellent and the wine list pretty extensive. I hope to be back on another beautiful summer evening."
"With an Italian restaurant on every corner these days, if you want my business you're going to have to bring it.  Topo Gigio did just that.  Awesome food.  Awesome atmosphere. Awesome service.  Awesome prices.  HUGE portions made of extremely fresh ingredients.  I'd drive 50 miles to eat here."
"This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to here in the US. Coming from someone who grew up in Europe, this says a lot. I have eaten here twice and love their dishes. Definitely not your typical Americanized and bland food. Their wine selection is great, as well. I love the atmosphere but it gets super crowded, they really try to squeeze in as many people as possible and it can get somewhat ""tight."" Service is average. Also, even though I made a reservation a MONTH in advance, they did not have my name on the list. The hostess said that she would ""give me the benefit of the doubt"" and tried to seat us right away, which she actually did (Another group was late, so we got their spot) I was a little put off by her comment since I DID make the reservation and they were the ones who messed up. But my wrath was tamed when they accommodated us so quickly. Throughout our dining experiences, it was somewhat hard to get wait staff's attention.Bottom line, I like this place a lot and will make it my go-to spot and highly recommend it unless you suffer from claustrophobia."
"Great place... A solid 3.. but the martinis are served in small glasses and the bread is meh..... Can't go wrong with this place for  solid italian food... Unfortunately, I have been spoiled by NYC Italian...."
Tight squeeze but amazing food and service. Felt like one big Italian family in a dining room!
"I used to think Topo Gigio had some of the best Italian food in Chicago. I still think the food is good, but I will not be going back... EVER again. I live out of state, but usually make it a point to order from them when I visit. For the second time, when ordering take out, the person taking my order was incredibly short, rude, and frankly insulting. In asking simple questions to understand the portion size and if something had an ingredient (that I am allergic to), the amount of sass back was both unhelpful, and made me feel like an idiot.I can overlook a busy staff member taking a carry out order (though it was Sunday night and not exactly rush hour). But when we got there, the 3rd class treatment just continued. We had to wait 2 times as long for our food as we were told. No one acknowledged it, not a simple 'sorry for the wait' or 'thank you for your patience.' Nothing.  After a while still waiting, we take care of the bill so we can speed up the process of leaving once we get our food.Then, I look  up to see the 2 people in front - both adult women (not teenage hosts). I overhear the one woman say to the other ""what they didn't even tip you?"" And the other woman (who was middle aged)  goes, ""I know, can you believe people like that? How tacky!"". They start laughing like little school girls, and they look up to see - me looking at them shocked.  It was so obviously about us (we did not tip on our take out bill). Rather than apologize or say anything at all, they literally ran away like bullies on a playground. It was shocking, rude, and pathetic.  A few minutes later one of them came back with our food - again didn't say anything about their unbelievable remark, didn't say thank you for waiting, NOTHING.  By the way - even if you have to complain about a customer.. dude, you're in the SERVICE industry. Use your brain and talk smack in the back - NOT in front of a damn customer you idiots.Now to circle back to the no tip.. During our wait, no one offered us a seat or something to drink - as is customary for most restaurants while you wait (even a restaurant far more casual than this one does so). And by the way - these easy and little courtesies are what warrants a tip for take out. A tip should not be expected- its a reward for good service. And its take out! I'm not sure if we looked young and not worth their time, if they thought we were not rich customers, or frankly another profiling issue (hate to say it, but...) - but it was incredibly rude. The best part is that when we got home, I was already seething about how awful the entire service experience had been. But I cooled down as I thought about the fact that the food will be reallyg good. Well, I clearly gave them too much credit. I opened  1 entree - MEAT all over it. Another entree- MEAT all over it. We clearly told the people on the phone that we were vegetarian and ordered everything without meat. We literally had to throw out our dinner.  After having my fill of absolute BS with this place- i called to talk to the manager. In my most polite and professional way, I told the manager (who could have been one of the giggling school girls for all I know) that I have always been a loyal customer, but was really disappointed with my experience. I told her an overview of the whole thing... and she didn't even offer to refund our meals, offer us a future meal comp, or a freakin free drink. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.   Is this how you retain clientele? I'm in customer services and sales myself, and i'll tell you a basic idea Topo - you catch a lot more flies with honey than vinegar.  Trust.Bottom Line: Topo Gigio - you may be an old money restaurant... but you have NO CLASS."
"I really enjoyed the food here! We sat at the bar in the outside portion of the restaurant. It was December so they had a nice tent set up. Food was tasty. Wine was even better. Plus, I love Old Town. Perfect scene for a date night!"
"I was not originally intending to try this restaurant out, but due to a private party at the resturant of choice my friends and I stumbled across Togo Gigio. Overall my experience was mediocre. The server seemed annoyed that we took awhile to order and once we did he seemed to disappear for the remainder of the dinner never asking how the meal was and only bringing the check at the end. The bus staff was excellent as I never had a dirty dish or an empty water the entire 2 hrs. I would avoid ordering the antipasto as I have had much better. My dinner entree and wine were delicious, but overall I probably won't be back."
"I dont really venture to this neighborhood so wandering around trying to find a place to eat my friend and I decided to give this place a shot.  We were early so there wasnt a wait (thank goodness because we were hungry lol) so we were seated immediatly.  Just the decor itself was kinda dark but pretty cozy.  For some reason we thought the portions were gonna be small so we went overboard on the bread but you get a nice amount of food for the price! I must also say that the staff were great, you will never go thirsty, and our server was such a gentleman!"
"Thank you yelpers for yelping this place, cuz if you didn't I would probably still be starving or drinking more ETOH.It was Saturday evening and I was really craving some Italian food. I am from Californ-IA represent Los Angles. So I have a had my share of Italian food and a couple visits to Italy. I was so excited to get down with shy town. Unfortunately, I was let down. MAYBE it was me but my spaghetti/meatballs was no good. WHY? 1st of all the pasta was came from a BOX. Even the decor when you look at the walls you saw tons of  boxes on the wall, maybe at that point I should of settled for some giovanni's pizza. The meatballs were bland as water, but the brightside the meat sauce was decent - the savior of the dish I would say. My buddy got CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA which they recommended as one of their signature dish- that was OK. **There minestrone soup was bomb FYIRecommendations: AmbianceDecor - great, service- super, price range $10-30. FOOD - try there pumpkin raviolli - thats what all the yelpers recommend- Should of listen to them"
The food is AMAZING! The staff is wonderful!
"Went there for dinner tonight and was turned off by the rude service. When my friend sent her food back, because it had no taste at all...I even tasted it and it was bland, the waiter was very rude and acted like he was being disrespected. Then, as we walked out, he mean mugged her...lol.Oh and Topo Gigio...you just got YELPED!"
"Topo Gigio is still my go-to date venue.  Why?  Because it's relaxed, lively, fun, festive and just the right noise level for private conversation without having to scream. If you need to get warmed up a bit beforehand, Topo has that cool ancillary outside bar with the heaters and the awning.  You can have a drink and get a bit toasty (literally and figuratively) and cozy there while you wait.  It's perfect.  However, if you're more than six feet tall, you might want to keep your head down near the heater or you could be singed.  You only want your date to singe you.  She will.  You're welcome, chief.  And the book will be out soon.The menu at Topo never does seem to change, which is fine by me.  I only ever order the simple pasta dishes anyway - spaghetti and meatballs or rigatoni.  Boring.  Many dishes contain seafood, which I just don't eat.  Snicker.  So it's always the old stand bys at the old stand by.Topo Gigio.  Great date spot.  Great side bar.  Great facilitator.  Always guaranteed to get your blood racing and your cheeks flushed.Forever more, it's five stars."
Hands down the best most amazing food ever. I had the penne alla vodka. cute warm welcoming atmosphere. The food was delicious. I had the lemon sorbet for dessert was also good. i would definitely and will definitely come back again for more deliciousness.
"My experience with this restaurant was outstanding.  My friend and I arrived without reservations on a busy Friday night and the hostess found us a table within minutes.  The wine, my meal and the service were all amazing!  I can't wait to go back!I ordered the grouper special with spinach and new potatoes and it was fresh, light and delicious!  I ordered a glass of shiraz to make it a perfect meal.  Our waiter was friendly and not pushy and the low buzz of the restaurant and lighting made it the perfect Firday night after a hectic week.  This place is what a restaurant should be!  The only way it could have been better is if I was able  to order a dessert....will do so next time.  The tiramisu I must have!"
"I am from out of town (Philadelphia.) This restaurant had AMAZING FOOD. It had the most affordable drinks of anywhere we went in Chicago (granted, we only went to nice places.) The tortelli made my taste buds want to learn to sing in gratitude.Plus, it was around the corner from second city.I can't remember the last time my fiance and I had such a wonderful, FUN, relaxing night. The people were even friendly at this place, and a local struck up a conversation with us which was a welcome, fun surprise."
"This place has a beautiful outdoors area - even in the winter. The fiance and I went here last winter and really enjoyed that you could be seated outside and it was heated. I loved being able to feel like I was on a lit-up outdoor porch in the winter time! So refreshing. The service was great and the food was very good. Wine selection was decent, but nothing to rave about. I love it when a restaurant takes the time to bring you warm bread instead of a cold hunk that has been sitting back in the kitchen since earlier that morning (or the morning before). It always sets the mood for the rest of the meal, so this left me ready for the main course! All of the food was cooked by a chef who clearly knew his way around Italian food - it left me very full and wanting to return to try everything on the menu. We didn't get any apps or dessert as we were (as always) running late for a show. The waitress was very nice about it. When we sat down, I let her know that we were on a slightly tight schedule, but still wanted to enjoy our meal. She handled it perfectly - clearing our plates right we were clearly finished and bringing our check immediately out. I will hopefully make it back here. Maybe in the summer or fall so I can *actually* sit outside instead of ""outside"" this time."
"Therese is the rudest reservationist ever.  She told me that my reservation was ""THE choice reservation - take it or leave it"".  I will never dine here or refer anyone else to.  One day this restaurant will be on one of those reality TV shows about failing restaurants with the stance that they just don't understand what happende...."
"After running all over town trying to show my parents a great Italian dinner, i finally tried my own fave, topo gigio. Food, service, everything awesome. This is now my fams favorite place...  Linguine vongole is amazing. Followed by simple perfect spumoni that was so incredible!"
I am Italian and this is by far the BEST Italian in the city! My Dad is from Italy and when he and my Mom visit this is our dinner spot. My favorites are the Conchile alla Sarda and the Frutti de Mare with tomato cream sauce. My husband loves the black linguini and the ossobuco which are frequent specials. Yummy!!!!!
"Topo Gigio is the most overrated restaurant in Chicago. I went in with high expectations but was unfortunately let down on every traditional restaurant criterion. Food was alright, ambience was pleasant, but the service was completely unacceptable. Our server was extremely disengaged and after having to raise concerns about the service we were treated very rude for the rest of the evening. If you're looking for good Italian food in Chicago, please try one of the quality Italian restaurants before resorting to Topo Gigio."
"Memorial Day weekend - Sunday: We went for a short walk and passed by Topo Gigio.  We were not planning to eat out, but we could not resist.We got a table for two outside and, for an hour and twenty minutes, we were transported to Italy.  This is the 3rd or 4th time we went to Topo Gigio and everytime we had a good time and enjoyed the food and wine. I had the Spagetti with Frutti di Mare in red sauce, Italian Merlot wine and Tartuffo for desert.Five stars is not enough to descrive this experience!  Grazie Mille!"
"True Story..... I had a dream last night about spaghetti arrabiata with a touch of cream and peas.....this food fantasy was so powerful that I woke up at 3:30am contemplating if I....A) should get up and make it.....B) had all the ingredients to do so....or C) could get that exact dish somewhere for lunch. I went with C.....which brought me to Topo for lunch today and I would like to thank them for making my pasta dream into a perfect reality!! It was literally like my dream had come to life....of course I was a little worried that it would not be as perfect as my dream version....but I told them exactly what I wanted and presto-chango alakazam there it was right in front of me.....a steaming hot plate of perfectly cooked pasta dancing in a spicy red sauce with just a touch of cream and little green peas dotting the landscape....swoon! Seriously, I don't think I've ever been that happy about a pasta dish in my life! My gf that I lunched with got the Joe's salad which is also a favorite of mine.....it's got everything....endive, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, onions, roasted red peppers, walnuts, capers, raisins, a couple of different kinds of cheese....and I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of things....but at the end of the day it is delicious....and with the removal of the cheese my vegan friend was in salad heaven. I've eaten at Topo tons of times in my 16+ years living in Chicago.....the food is always top notch.....some of the best Italian in the city.....and they are always on top of their game service-wise...extra nice, friendly and professional....extra points for being less than 2 blocks away from my house."
"My girlfriend and I were only in town for two nights while I went to an interview in the city. We found the reviews and decided that Topo was a good restaurant to try. We both love Italian, it was an easy pick. We went on wednesday night and didn't have reservations. The front bar was a little confusing. We clearly looked lost, and no one pulled us in. Once we found our way to the hostess things got better. We were seated right away with no wait, even though the place was packed. Our server was to the table quick with bread and oil, and was very friendly. The food came quick and it was incredible! Well cooked, great portions. The atmosphere was nice, and not too loud. warm lighting and candles. We had wine and the Tiramisu for dessert. Another great pick. We hung out for a while toward closing time and didn't feel rushed. When it was all said and done, we had dinner, wine and dessert for $65 total. I couldn't have asked for a better experience from a place we stumbled upon. Fingers crossed for this job, just so we can eat here again."
"I really like this restaurant.  Everything I have tried there has been very solid.  The   service is wonderful and they always remember you and treat you like family.  It's a bit hard getting in on summer weekends, but well worth it."
"This is solid Italian restaurant in an elegant part of town. After a weekend of eating and drinking, we were so happy to find this warm, bustling, family style Italian spot. It was nice, but comfortable. I appreciated that there were many Italians there....always a good sign. Perfect martins and a great pasta."
Awesome linguine pesto!!!
"Topo Gigio is definitely my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago.  The food is excellent and the service is always great.  I love coming here in the summer and sitting outside on the street and people watching while eating.  The actual inside of the restaurant is cozy and cute so that's a good option too.  The serving sizes are huge so I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.  The prices are very reasonable for such amazing food.  I would recommend making a reservation as this place tends to be busy on Friday & Saturday nights, I've never been on any other night so I can't speak for the weekdays, but this place is very popular!"
"Great food.  Great service.  So damn loud it felt like a rock concert.  Do I really need to hear the 50-year old single guy (sporting the Robert Graham shirt) loudly convince his married friends (well himself really) that he is still awesome and desirable?  Nah, not really.  Did he really need to be screaming from the table next to us?  Definitely not.  Make reservations. Ask for a table in the corner.  The food is definitely worth it."
"This is the best restaurant around. The CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA is so yummy (I'm not a big pork eater, so I sub chicken). Also, best SPAGHETTI con le POLPETTE (spaghetti and meatballs) I've EVER had.  Boyfriend loves POLLO ARROSTO al ROSMARINO (rosemary chicken).  Wine is reasonably priced, and a pretty good selection.  I've had a great $37 pinot grigio and a yummy $33 pinot noir there. The waitstaff is incredible. They don't talk to you while you're eating. They love the menu. They're attentive.  I think I could eat here once a week and not get sick of it.  I'm lucky it's so close to home, but I have a feeling I'll be coming back here often even when it's not!"
"Delicious, very friendly service, not too loud.Perfect for both a date or a group."
I love everything about this place! One of the best things on the menu is the Tortellini Alla Panna. Portions are very large though. It's always nice to grab some wine at the bar and visit with Rudy as well.
"Went here last night with the bf. We ordered a caprese salad, rigatoni and a chicken dish. Overall it was really good and huge portions! We each had a glass of wine as well. I really enjoyed my wine but he wasn't as into his, such a wine snob he is :) I loved the outside seating and will definitely be going back if I'm in Old Town and have a craving for Italian food."
"I was in Chicago for a trade show and had a group dinner at Topo Gigio. First of all, I'm not old enough to remember the mouse but by the time I left, I had the infamous tee w/ mouse in his striped shirt. For starters we ordered quite a bit of appetizers. They were delicious, but I didn't want to fill up on appetizers since I didn't have a fridge in my hotel room. For dinner, I had the CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA  which is Seashell Pasta in A Tomato-Cream Sauce with Ground Sausage, Peas and Pecorino Cheese. It was absolutely delish! I tried my best to eat the entire meal but I just couldn't finish this never-ending bowl of pasta.One of my co-workers had the SPIEDINI ADRIATICA  which was Grilled Scampi & Sea Scallops on a Skewer, Served on a Bed of Spinach in Garlic & Oil. First of all, the scallops must have been the biggest scallop I've ever seen and it was grilled to perfection. My next trip to Chicago, I'm definitely visiting Topo Gigio and might even where my tee!"
"overall it was good, I had the special veal chop. Only big complaint is that the parm cheese they put on the table was sooooo salty."
"Molto Bene in Old Town!It's so exciting to come across an Italian restaurant like this! The service, first rate! Ate at the bar - Tony was awesome! Fast, funny, professional, friendly.  I could live here every night, but alas, my home is DC.  I had the CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA  pasta, which could feed a hungry family of 4...I like that!  Another meal for later!  Too full for meat entree, but I tastedthe Veal Saltimbocca that my friend had, and it melted in my mouth.Tony kept the conversation and the wine going - just a great place."
"Great food, great mood. But, the tables are pretty jammed each other.Service was very kind and friendly, and the bread they offered before the meal was tasty and warm. :)"
"Great service; well prepared food, delicious, simple Italian at a reasonable price. Appetizers are good size, main dishes are huge. We sat in the outside  back patio on a fabulous perfect night. We will definitely return when in the neighborhood."
"This place is absolutely delicious! Topo Giogio is my boyfriends favorite Italian restaurant and he took me there this past weekend. OMG, it is so delicious! They paired Risotto with pieces of filet mignon and it was absolutely perfect! Aside from the amazing meal, the ambiance is charming and the price was really reasonable! Highly recommend!"
"I just moved into the neighborhood and this was one of the first places I tried.  The first time was for lunch, which was a quiet atmosphere and very relaxing.  The second time I took 5 other friends here on a weekend night.  Luckily, we made reservations because it was packed, but we only had to wait 5 minutes for our table. So, here's a breakdown of what I thought:Food:  Very good (although not out of this world)Atmosphere: Fun and loud during dinner; quiet and chill at lunchService:  Good service both timesPrice: Typical pricesDessert:  LOVE THE TIRAMASU (the one reason I will continue to go back)"
"While I was brought here on a date by an Italian man whose family has been coming here for years, I wouldn't exactly say that this is a date-friendly place. Intimate, authentic, rustic little Italian place but also very loud-all the things Italian that I just love. Food was amazing and out of this world. I had the special for that night which was the Mahi Mahi special with asparagus and mash. Everything was cooked to perfection. For being in Old Town, I thought most items were appropriately priced. Not the best cannoli I've ever had but got the job done."
"Used to live up near here and hadn't been in a while so I said to myself ""Self... it's time to revisit the old hood.  Hey Nostalgia, what's up?""  Seeing that it's been nice out (in your FACE fall) lately, I decided to do some outdoor awesomeness.  It was pretty packed so I settled for indoors.I'm an avid fried calamari eater, I will say it was pretty good.  This is the end of my happy portion of my review.  There's no going back after this, folks.And now, how I really feel about my visit.  I sat forever without water or even much as a glance from our server.  I was parched, to say the least.  I'm not sure if I got the same server as a previous yelper here but what on earth is going on there?? I felt like I was on some sort of Howie Mandel candid camera show in regards to customer service.  So in short... well not really b/c I've been ranting, but all in all I shall not return.  Food....good.  Service... scary."
"When it comes to Italian restaurants I have two simple requirements:  big flavor and al dente pasta.  Unfortunately there are many Italian restaurants that fall short on the  basics.  Topo Gigio, however, is not one of them.I had the veggie pasta w/seasonal vegetables in a tomato sauce.  It was such a simple dish, yet the flavor was unbelievable.  The pasta was al dente -- yea!  The veggies were blanched perfectly, delivering a welcomed crunch in each bite.  And the vegetables themselves were refreshing:  broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, peapods, carrots and peas.  I'm not a fan of peas, but I ate every last one of them.  The portion was huge so I took half home.For dessert I had a cannoli and cappuccino.  The cannoli filling was so creamy, so light and oh so decadent.  The cappuccino was very good too.The only downside to my experience was the rude service.  Service was efficient once we ordered, but our waiter took about 25 minutes to come by to take our order.  We had to flag him down and he made it obvious that we interrupted his flow.  Also, I requested my cappuccino with skim milk.  He rolled his eyes at me and in a very rude tone stated that they only use 2% or whole milk.  Needless to say my friend did not request the soy milk she wanted.  Lastly, my friend and I split the tab with a credit card from each of us.  We asked the waiter to split the bill evenly on the cards.  He was clearly upset by our request and muttered something under his breath that I didn't catch because it was so loud in there.  Despite the rude service I will be back.  Hopefully I can get a table on the patio before winter sets in."
Absolutely incredible pasta. Wonderful ambiance. I am going to be lusting over their FARFALLE ai DUE SALMONI for years to come. Unforgettable culinary experience!
Topo is great. The food is good. The only drawback is it gets loud and crazy busy. If its too nuts there then pop across the street to Trattoria Roma.
"Topo Gigio is a personal favorite of mine in the old town hood. The patio (open year-round...nice tough) is a great place to relax and enjoy the warm weather (or heat lamps depending on the season). It's one of those spots that you get what you pay for so I have no issue paying a few extra bucks to get pasta here than I would elsewhere (truthfully it is priced pretty fairly in comparison to it's Italian brethren throughout the city...that comment was for the Olive Garden public...you know who you are...the breadsticks are not good stop lying to yourself). The staff is very nice and is always willing to aid an amateur wine fan such as myself on choices to make me look like I know what I'm doing in front of the ladies. Tip: The sausage and peppers is terrific but not a good pick on a date. Even though it is an Italian establishment, there is a cutoff point for garlic on the first few dates."
"Topo Gigio is one of those restaurants that has made me happy since I was a little kid.  Great, flavorful italian pasta dishes and warm ambiance mean you can't go wrong.  And in the summer I love their outdoor seating."
"Went in on a busy night not expecting much, but were seated right away at a great table. Right next to the ""Yelp Loves Us"" window sticker. I should have removed it. The follow-up email thread with the manager should be a sufficient explanation, ooh, and the reason we had to leave suddenly? Our appetizer made my husband explode.  Also note that my husband ordered one of the more expensive entrees and we mistakenly received the cheapest entree....see how helpful their management staff is when trying to correct something.....Something about the ""Let me speak with the owner"" you'll see below made me think that this email thread would show up here....still haven't heard ANYTHING back.The start of it all, April 19, 2010:Message: Greetings Topo Gigio,We tried the restaurant for the first time last night.Unfortunately my husband wasn't feeling well during our salads and drinks, so we needed to get our entrees to go.We did not get the right order - my husband ordered the TORTELLINI alla PANNA, and we received a red sauce with spaghetti noodles.Would you please help us fix this? I have photos of the wrong entree, ifthat would help.We would love to try you again soon.Response:I am sorry to hear that.

Nothing about the restaurant, invisible waiter, nor experience would ever bring me back....funny how my 1-star reviews always show up at Yelp events though....Johnny T., this is definitely one to avoid."
Excellent pasta dishes in a nice outdoor setting
"Topo Gigio. I want to like you. I really, really do, but you've just come up leaving me unsatisfied. Twice. Last night I gave Topo a second chance while meeting up with a friend to catch up over dinner. The atmosphere is nice (albeit loud) and a very traditional and typical Italian feel. I arrived a little early for a 6:30 reservation, so I asked to be seated at the table to look over the menu. After mulling over the menu I had picked out what I wanted to eat once my friend showed up. I'll break the meal down as follows:The wait staff: Can I say ruuuuuuuuude? Sure, the Italian accents are charming, but when we have to ask what the daily specials are which prompts an eye roll before starting to list them? The wait staff didn't even ask how the food was, let alone any sort of interaction.The bread/olive oil: I normally base how the food will be on the bread and olive oil that is served up before the meal. The olive oil lacked any sort of flavor or spice. It was simply olive oil, and it didn't even taste like EVOO. It was nice that they had Parmesan cheese readily available on the table, but when mixed with the olive oil and salt/pepper, it left something to be desired. As for the bread, it was cold upon arrival, and there was nothing to it. Meh, not a fan.The entree: I chose the ""Petti di Pollo alla Valdostana "" which is a breast of chicken stuffed with fontina Cheese,prosciutto cotto and spinach and then baked with sun dried tomatoes and porcini mushrooms sauce. This dish sounded savory and amazing, and with the 30 minute bake time, I was excited to try the dish! Upon arrival, the stuffed chicken showed up swimming in a cream based cheese sauce? It visually reminded me of lobster bisque, which was a little off putting. The stuffed chicken tasted great in and of itself, but the sauce that it was drowning in crowded out a lot of the flavor that the chicken had. Overall I wasn't that impressed, especially for a $17 entree.The dessert: Perhaps this is the only redeeming quality of the meal. The dessert special of the evening was a key lime cheese cake that my friend and I split. The lime wasn't overpowering and the cheesecake was decadent and savory. My only complaint was that the portion size was TINY. Barely enough to share, but a nice sweet ending to a less than average meal.For a $40 meal I feel that my dollars would be better spent elsewhere. It will take a lot of persuading to set my foot back in the door of this boring and typical Italian restaurant."
"Our first night in Chicago and we had a delicious meal and experience at Topo Gigio our reservation was for the dining room, but we opted for an outdoor table on a very pleasant evening. The service was great, the food was even better. I highly recommend the whitefish...cooked perfectly. What a great introduction to Chicago dining."
"Order some seafood! The pasta is wonderful but it's the whitefish that won't leave my head. I think this was a special and it WAS special. Lovely service, lovely room. Great place to bring a parent or a date. Volume does get loud but that's just so many people having a wonderful time with wonderful wine. Do not take your chances with this place - make a reservation."
"Definitely a favorite local Italian spot, but if you're going on a weekend, make sure to make a reservation!  I've had several of their dishes and none has disappointed.  You can't beat the fresh bread either!"
"Went here while we waited to go into Second City down the street. Great Italian comfort food with excellent service. The bread and olive oil + parmesan to start with was a nice touch. We had the grilled calamari to start (CALAMARI alla GRIGLIA) and it was levels above the fried calamari that is often found at restaurants. For entree, we had the chicken stuffed with fontina and prosciutto (PETTI di POLLO alla VALDOSTANA) and chicken with pancetta and baked mozzarella (PETTI di POLLO alla FIORENTINA) and they both tasted great and the portions were more than satisfying. Finish the night off with some tiramisu and then head to second city for some laughs. Sounds like a great night to me."
"I've had an obsession with spaghetti and meatballs since I was a little girl. And I crave it non-stop on a weekly basis.  So when my date was telling me our dinner options for the night, I was sold the second he mentioned Topo. The place can be summed up in one short sentence:  An authentic Mom and Pop quality Italian dining with a fun lively atmosphere.I knew I loved the place as soon as we walked in. The large restaurant was bustling but we didn't mind the wait after smelling and seeing the delicious large portions of food being carried to tables.  After checking our coats, we enjoyed a couple of cocktails as we anxiously awaited our table. The bartender was super nice and scored us seats as soon as one of the other couples who were sitting down got a table. So the food...amazing! We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer- it was PERFECT! The marinara sauce was tasty and zesty and the calamari was perfectly fried. For entrees, I of course got the spaghetti and meatballs and my date got the special which was the pasta in vodka sauce w/lobster and scallops. Both dishes were a hit! We opted out of dessert since we were both stuffed but I'm sure they were all yummy!"
"Been a few times, have always enjoyed the food and the experience, forgot to review them in the past and just wanted to get our high score on their listing."
"The food was great but the hostess (brown hair, glasses) was incredibly rude. When asked about how much longer the wait was she assured us in the snappiest way possible that she was currently in grad school (wow?) and that she knew what she was doing. However, her estimate was 45 minutes off. She had absolutely no reason to treat customers in that way...it was the first time I had ever experienced such disrespectful staff at a restaurant."
Took me a while to like this place but it's food is truly delicious.
"La Scarola has been my favorite Italian in Chicago for four years, but I've finally found a place that can compete.  The staff are friendly and there is a ton of indoor and outdoor seating (the patio is super romantic in the summer).  Make a reservation if you can, but otherwise try to stop by - the space is big enough that the wait is usually doable.The prices are a bit high, but standard for a nice Italian restaurant in Chicago.  If you want to save a little money, get a half order, which is still plenty of food.  Good news is the meal comes with free bread, but don't forget to save room for your entree!I'm not a meat eater, so I get pasta every time, but it's always fantastic.  When I'm on my vegan kick, I get the homemade gnocchi (NOT on the dinner menu, but always available) with tomato (marinara) sauce.  The portion is huge and the lovely little gnocchi pillows are light and yummy.   When I'm indulging on dairy, I go with the ""Conchiglie alla Sarda"" sans the sausage - essentially mini shells with vodka sauce and peas. Most delicious dish ever. Don't miss it!As far as sides/drinks, I highly recommend the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc (totally worth the $34) and the Caprese salad.  The Mozzarella and tomatoes are incredibly cold and fresh."
"Great spot for dinner! We enjoyed excellent prosecco and pasta before catching a show at The Second City Mainstage, just down the street. The place was bustling, so we were glad we had made a reservation, but we received great service and enjoyed socializing with the other patrons - the tables are quite close together!"
"Nestled in Old Town for years- almost the Perfect Italian Resto!! The have the formula perfected here, why they've been in biz for over two decades. First up, Great Cocktails/Wine/ Classic Italian Beer selections/ not just run of the mill junk--Had a Moretti Rosa-- Dark Italian ale and it was almost perfect! Second, The MENU is done right/10 classic Italian Apps/10 Salads/20 Pastas/10 ""Meats"".. all things you want to try- not a bunch of weird creations. Third, they bring out the Olive Oil/Parm/Bread combo but this isn't just any old dried out bread--it's freshly baked!! Fourth, the service is OLD SCHOOL-- don't expect them to hurry or rush you out the door/ these guys know the specials inside and out--not some college kid botching the name of every ingredient.... They usually have like 5 ""Specials"" that tend to be very good also expect a lot of ""Locals"" at the bar/All on a ""First Name"" Basis--they are ALL About Service here and that's how it should be. Very cozy interior and gets extremely crowded at peak times/Great Place to celebrate a Birthday or just Celebrate Success!!!  GTFJD"
"I recently met a girlfriend here for a nice dinner and we were feeling a bit indecisive. Our waiter was not impressed with our request for recommendations for literally every element of our dinner, but he humored us. I wasn't blown away by my dish, but I think I just didn't order well. I had their salmon and farfalle with dill... and the flavor combo just didn't work for me. They were out of several of the wines on their wine list as well, which was incredibly disappointing since that was what we were most looking forward to. The ONLY reason I am 4-starring this place as opposed to just A-Okaying it is the Tiramisu. Can I please just eat this this for a living?! Holy Ladyfingers, that was the most amazing tiramisu I have ever encountered. There is nothing bland, soggy or unforgettable about this dessert prepared lovingly in a footed glass dish. I'll be thinking about that dessert for a long long time. Don't miss out on it when you go!Also, make reservations. It was crowded even on a Monday night."
"Fine, call me crazy, out of your mind, are you serious? But.... my fellow Yelpers, I have had better Italian food and better service in most places I have been to.  I'm not sure what type of plants or roots these 4-star rating people are smoking, but the night I went, it was just not on par from what I would expect. I came here the first week of August 2010 for a friend's going away party and granted we did have a large group of about 15 people (at two separate tables), we weren't a hard bunch of folks to please. Simple things such as water refills, drink orders, and the waiter coming to your table to check on you isn't too much to ask right? Well apparently it was for our waiter.SERVICEIt takes him about 10 minutes between his rounds/wandering around the restaurant to eventually make eye contact or check up on us.  Waters took 5 minutes to get to us, drinks took another 5 minutes, and then ordering took another 15 minutes to get back to us, and then our food took a good 45 minutes to get to us.  I ordered the Spaghetto Con Fruitti di Mare (Seafood and Tomato based Spaghetti).   Note that they ran out of clams on that day... he tells us this before hand, so I know I'm already be missing 1 out of 4 seafood items in my dish.   When he brings out my dish, which is the exact same dish which 3 others ordered... you could tell that it was visibly lacking seafood compared to the other people at my table.  (Noticeably the way they present it - 4 large mussels on each corner of your plate to form an 'x' if you might say)  Mine was missing one in the corner.  (see diagram below)normal: (note: x denotes a 'mussell')x        x                    pastax        x mine: x      pastax      x When I brought this to the server's attention right when he placed it on the table  - annoyed as I already was from his lackluster service/attention - he says ""Oh, I'm not sure why its missing one"".... and that's it.  (umm,  Do you think I ate it? Hid it in my pocket?).  He then continues to put other people's dishes on the table and then walks away... no.. simple ""I'm sorry our Kitchen's been busy and they forgot to add that one"", or ""We ran out of mussells"", it was just ... ""I don't know"".  Who does that?Long story short... not a pleasant experience... service isn't that great, and maybe its cause we had a big group, so BIG groups this isn't the place.  Also, the Seafood Salad is GROSS.... barely any lettuce (just a few greens...) and then half cooked tasteless squid and calamari everywhere on your plate.  Absolutely gross. Have a good day everyone. My rant is done."
"I just went to T.G. for a ""working lunch"". The food was wonderful, we had the choice of sitting inside or out, and the waitstaff really gave us the space to pull out paperwork and talk business and then check in on us when it seemed appropriate. The Gnocchi was A++!  I will be back!!"
"Just called to make a reservation at this property for next week. Spoke to Therese. I have spoken to many rude and pretentious people but Therese may just take the award.. we were looking for a Fri. night at 7:30 for 13 people. Without apology,she immediatley told me she had too many large parties for the evening. I totally understand that the property is busy....offering some alternative would be something the owners would appreciate. Having to ask her what time we could be  seated she mentioned 9:30. Asking for an earlier time she said ""it would not be to my liking"". Really? How would she know with out mentioning the time. Again, I had to ask. Again, she said it was ""absurdly early"". Again, I had to ask....getting the picture? I'm sure there is a class in Chicago that Therese could attend in Customer Service 101.....make that 100 she needs all training she can get."
All you need to know is that you'll need a reso cause it's a very popular place and the food is delicious!!!!! They accommodate for food allergies too.Great place to eat before a second city show.
"Topo Gigio is a quaint restaurant in Old Town on Wells. The atmosphere is pleasing and the wait staff is extremely professional. What makes Topo Gigio so good though, is how these elements are brought together with magnificently prepared food.I have tried several dishes there and most recently had their salmon with a lemon butter caper sauce, asparagus and mashed. The flavors were spot on. The sauce complimented the entire plate, the salmon was cooked to perfection, the potatoes were perfectly seasoned and the asparagus was crisp and fresh. Every element on the plate complimented its counterparts. And, while this is not a very difficult dish to create well, it is tough to get it absolutely right. Topo Gigio did just that."
"The food here is fantastic, I have visited many times over  7+ years.It is expensive, but as far as flavors, quality and many choices including the usually well-stocked lovely antipasto bar, it is always a great meal.The one downside is cost--it is very expensive.They are very accommodating to kids, a plus for families.pleasant environment."
"I had just an OK experience at TG for a recent birthday extravaganza for 4 of my close friends. All of their birthdays are about a month apart so we did a huge celebratory birthday dinner at Topo Gigio! This place was jammed packed on a Saturday night. We were stuffed at a long table in the back so it was hard to converse with my large party. Our server was not as attentive as we wanted. He didn't come back as often as we would have liked. One of my friends had a empty water glass most of the meal because it was hard to get back to her. It is very loud up in here and it's hard to hear the people you are wining and dining with. For starters, we had Prosciutto di Parma:Slices of Prosciutto di Parma, with Buffalo Mozzarella and roasted red peppers. This was a very divine appetizer. You had to combine all the elements of the appetizer to fully enjoy the unique flavors. We also had the Calamari and it was just OK. A little dry and too cold for my liking. Topo has pretty decent wine prices and a killer malbec.I was torn on what to order so I just had plain old spaghetti and meatballs. It was very good but basic. I wasn't brave enough to try another dish without marinara sauce. I guess I'm plain... I should have tried their pumpkin ravioli!! For the birthday guests, Topo Gigio put together a nice dessert platter. There was plenty of yummy tiramisu to go around and assortment of biscotti and Italian cookies.I would like to try TG again with a smaller party. They have a great menu with a huge variety. I was not impressed with such a large group."
"Dollar for Dollar, this is the best Italian spot in the city. The service is great, the food is amazing and the ambiance and location can't be beat. It may be a bit loud for some people or groups, but we love this place.The homemade fettuccine is top notch, even the fresh baked bread brought out when you are seated is delicious. Their imported Mozzarella which is served with their Prosciutto and the Caprese literally melts in your mouth and the grilled calamari appetizer  is among the best I've had. I can't help but dip my bread in the sauce once the calamari is finished. IF you don't like calamari grilled, the fried calamari is cooked to perfection and perfectly crispy.The Panzenella salad is one of my favorites on the menu, but that doesn't mean the rest aren't delicious.As for pastas, you can't really go wrong. The mark of a good Italian restaurant for me is how good their spaghetti and meatballs are and Topo's is UNREAL. The Rigatoni Al Filo Di Fumo is also one of my favorites, but I'll usually ask them to substitute the homemade fettuccine instead of the Rigatoni (personal preference). The Conchiglie alla Sarda is also top notch.The Chicken and Fish is also delicious, I won't get into particulars.I could go on for days, bottom line, this is our go to choice when we're in the mood for Italian. The portions for the money are very generous."
"I must admit, when i came to Topo Gigio years ago, i did not like it a single bit and because of the experience, i avoided this place for a long timerecently went there with friends and i definitely enjoyed it this time aroundthe caprese salad we shared was fresh, wine was reasonably (we had an argentinian malbec) priced, my tilapia special was tasty and i literally stole all of my boyfriend's black linguine with shrimp scallops and smoked salmonall in all, i am glad i came back and tried the place again. good value for a neighborhood restaurant"
"We ate here on 7/12/13 prior to seeing a show at Second City.  Reservations were taken on time.  Very busy restaurant, the server was not very attentive.  The food portions are huge and enough to share with a table.  There were five of us total and we ordered three entrees, two appetizers and a side.  The Joes Salad and La Caprese were very good. The entrees were (listed in favorite to least favorite) were Spiedini Adriatic (could have used more shrimp and scallops on the skewers), Piccantina di Vitella al Limone and Sedani Dell'Ortolano. The very last entree had no taste. The side of mashed was good.  We had no dessert due to timing of the show."
Honestly one of the best meals I've ever had. My husband had the special which was a pasta del mar with a creamy red sauce.... Divine! I had the CAMPANELLE alla NORMA - Campanelle Pasta in Arrabiata Sauce with Sautéed Eggplant and Aged Ricotta Cheese.AMAZING!!! And my sis had the cinque terre. Also delicious! The best part was that everything stayed piping hot!!! So amazing! Can't wait to go back!
"Topo Gigio is a great place in Old Town for a date or an afternoon lunch. I ended up there on a date after another establishment in Old Town who shall remain nameless was unexpectedly closed. Their loss. Our gain.Topo Gigio has a great deal of outdoor seating, both in the open near the sidewalk, and tucked away in the more secluded back. The atmopshere was romantic, but not suffocatingly so. As a first date, it worked out as a great location.I had the seashell pasta with a creamy-cheesy-tomato sauce with peas and sausage. It was fantastic. The portions are pretty large and I thought there was no way I'd be able to finish it, but it was so good I found myself unable to stop chowing down! Clean plate!The price was also pretty reasonable, especially in Old Town; a major selling point for me! If I have any complaints about the restaurant, it's that if you are in the outside seating during the afternoon, beware! Topo dresses the outside seating up with flowers, and while they look nice, our table was also receiving visitors from a lovely family of nearby bees/hornets/wasps. I imagine this problem would be alleviated in the evening hours, or by sitting somewhere else."
"This place was surprisingly busy for a random Thursday evening, I would probably recommend making reservations, if possible (although our party of three only had to wait about 10 minutes at 7pm, not bad).  The restaurant offers valet parking (I believe it's $10) and a coat check.We were greeted promptly by an efficient and professional server (not overly friendly, but I'll settle for efficient and professional, no problem).  They offer an extensive wine list with bottles priced from the mid-twenties  up.    While they do have a full bar, there are no draft beers and a limited bottle selection - take note beer guzzlers!The food was good, although I would have liked to see a few more vegetarian options on the menu for an Italian place (where's the gnocchi?  The risotto?)  Dinner entrees ranged from $12.95-$23.95.  I settled on the ""Sedani dell'ortolano"" (pasta & veggies) with the tomato sauce.  It was surprisingly good!  The sauce had a very nice flavor and the portion was generous.  The veggies (peas, peapods, broccoli, carrots) were fresh & crisp and centered on the dish was a mound of spinach with garlic (very good).    The Caprese Salad consisted of several large tomato slices topped with thick slices of mozzarella, topped with basil.  While this may be a good salad for two to share before a meal, I wouldn't recommend it as an entree (it just wouldn't fill me up).    My friend had one of the chicken entrees and said that while it was good, he preferred the whitefish he'd had the time before.BOTTOM LINE:  While it'd be nice to see some more veggie selections and draft beer (I know, I know wine + Italian food=standard), this was a reasonably priced spot with generous portions and good food!"
"Love this place.  Great patio in the summer.  Our server broke a glass close to us, and forgot our order, but she ended up comping something for us (I think?  Red wine always gets me)  Anyways, not an ideal serving experience, but not terrible and she apologized profusely.  I started with a filet mignon with capers, had veal for the main course, and tiramisu which comes in a huge portion which our server was nice enough to tell us to order only one.  We had a bottle of cabarnet sauvignon too.   I have no complaints.  This place is good to go to if you want to sit and relax and enjoy the weather in the summer on the patio, but I can't speak for what the inside looked like."
"I live in the Old Town area and thought I'd try this place out since a friend recommended it and I was craving Italian food.When my friend and I spoke w/ the hostess, she was not the most welcoming hostess.  She didn't greet us when we walked up to her and we had to say HI first.  We then asked for table for two. She asked if we wanted to dine outside or inside.  Our initial response was, 'first available'.  She then repeated her question of outside or inside. We're not deaf, girl! So we just decided outside then. She then proceeds to lead us to the table. Not friendly.Then our bus boy came who served us our water and bread. Yum.  Waiter came and did not introduce himself, however gave us our menus and left.  I didn't really think much about it until I saw him interact w/ the table in front of us and he was all chit-chatty and super attentive to our neighbors.  Time to order. I don't know if they have any specials tonight, but the waiter did not mention anything.  We ordered caprese salad, conchiglie mediterranea, and eggplant parmigiana.  All were delicious.The food was not lacking, however our waiter was.  It was the busboys who brought our food to the table. The waiter, finally asked how we were doing towards the end of our meal and he was curt about it.  Then I notice him go to the other table and made sure  everything was OK and dandy.He asked if we wanted dessert.  I overheard him earlier explain to the table next to us whatever kind of dessert they had or if they wanted coffee, cappuccino, etc. He did not do the same for us.The check finally came, I gave a minimal tip.  Finally found out his name, and it's Miguel. For a restaurant like this, I expected better and friendlier staff.  What is it with the staff?  Were they judging my friend and I because we did not look like the typical customers that come and stop by for dinner?  If it not for the good food, I would never come back here again. But I really liked the food -- I just hope next time I don't encounter that same hostess and I hope to never get that waiter again.2 Stars for the awful service + 4 stars for the food = 3 stars avg."
"I love Topo - definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. Delicious, authentic food, fun atmosphere, and good location. Though it gets really busy on the weekends, we typically just show up without a reservation, put our names in, sit at the bar for a few drinks and are seated within 45 minutes. If I'm looking for a good, hearty, authentic Italian meal - Topo never disappoints!"
"I can't say enough good things about Topo Gigio. However, the most important are as follows...1) Amazing wait staff and service2) Great for large groups (but definitely get a reservation ahead of time and 10 people is their max.)3) Food is out of this world - favorites include pasta with sausage and peas, seafood salad and grilled calamari4) Also, a wonderful place to just enjoy a glass of wine or two outside5) Great location - valet service available as parking is limited"
"Visit to Chicago from Kansas City.  Wanted to show the DH Old Town which I discovered on the Food Planet Culinary Tour....see that review!Went to Yelp to find the best restaurant in the area and this is it!  Sat out on the patio on a beautiful night.  Started with Antipasto Freddo, which had grilled vegetables and a small amount of salami and cheese.  It was OK, but would've liked a little more meat and cheese.  DH had the seashell pasta....OMG, it was so good!  Other reviewers convinced us to try it and they were so right!  Try it...yum yum!I wasn't so hungry so I went with the side of meatballs.  I was so disappointed....not with the meatballs but because I didn't get the spaghetti and meatballs entree!  Meatballs and sauce ROCKED!   Luckily, we had great service and were treated with respect."
"For a friend's birthday, we started out with some bottled red at the bar as we waited for about 30 - 45 minutes for a table of four.  The red was amazing, although sadly I can't remember the name of it.  We loved it so much we ordered another bottle at the table! The bread was amazingly tasty and addictive, per my usual carb-loving.   Everything our party ordered (I had the eggplant parmesan) was on point and the portions are ridiculously large.  The server was very knowledgable about the menu items, although he did recite it in an almost robotic, yet eloquent speech-like manner...perhaps a long shift?  He wasn't super attentive but I think it was probably just a busy night.  The place has great atmosphere, plus my 49ers won that night we went, which is definitely a plus!"
"Made reservations here for my birthday for a table of 6. We were seated promptly and this review could be written on service alone.  Service was fantastic!!!  There are so many different dishes to choose from but not to where it is overwhelming.  The place has a lot of character and has more of an intimate atmosphere but still very lively.  The place was packed and the owner stopped by our table to introduce himself as he made his rounds.  He was really friendly and personable.  I told him it was my birthday and at the end of our dinner he came by with a bottle of champagne for our table to share!  Haven't had that kind of service...... EVER!!!!  The food was good, I had a seafood pasta and there was plenty of seafood although I would've loved a few more scallops vs. calamari.  It would be great if they offered a cocktail menu with martinis they are able to make.  They have an extensive wine menu but I was in party mode so I was looking for some cocktails.  I will DEFINITELY be back the next chance I get!!!"
"It was a hot night in Old Town!!  Now don't get excited- this wasn't some wild date.   It was just plain, HOT the other night when we came to Topo Gigio for a late dinner.  There is a great outdoor bar which we sat at  to enjoy a drink but the awning covering it was just trapping the heat under it.  My solution?  I tried to keep cool by sucking down massive quantities of vodka and soda but even Rudy the bartender couldn't pour them fast enough to keep us cool!!  Darn! and that seemed like such a good solution!  Fearing early inebriation, we finally gave up on our wish to be seated outdoors and went inside to air conditioned comfort to enjoy our meal.  I have eaten here several times and love the pasta with porcini mushrooms and sausage.  We also had the daily pasta special which was a seafood medley (shrimp and scallops) in a spicy red sauce!  Both were delicious.  Paired with the caprese and the house salad, it was a perfect dinner. And there was plenty left over to take home for yet another meal.The service is always impeccable and the manager usually takes the time to personally  thank us for coming to this delightful little spot.Curious about the name?  For you trivia fans out there- Topo Gigio is the name of the mouse puppet that used to be on the old Ed Sullivan show. Thus the pictures of the mouse on one of the walls.Hot time?  Yes.  In so many ways.  But the food at this place is worth it!!"
"I have always thought every Italian restaurant in this city tasted the same until now.Go to Topo immediately and order the pumpkin ravioli, and a glass of Malbec, then shoot me a message thanking me. :)  Amazing.  We went on a Friday night, and while it was busy, we waited all of 2 minutes to get seated for a party of 4, which is impressive.  The service, atmosphere, and food were FANTASTIC.  A++"
"Picture it. Old Town Art Fair Weekend. Freshly painted fingers and toes and a chair massage left me and my gal pals a little less than content to wade in and out of a crowd that seemed more focused on downing pints than admiring the artifacts. We sought an oasis and because one of us is a picky eater, Bistro Margot wasn't palatable. We love her anyway.Topo, on the other hand, is delightfully diverse in options (their antipasto table was colorful and ample enough to be a floor to ceiling mosaic). My snoozy eater pal ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I got rigatoni with pancetta, basil, fresh mozz and a spicy tomato sauce. It's the house special and it WAS special. The pasta dishes are $15 - $20 but after you fill up on bread and Italian butter well shoot. . . take that home and nuke it for brekkie the next day! The bread, by the way, was airy, warm, pull apart fantastic. And the people watching? Perfection. We saw a dead-on Mariah Carey lookalike and literally turned our chairs around at our window table to begin creating narratives for passersby. He was going to propose to her; she is on the hunt for mischief; he shouldn't be wearing those sunglasses, or that shirt, or hell no! not those shoes either. There are so many damn different people in the world. Granted Old Town ain't all that diverse and a bag of chips, but it's still different than me. . . so I rather dig that. Leftovers, baubles and a few new headbands in tow we left with bellies full, an affection for the Little Mouse and more summer lovin' day ahead of us!"
"I have frequented Topo at least 200 times since I used to live the Old Town area and just one of the most consistent, authentic and fun places - particularly the outdoor patio and bar in the spring/summer.  I've always had great experiences with the service and not because I was a frequent customer.  The service is always friendly and attentive.The calamari is always tender, lightly breaded and seasoned nicely while Joes salad is filled with beautiful fresh greens, large chunks of mozzerella, artichokes, walnuts, raisins and a tangy balsamic oil dressing.  I've had every appetizer, salad and entree there is and my all time favorite is the black ink linguini with jumbo shrimp which they occasionally have on special.  Unbelievable.The desserts are very good but the price point is very fair particularly for the quality, consistency and fun ambience of this old town staple."
"This review is for all those looking for a special restaurant - superb food, top notch service and pleasant ambience.  I have eaten here about 50 times, most are 5 star occasions,  sometimes 'only' a four.  Select dishes are better than others - ""Chicago's top gnochhi!"", but you always walk away with a smile on your face!I enjoy the authentic flavors present in most dishes - typically mild - but you get the feeling the chef(s) are holding back on a little robustness- but that's your job when ordering!  No stranger to ""off menu"" & custom ordering when dining, they have always taken my deviations in stride and created food you would be proud to serve to your friends & family.I believe the menu has become more limited, but that may not be a bad thing, as they are then able to concentrate on making what they offer well.  This is not a place with over the top theatrics (doen't need it), just good food sensibly presented.  Can't miss."
"So my first time here. Recommended by my house host. I have ordered portabella mushrooms with polenta for starters. My main course is the Chilean sea bass special. Then I might have cappuccino cheesecake for desert! Ok so the mushroom was very good. Covered in a brow gravy with the polenta under the shroom. I couldn't eat it all for fear I wouldn't have room for the cheesecake!  Next course, the sea bass. OMG, the sea bass was cooked to perfection, light, flaky and succulent!  It was accompanied by asparagus spears, huge capers and fluffy mashed potatoes. Of course I had to wrap it up. I changed my mine on the desert since the cheesecake wasn't homemade. I chose the mouse instead. Another OMG, the mouse was cut like pie and the plate was dressed with chocolate and strawberry sauce. The mouse had a chocolate crust on the bottom.  Over all Topo Gigio was very good. The wait staff was on the ball. I would recommend coming."
"I think this place pretty much defines Old Town - it's crowded and there are a lot of trixies and chads. The food was pretty good, but our service seemed extremely rushed. It felt kind of awkward, like the time I went to see My Own Private Idaho with a friend."
"Great place for business lunch, you can still find street Meter parking. Not so crowded that you can;t hear yourself talk, and a good selection of salads and pasta dishes, service was very good."
"Too much to explain. Embarrasing ownership and staff. A guy, who appeared to have some type of connection to the place was extremely rude (older, skinny-ish and balding, italian-looking guy); he was basically standing at the bar drinking with a buddy, while trying to interrupt and micro manage every employee there. After 1 1/2 of waiting for a table and a loud discussion with said guy, who additionally refused to tell us, who he was; we ended up leaving the place."
"I give the place Three stars because I honestly just have a hard time finding a four/five star venue that I love in my price point. LOL. At any rate, I have been passing this place for years, having grown up here in Chicago. Happenstance, looking for late night grub. I got a really nice, though salty passta dish with meat. She got a passta dish with peas. The Calamar was fine. Wee pricey, but love the local vibe and language. Will always go back.  Did I mention tad overpriced?"
"Absolutely love Topo!  I've been 15+ times and the service, food and atmosphere are always spot on--place is a well-oiled machine.  Favorites are spaghetti and meatballs (with angel hair pasta), eggplant parm and the fried calamari.  MUST order the calamari!   Since everyone loves this place, it's always crowded, so be prepared for that and try to get a rez-o."
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Topo Gigio.  :)  Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago.  I'm lucky that it's right in my neighborhood.  I've been here several times and have tried most of the menu and nothing has disappointed.  I go here year-round, but particularly love spending the day at the beach and heading over for drinks and appetizers outside in the late afternoon/early evening."
"bland with little to no seasoning....hated the food, service was horrible (i had to wait 20 minutes just for water)"
"When does a restaurant deserve five stars? When it delivers one of the best meals you've had--ever. Such was the case at Topo Gigio. Referred by my old man, who used to tipple at the bar, I knew it'd be quality Italian. We arrived for a business dinner--myself, two co-workers and a client. Ms. Client promptly face-planted on the sidewalk emerging from the cab. After this minor mishap--in which said client lay face down on pavement for upwards of five seconds, conjuring fears of lawsuits and orphaned toddlers--things started looking up. Brushing the street soot from her face, Ms. Client led us through the warmed patio area, thrumming with a Rush Street dinner crowd. We docked our coats and landed inside at a good four top. The interior is a perfect balance between upscale and old style Italian. Not trendy enough to be overpriced, but without the red sauce mafia vibe, capiche?Anyway, the wine list delivered -- a fine Santa Cristina Sangiovese with plenty of Chiantis and Barberas on offer. The food over-delivered: my tortellini alla panna was exquisite. Tortellini bathed in cream sauce, flush with freshly plucked shrooms and salty slices of spiced pancetta, all showered in parmigiano reggiano. Likewise, the black linguini with scallops, mussels and clams in marinara sauce was memorably good. The black linguini, by the way, is made by adding calamari ink to the dough while preparing the pasta.All in all, great atmosphere, a mouthwatering meal, and we successfully packed Ms. Client off in a cab at meal's end..."
Very nice little restaurant. The inside was decorated really nicely. They have a pretty solid wine lists with plenty of really reasonably priced bottles of wine. The service was really friendly. The food for the most part was really good. I had a special with fillet medallions which came out medium rare as I ordered but it was supposed to have a pepper crust but it just tasted charred and burnt. The meat inside was great though. My guest had a spicy pasta dish that was awesome. Id go back but id stick to a pasta dish rather than ordering beef.
"I had the Scottish Smoked Salmon, it was served with Served frisee, dill mascarpone, capers and citrus vinaigrette. It was delicious.  I sat outside on a beautiful summer afternoon with good company, and a nice glass of chardonayThe service was good, our waiter was very cool, seemed genuine and not pushy or overtly annoying.I would go back to try out something else from their menu. My boyfriend thought the pasta was hard - but I liked my meal.  I tried his pasta and it was kind of hard...but he didn't return it - and ate it like that anyway.  His fault."
"I love this place.  The food is great, but not too expensive.  You can go here for multiple different occasions (dates, family, birthday, anniversary...)  It has a great feel of being special, but not uptight.  I imagine a long table with family laughing and enjoying a great night out on the town.You'll find all of your typical Italian dishes done very well.  Good selection of dinner wines.  The place does tend to get busy so call ahead if possible.  It is situated right in Old Town.  Great place to stroll around before or after dinner.I've been here a handful of times.  I haven't had a bad experience with food or staff.  If you go in the summer there is great outdoor seating.  Thumbs up!"
"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in any city, you can always count on the bustling Topo Gigio for a great meal. It's crowded-- and loud, and you will need a reservation on a weekend but it's worth it (and for me, I like a busy restaurant). Plus, they have the service down to a well-oiled machine. Pleasant, quick, you never wait for the food and it's always hot (and delicious). My most favorite thing is their polenta and mushroom appetizer-- I often eat that as a main course. And their deliciously prepared pastas-- also a favorite with wonderfully rich sauces make the meal hard to choose from. Great Old Town location that stands out amongst the crush of restaurants in the neighborhood."
"I'm from Texas, and the Italian food there is just about as bad as it gets. This was probably the best I've ever had."
"This place is exactly what you want an Italian restaurant to be.The space is much larger than we were expecting from the street, and had a nice outdoor seating area and bar, which would be perfect on warm summer nights.  Inside was warm, with lots of boisterous conversation and waiters in crisp white shirts whirling around full tables.I had the Tortellini alla Panna, which I don't think I'd order again - the cream sauce was very heavy and garlicy.  However I also tried my boyfriend's plate of Rigatoni al Filo di Fumo, which was a perfect red sauce dish - and I'd definitely order that next time.  The special desert, key lime cheesecake, was also delicious.Great for groups, and I look forward to coming back when the weather gets colder for a meal and experience that will warm me from the inside.  Sounds corny, but true!"
"This place gets super crowded, so plan accordingly.Everything we ordered was really really good and the portions were ginormous!  one little pet peeve: we got our salads/appetizers and were clearly not done with them when all of a sudden all of our entrees came out.  So then we had to play table shuffle, trying to make room for our salad and the entree plates.  that was super freegin' annoying..but of course we didn't want to turn away the entrees knowing that we'd be sealing their fate to a permanent burn ala heat lamps.besides that we loved the food and will definitely be back."
"Stop reading this review and race over to Topo Gigio right this minute! After about a 6-month drought (what else could I possibly have been doing?!) I returned to Topo Gigio last night for the caprese salad, the pumpkin ravioli--possibly the only good thing about fall/winter arriving--and some fabulous red wine. The best place to sit is outside the main dining area in the front bar with the heat lamps. They have newly remodeled the whole area and it's better than ever. Something about the place makes everyone happy they're there; it's small and intimate, easy to chat with neighbors and make new friends. And it's an especially good place to bring a date.  I'll be returning often this season.I think this is the best Italian spot in the city. Enjoy!"
"We came because we saw it on Check Please. The place was packed on a Friday night & we waited about 30 minutes even with reservation. We orderedprosciutto di parma - okcarpaccio alla piemontese - oksaltimbocca alla parmigiana - slightly saltysphaghetti ai frutti di mare - goodtortellini alla panna - oktiramisu - okI just was not impressed at all with the restaurant in anyway.  I really wanted to love it, and couldn't. Everything was meh."
"5 star plus 5 more! The food is amazing!! Food is great and the prices are not so high. The staff is very nice and attentive. Hands down, it's my favorite Italian restaurant in the city."
"Great service, funny staff and an amazing wine selection. Must try: Caprese Salad (-:"
"Old School Italian = Love.Dined on a weeknight with my dad and my brother. The service was very attentive and the food is authentic. We shared the prosciutto appetizer which is a comically small portion for it's $9.95 price tag, but alas it was delicious and it made it difficult to be too unhappy. Two large slices of Prosciutto de Parma, 2 rounds of delicious, fresh, creamy bufalo mozzarella, and a small pile of scrumptious roasted red peppers. Like I said, not exactly what we were expecting based on the description on the menu but everything was high quality and delicious. As for the entrees.... if our app was a bit scant on portion size (for sharing purposes, at least), the entrees more than made up for it. Huge plates of pasta arrived at our tables and by the end of our meal we were stuffed. I enjoyed the Linguine Vic Damone (pasta with clams, garlic, and cherry tomatoes). The lacking 5th star is simply because the tomatoes in my pasta were barely ripe (I am well aware tomatoes are no longer in season but for goodness sakes there are better cherry tomatoes available at Jewel) and there was a bit of grit in the very last clam I ate. I was disappointed to have my meal end on that note but overall we were all very pleased with our meal. Topo Gigio has great atmosphere and would be a great choice for a group dinner (they take reservations)."
"Great food, and if the weather's nice, the outdoors patio is an absolute blast to hang out. Its really quite a fun restaurant, everyone laughing and just having so much fun.The food is uniformly outstanding, and the value is good for the price. The quantities aren't huge, but then again, this ain't maggiano's, you know? Its more about dining out, not pigging out. This is a place to take family or friends. I especially like their seafood and pasta combinations and usually go by the waiter's recommendations.Be prepared to wait for your table, though, its a popular place....thankfully they've got professionals working the bar who will keep your drinks full while waiting for your table. Yummy!"
"Good Italian food!  And in a great neighborhood!  We were seeing a show at The Second City and everyone I spoke with recommended Topo Gigio.  I ordered the veal and it was really good. i am a sucker for veal, and this was cooked to perfection.  And I had to have pasta as a side, so I opted for a classic penne with their tomato sauce which was filledWith fresh tomato chunks and soo good.  But I must admit that I had food envy because my friend ordered a chicken dish with the most amazing cream sauce.  I kept on dipping my pasta in his plate it was unreal.Staff was ok.  I do wish the food came a bit quicker.  Music was really weird for the venue.  Had the typical Italian decor.  Wine list was ok, but I never did like Italian wines much."
"Good atmosphere, good service and good wholesome food. They have a great outdoor dining area, which would make this place a great summer destination to people watch in the bustling old town neighborhood."
"Topo Gigio is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago.  The menu has just about everything - and it's all incredible!  I am a big fan of the pastas, but there is nothing on the menu that I wouldn't eat.The wait staff is excellent and the ambiance can't be beat.  During the warmer months, the outdoor patio is fabulosity (unfortunately, they don't take reservations for this area)."
"Very ironically, two days before going to Topo Gigio I had read a legal reasoning hypo about Italian restaurants, and how they were characterized by pictures all over the wall, family style dining, and great pasta, among other things. At least in terms of the mock-up then it was as genuine as it gets.Didn't get to take a look at the wine list for selection, pricing, or corkage fee, but at three bottles spread across seven people I assume as usual that's what doubled our bill :)I can say with certainty though that the menu was amazing. It was confusing in one way - I didn't understand the headers and their complicated Italian terms - but on the other hand that just contributed to a great experience. Selections ranged from pasta dishes involving poultry and seafood to yummy sounding salads to a set of three delicious seeming specials.Conchiglie alla Mediterrenea, which I later learned to be Mediterranean sauce, spices and seafood over shells, ended up sounding the best. The pasta was supple, sauce slightly tangy with a great light creaminess to it, and seafood tasty but sparse (3 shrimps and 3 small scallops. Hmm. Am I just used to Red Lobster??).I only regret not getting a taste of my friends' dishes in. The bottom line price-wise is that you may pay a decent amount: $45 per person last night but with no apps nor dessert, so I don't know if $$ is appropriate. Definitely the higher end thereof."
"Topo Gigio mostly came through for me.I experienced much of the same great atmosphere and food as other yelpers here (boy had: traditional veal parm, enjoyed it; I had: lamb special - awesome. our calamari fritti was cooked perfectly, no hint of rubber, always my test for an italian spot).  unfortunately i also experienced some of the poor service. ordered a drink, never came. got our food, server never checked to see if it was correct or if we needed anything else (i understand that others run the food, but at least check on us once!). service ruined it for my fella, but I'd go back if i was in the neighborhood and hankerin' for some traditional italian fare."
"Was part of a large business group recently.  The fixed menu was too limited.  I come to TG for PASTA, people -- but we were offered only one pasta choice, penne with red sauce and basil, innocuous, with big meat entrees.  Cannoli for dessert, so so.  If that was all I knew of TG, I probably wouldn't return."
Excellent service and food. I felt like I was back in Europe. You have to order the bruschetta to start off.
"Eggplant parm was outstanding.  Everything was outstanding.  We smelled like garlic for days.  To not have sauce is normally a ""no go"".  We want to go back but we must try some others."
"Recently moved to Chicago I went for a walk with a friend to see Old Town. It was near the dinner hour so we decided to stop at Topo Gigio. We didn't know a thing about it. It was one of those perfect summer days so we ate outdoors.     I a dish that was  lemon chicken - but named different on the menu. What a delight!  I couldn't stop thinking about it for days . Had to go back to get an order to go so I could find out if it was as good as I remembered.  OH YES.... plus The staff extemely professional,  helpful, and when busy, mindful of the customers.It is Italy in Chicago."
"PROs:- Delicious food...highly recommend their ""Topo Gigio"" pasta (comes with chicken & sausage in an amazing tomato cream sauce)- Reasonably priced considering their large portions- Great location (Old Town, right by several other bars & restaurants by Wells/North)- Great ambiance (perfect date spot, but can also come for larger parties, celebratory dinners & family outings)- Great wine selection- Good (not great) serviceCONs:- Can take a while to get a table- Can get a little crowdedBut hey...these are the drawbacks of a great restaurant! :) Hope this helps!"
"I took my wife there for her birthday, it can't get better, super tasty pasta selection to choose from, my wife had the eggplant pasta, I tried a bite, it was delicious, She loved it, I had seafood pasta, I thought it was one my best I ever had, we also had a fantastic bottle of red wine , did I mention that both pasta dishes and the wine were recommended by our very attentive and friendly Italian waiter, don't waist your time with Italian waiter, if you let them help you, you end up having a great experience, then we topped of the night with a fantabulous homemade tiramisu and vanilla hazelnut gelato with a couple of espressos, We had a blast."
"EAT HERE.  It is delicious.  A great value, fresh, real, incredible."
This was definitely our best dinner in Chicago. We were a party of 13 and they sat us outside quickly. The weather was warm and the twinkling lights all around made it a wonderful fall evening. The food was sooo delicious and very reasonable. The portions were really big. I would say order what you want and switch with someone else so you get to try another yummy dish. =)  The service was excellent. The servers were kind and considerate and patient. I wish we went back another night for dinner. I will definitely come back to Topo Gigio's again. I would actually go back to Chicago just for Topo Gigio (ummm and for Garrett's Popcorn heehee)
"A bustling, yummy spot to enjoy dinner or drinks while in hanging out on one of my favorite strips in town, Wells St.  We showed up early for our reservation, and still had to wait a bit.  It was loud and dim, but full of a fun, classy energy.I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date because the tables are so close together, and you'll have to shout your sweet-nothings to each other over the noise.  This works better for a small group, perhaps before a movie or second city show (piper's alley right around the corner).The chicken and veal dishes we ordered were pretty great, but the hit of the night was the calamari- it was the best I've ever had!  It really took my mind off the strange framed items on the walls, and the standoffish  attitude of our server.We'll be back, and leave our lovey-dovey talk at home."
"Hands down, my fave Italian restaurant in Chicago.Everything is good but here's what I recommend - For Salads:Insalata mista della Casa (the dressing is so tasty - fruity olive oil and a mild vinegar - perfecto!)Panzanella alla Romana (super garlicky, perfectly dressed and very tasty for a usually boring panzanella at other places)For Entrees:Spaghetti ai Fruitti di Mare (seafood pasta that is very tasty, good red sauce that tastes like the ocean, and seafood is never overcooked)Linguine alla ""Vic Damone"" (whoever he is, he knows pasta. this is my gold standard for italian restaurants. it's very simply prepared but very tasty!! my all-time favorite! i've had it at several other places and it was bland bland bland.)Farfalle ai due salmoni (rich and creamy, salmon adds something a little different that you don't normally see in a pasta)I've never ever made it beyond my salad and entree so I can't speak to the desserts.  The portions are satisfyingly sufficient and enough for lunch the next day!"
"Warm, hospitable atmosphere with a large, varied menu of pasta and other Italian dishes. House-made linguine with huge shrimp, red peppers and pesto was awesome. Companions had traditional spaghetti and meatballs and deemed it excellent. Portions are really big. Lots of salad options including traditional mista and gorgeous caprese. Great place for couples or groups. Bar is lively, too."
"Decided a spur of the moment trip to Topo Gigio that was recommended to me almost a year ago, apparently I'm a little slow.Saturday night at 7:00 - no reservations, Topo got us in with only about 30 minutes of waiting time.  Awesome.  Expected to wait a lot longer.  Sat out on the covered patio and ate dinner.It was a little cold, hence I had to eat with my jacket on.  But the pasta was SO delicious it warmed me right up.  I had the Veggie pasta which was perfect.  I could only eat half, due to my dire need for dessert. But it made good leftovers.Tiramisu:  fabulous, please order it."
"Went here before seeing Second City on a Tuesday night with a total group of 5. We had a few bottles of Chardonnay which were pretty delicious to get the conversation going. They brought out warm bread which was also good, but pretty standard as far as bread goes. We collectively had veal parmigiana, spaghetti with meatballs, campanelle alla norma(pasta with eggplant in spicy marinara), chicken stuffed with prosciutto and fontina cheese, and chicken cooked with vegetables. I tried most of these things, and they were surprisingly delicious. I always get nervous with Italian restaurants because so many do Italian food all the same way or with very boring recipes. I would definitely enjoy coming back here again."
"Went here with a bigger group for a birthday. The table ended up a little cramped, but it's nice to be at such a full restaurant sometimes.Got the Barramundi / Whitefish. The fish was outstanding, but the asparagus came off undercooked/seasoned. The caprese salad was really really good also. Everything else seemed great as far as wine and food. The service was very friendly and helpful without being invasive like some places.The decor and overall feel was a little cheesier than I pictured the place from all the times I've passed by, but the food will get help you over that."
"This is a crowded, loud, boisterous restaurant that doesn't offer any surprises, but makes up for it by providing excellent, attentive service and a genuninely friendly environment. My friend and I both got pasta dishes and I was definitely impressed. Everything was fresh, the ingredients were top notch, and the server's suggestions were well-considered.That being said, the polenta we ordered as a starter was mediocre at best, and their wine list and dessert menu was unimpressive. I'd certainly recommend the pasta, and I'd imagine the other main courses are also great, but I'd really like to see a better overall menu."
"This place and adobo grill are my favorite restaurants to pair with a show at second city. topo gigio has a very warm atmosphere-  they have an enclosed patio with a bar and tables outside, and heat lamps and candles to keep warm in the winter! The service is the best part- they give great recommendations, are very timely with drinks and food, and can appreciate the necessity of a little rush when you're trying to catch a show. i prefer going after the show and relaxing over a bottle (or 2) of wine. some nights a strolling music ensemble will come around with the old school classics.  Food is delicious- based on the waiter's suggestion, I ordered a pasta with eggplant and garlic in a slightly spicy red sauce that was heavenly (sorry, name escapes me). A little pricey, but worth it."
"I'm with the ""want to love this place but I really, really don't"" group.  I've now been here twice and I have to say I can't recommend this place to others.  The pros: location, outdoor dining, ambiance, good service at the bar.  The cons: the mediocre food and an inconsistent waitstaff.  I really haven't enjoyed either meal I've had here.  Granted, the portions were huge but I didn't even want to take home the leftovers.  Both meals made me sick afterwards (maybe I'm allergic to some ingredient they use?) and I won't be returning to Topo Gigio with so many other fantastic restaurants in the city.  Really disappointing."
"We went for lunch on a Thursday. The service was attentive and friendly. The grilled calamari came in delicious sauce and were full of flavor. Bruschettas were well seasoned, crunchy with enough good quality olive oil and slightly melted mozzarella. The pasta with meatballs was huge and look very tasty."
"I came here based on word of mouth, as well as because of my personal goal to rate all Italian restaurants in Chicago proper...The food was excellent, the Chianti on special flowed like wine, and our waiter was excellent. We had reservations for an early 6:30 dinner and thank goodness we did because this place was packed the entire rainy evening."
"Really don't want to give this 5 stars but both times I've been my food has been really delicious.  Best Italian I've had in Chicago so far and very well priced.I'm not a huge Italian fan as it just never seems that interesting to me but this was very good and would be the first place I'd go if someone said they really wanted to go get some Italian so I guess I have to give it 5 stars for now.  But def 4 stars min for me but probably closer to 5 given how reasonably priced it is, the sweet outdoor area and both times I've been the food has been very good."
"YUM!!!  Love Topo Gigio! Food is always hot and yummy! Wine prices are amazing!  Best tiramisu next to L'Appetito!TG, never leave, please!"
"Busy Saturday evening, service was great. Food was excellent. All 4 diners very pleased. 3 had seafood of some type, filet or pasta with seafood. Not a place for intimate evening, very noisy, as an Italian restaurant should be."
"I don't see what the big fuss is about this place...nothing is really that good.  It's all just OK.  The only reason it's a place to go to is because they're located on Wells, which is an adorable neighborhood to walk around in.  Also, there's lots of bars and places to go afterwards.  I will say that they have some great vodka sauce so get that on whatever pasta you're in the mood for when you come here."
"My meal was bad and the waiter was terrible. When we asked for suggestions, he wouldn't tell us any one dish because ""what we liked"" wasn't necessary what ""he liked.""  What a joke. The whole point of being a good waiter is being able to provide a point-of-view.  I got the campanelle alla norma, which was not good at all. My friend got the fusilli alla top gigio with tomato cream sauce, which was better.  Would never come back for food, but could be convinced to come in the summer to sit outdoors, drink a mixed cocktail, and people-watch."
"I ate there this past Wednesday night, sat outside in a nice courtyard area in the back. We didn't order alcohol, made it clear that we weren't going to have any. The waiter served us just as attentively as if we had. The food was very good. We both got appetizers, salads, and entrees. The portions were large, the food was delicious, the service was very good, and the prices quite reasonable considering how much food we got and how good it was.  I will definitely return there when I am in Chicago."
perfect.'nuff said.
"Any American or even European who spends an extensive amount of time living in Italy, will come back a changed man and a true pasta snob. That is exactly what happened to me and after I returned to Chicago I was on a hunt for ""la pasta autentica italiana""I didn't have to look far, because Topo Gigio is located very close to DePaul (where I went to school). It is one of the few Italian restaurants in Chicago that gets ""Mags' Stamp DOC"" for having simply AMAZING Italian food.When you order a caprese salad, not only are the tomatoes amazing and juicy, the mozzarella is the real ""Mozzarella Di Buffola"". I sometimes want to lick my plate when I'm done!The pasta is truly al dente, not too ""american-style"" soft and not too hard. It's just perfect!! I highly recommend SPAGHETTI ai FRUTTI di MARE and FARFALLE ai DUE SALMONI  ( i like fish tho...but for those who don't there are plenty of other selections)If you are not feeling a big meal simply get the INSALATA ai FRUTTI di MARE. You will not only be satisfied, but you will also be amazed at how good a dumb salad could be. And if you pronounce it with an italian accent, you will probably get the waiters to speak Italian to you (YES!) as most of them do!Finally I love Topo Gigio for one more personal reason. The resturant is named after a little Italian, puppet mouse that I used to watch on Rai Uno when I was a little girl... brings back memories ! Plus the damn mouse is soo cute!!!"
"Old Town seems to be a haven for Italian restaurants that have been  there forever. This one is no exception, and honestly, it's virtually indistinguishable from Orso's down the street. It's got a very cute outdoor bar, but frankly not as cute as Orso's back patio. It seems a bit more ""see and be seen"", and a little less friendly (to me)."
"fantastic.  lively atmosphere, though not too loud.  Pastas were absolutely delicious.  Had not been there in many years but was back in town for business and wanted a more neighborhood choice.  Its nice to see the best neighborhood places for italian in Chicago are still going strong and this was certainly no exception."
"Very reasonably priced, tasty Italian food and good portions. I thought the Carpaccio was very tasty. We also shared the anti pasta (pasto?) platter for two and I loved the tasty omelet thing and who doesn't love grilled eggplant and grilled peppers. We had early reservations, 7:30p, that is early for me, and the place was packed with old people. It is wise to make a reservation later if you don't want to wait for your table. By 9p.m. on a Friday night the place was nearly cleared out less the groups chubby, drunk, 40+ year old, white women with outdated hair at the bar drinking house wine. Food - great Price - Right on Service - very good Atmosphere - Right on My only gripe, the wines by the glass are all sub par, save yourself some disappointment and order a bottle. Or drink Vodka."
"This place is great! I've been 4 times and loved it every time. It's usually pretty crowded so I would call for a reservation, if they take them.My favorite dish is the lobster ravioli. Based on the quality of that, everything should be great. The portions are pretty big too so you'll be able to bring some home or split an entree.The appetizer and wine lists are pretty diverse. The house wines aren't too bad, if you are curious.They also have outdoor seating right on Wells. That's a pretty busy street and so there will be plenty of traffic noise and people walking by you. It's still nice because Old Town is a great area."
"This place is excellent for people that want to have a drink or two at the bar, eat a decent meal then get the HELL OUT.   Hopefully you have somewhere else to be when you are done eating, because it sure wont be at the table you just ate at.  In other words, the service is definitely rushed.  Topo Gigio is not the place to take people (unless you don't like them) and share a leisurely conversation over a meal.  I am giving it four stars because the ambiance is great and I love grabbing a drink at the bar before I eat, plus I have never been one for lingering around after dinner.  The food is not bad, about what I would expect for the area and the price.  Most people will find it tasty enough to be satisfied.  From my own point of view; I would prefer less butter and salt, but I am more sensitive to these things than most."
"From start to finish, here was my experience...They had an enclosed outdoor seating area, so when I got into that entrance I needed to make my way to the indoor seating entrance.  I felt like I was in the way when I made my way over.  Then, I felt like I was even more in the way when I opened the door, and I had a busy server and a busy bus boy asking me to move out of the way.  Everyone was so rushed and space was so limited, but it really felt like I was a nobody as opposed to a patron at their dining establishment.  Whatever, I could get over it.  I walked over to the hostess, and I was completely ignored by everyone at the hostess booth, and the hostess was chatting with another employee while I stood there waiting.  They clearly saw me, and I tried to get their attention (pretty weak), but I guess they must have been chatting about something too important to stop.  meanwhile, I still felt like I was in everybody's way.  I spot my friends, and make my way over to their table.  It was an okay night from here on out.  I ordered a black pasta dish was a little too rich for me.  It was great at first, because I love rich foods, but after eating for a while, I was starting to feel like I'd had too much of all the flavor and creaminess too soon. Then, I was out of water and out of soda.  I put my glasses in the waiters sight, but nobody came for a while, finally the waiter came, and I asked for refills on both.  I got my refills but just from my asking for the refills, I got an attitude and the waiter said something suggesting it was my fault that I had to wait so long for the refill.  We finished our dinners and left.Although I had a good time because of the company I was with, I really can not give this restaurant a good review.  The food was nothing to write home about and the service was horrendous.  I don't plan on ever returning.  If you're in this part of town, I'd highly recommend Trattoria Roma.  It's quiet, elegant and the food is amazing as is service."
Absolutely wonderful and tasty Italian food. The restaurant is beutiful especially on warm summer days to sit outside in the garden. I love this place. All the pastas are amzing! I am addicted!
"There's a reason why certain restaurants survive in this city and others don't - simply put, those that survive ""get it"" (i.e. they know their clientele, they know how far they can push things and somehow, someway, strike a balance).  I've been coming to Topo Gigio for years (about a decade now) and each time, I find the food to be consistently above average (nothing earth shattering or culinarily incredible here), drinks predictable yet reliable and service generally on top (although it does lack warmth).  The patio/courtyard is lovely and enjoyable and it makes for a good time to kick back and relax.  Keep in mind, however, that the crowd has ahem (like me) gotten older over the years.  Where there used to be a mix of 20-somethings, 30-somethings and typical gold coast mid-lifers, has somehow evolved into what is generally a combo of tourists and gold coasters... That's not necessarily bad, but it certainly is not a scene and be seen kinda place."
"We went here on a pleasant Summer evening for dinner.  There is outdoor seating on Wells Street, a quasi-outdoor area taking you from Wells Street along the side of a bar area to another outdoor seating area in the rear.  The restaurant's main dining room is located inside, but, we choose to sit outside in the rear outdoor seating area.  The tables are spaced relatively far apart in the rear dining area and we felt removed from the hustle and bustle of Wells Street.  The menu includes classic-Italian inspired favorites.  There are a variety of pastas and meat dishes to choose from.  Most of the pastas and entrees were under $20 and provided value (though the flavors seemed muted).  The wine list included a couple of Rosso di Montalcinos that we enjoyed.  The service was not rushed, but we didn't feel as if it lagged."
"Used to frequent Topo Gigio quite often but not so much of late due to not living in the immediate area anymore.  It's a bit old school in its charm and has a distinctive clientle who go there religiously.  Some of the staff have been around as long as the place itself, so that speaks well to the owners and how they treat their employees.  The outdoor bar and seating area is great for when warm weather rolls around and if you're lucky enough to get Rudy pouring your drinks, you're in for a treat.  As for food, the menu is textbook Northern Italian and pretty comprehensive. If you opt for the pasta I'd say pair it w. some shellfish but that's just me....the winning dish on that front would be the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare which is packed w. every conceivable shellfish known to man; well, perhaps not but it's still absolutely mental.  Oh, and you can get half orders on most pasta entrees, which are still large enough to fill you up.  Close out your meal w. the king of cordials, Nocello (trumps Frangelico every time) and call it a day."
"If I had to rate my meal I'd give it 1 star. It was bad. My fennel salad with frisee and citrus was good but had too many giant chunks of fennel- it should have been sliced thinner.  Then I thought I'd order the portabella mushroom and polenta appetizer as my main. It was nasty- a dried brick of polenta, with overcooked mushroom and literally some odd gravy poured all over it. SO bad, do not order it. However, the other entrees in my group were good- one order of the scampi and scallop skewers- it was very light, fresh and delicious, simply grilled over spinach and garlic. The ""seashell pasta"" with sausage and peas was ridiculously rich and good. It's a lively atomoshpere with an odd crowd of people (maybe it was just that night) kind of a weird mix of gold coast guys and girls that were dressed up like they were going dancing. Seriously weird."
"4.5 really. For some reason, I was never really intrigued with this place but I ended up having dinner with a friend here the other night. The place is great! We split the filet and a shrimp saled and both were excellent."
"I live in Old Town and have eaten at Topo many many times.  I called last Monday afternoon to inquire if they had Wi-Fi because I was having a quick dinner meeting with my manager at 5pm and we needed to be connected. I usually eat there later in the evening/weekends so I had not paid attention to Wi-Fi capability.  The lady who answered the phone was unbelievably rude: ""Well, are you going to sit here with your laptops all night? BOTH of you will have your laptops? Maybe one laptop would be okay... How long will you be here? ""  For real? In this economy, this chick had an issue with a Monday 5pm dinner meeting? No worries....we went to Adobo instead where we were treated with complete respect.  Crappy attitude=Dinner elsewhere!  i will never recommend this place!"
"Topo Gigio has been a favorite of mine since I was in a high chair and still is today 20 years later! The waitstaff is extremely friendly, the service is quick, and the outdoor seating is great! The food is so consistently delicious and the portions are huge; definitely big enough for two or three people. The tiramisu is the best in town; I even try tiramisu in other parts of the country and world just to compare it to Topo Gigio's. The restaurant atmosphere definitely encourages the old italian, family style dining and is inviting to all types of diners during all times of the year."
"I really like this Old Town Italian spot. The food is really tasty and the pasta tastes fresh. The calms are amazing and full of flavor - if you're a seafood fan, they're a great choice of an appetizer to kick off your meal. The place can seem a little cramped since the tables are so close together, but the good food makes up for it. Service is fine, nothing to write home about but not bad either. This is a nice place to get a quality Italian meal, although I would recommend making a reservation for a weekend night, the wait can get really long otherwise! In the warmer months the outdoor bar is a nice place to grab a drink and relax."
"Yummie... It was very good Italian food, and spectacular service. Will go back again for sure... Make reservations though, it gets packed."
"Excellent and quick service, lively and cosy place, but not for romantic couple for sure, too noisy for romance :) Great place for good food, for families (even big families) and friends. Outdoor and indoor. Always full and very popular, but there is always a place of up to four people who just bump in."
Doubtful you will be disappointed at this place!
"We had a super nice dinner on the back patio with some friends. The service was good, not rushed but the waiter was sufficiently attentive and paced the meal well. We enjoyed a very reasonably priced bottle of wine and a lovely meal.  We had the black linguine special that a couple of others had recommended on yelp and found it super-yummy. The fried calamari was also very good, well cooked and not at all rubbery. I highly recommend."
"My friend recommended this place and I actually listened to her recommendation because 1. she's old school Italian and 2. she grew up in Chicago and grew up eating at Topo Gigio.  I brought 10 of my friends (ever ytime I'm in Chicago, I tend to bring everyone together because I don't see them that often).  The service was okay (which is understandable since we had so many people AND some people didn't come on time) but the pasta's were amazing!  I ordered a pasta with peas and creamy marinara and it was some of the best pasta I've ever had at a restaurant - it was simple, but delicious. Even though the portions are gigantic, I finished the entire dish, something I came to regret later in the evening when we were trying to go out (foooood coma).I always recommend the place to people that are visiting from New York because it's one of the best Italian meals I've eaten in Chicago.   Go now!!"
"We had dinner here last night for a birthday. There were 8 of us and they were very accommodating. We needed to move our reservation on a Saturday night which is usually not allowed in most places, but they made it work. The food was great. I wouldn't say amazing, but I do recommend the restaurant. The Waiter was knowledgeable. The presentation was impressive. Some of the favorites at the table were the seafood fettuccine, pumpkin Ravioli (both specials), and the chicken breast off of the every day menu. They have a fun outdoor room that is enclosed and still runs through the winter. The Tiramisu they gave the birthday girl WAS amazing. I recommend checking it out."
"The big, family-style Italian place that works.The decor is nice with a great bar/waiting area that is even open in the winter! The main restaurant is large and open with a group of men traveling from table to table singing Italian songs. The servers are very personable and knowledgeable on the wine. The food is also outstanding and served in the classic Chicago humongous style."
"AMAZING! My better half and I are huge foodies and we LOVE Topo... The food and service is always perfect.. I love their fish, chicken or pasta dishes... plus they give you sooo much you'll be taking some home... they always have a great wine list... and they actually know their wines and have them in stock..."
The best high end italian restaurant in my opinion. The sausage pasta is to die for and I am not a fan of sausage typically. Everything I have tried here is absolutely delicious except for the house wine. Yuck. Another complaint is the waiters. They can be kind of rude. Some of my friends ordered appetizers and the waiter seemed livid. I ordered from the right side of the menu so why should I get the cold treatment?
"Insanely large and delicious pasta dishes, I got three meals out of mine!  Very busy and very crowded, great for groups since it's so loud, I can't imagine how you would be able to hear each other on a date.  Portions are huge and the specials are always tempting.  Nothing revolutionary, try the linguini san remo if they have it.  definitely, definitely need reservations; that little stretch of old town is crazy popular on the weekends.three stars because while the food is great, service is just meh and i'm not sure how often i'll actually come back."
This is a restaurant we frequent.  Good food.  Huge portion.  Fun place.
Topo was recommended by the concierge at Hotel James - turned out to be just what we were looking for. Soup of the day was chicken and rice - outstanding. Eggplant alla Parmigianan was excellent as was Campanelle alla Norma. The waitstaff was extremely attentive. We will come back here the next time we visit Chicago.
"A consistently good-to-great experience. With autumn in the air I pine for osso buco on a bed of saffron risotto and a big Tuscan red. My partner wants hearty fresh pasta with cream-based sauces and spits on slavish devotion to health concerns that compromise taste, texture and authenticity. The service is unobtrusive and well-informed. I really really like Topo Gigio and it has always lived up to my lofty expectations for complete contentment."
"I was here once with another couple and I loved it! The atmosphere, the service, the wine and the pasta were great! Definitely will come a again!"
"Food was stellar, wine was amazing and the service was TOP of the line!! We waited a long time on a Friday night to get in to this place and it was worth every minute of the wait! I cannot wait to go back =)"
"I live close by and have gone to Topo Gigio twice.  The first time was ok, the second was as well, until the food poisoning set in a few hours later... Needless to say, I will not return."
"Very loud with tables close together, italian-family style.   A bit on the plain side with food, standard italian fare, definitely catering to the American crowd - those portions, yowza!   I had great company, so good memories. A good place for groups, not for twosies."
"We just had a private function here in the upstairs room and everything was amazing. You'd never know such a nice, large, private dining space with tall ceilings was above the chaos of the outdoor eating and smaller lower level cafe.The service was great, the space has it's own private bar. People are still raving about it.  The entrees were great. My favorite I think is the bowtie pasta with salmon. YUM! You won't be disapointed. I would highly rec for a private dining place!"
"Definitely a ""wow"" experience. Went here after getting my nails done at Sanctuary next door. I got the shrimp/scallops on a bed of spinach. The scallops were perfectly seared and the shrimp were nicely-sized to say the least :) Love me some spinach too. Prompt., attentive, and friendly service too."
"Definitely a great Italian staple in the heart of Old Town on Wells. Dirty martini straight up, blue cheese olives. Whitefish with a lemon butter caper sauce, eggplant parm, tomato mozarella salad....hmmm...so good. My fam likes this place so much that we all ordered t-shirts with the mouse...yes, yes we did. Buon appetito!"
"Hands down, the WORST wine list in the city!"
"Rude, Inattentive, Grumpy Waiter Service, Rude, Self-Absorbed HostessMediocre Food"
"I am in love with their mussels and spaghetti. My boyfriend had the veal chop and loved every bite of it. The place was a tight fit, but when I arrived at the time of my reservation i was sat immediately. The wait staff was kind and informative, and the food was great! A nice feature of this restaurant is that it is right down the street from Second City. A perfect dinner and comedy show date is so easy to have. You have to try this traditional Italian joint in old town."
This is a decent restaurant - just like a trip to Little italy in NYC.  Nothing amazing or particularly unique but consistent and pleasant meals.
"There is not one bad thing I can say about this place. I made a reservation for 8:30 on Saturday night. We showed up and there was a massive crowd of people waiting to be seated. The hostess was SO sweet. She just had a great attitude about her.  I love seeing someone in control like that and still able to maintain a positive attitude. By the time we ordered our wine, our table was ready. We got seated and immediately got bread and water.  Our waiter was efficient, nice and quick.  I ordered the Farfalle with Salmon (I forget the proper name and am too lazy to look it up).  It was DELICIOUS.  My friend ordered a pasta special which included a variety of fish. She loved it.   This place is great for a girl's night out, a date, etc.... pretty much any occassion with anyone (I wouldn't encourage kids because it is pretty small).   I absolutely love this place."
"Great place.  Went here for a friend's birthday.  I ordered the white fish (wanted something light) and tried my girlfriend's tortellini.  The white fish tasted how you would expect, but the fish itself was huge.  We came as a dinner party of about 12, and everyone seemed to love the food.  However, we were seated 45 min and ate about 90 minutes after our reservation time.  Despite this, the service was still great."
"Honestly, probably the best prosciutto I've had in a restaurant in America.  So fantastically good, I'd go back just for that.  But actually, I also enjoyed my dinner salad and pasta dish, so there's no downside here.  The menu actually feels more authentic Italian than a lot of places in Chicago.  I think it's the fact that the meat dishes are very predominant, and the pasta dishes are a little more than basic.  I have no qualms about recommending this for huge portions at reasonable prices--and delicious food."
"Yes, the food is solid and I haven't been bored with the menu (even though I've eaten there the past two nights in a row... so what. Who's keeping tabs?). Plenty of things here to please a diverse crowd, and I generally agree with the other yelpers that it is a great neighborhood place. What really does it for me, though, is the outdoor patio. Although it is a good place to go with friends, I wouldn't think twice about heading out there on my own for a great meal or just a drink. For those times when you just need to be alone in a crowd, or if you feel like chatting it up with some fellow diners, the patio is a nice escape... even if it is just down the block."
"Went there on a Saturday night, had a bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it. Was expecting it to be much more expensive than it was. Most pastas were in the $13-$17 range. Wine started around $7.50 a glass.Really enjoyed my dinner, the mussels we got as an appetizer, and the bread was hot, fresh, and delicious.My wife's been there for lunch, and said they have good deals then as well."
"Very rarely will I comment about service when it is bad, unless it is REALLY BAD.  I went for lunch at Topo Gigio apparently during ""shift change.""  -- is that the excuse for not bring us water, when we sat down, having to ask for our bread 4 times, getting our salads with our meal (when specifically we asked for the salads to be brought out first), and them completely failing to bring the host of the meal his dinner so we all had to wait for his meal to arrive (acward lapse in delivery while our meals got cold)?  Then when I mentioned the poor service to the manager he responded by saying ""I'll look into it.""  No apologies, no ""Oh, I'm sorry"" ... ""I'll look into it"" .. I'm not asking for a free meal, not even a free drink, I'm just asking for a nice, relaxing lunch with what used to be good food and okay service.  Now it's terrible service and not such great food .......Shame on you, Topo... ""thank you, please, I'm sorry"" goes a long way ....."
"Great place in Old Town.   Wonderful white-fish with capers and tiramasu.   Very good service.   Consistently an enjoyable place to eat dinner.   It's a good date place.     The table next to us ordered spaghetti and meatballs..... it looked  incredible.   I plan to try that next time.   Parking can be a challenge, it's better if you live nearby and can walk there."
Cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere. Excellent(and huge!) pasta dishes.
"Usually great service, great prices, efficient service.  every once in a while, on busy nights you get forgotten a little.  Been going there for 10 years, i like a lot."
"Boy oh boy. Honestly, I was a bit hesistant when we sat down. I am more into americanized italian food- lasagna with lots of marinara, pizza. The menu here has mostly itialian phrases that left me feeling pretty ignorant. I found something on the menu that had a couple words that I was familiar with and went for broke. Could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Plenty of food and it was incredibly delicious. I had CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA- which all I could really tell is that it was seashell pasta and creamy tomato sauce. It was unreal- pasta perfectly cooked, just a touch of heat, sauce rich but not overwhelming and twice as much as I could possibly eat. My wife ordered the Tortellini and it was nearly as awesome. I haven't even mentioned the service- incredibly attentive and warm without being overbearing. Best meal I had in Chicago. Highly recommended."
Amazing! It was very fresh and had great flavor. The portions are huge though.
"What a fantastic night!  When we arrived, we were told to be prepared for a bit of a wait, even though we had reservations.  However, they were able to get us a table for four within 5 minutes.I ordered a sauteed eggplant dish with a glass of pinot noir.  Next time, I will be sure to split the entree.  They are enourmous!  But it makes for great leftovers (just finished my dish for breakfast).I will definitely go back, either on another double date or even with some friends."
"Wow. Just wow. There's amazing people watching to be had at Topo Gigio.Topo Gigio has very interesting friends. There was a whole table of interesting friends there the other night, when simon and I stopped in for ""just a drink"" that turned into just a drink, bread, and an entree after the soul crushing ""Babel"" at Piper's Alley. The first sign that TGs friends were out in full force was a table full of Sopranos-looking men with a gaggle of scantily-clad, fully-made up, large chested (D or E?) women who could have no profession other than the obvious. Was it the fellas from Bada Bing out for a celebratory dinner? Perhaps, but we didn't have the guts to ask.The table livened up the entire dining room. A long table of women faced the probable dancers, and scowled most of the night. Even Simon, whose preference for women usually runs toward the xy chromosome, was gaping, eyes as large as saucers. And the food? It was fine. The rosemary chicken was almost perfectly done - crisp skin, slightly dry breast meat -- but who really cared? There were dancers with huge bosoms in the house!"
"Seems like typical Italian food - nothing to write home to mama about.  Granted, I was here for a corporate holiday event, so maybe I didn't receive the 'true' dining experience, but I just thought it was so-so.  The salad was drowning in dressing, the pasta was good, and the bread was even better.  I didn't stick around for dessert because all my co-workers were too drunk to be tolerated (which means the bar service must have been good!).However, I'd probably come back next time I'm in Old Town to see if I like it more when I'm not surrounded by a bunch of intoxicated suits."
Have always loved this place. We live close and have gone a few times with out of town guests.  We spent Mother's Day there even.  So did Bonnie Hunt! :)  She sat a table away.
I have been going to Topo Gigio since it was across the street in a tiny little space on the east side of Wells St. in the early 1990s.   I celebrated the signing of my first lease for our first Fleet Feet Sports store on North Ave in 1996.  Even today the food stands on its own as excellent.  I am partial to the Tortellini Soup and the Rigatoni al filo de Fumo.  It is my favorite lunch time meeting establishment for business affairs.  A great place for a date or to bring your mom and dad to introduce them to great Chicago dining.I am looking forward to smoking leaving the bar portion on the restaurant when the smoking ban goes into effect.
"Here for dinner, 8 of us. My Chicken and Italian sausage dinner was huge, compared to the other meals. The Chicken was dry but overall a good place for dinner. Has an outside area to sit as well."
"Some of the most incredible Italian I've ever enjoyed, at an amazing price too!  It's worth the wait!  Spaghetti ai Fruitti di Mare was memorable, was sad I couldn't finish it!  Polenta and Portobella app was different than anything that I have ever tasted, but LOVED it!"
"Above average food, fun/lively atmosphere. The bartenders are awesome, the servers can be a bit aloof and short in patience. Summer has a great patio. Dont forget to ask for specials, usually worth hearing."
"Editing my review after a great experience at Topo Gigio last night.  The service here is excellent, and the food is even better.  It's great for a casual date night.  I had the Gargenelle con le Luganighe, a handrolled pasta similar to penne.  Cooked to perfection!!  I was with my boss, who had the Farfalle ai du Salmoni - Bowtie pasta with salmon.  She said it was wonderful.  The food came out very quickly, and we were very satisfied with our meal.  Topo's is definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city."
"This place is wonderful. It seems like its always busy, but they make you feel welcome. The bartenders are great and so is the food. They create things in more of a ""Roman"" style of cooking and the flavors blend perfectly. Their sauces are elegant.  The wine list is more than adequate for an Italian restaurant and their reds, in particular, are worth checking out.  Its a great neighborhood place where the patrons are friendly and relaxed. An indoor and outdoor bar gives you options depending on the crowd and weather.  The owners are a family who are very involved in running the restaurant.  You'll see the occasional sports celebrity there, which is fun, but its really about making you feel like this is ""your place"".   Do yourself a proper and check it out."
"After living here for four years, I finally made it this vaunted Chicago restaurant.  We arrived right on time for our schedule reservation, waited the requisite few minutes and were seated much quicker than I anticipated. It was fun hearing my name yelled out about 15 or 20 minutes later.  Apparently, they forgot to mark us down as having been seated.  So when I raised my hand and told him I was seated, the Maitre D was a bit astonished that we were seated, but pleased he no longer had to look for us.The service was a bit gruff at times, but from what I understand that is part of the charm with Topo Gigio.  Our meals were delivered quickly and were quite fresh.  The caprese di bufalo was very nice.  It's interesting as this was apparently a special for that night.  Doesn't seem wrong that caprese is not a regular item at an Italian restaurant?  Hopefully I just missed something.My chicken dish was pretty good. I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped, but honestly, I think it was the result of my poor decision, not the food itself.  I just shouldn't have ordered something smothered in mozzarella cheese.  It was tasty, but by the time I actually ate, I didn't want a dish smothered in cheese.  Regardless, it didn't stop me from cleaning my plate.All told, we had a lovely time enjoying some good food and lively conversation with good friends.  This is a great place for group dining with it's lovely, lively atmosphere."
"It's been a while since I've been back to good ol' Topo Gigio. Partly because there's always a huge wait to get in. I can understand why though as the food is delicious and solid. They have a killer outdoor patio, which is perfect on a warm summer night in Chicago. Good food, good wine, good people, what more could you ask for?"
Went here in January when I was in town visiting family.  What a great spot - looks like they have outdoor seating for warmer weather.  The food and wine was delicious - great array of apps and entrees.  I look forward to a future visit on our next trip to the windy city!
"I live down the street from Topo and my roommate and I love going there for a nice, good, reasonably priced meal. We've been there for lunch as well, and I wasn't too impressed with the 'insalata di gamberi'- the dressing was a little too acidic for my liking. The pasta, however, tastes amazingly fresh.. That, combined with the service and ambiance, makes for a truly enjoyable dining experience."
"Good Italian food but didn't knock my socks off.  Fantastic location and very nice outdoor seating.  The minnestrone soup was probably the best item we had.  Bread was good, too.  The table had several pastas, all of which were above average.  Service was not as attentive as it should be.  Would go back but not in a rush to do so."
"Love this place!My dad and I have a ritual where he'll drive downtown, pick me up at work and take me to lunch.  We started this about 2 years ago, and this is our spot.  The pasta is always served steaming hot, the bread perfectly crispy.  My personal favorite is the grilled salmon salad with mushrooms and asparagus.  If I'm here for dinner, I dive head first into the pasta dishes.  None of them disappoint.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  The servers are attentive without being overbearing.  Topo Gigio comes highly recommended!!"
"I made reservations to eat with some out-of-town visitors, and we found the service to be pretty good, although we did eat a little early. My pasta was excellent. We enjoyed the sidewalk view from our table. Located on a very nice block in Old Town, so it makes for a good post-dinner stroll. Good place to take visitors before or after seeing a show at Second City."
"I can't believe the reviews this place gets!The service was horrible!  We ate inside, with hardly anyone inside. And outside wasn't that crowded.  It took forever to get waited on.  It took forever to get our check.  The waiter always came at inappropriate times, but never really when we actually needed him.My date got the spaghetti with calamari and muscles with spaghetti sauce.I got chicken beast covered with spinach and mozzarella cheese.There was nothing good about what either of us got.  My meal tasted like it was a Smart Choice meal you can pick up at Jewel and microwave.  My date hardly enjoyed what was on her plate and expected much more.The only exciting thing was the people watching.  Otherwise, please heed my advice and ignore this place. Unless you are stopping by for a drink and too socialize."
"My favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. Went last Saturday and had the best spaghetti and mat balls and Tiramisu ever. Generous portions and a very cozy environment. The waiters are Mexican and that means better service. Fair prices, didn't have wine so Ill have to go back and check that out."
"good food. bad service.it was really busy but still no excuse - waiter was MIA most of the night and even managed to miss our neighbor's mini-bonfire that we helped put out and clean up by ourselves.But i'm here to write about the food - fresh bread and olive oil started us off and the carpaccio app which actually was pretty large and had capers, which i love. For entree: PICCATINA di VITELLA al LIMONEvery nice - 3 big pieces of veal!Food was very good regardless of service.We ordered a small carafe of their house chianti - the price is rather cheap but then again the wine wasn't too great so you get what you par for! reasonable prices for great food."
"During a recent jaunt to Chicago, I had one absolute goal in mind: eat a fantastic Italian meal. Since my knowledge of restaurants in Chicago is pretty much nonexistent, I can't pit this against any other places. Generally though, I'd have to say that my meal at Topo Gigio was a great experience. My friends and I placed reservations for dinner at 8:30, and arrived about ten minutes before this. Place was buzzin' and bumpin' with patrons overflowing. While this was a good sign, I was suddenly worried that our reservations were meaningless. And of course, they were. We ended up waiting for about 40 minutes, so we were not seated until well after 9 pm. If we had other plans lined up, this would have been unacceptable. However, we had the time to kill, although our stomachs were seeing (feeling?) red at this time. Being that it was a Saturday night and it was butt freezing cold outside, I could understand the capacity maxing out. But it was a bit annoying as the space is tight and standing by the doorway is a definite fire hazard. At one point, I must have looked pretty pissed, because the manager caught my eye and then sent a hostess over to my party to apologize for the long wait, and then offered us free drinks (alcohol inclusive). I thought this was a really good way to handle the situation, because I immediately softened and stopped thinking hateful thoughts in that moment. Wine, especially when comped, always bodes well with me.When we were finally seated, we scored one of the best tables in the house, which was atop a small raised platform in the corner so it was intimate but also nice because we could watch the rest of the room and patrons. As for the food, firstly I was AMAZED by how quickly we were serviced. After ordering, our crab cake appetizer was before us less than 10 minutes. While this was delicious, I could have used much more as it was only one cake. So good! We barely finished the crab cake when our entrees were served. I decided to go with the linguine with baby clams, one of my favorite dishes. This definitely delivered for me, simple yet flavorful and rich, but not in a heavy way. My friend opted for a pasta dish featuring shrimp and spinach, which was done very well. Even though we were full, we couldn't pass up on the desserts. And so we decided on a pistachio gelato and a berry shortcake. Both were light and the right amount of sweet, and even though I was ready to blow chunks, I made sure that we wouldn't leave any behind.Solid food, nice atmosphere, good service...next time I'm in the Windy City, I'll visit again."
"Fantastic neighborhood joint! When my husband and I lived in the area, we got to know the host and waitstaff pretty well. They were always very gracious and even managed to seat a party of 8 of us on a Friday night, prime time, with no reservation.  WOW.  Plus, the food here is consistently great - you know how the quality of food can vary at a restaurant depending on who's cooking, day of the week, etc.  Not at Topo - everything is always fantastic.  If you dine in, try the antipasto platter - all fresh and authentic.  You can never go wrong with the Joe's Salad and the CONCHIGLIE alla SARDA - amazing tomato cream sauce, fresh peas - yum!"
"This restaurant was a great surprise. Topo Gigio has excellent service and classic Italian dishes. The rigatoni dish was light and not loaded down with sauce and didn't lack any taste. The Insalata Mista salad was light and refreshing. For our main dish we had the FILETTO di MANZO al BAROLO which was also nice but was a little bland, and my favorite part was the cannoli! I've only had cannoli once before and i didn't really enjoy it, but the cannoli here are fantastic!"
"Never a bad meal at Topo Gigio. Very fresh which is huge in italian cuisine,  delicious and great atmosphere!"
"This place has a nice ambiance, but the food is pretty good.  Not great but pretty good.  The service is good.  Check it out!"
"Wish I could give 2.5 stars.  This place is average at best, and the italian food is no better than at most chain italian restaurants (think Carrabba's, Romano's, etc).  I particularly found the food to be loaded with salt, with the sauce typically overpowering the dishes.  Our waiter faking an italian accent was a nice touch, but I definitely won't be going back - for this quality of ""italian"" food, I'd rather go to Pasta Palazzo."
"I loved this place.  It's very well priced for the quality of food that it is.  We went on a Monday night around 10.  That way, we knew we would be able to get in.  I would not try to get into this place on a weekend, especially if you plan on parking.  Nonetheless, the food was really really good and the waiter was charming and classy."
"DELICIOUS!!!  I have been here 5 or more times and that was just for catered events held in their upstairs banquet area but every single time we have been there for a family get together it has been amazing!  The service, food and ambiance all get two thumbs up from me.  Granted, I have not eaten there as just a regular dining customer but I can't imagine things would be any different.  I have done carry-out with them as well and that was just as good as eating there. :)Wish I had a party coming up that I was going to there... :)"
"Topo has a great atmosphere as soon as you walk in the door.  You get a lot of attention from the waitstaff.  They are very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  The outdoor pation area is nice, a little closed in if you like to have a view.  It can be very cozy for a date though.  You get a basket of fresh bread with amazingly awesome olive oil and cheese.  I love oil dipped bread and this oil is light and fresh tasting.  My friend and I shared a seafood salad, grilled calamari and shrimp mostly with just a tiny bit of lettuce underneath.  Just the right drizzle of more the amazing olive oil was over the lettuce. The waiter didn't even bat an eye when we asked to split the salad, they are HUGE!  When the pasta dish came that were also going to share, we had no room and had to take it to go.   The prices are slightly high but it is the neighborhood and the atmosphere you are paying a higher premium for."
"Very good!  Pasta was fresh, service was a little hurried, but hey, it was a Saturday night so I wasn't expecting something overly fantastic.  They have the usual nice warm crusty bread with olive oil/parm cheese for a starter, which is delicious.  I had a pasta dish with fresh veggies and pomodoro sauce, and it was very enjoyable.  Other diners in my party also enjoyed their food (eggplant parmesan, half roasted chicken, some salads, etc)....whenever I venture out to second city again, I will be sure to enjoy more pasta @ Topo Gigio!"
Entrees were excellent... Highly Recommend the tortellini.... The bread was disappointing--- hard and lacked flavor--- but everything else including the service and price was great!
"My favorite old town joint and definitely in my top restaurant choices.  Love the food, love the ambiance.  I always order the seashell pasta with tomato cream sauce and shrimp and it is DELICIOUS (just FYI, that combo isn't on the menu and they are always friendly about changing up the order)!Definitely worth going to..."
"My experience can be summed up in one word...Enjoyable.Having grown up in a family-owned Italian restaurant, I certainly appreciated the simplicity of the menu; chalk full of staple Italian dishes done well and with an affordable price tag.I had the advantage of dining with a larger group, which always makes it easier to try more menu items; especially when portion sizes are generous.  We ordered an array of appetizers for the table including Polenta and Portabella Mushrooms, Crab Cakes, Prosciutto di Parma, and Grilled Calamari.  All were very satisfying, but the Polenta and Portabella was probably my favorite as the mushroom sauce was flavored perfectly.  The Prosciutto di Parma, of course, was also extremely delectable and the fresh mozzarella included on the plate was VERY scrumptious.My main course was the Pollo Fiorentina, chicken covered in spinach and cheese (what's not to like), served with Asparagus and Roasted Potatoes.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection, just al dente enough to still taste slightly crispy, and the best part about the meal was that it was HOT; this may seem like a pretty silly thing to be excited about but there are way too many restaurants that overlook this.  This probably  speaks to the expedient service staff's ability to deliver our food promptly from the service line in the kitchen.  Snaps to them....Dessert was only OK...  I ordered the Tiramisu, a dish for which I have very high standards, and it did not meet the mark...  wish I would have ordered gelato instead...  We live an learn.Again, I will reiterate the only word that comes to mind... ""enjoyable"".  This is a great place for a casual meal with friends and/or family ."
"there are a few restaurants i can always count on when i have visitors, or a special occasion to celebrate. when italian is on our agenda, this is one of my top two choices. they take reservations, for one, and stick to the seating time. i'm asian, but i swear, everyone from the greeter and waiters to the busboys treat me like i'm family. and even when it's crazy busy, the service is just attentive enough.it's bustling, not quiet, but not too noisy to catch up on out of town gossip, and the menu is extensive enough to suit everyone's tastes. wine is affordable, and desserts are yummy, but i'm usually too full to have any!"
"Absolutely scrumptious Italian food.  Great Great Great service and save room for the dessert.  We had the Tiramasu and it was very unique and delicious!  To boot, it's in my neighborhood so I can go back for a $4 cab ride."
