Señor Pan
"A most perfect lunch joint for takeout, couples, or small groups. Family friendly.The ropa vieja sandwich is the only true way to go.  It's saucey and savory.  It is hard to chew, and will get in your teeth, but I tell you, my friends... SO worth it! the bread they serve the sandwich on soaks up the sauce in a complimenting way.... *salivating in nostalgia*I have tried the pulled pork/lechon sandwich which is also good, but fares on the drier side.Don't count on the chips that come with the sandwiches. I think they're okay, but papery, and sometimes lack in flavor.  Needs like a cajun seasoning, or something with a kick. Instead, order a side of sweet plantains! can't go wrong.Ive tried the champagne soda - DELISH!also had the flan, which was also really good, drizzed in caramel. Very thick, creamy, and condensed in flavor. If only I lived closer... this would definitely become a guilty pleasure. It is definitely worth a drive to. On the plus side... they're open pretty early! since they offer bakeryish items, I believe they're open at 8am. they also offered a pretty nice groupon deal and yelp offer, last i checked."
"I grew up in Miami and Cuban food is my absolute favorite cuisine. Which is why I wanted to like this place so much. I haven't had any of the sandwiches - I hope to do this another day, but of the things I've had, I've been fairly disappointed. - Fried Pork Chunks- Churrasco- Ropa Vieja- Lechon Asada- Milanesa- Cuban Sampler PlatterI wouldn't order any of these again - overcooked, dry, or oversalted. The platter probably had the most interesting stuff and a ton of food so I'd recommend that if you haven't had it anything like it before. I will say that the interior and atmosphere was quite nice and made for a nice date night."
"I love there food especially the sandwiches, but there is one thing I wish they would fix the lechon is kind of salty. Overall best place to get some quick Cuban food. Taking out is great as well as rating in, been here with the family and just a date night. Atmosphere is amazing for any type of occasion."
"I found another great restaurant on Yelp.  Señor Pan is rated 4 1/2 stars w/1$ sign.  We went Sunday night around 7 pm and the restaurant was packed.  There are 2 locations.  The location we went to @ 4615 W Fullerton Ave.   They have a large menu with very reasonable prices & the food we had was very good.I had the Masitas de Puerco Fritas.  This is Deep-fried pork chunks were very tasty, but a little dry w/red onions, yellow rice was very good as were the plantains all for $10.95.  We also ordered Ropa Vieja shredded beef in tomato creole sauce & The Choice beef Churrasco Cubano was very good.Good food, good service and huge portions (I have lunch tomorrow).  Best of all Yelp had $40.00 worth of food for $20.00 & we all had left overs on all 3 dishes"
"I  am still sitting here in writing this review. This place is a wonderful establishment. Wonderful music ambiance. The food is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I came here on a whim and so glad we did. If you are in the area and need an option to give you that itis, this is it!"
Our waiter was nice the girl that cleaned the table had a bit of an attitude . I had steak with fried plantains and garlic sauce. The meat was rather frisky and tasted steamed . They needed salt . Black bean soup was mediocre and tepud. My brothers yellow rice wA seasoned good along with his pork . On the dry side but flavor was good. His wife had a steak stew was didi. The bread was good
"It's pretty sad that lately I have not been impressed with their sandwiches or the cafe con leche. They just changed the bread they use for the sandwiches so now I feel like they taste different and not in a good way. The cafe con leche has just been  ""blah"" as well with no real taste. Sucks that they pre-make the cafe con leche and just keep it in a carafe there unlike before where they used to make it for you on the spot when you order it. Might have to start to look for a new Cuban sandwich place in the area since I'm pretty sure there have to be other places....sad day for me!"
"I have eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed. Staff has always been welcoming and very polite. I always order the ham egg n cheese omelette because it is always so fresh.   I will continue to be a customer as long as they continue with the great service and reasonable prices. Thank you, Señor Pan!"
"Great experience. Pleasant staff. Try the mango smoothie, it's the best."
"I got the $20 for $40 yelp deal for me and my son and it was great. My only complaint is that they ran out of 2 signature Cuban dishes that we wanted to try (Ropa Vieja and Congri). We were there on a Monday so we got the lechon asado special with white rice and black beans. And also a steak with totstones and yellow rice. For the most part everything was really good. The lechon was a little too salty for me, but it had good flavor. We had a cafe con leche and a cortadito after dinner with a pastelitos de guayaba, one with cheese and one without. Definitely prefer the one with cheese. Overall a great place to eat and listen to some great music."
The food is great but the service sucks. Maybe it's because they are always packed but usually our table gets ignored.
"Came to dinner on a Sunday night it was really busy took a while before I was greeted and shown to a table. Once seated my girlfriend and I waited for a waiter and to much disappointment someone who was seated after us got attended to first. The customer service wasn't that great that night maybe they were understaffed. However appetizers of tostones and empanadas arrived pretty quickly I enjoyed it all the freshness of the tostones was amazing and the dipping sauce was to die for! I ordered a steak sandwich was was pretty good could've used more meat it was a bit skimpy but nonetheless good my friend ordered the same thing and enjoyed it as well. Overall the food is great, parking lot SUCKS!!! And the customer service was EH. If in the neighbor I will give it another go"
"I chose this restaurant initially only because it was close to the Honduran Consulate AND there was an amazing ""coupon"". After having a wonderful fabulous meal in a pleasant atmosphere (do NOT let the exterior play a role at all) I now am looking forward to returning to Chicago with other friends ONLY to share the experience!"
$20 for $40 Yelp coupon?!?!?! Ummmmm yes please!!! Alcohol included forvthat deal as well!!! Very delicious Cuban food and customer service that makes you feel like youre at home. One of my favorite Cuban places in Chicago for brunch.
"I went with my family, 7 in total, the waiting was a little to much, only one person taking orders when it was pack, need more servers, they need to be more friendly! The food was good!"
Love their food! so affordable always craving it!
"Great atmosphere--all servers are wearing fedoras and the music to the decor makes you feel like you're in Cuba. Very hard working staff. Our server Gloria was amazing!!!Large menu with unbeatable prices. Bomb, fresh mojitos. Ropa vieja  was incredible, delicious creole sauce that tenderized the shredded beef. You gotta get the cassava--so flavorful because they cook it with onion. My girlfriend got the Cuban. She thought it was a little too salty. All she could taste was the bread and salty. She thought it could use a little more meat in the sandwich.Croquettes were fried to perfection. The cheese one reminds me a little of a mozzarella stick but with WAY more flavor.You need to come out to hermosa to check this place out!"
Best Cuban sandwich in  Chicago. I love this place and there employees. I highly recommend it.
"Love the ropa vieja sandwich! Mmmm if I ate this as much as I craved it, I would be in trouble. Always good food, sometimes the service is lacking especially when they are very busy."
"Senor Pan has some great deals on Yelp - a free small cortadito when you check in, and a $40 for $20 deal. That was totally worth purchasing for a group of 3.The parking is scarce, that part wasn't fun. Once we got in, we felt right at home. It is open and clean, with lots of Cuban decor. It's casual, but not a hole-in-the-wall. They have plenty to choose from on their menu. I decided to go with the vieja ropa, and it did not disappoint. It was everything I had hoped it would be. The tostones were great too. Overall the food is cheap - the portions are just enough to fill you up. We were worried about not being able to spend $40, but we made it happen! The mojito was great too.The service was not great. Our servers switched...and we never really knew who was serving us. They did not come very often (for having 3 servers we should have seen at least one) - we had to flag them down a few times. We were never really asked if we wanted another drink. We waited forever for the check. We had to ask for water twice. We said we didn't want sugar in our coffee, but it still came with sugar. And we didn't get a good-bye. Food, awesome and cheap. Service...meh."
"I was so pleasantly surprised that this place delivers! We ordered from here twice  and both times it's correct, piping hot and within the expected delivery time."
"Loved this place! It's a little far from my home, but totally worth it. The staff here was tremendously friendly and gave myself and my family a nice warm welcome. We all ordered the Bistec Encebollado and chose the sweet plantains for the side. Those Plantains were delicious!!! I wanted to order another side of those. The steak with the onions were good as well. We decided to go with the rice with the black beans mixed in and that was also good.The yelp deal is totally worth it. I bought the $20.00 for $40.00 worth of food. If you check in on Yelp you also get a free Cortadito. For dessert we had the flan. I'm usually not a fan of flan, but this was really good. It tasted like it was dipped in some type of caramel sauce.Other positives about the restaurant is the parking. There's a parking lot, but also tons of free street parking. I would totally make the trip back to try other items. I asked the waitress for other suggestions and she said the Pork meal was also great."
"This place is 5 minutes away from my house and I've never been here it's a clean little restaurant for me service was pretty quick, I just thought that the neat would be a little more wet not so dry,the empanadas were pretty good I just don't feel like there's enough meat in the food."
"Food was great! Good portions and decent prices too. Our server was very attentive as well. Will be back for sure. The empenadas were yummy! Went there with my wife and had a appetizer and 3 dinners! Skirt steak,steak n onions and fried pork."
Get the Cuban sandwich de pollo with avocado. You're welcome.It's delicious and less than $5! I suggest calling your order in ahead of time if you don't plan to dine it because it can take a while as they are quite popular in the area.Small parking lot (though the inside is a nice size) so carpool or get carry out.Enjoy!
"Senor Paaaaan! So happy we found this place.Small, cozy, hole-in-wall Cuban food with nice/fast service and delicious homey food. We tried the Pollo Asado and the Lechon Asado with yellow rice, beans, and plantains - all of which was super tasty and abundant. Best plantains ever. Meat also excellent. Super reasonable prices. I plan on coming here often!"
Food was very good. Lechon sandwich and cuban were excellent. Cant ever go wrong with white rice and blk beans. Mojitos are good here.
"This place is the greatest. They have cheap stuff, their food is delicious, and their portions are gigantic. I don't know what else a person could want here...but they probably have that, too."
"Service always seems to be lacking. I don't think they're trying to be rude but good luck getting a hold of your waiter. Whenever we come we have to order drinks, our food and any other extras all at once:  ""can you bring the hot sauce with our food, oh and the salt. And the sugar too. Perhaps some extra napkins, some water and the bill. Have a nice life.""Anyway, the food is good not great."
I normally get good service not today. The cashier was on a personal call talking about the mall. And the manager was counting the tip jar. Waited 5 minutes for service.
Love love love the food! Staff is great and always very friendly. Love that you can call in your order ahead of time. Try their breakfast sandwich it's one of my favorites.
"FOUND A HAIR IN MY FOOD!  THIS PLACE ISN'T what it used to be. I've been coming here for many years and the chicken tasted old, and I found a hair in my food. I showed the waitress and the manager offered free dessert and still charged for the meal. Bad customer service and food... I will not be coming back."
excellent cuban steak and chicken breast- very busy place- wait staff is very nice.  Good coffee too
Do not take this three star as a bad review. The food is good. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. and the place itself is welcoming. A great place for you to take you friends or significant other. The mango shake is delicious as well as the yuca fritas. But unfortunately that is as far as I have gone on the menu. I am sure once I venture out of my safe zone that I will not be unpleased.
Great Cuban food!!! Ropa Vieja terrific. Great food. Awesome service.
"After watching Jon Favreau's new movie, ""Chef,"" I was hankering for some authentic Cuban food. Luckily, there's quite a few choices in Chicago, and I decided on Senor Pan. It turned out to be a solid choice.The place has a very casual and relaxed ambience. The food comes out incredibly fast and is cooked to perfection. We ordered an appetizer plate with a cubano and a skirt steak entrée, with an iced coffee. And with the yelp coupon on the app, you can really get more for your money.You can bang the bongos on your way out to tell the staff they did a great job. And believe me, I banged the hell out those bongos.Will definitely be back for more Kola Champagne."
"Very good, authentic Cuban food. We loved it! We started off with the empanada trio and yuca con mojo, both great appetizers. For the entrée we had the ropa vieja and cuban sandwich both which were amazing dishes. Prices are reasonable. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good music. I would def come here again.Would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the bathrooms. A little disgusted at how they were maintained. Needs maintenance and a good cleaning. I wasn't pleased with the condition of the bathrooms."
"Great ropa vieja, empanadas, and cortadito.  The food was very good and reasonably priced.   Nice decor and friendly staff. I bought the yelp deal so I can come back."
"Delicious and authentic. The empanadas trio and their chimichurri sauce stay on my mind. Along with their ropa vieja, steak, maduros and tostones. The garlic sauce that comes with them is a different version than I've seen but so good! Their piña colada is perfect. It is better quality and authenticity compared to other Cuban restaurants in Chicago. I went the day I saw it on Chicago's Best and will continue to return and bring more friends. Reminds me of one of my favorite Cuban restaurants in Miami. It's very clean and food comes out in a timely fashion. Sweet, Cuban waitstaff as well."
Definitely I would recommend this place and everyone is super friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Cuban food
"Errrthang was SOOO GOOODD! and they also had great music that was playing.. made me want to get funkyyy LOL!  For appetizers, I got the chicken, beef, shredded beef, and ham and cheese empanada. Fav one is the Ham and Cheese! You must order that one! I also ordered the Lechon Asado Entree, I've tried both the Cubano Sandwich and the Bistec Encebollado A Caballo!!! from my cousins. It was DAA bomb! Our check came out to be $76 BUT we got a voucher deal which is you pay $20 worth of $40 of food! how amazing is that!?! So we ended up paying about around $32! all because of the voucher!Will definitely come back here again...but with a date ;)  OH and dont forget to check in so you can get a free cortadito!"
"After a party night in Chicago, next day me and my boy got up hungry!!!! and yelping for breakfast places I found señor pan. We got an AWESOME deal on yelp,  for $20.00 we could spend $40.00 which I found it a lot of money for breakfast. At the beginning I wasn't sure to go or not because it was out of my area but and the end we decided to go. When I walked to the restaurant I found it so nice just when I walked in. Place look very clean was packed and smell like yummy Cuban food. Me and my boy ordered right away Cuban cortadito (coffee) and a trio of empanadas and and must say WOW. Coffee was just on point it was so delicious probably best coffee so far in Chicago. Empanadas had enough meat inside and were tasty. Then we ordered our main dishes I ordered pork roast  with Cuban rice (rice with black beans) and fry yuca. My boy ordered deep fry pork cube Cuban rice and plantain. I can't not express myself how AMAZING was this food it was so good everything and they serves so much we both have to take it to go. This Cuban place is def in my top 10 best restaurants I have been in the city is very hard for me to give 5 Stars but señor pan deserve it. Place, waitress, atmosphere, coffee, appetizers, food everything was excellent."
I normally love Señor Pan but I ordered take out today that was not that great. The black beans were super watery. The sweet plantains were not cooked through. The steak was great but I was disappointed with the sides today. Not sure if I'll be back but if I do it will take a while to get these watery beans out and raw plantains out of my mind. What happened Señor?
"Everything (minus) parking = A~W~E~S~O~M~EI have been here a few times ordering in and a few times to grab lunch to go.  Let me start with the few minor things before letting you know why they are all trivial and worth going through to eat here.First, parking can be a pain.  The lot is about as big as the restaurant itself, but there IS street parking.  The last time I had the medianoche it was served on not the typical medianoche bread but some strange soft not sweet bread.  Miss the usual.  Lastly yelp deal is dine in only.  However, dining in is the way to go for this restaurant, and let me tell you why my friend.Dine in for food & superior service beyond compare.  Came on Thursday night with some gals to get our dinner & drinks on.  Had a round of mojitos (which were very good).  A few appetizers (the ham croquetas and empanada trio are a must).  And we each had a different entree which comes with your choice of rice, beans, and side.  Oh my so much food.  There were plenty of leftovers.Our server was extremely animated and joked around with us, and was helpful without being overbearing.  We ended up accidentally staying about 30 minutes past their closing (and they really didn't even hint at us to leave).  When we saw that half the restaurant had the chairs on the table we realized it was time to go.A thoroughly satisfactory evening of food and fun.  Remember to hit the bongos on your way out!"
All I ordered was the steak sandwiches and man they were good. My son loved it so much he asked for another while we were there and another one to take home. Great environment and friendly staff.
Delicious!! I love having breakfast lunch & dinner if I could! Great food awesome prices. .  I love the  Cafe ..  So good!
"Great food and attentive friendly service during our visit to this family restaurant. Running a successful restaurant in Chicago, no small feat in this city of so many wonderful places to eat! Appears they just opened another location in the Humboldt Park neighborhood.Packed out on a Sunday morning with happy families. Appetizers and entrees were authentic and tasty. My meal roadmap; start with side orders of yuca frita, yuca con mojo (cassava with a great garlic sauce), mariquitas (plantain chips . . again with the awesome garlic sauce) before moving on to my favorite entree, Masitas de Puerco Fritas (fried pork). Amazingly good! Finish up with a cuban coffee (cortadito). The only drawback of senor pan, inadequate parking for their popularity. No biggie, street parking is available if you act fast."
Tasty authentic Cuban food
Super nice atmosphere! I would go as far as as to say that it's the best Latin restaurant in the far Logan square area. Also their free yelp cortadito introduced me to my new favorite coffee drink. If you like your coffee with milk and sugar you have to try this!Friendly and courteous service. Will definitely be back!
"My experience at señor pan was a great one. the place was very clean, and a little more spacious then I expected. Our waitress and the entire staff was so friendly and welcoming, which just made the entire time pleasant. We tried the empandas, lechon con arroz main dish, and the #4 torta de bistec ( i added the american cheese and the avocado) & it was all great!we were happy because it was 3 of us, one of whom wasn't too hungry, so the waitress suggested she could split the lechon plate in half so that two people could share it. if you're up for something sweet do try their piña coladas, and their little guava & guava/cheese pastries they're delish!!!"
"It is time to update my review from June 2, 2014. We came here for an early breakfast and it was just A-OK. I am not sure what is happening at this location, but perhaps they have become somewhat complacent here. I had a breakfast sandwich that was a ""regular"" size. They have two sizes of sandwiches.  My sandwich contained scrambled eggs, ham with melted cheese circumposed on fresh Cuban grilled bread. The ham was aggerosed between the bread. This sandwich was very satisfying and meritorious. The exterior of the bread was crispy, but not to the point where you could scrape the roof of your mouth upon first bite. The interior of the bread was fluffy perfection. I rate my sandwich with 4-stars. I ordered a small Cuban coffee which was 10-stars worthy. They automatically put sugar in the coffee (without asking you how you would like your coffee). This is really BASIC customer service. Not everyone wants sugar in their coffee, and I don't ""DO"" sugar en mi cafe, so make sure you TELL THEM ""NO azucar"" when you order coffee here.Note: I was charged $1 for the ham and .50 cents for the cheese so the price of the sandwich jumped up from the price on the menu. They will custom-make any sandwich for you -- just ask. I still prefer the Cuban steak sandwiches from El Cubanito (a former ""hole in the wall"" on Pulaski near Wrightwood). My friend had the pan con timba. She was very disappointed. She indicated that the guava was not melted enough while the cheese was very melted. She stated that the highlight of her sandwich was actually the bread. I felt awful, because I recommended this place and it fell short for her expectations. I gave her the other half of my sandwich to redeem myself. She really enjoyed it and said she should have ordered what I had. Their Cuban coffee made up for the not-so-great pan con timba.  Her pan con timba received 3-stars. Her coffee, 5-stars. The sandwich that I shared with her received 5-stars. Sweet! I ordered one Flan for my friend ""to go"" and she sent me a Text saying, ""Wow, this Flan is super ethereal y por la maceta!""This place has a postage-stamp sized parking lot. They took over the space where the Domino's Pizza used to be, but the Domino's sign is still up for some weird reason. There is a super tall Cuban flag waving around outside, but it is easier to spot the flag and Domino's pizza sign FIRST before you spot this joint off the street. We had to ask for two waters. I assume that this should be the first thing they place on the table once you sit down and get settled at your table. Strke 1. Another negative was how super slow service was and it wasn't even crowded when we came for breakfast (four tables were occupied and they all had their food). Strike 2. We ordered a side of jamon croquetas. For some reason, they really, really tasted like the ones I have purchased in the freezer section at my local grocery store (Goya brand). Regardless, they were/are worthy of 4-stars. These were the perfect amalgamation to my breakfast sandwich. Las croquetas son deliciosa, so give them a try. Another negative here is NO free coffee refills, so order a LARGE coffee (the small one I had wasn't enough). No Free refills -- Strike 3. POSITIVES: (1) Portions are generous, and it is good, hearty, stick-to-your ribs comfort food; (2) They have a small parking lot; (3) Affordable price-point; and (4) Try their Ropa Vieja sandwich (tender/flavorful). Took one home for my husband and he said it was excellent.  SIDE-BAR: We ordered two Guava-filled pastries. They were not fresh. My friend commented on how they didn't taste ""fresh"" (more like 1-day old pastries). I don't eat sweets, but took one small taste. I concurred and immediately thought ""Yeah, this does NOT taste fresh!""TIP: Make sure you look at your check carefully. We were overcharged by several bucks. I knew the amount  was somewhat ""off"" but they made the correction and were very apologetic. I always look at my check to make sure it is correct (just a good habit to have).  It is a habit that everyone should really acquire! Another weird thing I noticed was that Customers paid with actual cold hard cash. Wow, I was really shocked because I am so accustomed to using my Debit card for everything (plus this is 2015, not 1985). Of course, I used my Debit card to pay -- I always do!The parking lot fills up quickly, but if you are here for breakfast, arrive before 9:30 am or before 6:30 pm for dinner. However, if the parking lot is full you can park on side streets (for free). To be honest, I prefer their North Ave location to this one. It is more intimate and smaller, but soooooo much better! The customer service here is very slow. In fact, I think my 300 lb brother-in-law moves faster than this place!  However, the price-point and their sandwiches makes up for the super slow service."
"Have you ever had ropa vieja in an empanada? Have you ever had a salad with chicken for six dollars? Have you ever had a mojito for six dollars in chicago? If you answered yes to any of these then was it good?If you answered no to these questions well you will thank me later for introducing you to the true definition of gem. What makes this a gem is everything I mentioned above you can find here. The ropa vieja empanada, salad with chicken, and the mojito are cheap here but they are not cheap quality. I feel the price is fair. They also serve great coffee which goes good with any of their sandwiches. I usually get the chicken sandwich because they marinate in a mojo which is a orangey limey kind of marinade but when it is cooked it is totally good. But what I feel is special about senor pan is the ropa vieja in an empanada yes their ropa  vieja is good alone but putting it in an empanada is friggen genius and you will not find a place that serves it and if you do tell me, but seriously those are truly something special. Among other things you can order here like thelechon sandwich or bistec with onions you are sure to be satified and leaving with money still in your bank."
"I had an excellent time! I recently came from Miami, which has amazing Cuban food. I got recommended to this restaurant by a friend, and it was EXCELLENT! The service was very good, it made me feel just like home.The food was beyond my expectations. I would recommend you start off with a trio of empanadas! Talk about delicious! I ordered a Pollo Asado and my friend Aramis ordered a Cuban Churrasco. I would order it again. The Churrasco was so tender. The pollo asado was fantastic. I would come again!Lastly, We finished with a mango cheesecake, everything about this place was authentic Cuban!"
"Yummy! My fiancé and I came here for lunch on a Thursday. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the waitstaff is extremely friendly. We started off with the Trio de empanadas. They tasted as if they just came out of the oven, the chicken one was my favorite. For entree, we ordered the Lechon Asado and Pollo Asado. The pork and chicken were very tender and flavorful. We finished off the meal with flan and Cuban espresso. Overall, this place is great! The  food tastes very authentic and the prices are cheap! I'm definitely coming back :)"
Superb Empenadas.  I got the trio for like $3 and it was enough for a meal.  The fillings were amazingly tender.  I also got the fried pork special and was particularly fond of the rice.
"They have a collection of tasty and reasonably priced sandwiches. I was impressed with the Cubano I had, I would like to try something else next time for variety. A nice alternative to the chain sandwich shops."
"Great service, Manager is very friendly. Media noche w/mojo is yummy. Mojitos are on point!"
Great Cuban!  I Just wish during breakfast hours they wouldn't play such loud music. Other than that I love the spot.
Great food! My hubby enjoyed his steak with rice and maduros (sweet plantains). I enjoyed the medianoche sandwich and a cup of beef soup. They also serve great coffee and before you leave you must try the guava & cheese pastry. Enjoy!!!
"When you have a hankering for authentic Cuban food, like Abuela made, this is THE place to come. Y punto!"
"Raised in Miami I was excited to have some Cuban food here. I tried the papa rellenas they were amazing, lechon con congri with cassava the lechon and rice was good the cassava could have used more mojo, fried plantains were on point, Cuban tamal was pretty good and the mamey shake was good, coladito was delicious. The service was really good not sure about what others say that it was slow. This place is pretty amazing as close to Miami Cuban food as you can get."
"Been here twice and both times got the ropa vieja dinner and the sandwich. The girlfriend got the media noche sandwich both times as well. Everything was very tasty.  Service was friendly but a little slow, which would be okay if you're not in a rush. Will have to try the other dishes."
"I use to LOVE this place! They hand the BEST Cuban sandwiches ever. I would come here at least 1 a month for the empanadas, cubano, and shredded beef sandwiches. Unfortunately they've changed their bread and now the sandwiches are ok. I miss their old bread. Oh well...now I have to find another place to satisfy my taste buds."
Great prices! Amazing customer service! My best friend who is cuban is very hard to please when it comes to finding a good cuban spots to eat. I was happy that this place was a winner. Epsecially with the Yelp Deal $40 worth of food for only $20. I had the Lechon Asado very flavorful and juicy. If you're looking for a Cuban restaurant Señor Pan is the place to go. I will be visiting this place soon with the whole family.
Love this place!!! Second time here and food is good and ambience is great on a busy nice with fast service and super friendly staff! Love that there is a place like this in the neighbourhood :) see u guys soon.
The shakes are AWESOME! The chicken has no flavor whatsoever
"I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I watched Chef the movie. I came across this restaurant not too far from my house.  Brought the hubby for his Father's Day dinner.  So happy we came here.  Service is amazing!  Servers, host and waitresses were attentive and polite. The food was delicious!  We had empanadas for our appetizer. My husband had bistec empanizado with black beans and maduros. I had ropa vieja with yellow rice and tostones.  I will definitely be back! :)"
"Love this place!  Great atmosphere, very cozy inside, love the fedoras on the waitstaff.  My niece loves their steak sandwich.  The mojitos were delicious, as was the flan.  The fried yuca with garlic sauce delicious.  So was the boiled yuca.  I couldn't stop eating the fried plantains either.  I like to eat vegetarian when I can, but was disappointed they didn't have a more creative veggie sandwich.  Maybe they can experiment with Yuca on the veggie sandwich to make it more substantial.  Fried yuca on a veggie sandwich would be yummy - for example 2 Asian Brothers on Foster Ave does a tasty vegetarian Banh Mi sandwich which could inspire chefs at Senor Pan.  I ended up getting the chicken sandwich which was good but the chicken was a tad bit dry.  The wait staff were so friendly and the prices were excellent."
Amazing service! Definitely one of my favorites restaurants. Not only is the food delicious but the service is very good. If you are looking for a delicious Cuban sandwich this is the place to go!
"I have been here tons of times and I have yet to be let down. Their food is always made to perfection, great prices and the service has always been excellent!!!  very friendly and attentive servers. Some dishes that I love and would recommend in order would be.....*Chicken fajita made cuban style with white rice and black cuban beans and tostones..... Price is like 9.95*steak with chimichurri sauce and rice of your choosing with a side sweet bananas or to plantain or yuka. Price is about 14 bucksJibaritos, steak, sandwhiches, and the fish are other great choices.* for appetizers the crocetas, and relleno De papa Great great place!!!!!  Check it out."
"Yet again this place disappoints me on customer service. I wish they gave customers FREE water.. however with the customer service here your cup probably wont ever be filled.Not sure why its hard for servers to take their time coming to your table.. seems like theyre doing so many things at once. Sometimes you just have to raise your hands like your in elementary school to get attention. Also I laugh at the lack of common sense from a server when I asked for mayo on the side and decided not to give me a spoon or butterknife to apply mayo on my sandwich. The cuban sandwich is delicious however a lil dry... so I attempted to ""dip"" my sandwich in the small container...however it was annoying lol.Also Please tell your customers that when your finished get up and pay infront. Luckily I know this by now however each time I come  maybe theyll bring a check and pay while at the table. However your going to have customers look clueless to where is the bill lol. Should use the raise hand technique lolI really hope this place continues to work on building a better customer service experience.  Seems like yelp is not helping..maybe I should contact the owner myself.the food is fantastic...and I love their piña coladas. Like I said improve on this issue and youll have happier customers!!"
"Authentic Cuban, great prices and service in a long block of North Avenue that's surprisingly lacking in eating establishments. Highly recommended."
"The sandwiches were excellent and super cheap for the quality and size. Croquetas were so-so, but everything else was great, including service."
If you're looking for good food at a good price without the guilt come here and come again for your Latin/cuban food craving.  I can't get enough of this place and it's a must stop if I have guests from out of town.
"Nice place. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't know but it is decorated super cute. They have a nice bar, the food is great. I love the ropa vieja. Nice spot for a date night or a ladies night."
"Delicious food!!! Would love to keep the 5 star review but the service today was extremely slow. Our waiter never checked on us. It took 20 min to get water and never received refills for any of our beverages. We had to ask for the check twice. The waiter never asked if we wanted to dessert and I don't think we would have had time to wait for it even if we wanted some. All in all, great food, lovely atmosphere, improve the service and we would visit all the time. Definitely going to second guess this place for future visits just based on the service."
"I'm no expert on Cuban food but I know I loved my meal here! A friend of mine came to visit and begged me to bring her out for a nice Cuban meal. I was a little nervous because she knows this cuisine and I was left to decide (on little to no experience). I didn't need to worry. She was thrilled with this place!I started with a strawberry margarita. I didn't think that's what I ordered but my friends told me I had. To be honest, my friends were all ordering in Spanish and I got so confused I guess I ordered the wrong drink. It was good though. The pineapple soda was probably the biggest hit at the table as far as drinks go. I had some type of a steak sandwich. The steak was marinated in tomatoes and it was so delicious I was embarrassed at the way I was shoving it in my mouth. I even ordered another one to go! It was that good. The side of plantains with garlic sauce that I ordered were life changing! I'm going back here just for those. Our service was friendly. A little sloppy if I were to get technical, but friendly. Make sure to end your meal with a cortadito and some flan. I find myself craving this now!"
"I had been craving Cuban food for awhile and so my sister suggested that we check out this place. I'm so glad she did because this place was crazy good! I had the Bistec Encebollado (steak with grilled onions), with white rice and beans and sweet plantains (these were just way too good!). Everything about the meal was fantastic (i.e.the portion size, seasoning, etc.) and the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. I ordered the flan for dessert and quite frankly if it were socially acceptable to lick your plate in public, I totally would have done so because that was delicious as well. This place was awesome and I can't wait to go back!"
I love this place. It can get a bit loud and crowded but the food makes it worth it. Their black beans are the best I've had. Everything I've tried has been delicious. Everybody I've  brought here loves it and return. They do a cute group song to celebrate birthdays as well.
"I've been here on a few different occasions and while the food is great, the service can be lacking. With that said, I must add that this time around the service was great. The waitress was really nice and attentive. She kept checking in on us and was very helpful with food recommendations. We used a yelp deal and she even made suggestions on what to add to get our full value of said deal.  I will definitely be coming back and I hope I get her again. I wish I could remember her name. She has a darker complexion and although she had her hair pulled back I could tell she had very short curly hair. The reason I'm describing her is so you can go to her if she's there, yes she was that great!  And it wasn't just with us, it was with all the tables she was waiting on!We had the croquetas de jamon, empanada trio, grilled chicken with rice and black beans and the special of the day which was steak, white beans with bacon, and maduros, YUMM. No complaints about any of it. The food was great!  For dessert, the flan and the absolutely delicious guava pastel!  Yum, yum, yum!Oh! And another great thing, while we were there the table next to us was celebrating a birthday. They play the birthday song in a salsa version on the speakers and while that is playing, the staff comes at you with maracas as they sing to you as well! This was so cute and fun! Great place for a birthday dinner! Don't forget to hit the ""tambores"" on the way out to let them know you had a great time!! :)"
"Tonight was my first time visiting this place...I was so excited...We had mixed reviews. I thought my churrasco steak was o.k, but on the thin side. I liked the tostones and the sauce, the yucca with mojo was o.k., the congri was very good. The flan was EXCELLENT! Service was blah and non engaging. Though this is a fairly small restaurant it was decorated quite nicely."
"*every server was attentive, kindly checking on each others  tables*, that in my book is premium service. Their are few places that treat you like royalty and act grateful for your choice in their establishment after they have heard they have heard ""deal/coupon"". Senior Pan, when we walked in, then later mentioned our deal, and till our last smiling goodbye from the cheerful staff made us feel like family. The ambiance was beautifully presented from the premium decor that conveyed such an authentic Cuban feeling.The food was very good. I especially loved the plantain chips with garlic sauce. Their Cubanos are very filling and well crafted. Even their desserts hit the spot just right, pleasing every taste bud. Recommend flan cake (#2) and the Mango cheesecake!Lastly their Cuban coffee, so many undoubtedly tasty selections. Favorite: the cordito.  We will be back."
"Love it, the ropa vieja sandwich is so flavorful with lots of  meat. Pastelitos are out of this world good, super friendly staff. Worth the 30 minute drive from the south side.."
The food was very good! The waitress was very nice as well. The other people who worked there didn't seem to enjoy their job and very stressed. Everything else was amazing.
"Absolutely loved the attention and customer service Señor Pan provided. I felt at home and the food was amazing. The mango smoothie is super yummy and it is not too sweet, which I like. The Lechon Asado did have a little too much flavor but the portion was perfect. The presentation, portions, and taste were perfect! I am definitely returning!"
"Have been various reviews about señor pan for the past couple of months so I felt that I had to experience it myself and I should tell you, my experience fell nothing less than blissful. I went on the weekend, so it was pretty full but I later found out that the wait was completely worth it. The food was tasteful, delicious and fulfilling. I tried the ropa vieja and my partner tried the lechon. Both dishes were amazing and we had to top it off right with a cafe cubano. All in all, I will definitely come back with family and friends.  It's a must try place even if you have to take a little trip!"
"First I'd like to say that I've been coming to your restaurant ever since it opened in 2008. Your sandwiches are amazing along with everything else on your menu, and I can say this because I visit about five times a month. I follow you on Facebook and on Yelp and I always speak highly of your business to everyone, but today wasn't a good day for me and Señor Pan. Let me just say that there was nothing wrong with the food but rather the form of customer service we received. I visited your restaurant today with 4 other friends of mine that also live in Chicago but have never ate at Señor Pan so I was quite excited about introducing them, but they left rather disappointed. We arrived at noon and granted the place was busy but we were seated right away. Menus were brought quickly but we waited 20 minutes for someone to come around and take our order. Food arrived quickly for being so busy which was a plus for us, but what was worse was that we were never offered more water after ALL our glasses were empty, and the fact when we asked the server about the avocados we ordered on the side she simply stated there on there way but didn't show till after we were done with our meals. Sadly to say my guest said they'd probably never come again unlike me I will but please don't see this as a complaint or bad review but as way to reach out to your employees and let them know that there are certain areas that need just the smallest attention."
Coffee n. Food always great !! Their services needs  more help . I usually come for a quick lunch break n they take forever ! Girls behinds the counter seem more interested in their conversation then their customers. I waited ten mins for a glass of water smh !
First time I went here everything was great. The 2nd time the food was still great but Jamena was a bad waitress!! She brought the food out but no silverware and rarely visited our table. Didnt like that they automatically added a gratuity because we used a yelp deal
"The food was good, I didn't like that you had to ask for water and silverware other than that I would come back again."
"The guaba and cream cheese puff melted in my mouth, really delicious right off the office"
"Horrible service!!!!! Every time I decide to give this place another chance I regret it. This last time was so horrible, I walked out after being seated. I waited over ten minutes before anyone even acknowledge us, not even water was brought to the table! Food is ok but service is horrible!"
"I've visited both this location, as well as, their cafe on North Ave....the sandwiches are pretty good, but I really think what I like most about Señor Pan is they have their act together! It's so appreciated that the staff is always nice, and there's always consistency in the food, the service... everything. I love to pop in and buy an iced cafe con leche, and they taste exactly the same every single time and at each location - that says a lot to me! Love that there's a Latino owned and run business like this! Saludos!"
"We went to celebrate my mother-in-law's 87th birthday. She was born and raised in Cuba, and misses her home very much. She had tears of joy in her eyes after our experience. She said the environment, food, music and service reminded her of Havana. If you can get a Cuban's approval, let's just say this place is a gem!"
The absolute best Cuban restaurant in Chicago. Staff is exceptionally awesome. I highly recommend Señor Pan to all for types of food service Dine in Carry Out or Catering. SEÑOR PAN IS THE BEST.  Tell them JC sent you play that CONGA  your way out.
"Every once and awhile, I get hungry enough to try this place again.  I tell myself maybe you just didn't order the right thing, but the food here is disappointing.I live within walking distance and I was starving.  Since there are limited places to eat in my neighborhood, I thought I could just grab a sandwich.  How hard can it be to make a decent sandwich?  Apparently, it's very hard.  I've had the ropa vieja, the Cuban sandwich, croquette sandwich and the steak entree.  I always get half way through the meal when I realize, ""I don't even want this, but I'm not going to waste it,"" so I finish.  When you eat the food because you don't want to waste money that isn't a good sign.  In general, the food is flavorless and needs more seasoning.  The dishes can also be a bit greasy.  The meat is often dry.  I've had the empanadas and they were tasty, but greasy.The two stars are for the staff.  They were fast and friendly, but I'm not giving Senor Pan a fifth chance."
Very happy with everything the pan con bistek was the best I've had in a while.the flan was good too.I also had the piña colada a little small but really good . All in all a must visit for those with a Cuban craving
The best Cuban food I've had! I just moved about 5 minutes from the restaurant and we had this for the first time a month ago and it's been a hit! My family coincidentally started visiting more often now that we're best this restaurant. :) the flan and fried bananas are the best!
"I have been meaning to check this place out because it was recommended by one of my Cuban friends.  I noticed the yelp deal, and so we decided to try the Senor Pan on Fullerton.  There is a small parking lot, which makes parking convenient, depending how early or late you get there.  It's not BYOB, which was good, I didn't have to make a stop before I arrived.  If you like cocktail's, it is a must, that you have at least one mojito.  The yuca rellena and empanada's have just the right amount of meat and its not chunky.  The mixed appetizer comes with 3 dipping sauces, and are all delicious.  We had the platters, ropa vieja, pollo empanizada, and the Cuban sandwich - all were really good, and you choose your sides.  I won't give too many details, you have to try yourself.SAVE room for coffee and dessert.  You don't have to request the cafe with easy sugar, they add the right amount.  The flan, homemade - and one of the best.  I had to order the pastelito de guayaba to go, cause I had already maxed out. Service is excellent and everyone is willing to work together, not bad Señor Pan, I will definitely be back to try other menu items, and breakfast.  Yum!"
"Had a Café con leche and a sandwich Cubano. The cheese in the sandwich was melted just right and the bread was toasted well enough to be crispy on the outside but still soft inside. It came with home made potato chips; they were ok but they may need some extra kick (seasoning or something) El cafe was muy rico! I like that they served it in a to-go cup in case there's some left to take with you pero it was gone after the meal. Ha!  They have a very tasty sauce that came with the empanadas, so good that I had to put some of it in my sandwich tambien  The decor and setting is really nice with many pictures and artifacts portraying mucha Cultura. The staff is very friendly and always making sure everything is well. *Don't forget to hit the congas on your way out!!"
"I've become a regular at this place. Although I always order the same thing, it's always consistent and delicious. Sandiwch de Bistec (have to add swiss & avocado), a side of tostones, and a mojito or two. Meal and drinks reasonably priced and you will not leave hungry. MUCH better than 90 Miles by FAR. Great atmosphere and big but cozy dining area that seems less kitchy/more authentic than 90 Miles.The only reason why I don't give Senor Pan a FIVE is because I find that the customer service waivers a bit. Last weekend I came in to use the Yelp deal and our server had no idea what I was talking about and gave me a little sass. Other than that, always satisfying!"
"Best Cuban food I've had thus far in Chicago. Great service, decor,and ambiance as well. The cafe con leche is ridiculously good."
"My husband and I visited Señor Pan. To our surprise it was a very nice place with some very good food. We had the ropa vieja and boliche sandwiches, congri, tostones, yuca and maduros. Everything was great including the service. Will definetly come back!"
"Excellent food. Great service. Not too pricey. I've been coming hear since they opened and I've never had an issue. I have lunch here alone, I bring clients here when we are out on business and I eat here with my family. It feels like home here."
"Amazing lechon, great staff,  and good beer. Have been here many times and they've never let me down"
"Love this place! Everything on the menu is outstanding. Good portion size and the Yelp deal is a bonus! Come here and have delicious food in a welcoming setting. My favorites are Bistec encebollada, the Cuban sandwich, mojitos and piña coladas! Plus all the appetizers are wonderful!"
"Love it, simply delicious. I only visited once because the parking lot is always full. I will return soon, maybe I'll ride my scooter and squeeze in."
"Love it. Waiters and waitresses are nice, have a legit attitude (not fake) and always do it right."
"Best Sandwhiches in Chicago! Order the Steak Sandwhich (Super) add Extra Meat, add Avocado, add Swiss Cheese, and extra Mayo. They don't put very much of it. I come here every other day. Enjoy!"
The pulled pork sandwich is to die for. The pork is seasoned very well and not dry at all. Also the bread is fresh with a slight crunchy consistency. I also was able to taste the steak sandwich which was also really tasty. The steak well seasoned as well and not tough at all. If you're looking for a great sandwich joint this is the spot.
"Once again amazing. Tried the Cuban Sandwich w/Avocado this time. By far on of the best around. Throw some Mariquitas and mojo sauce in the mix, and you're on the fast track to heaven my friend. To-go was really quick too! Have fun finding parking!!!"
"I have never been here to this past weekend I loved the food it was awesome amazing service,,,"
"I really wish I would be able to give a 5 star review. I placed an order for takeout and everyone was super duper nice. Fantastic service, really. Decent prices, nice looking restaurant. Food was not so spectacular. Really dry, pretty much seemed like it was sitting around for a while or maybe reheated. Has great potential and I hope to end up being a repeat customer."
Great stuffed potatoes love the pork sandwiches I was told about the place by a friend and now I come here at least twice a week
"Let me just start off by saying, I bought the Yelp $10 for $20 deal and I just ABSOLUTELY hate when you redeem the deal and people who work at the establishment act confused as if they don't know they have a deal going on. It's just annoying.okkkkkkkkkk now that I have gotten that out of the way. I can say I really wasn't expecting much and I drove right by it (it's situated in a little strip mall next to a Domino's Pizza), but when I walked in on Friday afternoon it was PACKED.The food was ok, I would go again if I was up Fullerton that way. I'm closer to 90 miles. The restaurant is very big and spacious. I had the Ropa Vieja with yellow rice and platano maduros and my friend had the Cuban Sandwich and tostones. I really liked the garlicy sauce that came with the tostones and they were cooked well and nice and crunchy.Service was very fast and attentive and I never had to chase anyone down for service,All in all it's a solid restaurant and if you are in the area you should definitely check it out."
Fine Cuban dining and fine women on hand at every visit.Been frequenting this place more than a few times now and I haven't been upset yet. Well maybe just at their parking lot. Minor. The place is real nice inside and the beautiful waitresses do their duty. In all it just feels very welcoming inside.The food is five star Cuban. Mostly stuck to the sandwiches at first and that ain't downing them since they are so damn good. Took my homie and he was planning his next visit before even tasting. Recommend any of the bistec or egg sanwiches or bistec with an egg. Definitely a Cuban. Always get the tostones and arroz with black beans. I'm a damn bistec fan all day and it made the passing grade. Tasty. Just wish the onions were cooked a little more so its less of a crunch with the steak and more of a fusion. But I'm not complaining.  If you're not sold then definitely cop their Yelp deal.  $10 for $20 and with that you should satisfy any doubts you have.
"I had a very nice experience here the food was great and the service was good. The mojitos were well prepared and were not over priced. I recommend getting the ""mariquitas"" as an appetizer which are thinly sliced green plantain chips with a nice dipping sauce. I bought a yelp deal wich they honored with no problem i just showed them the code directly off my phone."
"Was just there on Sun 8/17 after leaving the crappy D'Cuba rest for horrible service. I wasnt driving or I wouldve come here 1st, love this spot. Been here several times !The service, food, waitresses are great. The waitress la flacita had a blast with us. Will be back soon. I am Cuban and they represent very well."
"Not sure if I caught them at the wrong time but nothing seemed very special about the food.  Got the green fried plantains, half of which were tough/stale.  The ones that weren't stale were pretty good but the garlic sauce was what made them very good.  They should really bottle that sauce.  In addition to the plantains I also ordered the Sandwich Cubano, pretty good but not great.  The cheese tasted like the type you would get as singles.  Overall, pretty good food, fun atmosphere and very good service."
"The food is good when you catch them on their good day.  The service is a tad bit slow. The First time I had their Cuban sandwich I fell in love. So naturally I went back, not so great. I went the third time and again just mediocre at best. This place has great potential they just need to be more consistent."
Went here a few days ago for lunch.  I'm from the Southside so I'm always looking forward to eating Caribbean food when I'm on the Northside. The food was great. I had the Croquette Sandwhich with the plaintain chips.  Their garlic sauce was phenomenal.  I will definitely be returning with my family.
"As soon as I came into this restaurant, I knew the food was going to be good! I'm from Miami and my dad is Cuban so I know what good cuban food is. I ordered the lechon (which you can't find anywhere near Rogers park) with white rice, black beans, yucca con mojo and pastelitos de guava y queso. The lechon was sautéed with onions and seasoned very well. A little less salt and I would say it's perfect! The rice was good but the beans were okay. They needed a little more seasoning. Other than that they would be good indeed. The pastelitos were made fresh (just came out of the oven). Those babies were so good. I was on a hurry and wanted to try a cuban coffee...I will definitely be back! Maybe even move near this area. Apparently, this is where all the good food is. I gave this place 5 stars because the cashier was very friendly and attentive and they were playing good music. The restaurant itself is very clean and was put together very nicely. Man, I miss Miami and coming here made me miss it more. I can't wait to try their next dish!"
Came here for a bite to eat. Ordered cafe com latte and sandwich de bistec. Sandwich and coffee was phenomenal. Will be looking forward to come here again.
"Best Cuban sandwich in town. Try it now. Authentic floors that take u straight to south beach. Others gems are the sampler platter with steak empanadas, croquetas, and stuffed yuka."
"What a great restaurant what great food everything is awesome about this place, first thing to get is the Cuban coffee second for appetizers get some empanadas and then a sandwich or entree. We already bought two more coupons to come back here."
"Absolutely the best! Outstanding food- best choices to date would be the classic Cubano sandwich and the steak sandwich which are always done to perfection - the grilled bread is so good! Mariquitas- fried plaintain chips with their garlic sauce is a ""must have."" Have been here many times and am always eager to go back! REALLY good food! Good service! Nice people! My favorite spot in the whole city! (note- the parking can be tight but well worth the effort, consider it a lesson in patience!)"
"Since moving to Chicago I have been on the search for the best Cuban food. My family is Cuban and I have grown up my whole life with Cuban home cooked meals almost every day so I know what is good...and this place is AWESOME!!!!! If you are in Chicago don't waste your time going to 90 Miles, total tourist trap, go to Senor Pan. The lechon was great...the seasoning was amazing, congri rice is good, and the croquetas...to die for!!!!"
"This is my second time coming to this location with my boyfriend the food is definitely not a disappointed. I had the chicken sandwich with avocado and he had the lechon sandwich. We got our food and loved it however he forgot to ask for avocado on the side and it took the waitress more than halfway through our to bring to out. It wasn't busy for us to not get water either, we asked when we ordered and we asked again when we got our food. The service was a disappointed which makes me hesitant on coming back but at least we were able to enjoy our food"
"The thing about Senor Pan is that you can taste the love in every bite. They cook like they really dig what they serve. I love the garlic sauce for the tostones, and my current obsession is the trio sandwich -- steak, ropa vieja, and pernil -- three great tastes all in bite sized amounts. And a flan with a cortadito coffee sure ends a meal right!! A great meal every time!"
"A little far from my place, but ended up going here at random after Walmart.  One of the best cuban places in Chicago.  I had the skirt steak sandwich with fried egg and swiss and added avocado, and my wife had the ropa vieja entree.  We also got empanadas.  All really, really good. Ended up taking some food to go.The service was great, too.  My 1 year old daughter really liked the waitress.  Definitely will be going back when we're in the area.  Don't forget to bang the bongo drum on your way out if you had a good time.  You will."
"Excellent food. The manager was great. They have a very good services!  The music was enjoyable!  My son love the conga on the way out! The price was affordable. Thanks, we has a good time."
Great place for the family! I really enjoy the food and the specials!
"Highly disappointed with this restaurant! I ordered through grubhub and they are only five minutes from my residents driving. I placed an order at 6:15 pm and didn't receive it until 7:50. When the food finally arrived it was seriously cold, not even warm. I do not have a microwave (personal preference) so I had no way of reheating the food. I contacted grubhub to inform them and they called the restaurant to only be told that due to weather conditions is the only reason the food was cold. I do not believe that as I was able to get home from work in 30 min with the weather conditions and it normally takes me 20 min. So for them to be 5 min away, the food shouldn't have been cold. All they could offer was $5 off my next $20 purchase, however I will never be ordering from them again. Extremely disappointed and if I was able to give them no stars that is exactly what I would do, but unfortunately you have to give at least one star."
"Both my parents were Cuban and obviously I was raised on Cuban food. Does anything compare to home cooking...no. With that being, it's hard to pick out anything made at Senior Pan that isn't good. The Cafe Con Leche might as well be crack (in that it is addictive) and I can simply eat 1lb of their tostones with garlic sauce. The one critique I have is that they over cook the pork from time to time. The restaurant is small and does fill up on Sundays after church and early evenings. The staff always provides wonderful service. If you're in the Humboldt Park area and looking for some good food, you can't go wrong with Senior Pan..."
"The food here is pretty good especially since I know nothing of Cuban cuisine outside of my girlfriend who happens to be Cuban, but I know the basics. The customer service was good and the food was too. Since I am no huge Cuban food fan outside of a few things is why I rated it 3 stars but if you're in the area and enjoy Cuban food this is the place to be. Oh FYI...the waitress are Cuban too....I asked lol."
"Been here before but it's been a while. The food today was nothing special just ok. But what really post us off was waiting 30 (not exaggerating) before they took our order, then another 40 for the food to come out. The waiter looked dejected and like we were bothering him. Even when we paid he didn't come back to get the tab for 15 minutes. What should have been a fast lunch ( few sandwiches) turned into a 2 hour ordeal. I used to like this place, but I'm so disappointed after today."
"Omg get the #4 steak sandwich, add cheese & avocado, it's soooo good! They also have these fried yuca potato like things with garlic sauce- Nom Nom Nom!"
"This place is delicious!!! I had never had Cuban food and the waitress was EXTREMELY helpful in explaining and recommending things to try. I loved the service and so many options above all the prices. Around $25 per person for the huge appetizer sampler to share (we had to try everything!), a sanwich, soda, and a dessert each."
"Came here on my first trip to Chicago, and I must say it was amazing!  I had the sanduche de bistec al caballo and of course some coffee and it was delicious! The food was very fresh and quick, the atmosphere was really nice and familial and some very friendly staff to top it all off made my experience at Señor Pan top notch.  Will definitely be coming back especially after using the yelp deal ($20 for $40 of food) and having an awesome meal for an awesome price! Certainly a must when visiting Chicago!"
Best Cuban food in Chicago. I would recommend the empanadas with chimichurri sauce as an appetizer. Every plate that I have ordered is delicious. I come here often with my parents who are fans of their Café con Leche and Cuban sandwiches. Always fresh with plentiful portions. Nice addition to the neighborhood!
"My family have been to Senor Pan on several occasions. The food is always great as is the service but this last time that we went we brought some friends that were visiting from Spain. The service was excellent.The owner's brother(that's what he said) came to talk to our friends and was very friendly to them. The food was wonderful and at the end of our meal we were a couple of surprises,flan and tocino del cielo. Thank you,Senor Pan! We will keep coming back oer and over."
"Had the steak sandwich. It was excellent. Toasted bread-mmmm. Tried the cubano espresso and it reminded me of the greek coffee my mom used to make. Was awake after i had it ill tell you that much.  Friendly service, great atmosphere, relaxing cuban music. Only negative is that its next door to dominos in a strip mall. Gracias!"
"As a Cuban woman, I had high hopes for this place and was honestly let down. I purchased the Yelp deal for $20 towards $40 worth of food. I decided to check the menu ahead of time, and saw how incredibly cheap they were so I was really focused on getting the full value of the coupon.I came here with my boyfriend and he got the steak with rice and beans ($14 I think) and I got a Cuban sandwich which was $8. We opted for the Cuban sampler plate which has a wide variety of Cuban things I personally have never tried before, which was also $15 but half of the items I didn't care for because they were just flat out gross. The only things I really enjoyed were the empanadas, the tamale and the stuffed cassava. The plantains were OKAY but sort of soggy, I prefer mine crisp. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his food, but my Cuban sandwich pretty much had no flavor to it really which is depressing because I LOVE Cuban sandwiches and was so flaky every time I bit it, it was falling apart. It was overly toasted which is a big deal to me. However the mango smoothie is one of the best I've ever had!This place just needs to add a little more flavoring and toast the bread a little less, and it would be more authentic tasting.When the bill came, I had to pay $3 over the coupon which was more than okay until the woman came to me and told me their debit minimum is $5 so I would have to purchase something else. As annoyed as that made me, I got another delicious milkshake and was on my way.This place is decent but there are far better options (D'Cuba) in the city, so I probably won't be coming back."
We are one of the original customers at Senor Pan. The food is good but the restaurant's charm has changed. The last few visits we received slow service. Management needs to stress friendliness and speed to the staff.
The food was great. I would recommend people who would love to try Cuban food for the first time.  I would come back again. Great Cuban sandwich.
"Wow! We were sitting near Cicero and Armitage and totally starving...hit our iPhone YELP App and up pops Senor Pan! We read a few reviews and punched the address into the GPS, which told us we were 0.9 miles away, and we were on our way!!! We walked in and were instantly in love...the place had a good feeling to it. The prices and the menu looked fantastic. We started out with a Ham Croquette and I have to say it was one of the best I have ever had...it was even better then the ones I have had at Versailles's in Miami...which use to be my favorite until today! Then we had a Beef Empanada...which was really good. I had the ground beef one and after further review of the menu I could have had the Steak Veijo...so I will try that one next time. The Cafe Con Leche was fantastic and a 16oz Cup was only $1.95...if I lived closer I would be here everyday. Now on to the entrees...I had the Super Cubano Sandwich. It was one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I have had to date. The meat was piled high and extremely juicy. The bread was also toasted to perfection...it was crunchy and golden brown. The sandwich looked like a piece of art...I almost did not want to eat it. In fact, it was so large I could hardly finish it...I brought half home which is sitting in my fridge...I can hardly wait to throw it into my panni maker! My wife had the grilled chicken covered in onions. It was really good. It also came with black beans, white rice and sweet plantains. I sampled them all and I am happy to say they were all delicious. I must give special credit to the white rice which was some of the best rice I have ever had in my life and I do not like rice. The whole meal for two people was under $19 bucks...what a deal!!! We will definitely be coming back here. We also heard that the owner is opening up a second location near North and Western...which is closer to our house...I can hardly wait! On a side note: This place has one table that out shines the rest. When you walk in look to your right in the corner...there is a table on a platform. Oh yes...one day I will sit there!!! The only reason I noticed this table because the couple sitting up there were looking down on me...like they owned Senor Pan...hopefully next time I will be the Kingpin of Senor Pan!!!"
"Despite the shady strip mall feel, the ambiance and menu is absolutely delicious. The Mariquitas are so crisp and not dripping in oil. The array of sandwiches are perfect and those empanadas are so well-filled. End your meal with a delicious Cafe con Leche and pastry and it will not disappoint."
Great food & service. Never had anything wrong with any of the food I've eaten from there. Great place to experience Cuban Food.
"Omg I love this place! Excellent food, superb service and the ambiance was spectacular! !! Will definitely be back!!!"
"This will be a very helpful review. I do not remember what I had, but I remember it was quite delicious and I was pleased with the overall experience, kind of like going to Joshua Tree with some peyote, so I hear...  There was no one named Senor Pan in the entire place to give my gratitude to, so hence this positive Yelp review, instead."
"Great service, great quality, great taste, great price. What more can you want?Request: Vanessa. Kind, helpful, and muy bonita ;)Cortadito: SO yummy. I know it's a shot, but I wish they sold big cups of it.Mojito: Way too sweet for me, but the flavors were great. I can tell they used fresh lime juice and mint leaves. Next time, I'll ask for less sugar.Pina Colada: Tasted like a virgin but got the job done.Antojitos Cubanos: The tamale was a tiny bit undercooked and watery, but the masa had great flavors. The empanada was AMAZING with the chimichurri sauce. The croquette had a PERFECT ratio of potatoes and ham. Great texture; soft and fluffy on the inside, crisp and crunchy on the outside. And of course, you can never go wrong with mariquitas & garlic sauce.Ropa Vieja: It really is as amazing as everyone says it is. Juicy, tender, tomato-y, saucy goodness with awesome spices. A bit salty for me but the rice helped even it out.Congri: This one was a bummer. It was really dry and tasteless. You would think that it'd be moist since the rice & beans are mixed, but I guess the rice eats all the moisture or something cuz it was really..really dry. :(Tostones: Eh, these were kind of dry, too. Plus, it didn't come with any dipping sauce so it tasted kind of bland.  Would be good with the garlic sauce.Churrasco Cubano: THIS WAS MY FAVORITE. Wow. Cooked to perfection. The salsa on top is genius. So tender, so juicy, so going back to get this again.Arroz Amarillo: SO MUCH BETTER than the congri. The flavor was great and it had a lot of moisture. Didn't really feel the sausage, though.Frijoles Negros: Again, SO MUCH BETTER than the congri.  Definitely better in soup form.I'm definitely going back. Now that I know what to get next time, I'm sure it'll be a 5 star experience. Plus, the drinks are only $3.95!! Score."
"Great place, great service and of course great food!! Loved Jorge our server hes Great and Amazing!!! Had the empanadas, yucas fritas amd Cuban samdwich felt like heaven!! Def will be going back. Ohhb Cafe con Leche do not get me started with that now that there is to die for!! A-M-a-Z-I-N-G"
great steaks
GREAT food and VERY nice looking place with a cool vibe.NICE and ATTENTIVE staff as well! Been back twice already!
"Food was not that great had churasco skirt steak tasteless yuca con mono nothing to brag about portions were small, they didn't even give out bread and butter you have to ask for it. service was slow. entrees were brought so fast that I wondered if it wasn't pre - cooked and waiting for someone to order my plate had cold food so it left me unimpressed."
"I went to Senor Pan this past weekend for my dad's bday.... GREAT SERVICE!!! I am extremely satisfied with the service and food. We originally had reservations for 9 people, but due to last minute changes we had to add 10 more seats. The staff there made it really easy to accommodate us with no fuss. They were really friendly and helpful. Our waitress, Gloria, was very patient and kind. I really enjoyed the tunes they played to sing happy birthday to my pops. It made him very happy and he got to keep a fedora."
Always so yummy!
"Good Spanish food, reasonably priced. The Bistec Encebollado (steak with grilled onions) is flavorful and plentiful. The wait staff is friendly and courteous. The lechon asado (roasted pulled pork)  is also very good. The tostones (green fried plantains) take me back to my childhood in south Florida."
Love love LOVED it.. UNTIL one day I had my regular steak sandwich with maduros and a piñacolada everything went great until I was about to take a bite of my sandwich and I noticed a dead fly in it! I was so disappointed and never again have I gone back ;(
"Back again after way too long and we were so happy with the meal.  We got the same entrees, but this time went for the empanada trio and were very glad we did.  The service was super fast and we were in and out, with a few rounds of drinks in under 45 minutes!  Breaded steak is so large, but thin, so you can eat it if you put your mind to it.  Plantains and black beans and rice are delicious.  The bread is free, but you have to ask for it - make sure you do, because it is grilled with butter and scrumptious!  We will definitely be back before another year goes by!"
"The ropa veija sandwich was decent. The flavor was rather average and there wasn't too much meat on the 'super'. And te empanadas con jamon y queso was all right, but nothing special. But try the Mamey batido, it was pretty good."
"When I eat at an ethnic restaurant one of the surefire ways I can tell that I had a 5 star eating experience is when I find myself thinking that I need to find a woman from that country to marry so that I can eat that type of food for the rest of my life.  Well to be truthful I didn't find myself thinking about that, but I did find myself thinking that the embargo against Cuba was really stupid since the food here makes me really want to go visit Cuba and pig out.  So although I didn't daydream of finding a Cuban wife I did daydream of going to visit Cuba and eat some more really good food so I guess that is close enough to qualify as worthy of a 5 star review.Ok, I've rambled on long enough so I'll move on to the information you really want.  I'll start with the service.  I told the young lady that I needed to look at a menu so I could place a to go order and she was very friendly and didn't seem the least bit put off by the fact that she wouldn't receive a tip from serving me at a table (I do tip on carry-out orders since they are providing some service, it's just not as large of a percentage as if I were dining in but servers don't know that when I place my order).  Some servers turn off all friendliness when they hear the words carry-out, but I'm happy to report this young lady was still kind and attentative to my needs.  When I explained to her that I'd never eaten Cuban food before and wanted to know if a particular dish was spicy she informed me in a professional manner that it was not the least bit spicy.  So all that to say I found the service was top notch even for a carry-out order which unfortunately is not the case at all restaurants.Now on to the most important impression.  The flavor!  I can't honestly say that Cuban food will become my favorite food, but I can say with certainty that I'll be coming back here many times in the future.  As a matter of fact I'll be going back tomorrow to try one of their sandwiches.  Tonight I had the Cuban style steak fajitas and rice with black beans in them.  All I can say is I loved it!  The fajitas actually kind of reminded me of Filipino flavors since it had a little bit of a twangy flavor like adobo.  It was some good stuff!  I'm looking forward to going back many times in the future and trying lots more of the items on their menu.  Good job Senor Pan!!!!"
"Took my brother and sister-in-law to try out Cuban food and señor pan did not disappoint! Very tasty Cuban sandwich, ham croquettes, and ropa vieja. Amazing cortadito and pastel De guava y queso. Will definitely be coming back again and again. :)"
I love this place food is delish only complain is that the staff can get a little lost when they are busy maybe they need to hire more people during busy hours but they are really nice.
Nice place but not so good food. My waitress was great and so was the service but my food was a let down extremely I had high hopes on this being my new Cuban place sadly I had my expectations very high but it was a let down. Marianao on Milwaukee and California is better and El Cubanito on Pulaski and Wrightwood is better although these places are smaller but they are worth the quality of the food.
"Went to the Cuban festival at Riis Park. Wanted to have an authentic Cuban meal. Went to yelp and Señor Pan was a clear winner. We went there and it was packed at 330 on  a Sunday. We waited 15 min and it was so worth it!  The mojitos were yummy, empanadas and steak with grilled onions: so good!  Will definitely return :)"
"Awesome flavors! The regular sandwich is the size of a toddler, and is an incredible deal, considering it was incredibly delicious. Will be going back!"
"All I can say is ""Ay Dios Mio (Oh, my God).""  The Cuban dishes here are excellent.  A taste of their ropa vieja and I feel like I'm back in Miami.  The beef is so juicy and flavorful.  The croquetas de pollo are nice and crispy and not soggy like many other places.  Every time I go to Señor Pan (which is too many times to count) I have to order their doble cortadito with an empanada de guayaba.  The service is great and the fact that the waitresses are attractive make the dining experience more enjoyable :-)"
I use to love 90 miles. Then I tried Senor Pan and it made me redefine what love was. GREAT PLACE!!
Decent spot for Cuban food.Everything I tried was good.Ive driven past a thousand times and never knew it was there till a friend checked in and I had a taste for some Lechon.Now that I know theyre there I will be returning.Was too crazy about the service though.Maybe it was an off night.
"Five stars seems high for such a simple place, but the food is so good.  We've been trying to find good Cuban food since we left the Keys.  We've been to the Cafe once and to this location twice (unbelivably good Mojitos,not available at the Cafe). If you haven't tried Cuban food, have the appetizer sampler, the lechon asado and, the ropa vieja . Be sure you get the sweet plantains (maduros) and some of the congri rice. Leave room for the wonderful flan or the pastelitos de guayaba y queso (guava and chees pastries).  Have a Cuban coffee (even decaf).  Be happy, bang on the conga on your way out.  We have always had helpful and efficient service -- and much willingness to explain the menu."
"love the cafe con leche. service is great. The restaurant is great, but i really like to order and pick up on my way to appointments"
.
"Great food (probably not the healthiest you'll have) but perhaps more importantly, EXCELLENT service and fun atmosphere! Everyone was wonderfully pleasant, and the food came quickly. Can't wait to come back for a coffee and desert-we were too stuffed tonight!"
"Mmm cuban sandwich with extra pickles pleasee! :)Absolutely lovee this place! Food is authentic and delicious...The company I work for always buys breakfast/lunch for the workers on Saturday's, which is awesome! On 11/5 everyone agreed on Senor Pan!I usually order the side order of white rice and a side of yuca con mojo ((white starchy tropical vegetable with garlic))But this time I went with the Cuban sandwich..variation of ham, roasted pork, swiss cheese,pickles, mustard, and at times depending on your taste salami...Of course I had asked for extra pickles and had a diet coke to wash it down...Love this place!"
"I enjoyed the sandwich however I didn't care for the customer service. A man waiter(tall,big round eye,mid20s) tried to force me to purchase a beer after I told him NO!  He even gave the beer to his coworker so she could serve me.  For what so I can be CHARGE?!  Poor customer service IS always bad for the business. Therefore I won't be back.For those that do go(to this location) be warned of a pushy waiter not taking NO for an ANSWER.Tip: While servicing the customer, Its rude to speak another language in-front of a them because, it gives the impression that you have a hidden agenda."
Holy deliciousness Batman! This places was crazyyyy good! I'm not a pork fan but it was so good! I didn't think the avocado was needed but still amaze balls!
"This is a great place to eat. Great food, great service and wonderful atmosphere. My wife and I go there quite often. It's a wonderful neighborhood Cuban Cafeteria. I enjoy the ropa vieja and the boliche. I stop in for breakfast sometimes and enjoy the pan con timba. I strongly recommend Senor Pan as one of the best Places to eat Cuban food. I give it 5 stars."
"Excellent, excellent food.  Service can be spotty sometimes as they always seem to be super busy.  However, staff is very friendly.  Definitely save room for their cafe con leche with a guava con queso pastelito (yummers!).  Breakfast, lunch or dinner...you can't go wrong!"
So delicious! The meat is marinated to perfection!!  everyone is so friendly the chicken salad with the grilled veggies is HUGE!! and ONLY 4.95!!! from 3pm til 5pm monday - friday  they have 2 for 1 sandwiches!try it out they're great!
"Love this place,the cuban coffe is so good and I'm not a coffe drinker.staff could use some help,but still very helpful.the food is very good can't go wrong with the chicken sandwich,or anything for that matter. Big thums up!"
"Before we ventured in here, we read the reviews... I trust my fellow Yelpers... Those of you who said the service is terrible were spot on.  Our server was miserable. She never smiled; she didn't come back to check on us (and I was super-thirsty); she seemed to just generally avoid us. I can handle bad service, but this was beyond bad.  There are over 35,000 restaurants in Chicago and lots of them are Cuban. If you want customers to return for your decent food, you have to treat them right."
"While visiting Chicago my family and I decided to try this place based on the good yelp reviews. We were seated immediately and they didn't take long to take down our orders. Everyone in my family ordered a sandwich except me. They all raved about their sandwiches and after tasting some I can say they tasted okay. Unfortunately, I had their arroz congri, lechon and yuca con mojo and although it was edible it didn't feel like authentic Cuban food. The rice was dry, the pernil wasn't seasoned that well and the yuca had some what of a fishy taste to it. I've lived in Florida and my mother in law is Cuban and unfortunately what I ordered couldn't compare to what Ive had before but their sandwiches and coffee are worth a shot. Also, don't expect the waitstaff to be too engaging."
"A Cuban friend of mine recommended this place, as it's one of her favorite spots in the city. I can definitely see why! Like a homecooked meal, as if I spent a Sunday with her family. Generous portions, and the pricepoints won't leave you searching for the last few quarters in your car to get a tank of gas.I highly suggest the mariquitas con mojo (plantain chips with garlic sauce) and the ropa vieja (shredded beef, which also comes with rice and plantains).The flan was a little overcooked but was delicious regardless.The restaurant is spacious. There's plenty of room, and you can tell by the seating arrangements that they can accomodate large groups. What I will knock them for is their painfully slow service! The food itself came out quick, but we were rarely asked how our meal was, had to keep hounding them for water refills, and by the end we probably waited more than half an hour to finally see the servers come to life and bring us our checks. And if there's anything I hate more than waiting for my food, it's waiting for my check. Luckily my friends and I came here on a day when we were playing catch-up with our life stories.I would have given the girls the benefit of the doubt but 1) it was a slow weekday 2) my friend said that this is actually common here and is the one thing that leaves her irked.There's a parking lot, but it's very small! Cross your fingers and hope to get a good spot."
We came here for my birthday lunch. We ordered the daily special to share and some Tostones. The special was insanely good. Prices are so cheap I bought the discount coupon but our bill was too small to use it. It would be our go-to place if I lived nearby.
"Best Cuban food in Chicago and also at the best prices!  The restaurant is also cute and the waitstaff super nice.  I didn't have any drinks, but have had the black beans, croquetas (jamon), maduros, bistec empanizado, picadillo - all great.  Portions are pretty big too...you won't leave hungry!  Try it!"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I Live in the neighborhood and certainly come here often, im usually with a friend so you know that means CHIT-CHAT! The whole experience is always pleasant, from the moment you walk in the door to the time you exit. Waiters are all very friendly, & food is AWESOME! Food varies from Light, to on-the-go or just sit down and eat a big plate! Sanitary & Cleanliness are also a plus, I definetely recommend this place they have a wide assortment of meals, & cant forget with todays economy many specials to choose from!5 STARS! WOOT WOOT."
"Love love love their empanadas! Good atmosphere, good food, nice staff, and they now serve alcohol too!"
"I went to for my dad's 60th birthday! The food was delicious and originally made reservations for 9 people, but 10 more people decided to tag along last minute. I was quite embarrassed but they were so accomodating, our waitress Gloria was great and let me tell you had a lot of patience with us. They made sure that everyone was happy, the staff is really nice and pleasant. We will definitely be going back for some great Cuban Food!"
"My Wife was craving Ropa Vieja, after having it in Miami, so we stopped in after hearing great things. The food here is awesome. The beef empanadas are the best I've ever had anywhere. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish, and the steak I had was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I recommend this place to anyone looking for great tasting authentic Cuban food. Whatever you do, don't leave without trying the coffee! Parking can be a tough feat, but it's worth it."
"The service was good, my boyfriend and I went there one random day because we wanted to experience new restaurants and this happened to be one of them. The food is DELICIOUS, feels like your eating at home :) the empanada de Pollo is mouth watering, and the sandwich de bistec is a big MUST!! My boyfriend eats anything and everything so we tried the trio of empanadas which was pretty good, I recommend going here. We are regulars already, all the servers literally know us there lol."
"I had a wonderful time dining at this Cuban restaurant! It is a very clean and cozy restaurant. Also, very presentable. The red and brown walls are pleasing to the eye. Now, time for the food!!!!My friend and I had a very late brunch around 1pm, so we were starving!What we ordered:- empanadas- croquetas de jamon- mariquitas with garlic sauce- three mini sandwiches (jamon, ropa vieja, and grilled steak with tomato lettuce and onions)- and the brioche platterMy faves: mariquitas with garlic sauce, ropa vieja sandwich, and grilled steak sandwich. Piña colada was pretty top notch!Everything else we tried were not out of the ordinary, just ok. My faves are so good! Mariquitas are sliced plantain chips accompanied with a garlic dipping sauce! The bread of the sandwiches are toasted so well. If you like Jimmy john's bread, this is bettttteerrr.And, to top it off the restaurant is super affordable.When I come back I need to try the Cuban style burgers and their new salad!"
"Ay Senor Pan, como te extrano.....I LOVE this place. To me, this place has the BEST cuban and Media noche sandwiches. I've eaten here and have gotten take out MANY times to state that. Every single time, the sandwiches have tasted AH-MAZING. They are full of flavor, the bread is perfectly toasted, cheese melted just right......oh yeah and their empanadas are great, their licuados aka milkshakes and those plantain chips....damn.It just sucks I can't go anymore for fear of running into my ex's awful cult loving family...Unless of course I dress up like a ninja and hideout...we shall see."
Best cafe con leche ever!!!!! We enjoyed this cute Cuban spot up north. The food was yummy esp platanos appetizers with the sauce it comes with. We definitely will be comming back
"It was real full expect a bit of a wait, but the food was the best Cuban food I have tasted in a while. Believe the hype."
Yamara was our server and was fantastic. Me and my friends never tried Cuban food before so we decided to come here since it was in the area. I gotta tell you we were all impressed with the quality of food and service as well. Not expensive at all and I came out full and satisfied. Definitely recommend this place
Love the food but the service sucks... They take forever to come take you drink order and they take forever to take your food order. I recommend order everything when you place your drink order because you will be sitting their for awhile.
"My co-worker recommended this restaurant to me as we work nearby and I am always looking for new places to try.  Needless to say, I am hooked!  I have never had yuca con mojo before and it is sooooo good.  I also really enjoy their chicken empanada trio, I can easily make a meal out of those two basic things!  I tried the chicken fajitas and I have no complaints there either.  Not necessarily on my healthy eating program, but I will take a cheat day for this restaurant for sure!"
"I did NOT have such a great experience here as the other reviews. Ordered the Combo Empliadias..VERY GOOD! Sauce for ""dipping"" Outta this worldHusband had the Cuban sand.  ""Good""I had the skirt Steak at 14.95...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Thin..VERY  VERY THIN like a sand. steak.  and tasted like it had been treated with a tenderizing solution and had a ""rubbery"" texture. did not eat it, brought most of it home and gave it to my son whom also (without provoking) said it was ""weird"" and he too did NOT eat it. No offense.. but then not wanting to waste the steak we gave it to our dog...SHE WOULD NOT EAT IT!The side items were GOOD tho! The sweet bananas were cooked to perfection! The Cuban rice? MEH..but it was my 1st time trying it. I asked for more sauce to mask the flavor and still could not eat it. Tostones...the sauce was VERY GOOD and they were fresh ..Service...HORRIBLE! I watched as ONE waitress services the WHOLE dinning room..Now this was NOT necessary at all, for there was another waitress willing and able, but this ONE  would push the other out of the way to take ALL the tables. She was dressed in a white tee-shirt, while the other in black.The one in black seemed friendly while the one we had wasn't at all, and she ignored my requests..like for bread and about the soup that WAS supposed to come with my meal, but she told me that because I chose the CUBAN rice I was not entitled to also have the soup....clearly the menu states otherwise, by a comma AFTER the rice selections...I wasn't going to argue as seeing that I didn't really want the soup, just wanted to know if I was SUPPOSED to be offed it. As far as the bread? Menu say's... that if you want it you HAVE to ask for it..I did and she ignored me. I was NOT rude or a ""tough"" costumer....I was pleasant and thanked her with each encounter, as well as my husband did. So if you are reading this and thought ""well perhaps she was mean to the waitress"" I wasn't at all.It is a saving grace that we brought a deal from YELP..20 bucks for 40 worth of food...we only spent 35 of the 40...we didn't realize that tho...and she took MY PHONE WITH HER and KEPT IT FOR OVER 10 MINS! In order to process my coupon she took my phone...I offered for her to write down the code, but she said she HAD to take my phone!  Made me nervous to say the least. Yes they would have been held accountable..but in the mean time I would have been super inconvenienced!She should have took the code..and then asked me to mark it as used!!AND she ( in good business practice) offered the remaining 5 bucks to be used...we wouldn't have..but that would have went a long way.I am thinking that she is some way related to the owner the way she acted and her lack of service expertise.3stars? Because the Empallada's were really good...and I would like to try the shredded beef...it was really tasty in the Empallada...and my husband enjoyed his Cuban sand. I would give it another try. But if I get the same waitress....I would turn toward carryout."
"I was a fan of Senor Pan for YEARS! Soooo, when I found a yelp deal I was super excited! I called and placed an order for carry-out (I would've dined-in but baby was sleeping in the car). I mentioned the lovely cahier I had the yelp deal and she called the manager/owner over... I'm not even going to mention all of the rude comments he gave me but he did NOT like that I was taking my food to go. Let me just say the yelp deal did NOT specify ""dine-in only"" (as much as he looked for it...) But what made things even worse is that he gave me a total, I handed him the cash and he continued to punch in numbers in the registered...with my cash already in his hand, he then gives me another amount $4 more than he originally said!!! I look at my receipt and noticed he added $4 gratuity. When confronted, he tells me the deal does not include tip...(WHAT?!) I had plans to tip the nice girl...but at MY discretion!!!. I went ahead and showed him the yelp general rules and he slammed the $4 in the counter....RUUUUDE! He kept saying he had intended this and the Restaurant.com deal to be dine-in only...well, it's NOT my fault he forgot to specify!!!! I will say this...I enjoyed my masitas the puerco (compliments to the mexican cooks cooking Cuban food!!!)... even after the aggravation. Will I go again? yes, I'll probably take it to go."
"This place is seriously amazing! Been here countless times and am always satisfied when I leave!! My favorite is the Sandwich de Bistec, the meat has so much flavor and it's so tender. However, whatever you order, it will be a treat! Their shakes are also awesome. If you have a chance, try the wheat shake. It sounds weird but it is AMAZING!!! And don't think this is some healthy alternative because it's not, wheat shakes are popular Cuban treats and this place makes it perfect. Also, they don't list it on the menu but just ask for it and they'll make it for you.There are a few Cuban places in the city but this is one of the best. They serve traditional food without all the added hype that add to your price (eg. 90 Miles). They're very clean and have great service, you seriously feel like your in Miami. If you're in the mood, give it a try, it will not disappoint!!"
"I can't say that I'm a Cuban sandwich expert--but I guess to become an expert, I need to do some research. Well one place that I'm glad was on my research list was Senor Pan. It's definitely out of the way of where I usually visit in Chicago, but thank goodness for mobile Yelp; I found this place easily!  A great family-owned restaurant!Very nice and clean and open place. I was pleasantly surprised by how pretty it was inside--dark wood tables and murals on the walls. You can either order to-go and wait at the counter or have a seat at one of the tables for table service. Me and my cousin decided to order a few different things to share since both of us had never had Cuban cuisine. The marquitas con mojo (plantain chips with garlic sauce) was so good. The chips were very fresh and crispy and if you like garlic, you'll love the garlic sauce--I wanted to pour it over my sandwiches! The black bean soup was just ok but it was nice that it came piping hot. We also got the Senor Pan Trio--3 mini sandwiches--that is definitely the way to go especially when you can't decide which sammy to get. So we chose the classic Cuban, the grilled steak and the roast pork. All had very good flavor, fresh ingredients and great bread. There was a nice meat to bread ratio so you always had some meat even to the last bite! Service is very friendly and attentive. I got a cafe con leche and flan to go. The coffee was very tasty and also served nice and hot. Not bitter at all and a nice drink to sip on my way home to the burbs. The flan? I'm sorry to say I didn't get a chance to try it. I handed the bag to my cousin and she FORGOT it on the table. So hey, if you see a bag of flan on the table on the left side of the restaurant, that's MINE!"
"I had the best meal at Senor Pan, this past Sunday.  The food was delicious.  For me to give them a perfect 5, they need to add more tables or change the seating layout, they need a door host at busy times and please please please make CAFE con Leche like it's suppose to be.  There was some confusion on how to order the coffee..my mom ended up getting regular coffee with milk and I got a latte but just didn't taste right.  The coffee was too light. Great service, food took a little long but worth the wait, very understanding staff, clean BATHROOMS, great with kids, food is seasoned well. Our meals were:Steak SandwhichBisteak Breaded ChickenThe kids had rice and black beans and bisteak Drinks: Coffee, Cola & Mango Smoothies Our experience was great, again for me to give them a 5 better seating arrangements and please fix the coffee. Way better than 90 Miles! 100%"
"The sandwiches are very good, especially the Ropa Vieja. For coffee lovers, you can't go wrong with a Cortadito. :p"
"I love their Cuban Steak Sandwich! I also ordered a side of plátanos fritos, black beans, and white rice. Mom had the pulled pork Cuban sandwich and gave me a taste, that was also very good. They are big sandwiches, soo come with an appetite! I enjoyed the atmosphere, the music, location, and staff.... Very friendly staff! I used a yelp purchased voucher that was a little tricky to use and was not explained properly on the Yelp site before I purchased it? There is a ""Used it"" Button that has to be presented for the cashier to depress to toggle it to ""Used"" along with the code sent to your email. Be ready to access that at the restaurant!"
Home style authentic Cuban cuisine. We both ordered the mixed empanadas and Cuban sandwich with cafe con leche. A must!
the food was delicious. the yuca was a little dry (I got the yuca with mojo). but the service could have been a bit better. it was busy but I think it could have been better. overall a good experience.
"My husband and I visited Señor Pan on Fullerton around three weeks ago (April) and it was our first time eating there. The service was excellent!!! That is very important to me. However I felt that the steak was a bit too chewy. The tostones were a tiny bit soggy. (I personally know how to make tostones, so I'm quite picky with that). Overall, I would return just because of the excellent service we received."
YUM! Croquetta sandwitch was delish! Manequitas...c'mon I ate the whole box by myself! Love love loveeee it!
"Place was excellent! Great food, music and service was amazing. Lets not forget the prices. Highly recommend it. .. Yvette Magaña was really nice."
"Once again awesome food. Has YET to disappoint. If you want GREAT Cuban food at a great price along with good portions, look no further this is the place. Also highly recommend the Ropa Vieja, best in town."
"Food is great.  As good as my mom.  The guava pastries is as good as the ones from Miami.  The only thing I do not like is the service.  Some of the women that work there need a few lessons on how to treat customers.  Still giving a good review.  My girlfriend loves the café con leche.  Been there around 4 times.  Never had bad meal.  Lechon Asado, congri,  Pollo Guantanamera, ect...  You can't go wrong."
"One of my favorite places! Delicious Cuban food!! My favorite by far is ropa vieja sandwich, yuca con mojo y arroz congrí! Yummmmm......"
"The Housemate loves a Cubano, and has been wanting to get one for a while now, so tonight she went down to Senor Pan and picked up a couple for supper.  She said the guy behind the counter was very nice, and the price for two sandwiches and an order of plantains with garlic sauce was quite reasonable, both good things.The sandwich was quite good, though the pork was a bit tough.  It had a nice flavor though.  I'd have liked a bit more cheese and mustard but that's a personal thing.  The plantains were very good.I really want to try some of their other dishes before I go past an A-Ok rating, but I think Senor Pan will eventually earn at least another star.  It was a good beginning to our relationship."
"Went there twice with my partner. The first time was for lunch. The food was OK. The service was OK. The second time that I went, the service sucked!!! We went there for dinner. I requested hot sauce. The waitress must have forgotten to bring it so I asked the guy that brought the water for hot sauce. Instead of doing the easy thing and getting the hot sauce, he went and told the waitress. She was busy doing something behind the bar (and constantly chewing on her bubble gum). I assume that the guy was some kind of a ""manager"" and too good to bring the hot sauce. He only brought it when he saw that I was starring directly at him several minutes later. He brought a bottle of hot sauce and sort of slid it on the table. Haven't been back since and not planning to. I know several other Cuban restaurants where I can spend my money, get much better service, and less attitude... not to mention hot sauce that is not in a bottle. The food was blend but I could have overlooked this if the service had been adequate."
"Good food, decent prices, esp. with he Yelp coupon. We really like the plantains with the garlic sauce. The waitresses are friendly and hot."
"Awesome place. Authentic Cuban food, at super affordable prices.Portions are huge too!We started off with the ham croquettes.  Deliciously fried treats.  Creamy center, awesome dipping sauce.   Next we had the Mariquitas,  Homemade plantain Chips with Garlic Sauce.  Sliced lengthwise, crispy and good.  We had 2 sandwiches, the Ropa de Vieja and the steak sandwich.  Both were the Regular  (cheap!!) but were huge! Couldn't imagine finishing the grande size.  Both were very tasty.Finally, we finished off with cafe con leche.   We saw a lot of coffee takeout orders, even during early afternoon. The owner is great, personally came to check on our dining experience as well.  Huge space, quick polite service,and great food. Will definitely be back."
"5 stars for the steak sandwich! Seasoned perfectly, and a steal of a deal for a meal that tastes this good. Good portion size too!"
"Being raised on Cuban food, I have to say that the food brought back AMAZING memories of my Grandmothers cooking. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service, and VERY delicious food. Highly recommend the ""Ropa Vieja sandwhich"" and ""Fried Yuca"" and for dessert don't forget to try the flan and a ""Cafe Con Leche"" to go. You WILL NOT be disappointed."
The food was great and service awesome!
"My latest 5-star review!!!! ""Wow"" and ""Whoa Doggie, That's AMAZING"" certainly are deserving words for this fairly new Cuban restaurant. I've tried most of the Cuban restaurants in the city, and this one surely takes the cake.  The details: Although a bit hard to see off of Fullerton (made even worse by their incredibly small sign and letters that blend in with the background), Senor Pan brings in a good crowd. The inside is rustic, bold colors on the walls, wonderful bright paintings of Cuba on other walls, and just a fantastic smell of fresh food lingers in the air. I've been here twice, and on both occassions it was more than 50% occupied with customers (prolly holds a max of about 50 people....). So that's a good sign right off the bat.The menu specializes in sandwiches and traditional Cuban food (senorpan.com/index.php?o…). They have choices ranging from their signature Cuban sandwich to delicious marinated steak sandwiches (both are the best I've had in Chicago). The best part? They are cheap - $4.95 for a normal size or $6.95 for a SUPER-size sandwich that comes with freshly made chips. Their entrees are very cheap for Cuban food in Chicago and come with TONS of food too. Either way, its a good deal for great food.Their cuban sandwich was recently ranked as the #1 Cuban Sandwich in Chicago (cafemagazine.com/index.p…). I agree with this review 100% and can attest to its superiority.  (I used to claim that 90 Mile Cuban Cafe had the best.... however, they have been increasing their prices and now its just too expensive for a budget-eater to even eat here. For shame....).Want a real good deal? Order this:-Empanada de carne - $1 (a little shredded beef wrapped in a dough and fried to perfection - this beef is actually ""Ropa Vieja"" and is WONDERFULLY sweet and perfectly cooked) -Mariquitas con Mojo - $2.50 (huge plate of thinly sliced and fried plantains that taste like long potato chips that you dip in a tasty/oil-free sauce!).-Sandwich de Bistec (steak) - $4.95 - the best steak sandwich I've had in chitown...... Marinated steak, piled with lots of the extras on the sandwich!Total of the above (which I easily shared with another person): $8.45 Yes, under 10 bucks for an amazing lunch that you will be raving about to your friends (and dreaming about when you sleep).Enjoy, Be Happy, and Cheers!"
Really Really Good Sandwiches! The Steak was my favorite but now I have found the pernil to be the best!  Actually they are all great and should be tried at some time.  Reasonable Prices.
"Oh how I miss Miami. The beautifully tanned locals, the culture, the partying, and...hey, I'm  a Yelper after all, THE FOOD!  Coming to Senor Pans, you have your ropa Viejas, fried yucca dipped in a garlic dressing, black beans and rice and a nice array drinks.  Tropical is in the back of your mind in the setting with wooden tables, a steady pace of customers and a friendly staff. Simple is always best when running a restaurant , especially when the star is THE FOOD.  Me and the dining companion chose the mega sandwiches so we could split them and sample both. I had the steak with the fried egg.  As quoted from past reviews, I mean, ""HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY MESS SOMETHING UP WITH A FRIED EGG ON TOP?!""  You just CAN'T!  And if you do, well then your place just deserves to either be shut down or revamped with the help of Gordon Ramsey.  Anyway, the sandwich was juicy and the bread itself was divine.  It had a great crunchy factor with still being soft in the middle.  Ahhh yes, let the clouds to heaven part....Dinner mate chose the ham and pork combo.  Now I'm not a pork fan, so with this pork duo, I wasn't too delighted of his choosing, but hey, ""when in Rome"", I'm good to try at least a bite of it.  Ummm yah....Bite whatever...  I loved my sandwich, but favored this one. Yes, ME, the non-ham person.  Go figure, but heyyyyy, they do it well!  When you finish, you can't believe it is all done. You are left wondering if there is a round 2.  On a Sunday, the parking here is pretty difficult in the lot because a lot of families do dine here.  The food is reasonable, the heapings are bountiful, and the staff are very nice!"
"We all have our favorites but there is no denying that in the States there is no better Cuban food than Miami, individually and collectively Miami is tops for Cuban food. That said, a person can find bright spots all across America for good authentic Cuban food. Senor Pan is such a place. The Ropa Vieja was outstanding, the jamon croquettas and the fried plantains were perfect. A really great place for the some fantastic Cuban staples."
"I drove 35 minutes to get here because there are no Cuban restaurants near me.  It was worth the drive!! We had the Pan con Mantequilla which for me was just that bread and butter.  My son however loved it and said it was the best bread he's ever had. With my cortadito in hand I was able to order with a clear head.  Lechon asado and Ropa Vieja.  I was excited to learn that each entree comes with your choice of rice and a side. I got to order everything I wanted to try and not have to pay extra. The Ropa Vieja was a little cold but the flavor was great, the pork was awesome! The bus boys walk around and clear plates and because it's not a huge restaurant our waitress kept an eye on us and we never wanted for anything. The restaurant is filled with beautiful Cuban art and lively pictures hang on the wall.  The staff is friendly and the overall atmosphere is cool and laid back. Well worth the drive."
"I wanted to like Senor Pan, I really did. Especially since I've heard from others that its good and it has great reviews on here. Idk...maybe I went on an ''off'' night for them but my experience was not that great.I went on a Saturday night. Which I would think would be a busy night for them so they would be on it....not so.First to drink I asked just for water, the waitress gives me a glass of just plain room temp water. I asked for ice and she said they didn't have any. EHHHH?! No ice?! How is a restaurant not gna have ice? OK ...I guess I will just drink this warm water then, ahh how refreshing. (note the sarcasm)So then for my meal I ordered Ropa Vieja (which is one of my favorite things to eat so I was bent on getting it). Waitress tells me they don't have any. WHAT?! Dang! That's all I really wanted to eat! How is a cuban restaurant not gna have the trademark dish on a busy night? HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!So instead I got the Lechon Asado (which I didn't really want to much, but then again there was nothing that I really wanted except the Ropa Vieja - but by this time I was starving and had to get something) with white rice, black beans and yuca. The Lechon was pretty greasy and didn't have to much flavor to it. Oh also I forgot to mention that I ordered the Empanada Trio as an appetizzer, which were good the only complaint was big hunks of fat in the chicken one...gross!My husband ordered the Cubano sandwich which was okay but I think El Cubanito on Pulaski has Cuban sandwiches on lock cuz this sandwich didn't even compare to theirs. El Cubanito has the best Cubanos around point blank period. So to some it up, I won't be going back to Senor Pan. I love 90 Miles, Cafe Bolero, El Cubanito and El Rinconcito Cubano....if you want DELICIOUS cuban food with no complaints stick with one of those places."
"I've only tried the sandwiches they have to offer and they're damn delicious and super cheap. On my first visit, Florida Marlin's player Carlos Lee was there with his family, so you may run in to celebrities ha! This place is truly as great as everybody says it is. Parking sucks though."
"With so many Cuban sandwich shops in Chicago, how does one stand out?1. The Senor Pan Trio: you get to pick mini versions of any three sandwiches on the menu for $4.50! I tried the Sandwich Cubano, Media Noche and De Ropa Vieja. All three were amazing, with the Sadnwich Cubano just a cut about the rest.2. Super friendly staff. Senor Pan's counter man chatted with me, told me a little about the restaurant, then sat down with another customer for a game of dominoes. Thats the kinda shop I really can get into.3. Free wi-fi. So I can write my Yelp reviews while scarfing down the yummy plaintain chips with garlic sauce.4. Breakfast sandwiches all day. Because sometimes you want Pan Con Timba (Cuban bread with guava jam and cream cheese) but don't wanna wake up before noon.I was a bit stunned to see a can of Diet Coke for $1.25, but the sandwich was so affordable, I couldn't complain."
Definitely lived up the previous reviews on Yelp -- very good Cuban cuisine!
"It's ok. After being charmed at 90 Miles and whose-is-it-ed at El Cubanito (and gas faced at Habana Libre - boo!!), I was on the hunt for more good Cuban chow in Chicago. I wasn't overly impressed. The food was good enough but there were some serious problems that made me question whether or not I would ever come back.I came at lunch time and they were out of several selections. I understand lunch is a rush, but that's also why you prep for it. People are coming to your restaurant with the intent to fly in (with money) and out (with good food in hand). Folks don't want to hear, ""We're out of that. That, too. And, that."" I was getting pretty annoyed, which made me feel badly as the young lady who took my order was very polite and helpful. That leads to another thing folks should know: it's almost all Spanish all the time at the counter (at least, my experience). My Spanish is serviceable. I can order food. I can ask for directions. I can plead for bo.. wrong site. In any case, I can get by. If you can't speak a lick of Spanish, you might want to consider going elsewhere. I saw a couple of customers have a pretty frustrating exchange at the counter. I am guessing this is a family biz, but it's likely that non-Spanish speakers have heard of the restaurant and would like to patronize you. Make.them.feel.welcome.The food was okay. I have had better. I have had worse. Thing is, for how long it took to get to me and how much it cost, I wanted this sandwich (Cubano; litmus test) to pay my bills and call me, 'pretty.' For a shake and sandwich, I forked over $12. $12!! My world was rocked at El Cubanito for $7. I could get an entire dinner order with meat, rice, beans, etc. at 90 Miles for around $12. $12 for a sandwich and shake is not cutting it. Not at all...especially when there are other options lurking around the corner and I wasn't completely satiated by the meal. You gotta do better, Senor."
excellent cuban Food!
"The first time I ate here we ate in the restaurant and today I got carry out. Both times the food has been outstanding. Our waiter was just ok, service could have been better so I opted for carry out this time. Got the sample platter to experience all their goodies and a bistec sandwich. For real, could be one of the best sandwiches in Chicago.  Even if you 'don't like Cuban food', still try this place. Where else can you get such a good steak sandwich for $5 in Chicago?? I had the Cubano the first time and it was good but I""m glad I tried something else also. I look forward to trying several other of their sandwiches as well.  The counter clerk was very nice and allowed me to use my $10 for $20 coupon on carry-out even though it seems they dont normally do so. I will tell everyone to try it out."
I came here with low expectations and wow! I was blown away at how good their sandwiches are! And the price is so affordable! I chose the option where its $4.95 to try 3 of the sandwiches because I had never been here before and let me tell u... it was super yummy. The bread itself is crisp and fresh. The service here was good. The waitresses are attentive and polite. The restaurant itself is very clean and big. I would def recommend this place to others.
"I love coming here to satisfy my craving for cuban food.  The staff is friendly and attentive, great customer service.  The food is always delicious and reasonably priced.  They have kids menu selections that my kids love, grilled chicken with black beans and rice.  The sandwich selections are tasty and the mojitos are very good as well."
"I'm a bit biased since I grew up in South Florida where the Cuban food is just outstanding. This is really a 3.5 star rating.The exterior is a bit unassuming. The Senor Pan sign wasn't big enough, so we actually passed the restaurant. A quick U-turn solved the problem, so that was fine.The interior of this restaurant is nice. There is a very handsome mural on one wall and flat screens to watch yer favorite colonial era Spanish soap opera. There is also a very nice counter where you can eat and/or order food for take away. So, being from South Florida, I came to this restaurant the other day knowing exactly what I wanted. My love and I ordered ham croquetas, mariquitas con mojo, lechon asado con congri y maduros, vieja ropa con arroz amarillo y frijoles, one pastelito de guayaba y queso and a Jupina soda.The ham croquetas were yummy, and they were even better with the dipping sauce they provided. The mariquitas con mojo were also very good, but you have to eat 'em while they're hot! My lechon asado was just okay. My love's vieja ropa was slightly better, but also just okay. I've had much better pastelitos in my life, but Senor Pan gets an A+ for making them fresh every day. The Jupina soda was everything I remembered it to be, a very sweet pineapple soda, so it was satisfying. The highlight of my meal was my order of maduros; they were delicious.Overall, I would visit this place again if I were in the neighborhood."
"I think this is one of the best places for lunch in the area. Parking lot tends to be full at that time. We get our office lunches (take-out) from here occasionally. Other times I get it on my own. Service is very polite and quick. Orders are ready in 10 minutes.   The sandwiches are crispy and delicious. My coworkers like the steak sandwiches, sometimes the chicken. Our employer loves the ham & cheese. I'm vegetarian so I get the veggie sandwich. When I'm in the mood for breakfast from there, I get the veggie omelette. The hot sauce is awesome but use with caution. I have found it is best to open the sandwich and dizzle rather than dip to get a slightly more subtle kick.    The only thing that made me knock off a star is simply because as a vegetarian, I expect dishes to be either 1) slightly cheaper or 2) include a lot of veggies and either cheese or avocado for the same price. $7.50 w/ tax for a regular size sandwich w/ the extras is a bit overkill to me, especially for the area. It isn't a deal breaker, but it reduces the number of times I go there."
"How shocked was I here, really!!! From the food to the waiter service, all around great experience. Thought the mojoito's could have been better, but was worth ordering two, lol. Would come back in a heart beat!"
"Ok food and horrible service. First off I want to say that Señor Pan used to be my favorite Cuban restaurant but due to the decline of their food quality and customer service it's now a place if only visit if I was starving and happened to be right in front of their restaurant. I used to recommend them to everyone but can no longer do so. My husband and I visited in a Sunday and much to our surprise it wasn't as packed as we had seen in the past. We were sat down fairly quick but it took ten minutes for anyone to ask us if we wanted anything to drink or to to start off with any appetizers. We looked over to the other side of the restaurant and counted 5 employees standing around and talking with one another. When we finally ordered and received  our drinks and appetizers I had to wave down an employee because our order wasn't complete. As I looked around I couldn't help but notice that there didn't seem to be a manager on duty. What I saw was a bunch of fairly young employees acting like the boss wasn't there. When we got our main dishes, I was very disappointed. I ordered the boliche (first time ordering it here). I am 100% Cuban and I've tasted very good homemade boliche. The boliche was obviously days old and the sauce was a very dull brown and old looking color. I didn't send it back because I truly felt that the staff on duty that day would not have treated my request with dignity (if you know what I mean). Throughout our meal, anytime we needed something we had to wave as if we were stranded on an island with our eyes on a passing ship. We had to wave over employees to clear our table as well. Needless to say I was very disappointed with the decline of their customer service and the fact that they served me very old boliche."
"My first time having Cuban fast food.I started out with Mariquitas Con Mojo, which was fried plantain chips w/ a garlic dipping sauce. I love garlic.I ordered the Sandwich Trio, so I could sample any 3 sandwiches of my choice.  Roast pork, Steak, & the Cubano.  I liked the Cubano out of the three.  I found the pork to be somewhat on the dry side.The mango shake was delicious.  It was a milkshake, not an ice smoothie like others.I didn't get to try any of the entrees.Great prices.  Very clean inside."
"Finally time for my birthday family meal, it is only over a week late! Well I will say things have been quite busy around the old family home lately. This is the first free day when we can all get together. I decided on Senor Pan, since we are a Cuban household. This restaurant came highly rated from you Yelpers. The ratings were only fours and fives. So we head up north to pick up our oldest daughter and then head over to Fullerton. There is a parking lot right in front of the restaurant. There is a pretty good crowd for a late Saturday lunch, early Saturday dinner. We start out ordering two orders of the Croquetas De Jamon (Ham Croquettes). They were very good. All the Cubans at our table agreed these tasted like a true Cuban made them and reminded everyone of the home made version. We also ordered the Mariquitas Con Mojo (Homemade Plantain Chips with Garlic Sauce). These were good also. It was strange that the Plantains were cut with ridges just like Ruffles have ridges). So they were not as thin as they could have been. Also they could have used more salt. For our main orders I started with the Senor Pan Trio (3 mini sandwiches of my choice). I got the Sandwich Cubano (sandwich with Ham, Roast Pork, Cheese and Pickles, this was very good and I am not a big fan of ham or pickles), Sandwich De Boliche (Roasted Beef, Lettuce and Tomato, this one was even better) and finally the Sandwich De Ropa Vieja (Shredded Flank Steak in Tomato Sauce, this one was truly the BEST). I will say two of my favorite Cuban dishes have to be Ropa Vieja and Boliche and in that order too. Oh I almost forgot I also ordered a Mango Batidos (milkshake, very, very delicious). Well Maria and my youngest son both ordered the Bistec Encebollado (Grill Onions Steak). Of course I tasted their steak and it was very good. They both thought the steak was very good but the rice, black beans and plantains were just average. My oldest son and youngest daughter both ordered the Ropa Vieja (Shredded Beef, my favorite Cuban dish). Dad had to tried some (remember it is my birthday meal and my favorite dish) and I thought it was truly outstanding. They both agreed on the beef but again just thought the rice, black beans and plantains were just average. Finally my oldest daughter order the Boliche (Roast Eye of Round Cuban Style, my second favorite Cuban dish). I also was allowed to sample this one and again thought it was one of the best I have ever tried. My daughter agreed on the meat but also thought her sides were just average. Finally for desert my wife and two daughters all ordered the Flan. They really liked it a lot. Usually they order Flan and say afterward that it was too jello like. This Flan was firmer and tasted very good. So this time at Senor Pan they all LOVED their Flan and thought it was just like a true Cuban would have made. Oh I almost forgot, (remember I am older now) I also ordered another Senor Pan Trio to go. My sandwiches were just sooo good that I had to place another order to go. I figured I had another yummy meal for the next day. So all this food and with drinks our total bill came to roughly $85 dollars. Actually it was a bit higher with a tip that our waitress did not want to accept (I left her a tip anyway). Since it is a family run place I think they don't want to accept tips. But the service was just sooo friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend Senor Pan to everyone and we do plan on heading back to Fullerton for another yummy Cuban meal."
