Park Tavern
"I came here before my first Hawks game. It is within walking distance of the United Center but they also offer free bus shuttle service before and after the game. I was here for a private event which used the east side banquet area. This area is carpeted complete with large round tables, tall boys, and a mini bar. The mini bar looked like a re-purposed coat check room. The west side is the main bar and restaurant area. Large modern sports bar with plenty of tables, bar space, televisions, you name it. They also have a nice large outdoor area. This place is kind of hidden within a commercial like building. If you weren't looking for it you wouldn't know it was there.My buddy left his phone here before going to the game and they actually still had it when we returned. What are the chances of that? The manager helped us find it and he was very kind."
"Overall a really nice venue! The place is big with plenty of seating, tall booths, and a spacious patio/outdoor bar area. It's close to the United Center and you an score free parking nearby (not everywhere though so pay attention to the signs).We came with a gilt coupon and ordered their beer flight, a few cocktails and a few appetizers. Our server was super nice, but seemed a little lost. We found out later that it was his first day. The calmer appetizer and sweet potato fries were good.Ordering beers for their flights was a little confusing though. Their menu states most of their beers are available for flights, but not all of them were actually. You get 4 beers for your flight.Cocktails were decent and some had funny names. Each $10. The night we went on (a Friday, non-event night) the place was pretty empty, except for a big party happening outside. So we got to sit wherever we wanted."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!I will start with the ambiance because that's what sticks out most!! It is amazing!  You pick your mood, sporty, romantic, laid back; you can come here and make it work!  There are TVs galore for the sports fanatic, the outdoor patio is hands down... AMAZING... the large booths can provide an area for a little alone time or romance... there is even a private area upstairs suitable for gatherings... im considering having an engagement party there... IF HE EVER POPS THE QUESTION... SHEESH... nevertheless... I DIGRESS... back to business.... I have been there several times and have never once had a bad experience.  ALL OF THE FOOD HAS BEEN EXCELLENT... and i have tried several... my absolute favorite is the Brisket Sandwich... and Fries... they are heavenly... but last night I had roasted red pepper hummus with cucumber, kalamata olive relish, andseasoned flatbread ..... TO DIE FOR! They have a huge selection of craft beers as well!!! Yesssssssss!!!! The waiter was extremely helpful to me seeing that I was a beer newbie looking for the perfect choice! I say... GO THERE TODAY AND TRY THEM OUT... It's beautiful outside and the perfect day to check their patio out!!!!"
"What the heck has happened to this place?  On my last two visits, the service has been terrible, the bathrooms filthy and the food just so so.  And given I was the one on both occasions who suggested my group go here, I have to take Park Tavern off my list of pre UC places until they get their act together.Yesterday's visit had to be the worst.  We had a reservation but there was no one at the hostess stand to tell that to so we just took a seat on the patio.  Our server was having an off day (was she even a server?) as she didn't write things down, forgot parts of our order and at one point when we flagged her down to ask about a beer we had been waiting 30 minutes for, she said, ""oh, were you the ones who ordered that beer?  We're out of it""So we ordered a replacement beer which came 30 minutes later after the food and right before we had to leave to get to our event.Don't try ordering the deep dish pizza here.  The server said it could take up to an hour and a half (I could call a pizza place and have one delivered in half that time!)  And if you need things like napkins, plates, utensils or anything else, you might as well go into the the restaurant yourself and find it on your own.  The table behind us did just that and went inside for a bucket of beers and their drinks.  We had other people's food delivered to our table, drinks put down and then taken to their proper table and at one point it was such a joke that the customers were all playing ""who's food is this?"" and then getting it to the right table.Sadly, the place wasn't even that busy.  Just horribly unorganized.  I asked to speak to a manager, and when no one showed up at the table, I went inside to the bar to find the person that the server had described to us.  When I asked her if she was the manager, she just shrugged and said she ""guessed so"".Park Tavern, you are officially off my go to list.  Unless you are trying to start a whole ""self serve"" concept, you've got some work to do!"
"Deviled eggs and outdoor summer games like cornhole? Count me in! No seriously, I am very glad I happened to have found this place on Yelp and it truly lived up to it's reputation etc.. Many of my friends ordered burgers which they all throughly enjoyed and I the deviled eggs with bacon on it. Yes... how to make deviled eggs better then they already are? Just add bits of crushed up bacon to the mix to make it that much better. Overall a solid place and I look forward to coming back sooner then later."
"Had a great pre-concert meal!  Wine and lots of craft beers.  Sit inside or outside...with fire-pits.  Shuttle service (free) to United Center.  Jerry, the driver was personable, prompt and loved his job.  Make sure you tip him!   Jerry also felt sorry for our cab not showing up to take us back downtown Chicago...so we drove is to the front door of the vote!  Happy to pay Jerry vs a cabbie."
"We were looking for a good place to get dinner while on our way to University Village and Park Tavern appeared on my girlfriend's Yelp app. Thank God for Yelp. I almost feel like it's my civic duty to give back by contributing reviews because my girlfriend has used the app so much to find awesome new places to try. The atmosphere in here I would liken to a more upscale sports bar. There were a bunch of high chairs at the bar, which created a cool aesthetic. It created a kind of romantic atmosphere. I know, right? In a sports bar? That's what Park Tavern delivers. There's really something for everyone here. We tried a beer flight to start, which was fairly generously portioned with four different beers to try. I generally enjoyed most of them, though one of them was too hoppy for my tastes. I was a little disappointed that a few of the ones I wanted were not included as options for the flights. It all worked out fine for me, though. My girlfriend and I were both eyeing the grilled cheese with candies bacon, but we didn't both want to get the same thing, so I let her get it. I opted for a burger, which was pretty darn good. Then, I tried her grilled cheese and it was really fantastic--definitely the star of our meal. I wanted her to have leftovers so I could steal them, but she gobbled it up. I can't say I blame her! Our service was great--friendly and prompt. No complaints here. I would love to come back here whenever I'm in the area. The food menu looks solid, as does the drink menu."
"I stopped in on a Friday afternoon after an appointment at nearby Rush. Nice place but the food and service did not match.  Actually the service wasn't too bad, but could have been little better. However, the food sucked.  First problem is that we weren't even done with the appetizers when our meals came out. Now I can understand that this was normal lunch time and those that visit on their lunch break might have like this speed. The foot long grill cheese did not come prepared as stated in the menu.  I also had to send back the burger as it was over cooked. The bottle beer could have been colder so I tried a tap beer. The tab beer was colder but they served my drink in the wrong glass.  They sell a 16oz Stella draft for $5 (good deal) but it comes in a 12oz glass. I will give it another shot on my next visit to Rush"
"Came here by accident before going to Bulls game- it's a couple minutes away from the stadium and they offer a shuttle to and from the stadium for free. If you park in lot across the street they will validate your ticket. Service is excellent!Happy hour is 3-5:30 and 9-11 where they have discounts on appetizers and drinks. I got a jack n coke for only $4 and it was the perfect pour with balance of whiskey and coke. Decorated and playing music for the holidays. Such a large and nice bar. Great for lunch, after work drinks, or dinner before game/ show- anything!Now the food...we ordered house salad which is huge and has delicious Greek goddess dressing. I thought I was the only person that ever got that kind! Pretzels with honey mustard dipping sauce and ribs were amazing! Then we got tacos where you get four mini tacos and a side of Brussels sprouts roasted with melted Parmesan cheese on top. Amazing! Definitely recommend it to everyone!"
Outstanding food and VERY reasonable prices! Lots of beers on tap and the perk of having a shuttle bus that goes to the United Center just adds to the experience. AND they take reservations? Will definitely be back!
Good spot to come for anything united center related. They offer free parking in the lot behind them. This is not marked at all and if I had not read reviews I wouldn't have ever know this but after asking the hostess twice she assured me even though signs seemed to say otherwise we were parked correctly.  They also offer a free shuttle to the united center which is a nice option in cold weather months. Although honestly it's only about 4-5 blocks from the stadium. But each time I have used the shuttle it was fast and efficient yet packed like sardines but hey it's free (STANDEES PERMITTED ON THIS BUS). Don't forget to tip the driver. Anywho...now onto the spot itself. The space is large and open and doesn't offer much of an identity but is modern and clean. They take reservations and I would suggest making one before any events. They do have a large bar but that fills up fast so having a table reserved will assure you get in and out. The food menu is expansive although unlike many places who have large variety they actually handle it well. Creative and well prepared food and fun to try a variety of their offerings. I will say the service here can be a little slow and not overly attentive.Finally I haven't been in the summer but they do have a patio and outdoor bar. SCORE!
Awesome tacos and Tuesday is featured for tacos. Juicy fish with light breading makes these irresistible. And the chicken tacos are made with chargrilled corn. Yum. Today I had the cheese curds. Wow.  Light and crispy. So top notch. I've been here many times and plan to keep coming back.
"We ate a late dinner here once we got to the city.  We were staying on the medical campus for a seminar and Park Tavern had the best Yelp reviews close.  First, it was a Monday night so there was noone there.  Mon. night football was on like 15 TVs and that was great.  We got there late (like 9PM) and they were still serving full menu.  Yay!We ordered some yummy Hopslayer beer and that was obviously good!For dinner we both ordered the ""MOO"" This was slow cooked brisket in a BBQ sauce.  I give it a solid ""A"".  It was a HUGE order and I couldn't finish it (that never happens).I had a side of broccolini ""A""  and mashed potatoes.  I was very happy with the meal and the game being on like 50 televisions.  For a monday night we weren't looking for a busy bar so ""empty"" was perfect.  I will be back on a busier night to see what that's like, but so far so good!"
"I stopped by Park Tavern last night before the Bulls game. It was my first visit and I was excited to check it out.My first impression is mixed... I liked the decor and the overall feel of the place. It's a modern, traditional sports bar. I thought it was a bit to loud but given that it IS a sports bar that's to be expected.We walked in and met the hostess at the entrance of the restaurant. She barely looked us in the eye and didn't offer even a hint of warmth. It was as if she were a robot simply programmed to do her job efficiently and effectively. My friend and I weren't that hungry so we just decided to get drinks and an appetizer. Honestly, we weren't too happy with the selections on the menu but reluctantly decided on the pretzel sticks. They were average pretzel sticks. Nothing special or extraordinary. The queso that was served with it didn't taste like any cheese I've ever eaten but it was decent.I ordered a peach sangria that was literally served with two piece of fruit. That was odd to me but the drink was good so I didn't care. I didn't even drink half of it and still left with a decent buzz. Our server was nice but he wasn't all that friendly either. He didn't smile or even say thank you for coming when he dropped off the bill. He simply set it on the table and walked away. I don't know. Perhaps I'm expecting too much of service industry employees.  Overall, I just wasn't all that impressed but the menu looked decent. I'd be open to giving Park Tavern another shot sometime in the future."
We love to stop by this bar after the bulls game.We would park near the bar and walked to the stadium. They definitely have better pricing for their drinks here compare to the stadium
"Park Tavern is in the building I work in, so I've been here countless times.  The fish tacos are great and I love $2 taco Tuesdays, but I've noticed that over the last year the tacos have gotten super tiny! Other favorite food items are the Mexibano Sandwich, Grilled Cheese, Gumbo, and their Mac and Cheese of the day.  I'd suggest standardizing and indicating on the menu the specials and soups of the day.  Lunch business here is highly dependent on regulars in the building or from the hospital across the street, so it would be helpful to know which day of the week you can get your favorite soup or special."
"I would have chosen no stars if possible.Went here to eat before a concert at United Center. I called for reservations, but none were available. I was told that the outdoor seating was ""first come, first served."" When we arrived, there was plenty of outdoor seating but no servers. The hostess said to order from the bartender and feel free to eat at any vacant table. We stood in line at the bar for 15 minutes. The bartender didn't acknowledge us. When the manager came by, my friend asked about ordering. She said, ""We are understaffed. You just have to wait.""Having been in the service industry, I totally understand being understaffed; however, being rude is just plain unacceptable.Needless to say, we left. On the way to grab a burger at Billy Goat's, we walked past Angel's on Ashland. We decided to eat there. It was amazing. See my review on their Yelp! page."
"Were in Chitown for kids follow up at Rush Hospital. Needed close by place that kiddo, wifey and I all could enjoy. No small feat!Found this place on yelp (always the most useful place on the Internet). Reviews were spot on. Me: hinterlands coffee stout and fish street tacos. The beer is a Green Bay brewer that I love so good to see it in the Windy City. We MKE types love to share. Tacos were muy bien. Off the hook (pun) good. Fresh and tortilla was perfect. Great rice and beans. Now I need a siesta!Kiddo: fish n chips.  No soggy newspaper greasers here. They were lightly breaded, perfectly fried sticks of goodness. She is picky so if she likes it I am super happy.  Hey Mikey she liked it. Wifey: carnitas street tacos. Juicy, yummy get of town great. I ate one for her. She had a whit bier. Quite an extensive selection on tap at reasonable Chitown prices (we in MKE are fortunate to have better prices). Nice weekly specials too. Very friendly and helpful waiter.  CheckGood vibe. CheckWe will be back (but hopefully not to the hospital again)"
"This place shows as closed when it is indeed open. Just know when you go, that they're rarely open if there isn't an event at the U.C.We went after the bulls game and there were numerous tables that were open. People started to trickle in. Upon arrival our turd server informed us that the kitchen was closing in ten minutes.After serving us both the wrong drinks the dbag had a bit of attitude as well. Older dude wearing glasses on the top of his nose clearly hating his life. Sorry dude?Any hoot. The street tacos of marinated steak are awesome. There's some Mexicans in the kitchen who know what they're doing. And the lemon jalapeño wings are a little spicy and also amazing."
"We basically came here, before a Hawks game, because of the reviews.  The whole experience was worth it. We arrived at good time and greeted and seated right away. Our server was Malorie and she was fantastic and answered all of our questions. We tried the Animal Tots, because of the reviews, they were delicious. My son got the kids burger, he was afraid it would be small, it was a good size and he ate every bit of it. My husband and I ordered the tacos and they were fresh and delicious.  We had a couple drinks each and the overall bill wasn't too bad at all. I will definitely recommend this establishment to my friends and family and the next time we are down for another Hawks game, we will for sure come back."
"A bit too sports-bar for me, but as far as sports bars go, it's pretty cool. Good food, good beer selection, decent prices for the area."
"Any place that puts pulled pork, cheese curds, grainy mustard, a fried egg, and a rich stout gravy atop tater tots is legit in my book. I would pistol whip a toddler for some of that sh*t. But luckily for yo childrens, I don't have to. I can get them at Park Tavern. If you don't know, I'm talking about their ""animal tots"". Their other food could suck, but I'd still come here for these. It doesn't hurt that they have myriad beers on tap. And the place is huge and often not crowded. They have two bars. Their smaller bar is bigger than many places lone bar. It's close to the United Center, making it ideal for a pre/post game hang. But I'd come here just to watch a game and grab a bite as well."
"I like when bars are dead, as Park Tavern was the night of a Rod Stewart show.  I was able to comfortably watch Game 1 of the World Series, which was important, because Red Sox.  No one was there to talk shit (well, except for the person sitting next to me), but aside from that, the 4 other people there couldn't have cared less.  Beer, food and a giant projector to watch the Red Sox crush that other team.  Heaven, right?Eh.  The food was alright.  The beer selection was okay.  There are two other bars in the area I'd probably prefer going to, but for games most people don't care about (such as the World Series), I'd come back."
"Went here before a Bulls game with some out of town business contacts and for what we used it for, it was perfect.  They have a pretty good beer list and some interesting appetizers.  We did the animal tots, calamari, spare ribs and wings.  All were sold bar food, no surprises.  As everyone notes, the tots are an interesting spin on a classic and worth trying.  They also have free parking and a shuttle to the UC.  The shuttle fills up and people will be standing in the aisle so get on early if you really want a seat.  I stood and it was no biggie.  Or you can walk over, it is about a 5 minute walk.  Also note that the shuttle stops 25 minutes after gametime.  My group went to the Stadium Club for a few pops after the game and had to walk back to the bar as we missed the shuttle.  Not a biggie if you are in a group but not something I'd recommend post-game if you are by yourself at 10:30 or 11."
"This is our go-to place any night we are going to the United Center.  The logistics and food are great.There is free parking behind the building in a fenced in, lit lot.  There is a free shuttle to and from the UC that runs quite a bit.  They are open after the events for a quick taco for the road...  All good.All of the food we have tried has ranged from good to very good to excellent.  Check out the picture of their Animal Tots... They are pulled pork, cheese curds, grainy mustard, fried egg,  and local brewery home style gravy.An order of this and a few beers before hitting the shuttle is a perfect way to start a night at the UC.  After, let the traffic clear out with any of their tacos and you are good to go."
"Good size sports bar, lots of TV viewing, big menu and the food was well done. Free parking and shuttle to United Center.   The menu is definitely larger than normal sports bar food, with excellent portion size.  Things we liked: tacos with accompanying black beans and rice, fish and chips, hand cut fries and the beer list.  We would come back to try more for sure.The service is just ok though, we asked for fries substitute with our taco order's beans and rice, our server simply said: no.  He didn't even offer for us to order a side of fries  for a few bucks.  We didn't like the chorizo deviled eggs, left 4 out of 6 on the plate and he didn't bat an eye and there was no question about why we didn't like them or whether we wanted something else.This is still a positive review and we will come back since we live nearby.  Not a destination and I would not use the word gastropub though."
"I came here with friends for dinner before the Bulls game last night.  If you are going to a game at the United Center, you should absolutely have dinner here and then take their free shuttle and keep your car parked free in their lot.  This is genius of them.This has the feel of a typical sports bar.  They serve great tasting sports bar food, and have decent specials even on game nights.Our server was really friendly, and refilled our water whenever we need.  That was the best service I've had in a while.I had the chicken tacos, and they were great.  I would get them again today if I could.Since I planned to have snacks and a drink at the game, I didn't get any appetizers or drinks.  But they had appetizer specials until 5:30 and drink specials for most days of the week.There were plenty of kids in Bulls jerseys, so while it's a sports bar type place it is still family friendly.They have a large outdoor patio with an outdoor bar, actual grass for bags games, so this would be even better in the summer.They even have a large free parking lot."
I love coming here for lunch. The wings are some of the best in the city they are smoked then deep fried then grilled and some how still juicy. The buffalo sauce is great spicy and flavorful not to hot. Burgers are also great well prepared and a nice size.
"The positive yelp reviews led my husband and I here on a weeknight before a United Center concert. I'm not normally a sports bar person but it seemed like the most convenient choice (free parking & shuttle!). I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere! We got a high top table in a corner and though the TVs were on and it was busy (but not packed) it was not too noisy to converse. I had the baja fish tacos, which were excellent (even the beans and rice were amazing!) and my husband got the short rack ribs & jalapeno bacon mac. Everything was great and we'll be back next time."
"This place was just okay. I went here before a hawks game. Decent food, beer, and service. Good thing is it is extremely close to the united center. Not a lot of places around the united center have great food/drinks so this place is probably one of your best options when looking for a place to eat before a game at the united center."
Good bar before anything at the UC.  Went here for some dinner before Justin Timberlake.  Thankfully made the reso a few days before b/c it did get packed.  Service was slow but as to be expected on a busy night I guess.  Burger was okay - a little dry.  The pretzel appt was good but pretty hard to mess that one up.  All in all would only go back before a UC event.  Not really worth the trip otherwise.  They do have a free shuttle but it was a 20 min wait so we didn't get to use it.
"I met a friend for lunch here last week. She had the cream of spinach soup and fries, both of which she said were very good. I had the BBQ glazed salmon, which was also quite delicious.The highlight of the meal, besides the company and conversation of course, was the dihydrogen monoxide served two ways in a glass cylindrical vessel. I had heard about it before, and felt that I needed to experience it for myself. Those of you familiar with this know that it is available in three different states, liquid and solid being the most popular. The liquid dihydrogen monoxide really served well as a palate cleanser between bites of the salmon, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. The solid cubes of the dihydrogen monoxide served to keep the liquid part chilled, while itself turning into a liquid. The delivery method was also quite ingenious. It was a polypropylene tube which helped to direct the dihydrogen monoxide on to different part of my palate between mastications.Overall, our food was delicious and the dihydrogen monoxide was exemplary."
"This place is a hidden gem in close proximity to the United Center and close to 290. It offers free parking and shuttle service to the United Center. Met a friend here one evening after work. We chose it primarily because of its location but the service and food were very good. Our bartender was Mike and the server Chris did a good job of making sure we were well taken care of aware of all the offerings of the tavern. I had a glass of Kung Fu Riesling and the Asian Turkey Burger with Sauteed Broccoli. It was the best turkey burger ever. It was adorned with purrrrrfect toppers and it was so frickin' juicy. I simply could not believe how good it was. The thought of it has my mouth watering all over again. It really was just that good. Slap your mama good. The not so good part was the $ upcharge for substituting broccoli. Seriously, the price difference between the fries and broccoli is $1, why am I being charged $2. Guess they prefer to you consume lots of grease. Perhaps patrons filled with grease drink more booze. No idea if this has any merit but any reason beats none at all.  ...I refuse to let the stupid upcharge keep me from the Asian Turkey Burger. So until next time......... save a seat for me. I'll be there in a minute!"
"Love the baja fish tacos and a hard cider they have called ""Smith & Forge.""  I've been here a handful of times now. I have tried the pork sandwich, a burger, and the tacos... the tacos are by far the best.THE WAIT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  Not to sit down at a table, but to get service. I went for my birthday dinner and it took us 3 minutes to get seated (over half the place was empty), 10 minutes to get asked for drinks or appetizers (not by our server), a total of 23 minutes for our server to finally introduce himself and get our drinks to us after learning it was a birthday celebration, and 45 minutes to order and receive our food... so we ate an hour after we had sat down.That being said, I'd come back. I was lucky enough to go with good company so I don't mind the wait when I'm not too hungry, but DO NOT COME HERE WHEN YOU ARE STARVING.  It'll just be extra torture to wait... as you inevitably will."
"So, I realize I should probably give this place 4 stars based on the tasty food and awesome beer selection. Also they have some pretty great specials.....aaannndddd, it's easy to find parking on the street....FREE! That brings me to my next point. There's this weird sort of 'off' vibe about this place.  I've been here a few times and it's always dead. Like super dead. Like crickets. How do they stay open? There's like this weird Teamsters, mob sort of air that honestly puts me on edge. I don't mean to hate, I'm just being honest. Is it just me?  Some friends have said the same thing, but hey, it doesn't stop us from going. Like I said earlier, the food is pretty darn delicious!"
"Trying to find non-fast food in the medical village around Rush/UIC is no small feat - thank you Yelp raters for listing The Park Tavern!Industrial-chic atmosphere with high ceilings, wall booths and high tops.  My friend and I wanted real beer and were not disappointed - over 20 local brews and popular standbys on draft - including Goose Island's Matilda (personal fave)Deviled eggs were tangy with buffalo wing sauce, though a bit sloppy. Angus burger was a solid choice, with perfectly done fries. The chicken sandwich really did take two hands with the fresh bacon, Brie and arugula spilling out - great blend of flavors and went well with the salad with nuts/spiced pears.  It was worth the short drive away from the med complex"
"What's not to love about Park Tavern? Conveniently situated across the street from Rush, their menu and drink selection are a perfect way to end any work day. We always end up ordering from their app menu and I can't say enough good things about their cheese curds, tots, and french fries. The service is usually speedy and attentive and they handle a crowd really well - even on game nights."
We went Friday night before the Hawks' game. I don't understand any of the negative reviews.  The hostess was great. The wait staff was attentive without hovering. There were 30+ beers on tap. And the food was excellent. They brought everything out quickly and cooked perfectly.  We loved the chicken wings an the Mac and cheese.  I would highly recommend this place before a hawks or Bulls game.  And there is a shuttle to the UC if you don't want to walk.
No thanks for sitting at bar for 10 minutes having a bartender look you in the face and then ask customers with drinks in front of them if they need anything. I know where I'm not wanted.
"This is a mixed review.  Food (buffalo tots) and beer selection (draughts galore) are fantastic. Service? A joke. I sat at a table for 20 minutes before a server finally walked over and asked if I needed something. Generally when I go to a bar/restaurant its for a purpose, so yeah, thank you. He told me he wasn't my server but he'd get my drink. Wow. Thanks, mister! Mind you, there were about 20 other people in the bar at the time. The servers were not over wise occupied such that I couldn't get my order taken for 20 minutes. Since I figured out how to make buffalo tots at home, and there are bars with better service in the area, I'm officially done with this place. I've been here several times, but the service is consistently terrible."
"These guys deserve a ton of credit for how great their customer service is. We had to make a last-minute change to our party size, and the host was very accommodating. The food is good, and they have great game day specials for drinks. When you include the free parking behind the restaurant and shuttle to the game, you cannot go wrong with a pregame meal at Park Tavern. Best option for any Hawks or Bulls game.Tip: They are open before any event at the UC, regardless of what the website or Yelp hours show."
"I heard that Park Tavern was a fun place to go before games at the UC. It's probably the best located bar for the United Center crowd but as much as I wanted to try their famed animal tots, I walked in, took one look at their sorry draft beer list (Bud, Bud Light, Coors, etc) and made a bee line out of there. Not a place for a beer geek like me."
"I was impressed with this place when I first walked in.  Those of you familiar with this area know that there aren't many places like this in that neighborhood.  It is very close to the United Center, Malcolm X College, and all of the Illinois Medical District.  On game days they offer a shuttle from the United Center to Park Tavern.  They also have FREE WIFI.  This makes it an ideal place to meet with study buddies for adults like myself who have recently returned to school.The food is okay, nothing to brag about, however, the beer selection is great.  Servers are friendly and attentive.  The Park Tavern itself if very big and spacious, lots of tables and booths. Very clean-cut modern/rustic decor.  They have a back area that would make for good office parties.Overall, good experience.  I plan to return."
"What's not to like about free parking, great food, Delirium Tremens on tap and a free shuttle to the Hawks game? The sandwiches, especially the Mexibano, are terrific as well as the calamari and the fries are perfectly crispy. The only bit of criticism I have is the service goes downhill when it gets busy before game time. Last time it took 25 minutes to get the check after I asked for it. Having more servers on staff, especially before a Hawks game, would really help. Other than that, it's still my go to place before seeing the Hawks."
"-2 in Chicago today, so the notion of a hot soup to start sounded great. Went with the tomato soup which was delicious and creamy and warmed me enough to enjoy my Firestone Pivo Hoppy Pils. Just what it sounds like, a hoppy pils, light but hoppy. I ordered the Mexibano sandwich and a side of crispy brussel sprouts. The smoked pulled pork was tender and had just enough spice to get my nose running. The brussel sprouts were a bit too salty. I finished with the Lakefront Fixed Gear American Red, a strong yet smooth red ale. The waitstaff was very attentive, although I was an early lunch patron and only shared the restaurant with two other parties. They do give a discount off of parking across the street, be sure to get a ticket before you leave."
"Love coming here before and after a Hawks game. Don't miss a ride on the shuttle to (and back) the stadium with Jerrry. ""Jerry!!!"""
"FREE PARKING WITH A SHUTTLE TO UNITED CENTER!! Don't spend the $25 to park at the UC, come here first, park and spend that cash on their amazing beer selection!My new favorite bar/restaurant near the United Center! Park Tavern is located where the old Moretti's was...the bar was gutted and all redone and it's absolutely beautiful. There are 40 beers on tap and they have an actual menu and not just cheap bar food. The patio will be open soon as it gets warm and it's going to be a wonderful place to hang out before or after a Bulls or Hawks game or if you just want to get out on a nice day."
Love this place. Perfect for before the Hawks game.  The place is filled with Hawks fans! Tacos are fabulous and they have a nice wine selection. Gotta try the gumbo too. Best I've had.
This is a great place to pregame before any Bulls or Hawks game.  I went here before going to a Bulls game for dinner and drinks because it is near the United Center.  I ordered the Animal Tots which were ok :/ The egg was way over cooked and it didn't have enough gravy.  The beer selection made up for the dry tots :) The best part was they shuttle you to and from the United Center for free.  I enjoyed pregaming here at The Park Tavern and postgaming here after the Bulls game :)
"One of the most inviting atmospheres for a bar. Very open and welcoming, great taste in aesthetics and selection of beer/liquor. The best time to go is when they have  a late evening event at the United Center"
"I originally thought I was going out to the NEW Park Tavern out in Rosemont, but ends up plans were in the city.  This place isn't exactly in the midst of downtown which is good, in fact I will totally go here again because they have a parking lot and FREE parking!  If you're paying attention to your GPS and not looking for signs, you could easily pass it but keep a look out and you'll see a huge sign for PARK TAVERN adjacent to the Teamsters Bldg - you can't miss it.  My friend and I stopped in around 7:30/8pm for drinks and for the entertainment.  It was more happening outside (which happens to be pretty nice) than inside but inside was decent as well.  The drinks were priced for the city, of course but I had a few $10 berry sangrias and they were pretty damn good.I will say the service was a little on the slow side for the place not being very crowded.  Also, we didn't have anyone come to the table at that time, we had to go up to the bar.And for those of you into salsa...lessons were going on later in the night so some fun was going on over on the dance floor as we were leaving around midnight.Again, I'd go back...and probably try the food next time too!"
"This is my go-to lunch spot if I'm hanging with some co-workers. Excellent lunch specials (Taco Tuesdays $2 per taco, Half off Sandwiches on Wednesdays). Can't complain about an excellent lunch for less than $10.  We always sit at the bar - Lilly's great. On some occasions the service has been slow, but that's not standard. The fries keep me coming back. Love their minestrone soup. When the weather's warmer I crave their pear salad. They have a warm butter cake for dessert that really hits the spot :)"
"I am a return customer for a reason.Good selection of food,  good service,  and the atmosphere is nice and clean. Depending on when you go, it can get pretty busy. But nevertheless the food is Yum yum. I went there for lunch yesterday with my work partner. We shared the Italian beef pizza. Super delicious but after a while it was too cheesy for me. He had the pear salad which was so tasty and unique.  He also had the chicken tacos which comes with beans and rice.  It's a really big dish for lunch so you will have leftovers. I've had the chicken tacos before and I can't really complain about them. They have a nice spicy kick to them."
"Excellent food, didnt cost an arm and a leg. Waiter was fun and attentive. Did not feel rushed. Bonus....free shuttle to the united center for neil diamond concert. Saved 25.00 to park. Definitely recommend Park Tavern..had a reservation..."
"OK, so it was Halloween, and the servers were all in costume.  That's nice but not an excuse for the bartender to be drunk and extremely rude.  Two stars is generous.  Her behavior wasn't just uncalled for, it was literally the worst display of ""service"" I've ever seen.  Cheers to you, soused cowgirl bartender.  Try to stay sober when you're on the clock. You must have been shocked by the $30 tip, but I doubt it made you think hard.Humorous aside:  A male staffer had a long costume beard and literally dragged it through someone's salad.  It was a relief to see he was busing rather than serving, but it still would've made a great photo."
"A huge, awesome spot to go before a Bulls or Hawks game. It's right on the way, and they even offer a free shuttle too and from the United Center. The food is pub grub, but good pub grub and that's exactly what you want before a sporting event, right? Paired with pretty extensive beer list and affordable prices and I can't think of a better thing nearby for pre-game. Give em' a try and go Bulls and Hawks!"
"Park Tavern was a great spot and environment to grab a bite before heading to the United Center. They provide free parking and shuttle service to and from the United Center as well. Free parking and shuttle service seems to be rare these days, so I really appreciated it. Their location is close enough to walk to the United Center depending on the weather. My group and I decided to walk back after the Blackhawks game due to the amount of people waiting for the return shuttle. The Park Tavern had a large selection of craft beer options as well as a variety of food to choose from. I chose to drink a hard cider, which was on tap and very crisp. We ordered an appetizer of the pulled pork gravy cheese curds for the table to start. Messy and filling, they were as fun and different as they sound. There was a wide variety of customers throughout the night, young and old, as well as happy hour customers, and hockey fans. I was worried about the wait for our food, but our waitress made sure to pay attention to each of her tables. Anytime I come to the United Center I will be returning to the Park Tavern!"
"$2 taco Tuesday, shuttle to games, $9 parking across street for games at United. Great beer selection. No Newcastle and ran out of creme de menthe for shots. Tacos were amazing! Seating was tight so arrive early or don't plan a large group."
"Made a late night stop after a game at the United Center. GREAT food. I know it might not be the first choice of most when they come here, given that there are other really great food choices, but the footlong grilled cheese... I will never eat an ordinary grilled cheese again. I have tried multiple times to mimic it but always fail and end up back here to devour the great sandwich.  The atmosphere is cool and open, more often times dead then hopping. But that's just my perspective."
I went here for a yelp event and boy am I glad I did.They made the best sliders I have ever had. They were just small upscale burgers but they were tiny and delicious and not at all like white castle or a typical bar. Tasty...They also have a bajillion beers on tap. (probably like 30 if I'm being honest)They are all in a row on the bar in the center and they are on both sides so you don't have to choose a side to get a specific beer.
Made it here before a hawks game and it is packed. Good food and beer will do that. If your coming for a game before walking or trolling over to the United center get there early.
"I would love to know when this place is open.  First time I visited this establishment was on a Saturday.  Loved the food and the beer selection.  However, all attempts to return to the Park Tavern have been denied.  Tried to watch a Bears game on a Sunday....closed.  Tried to watch some NCAA football on a Saturday....closed.  Thought it was an early afternoon thing so I tried to go for an late afternoon game on the weekend....closed.  Go to their website and guess what???  No hours of operation listed.  Is this one of those places that post when they are open on Twitter and people run in droves to sample their fare???  Please....I would love to give you some money for some food...help me out."
Great Friday night date place. Loved the animal tots:) ambience was romantic/casual. The cocktail list was impressive and reasonably priced.
This restaurant is super cool! Great atmosphere with a nice drink and food menu! Definitely coming back!!
"This place has an extensive number of beers on draft! They also have a yummy looking menu!The whole ambiance of the place is wonderful, very spacious, lots of TV's. Well lit (which is a huge plus for me!) The waitstaff was super friendly and attentive. Plus, this place has a free shuttle to/from the United Center! How awesome is that?"
"Swung by Park Tavern before we went to the UC to watch the Bulls beat down the aging Celtics.  Happy hour deals, impressive draft list of craft brews and a solid menu were what we found here.  I'm always up for exploring my neighborhood and PT had been on my radar since they opened.  I was pleased to see that they had happy hour and other specials going on event though there was a game at the UC.  You've got to stay on your toes about those because some of the places around the WL play shenanighans with their specials and make them disappear on gamedays.  Not the case here.  $1 tacos and half price apps during happy hour.  Since we felt like snacking we made a meal of the daily specials.  spicy calamari-crispy calamari, herb-chile vinaigrette, cherry peppers animal tots-pulled pork, cheese curds, grainy mustard,fried egg, bell's kalamazoo gravyroasted red pepper hummus-cucumber, kalamata olive relish,seasoned flatbreadchopped salad-iceberg, spinach, romaine, tomato, cucumber, scallion, bacon, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, croutons, herb vinaigretteDug the calamari, it had a nice kick.  Loved the animal tots and, without shame, ate it all myself.  The pulled pork was good and I'm sure I'll have a sandwich of that in the future.  The hummus was good and Kris liked her salad too.  Tons of taps featuring some of the area's best and harder to find brews.  Kris had a taster flight, I had the Founders Centennial IPA and then the Gingerbread stout from Sam Adams (yes, Sam Adams-brewer/patriot).  Prices seemed reasonable.  Park Tavern scored points for us with the speed of service for both food and beer.  We were also on our way to the game with time to spare thanks to their shuttle to dropped us off right there.  Truth be told, it's just a short walk anyway.  It's a big place with a bunch of different seating options and many TVs showing sports and even the Big Cat Diary (look it's Bella!)"
If you are heading to the United Center...this is the place to pre-GAME! FREE lot parking FREE shuttle service (to and from) not to mention awesome food! Can't go wrong. The street tacos were so delish we woofed down three orders and the 'animal tots' minus the animal hit the spot! Service was a ten our awesome waiter Julien was fantastic and didn't mind us drinking up a storm for three hours!
"Plenty of tv's but nicer than a sport's bar.  This is a newer bar near United Center.  Perfect for before a Bulls or Hawks game, or to just hang out and watch a game.  I love the decor, woody, but not cabin.  I don't particularly like the layout b/c the bar is in the center and there are three different dinging/drinking areas.  It felt a bit awkward to me.  We were here for a Yelp even and all the servers and bartenders were really nice.  The manager was kind enough to answer all of our questions about the bar, about the food, everything.  We enjoyed ourselves.I enjoyed the food, especially the sliders.  The only thing I didn't like was the bbq chicken tenders, as I felt like I was eating a banquet frozen kids meal. They were really bad.  The buffalo chicken chicken tenders looked better but I didn't have a chance to try them.Would definitely come back before a game."
"This space is very open which is great imagining it would get very crowded prior to a bulls game...So many great beers on draft including Chicago's own revolution beer, yum!"
"So, after having been here for the Elite event I remembered Park Tavern after watching the Hawks game. A short walk-which was challenging enough after standing at the bar for the game but we got there with a huge crowd. Huge because the front bar was closed and everyone had to funnel into the back area, which was a little more crowded than it should have been. The three of us eventually found a space at the bar, but it felt unnecessarily crowded with a darkened bar up front.  I had the Triple Karmeliet, since they had it and one of my friends ordered the Animal Tots on the advice of a staff member who had finished her shift. She didn't steer us wrong, with the egg on top of the pork and cheese curds-it was like extreme poutine. A plate of tots divided three ways couldn't satisfy me so on advice again I got the Mexibano. I loved the sandwich which went down easy but damn the fries were salty as shit! I mean, I love salty food but I must have gotten a bad batch or something because I could only eat a few before I had to stop. My friend's with their busy hands also stopped eating the fries because they couldn't handle more than one or two fries. I literally was dehydrated the rest of the night. I think next time, I'll ask to swap out another sided because they were too much."
"Park Tavern was a good spot to grab dinner before a Hawks game and I'd come back for that purpose. I came for dinner with a client and a colleague. The client enjoyed himself so I was happy. But I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here just to go here. A BIG bonus was that they take reservations and I was able to get one on short notice on a game day. We were running about 5 min late because we couldn't get a cab so I called and I was pleasantly informed that they hold reservations for 15 min. No big deal. The other perk was the shuttle that took us to the game, which was clean and comfortable. I had a shrimp banh mi sandwich, which had some good flavor. I didn't care too much for the fries, which were a little big soggy. There was an impressive beer list.The space is huge ... almost cavernous. We had a table in the back section. It's hard to explain but it had a weird vibe back there so removed from the rest of the bar, which is pretty crowded. There are several TVs high up on the walls so you're craning your neck up because you're seated at these pretty low wooden chairs.It also seemed like staffing was kind of an issue. Our server was nice but he was busting ass and seemed spread a little thin."
"This place was ok.  Not at all bad but really could improve. Here is my experience:Reservation: Every time I called the person that picked up the phone was not friendly.  I confirmed our reservation for 10 the day of (just to be sure and since we had so many people on a Bulls game day) and I had to call 3 times before someone could confirm our reservation. Not a great sign. Food:  Really good.   Everyone loved the food! REALLY GOOD. Service:   Ok at best.  Not expecting much due to my experience setting up our reservation and they delivered on that expectation. Not the worst and not the best. ClienOdd part:   When waiting for our clients, some old woman would not leave us alone at the front bar - the staff obviously knew here as she was standing next to the hostess when we walked in (we thought she worked there).  She then followed us to the bar and asked us twice to buy her a drink - the hostess nor the bartender reacted to hers (as if that was normal).  Very uncomfortable even for me!  Good part:  We were late for the bulls game.  We thought it started at 7:30 but we were wrong (oddly the bar didn't turn it on the 10 TVs until 2nd quarter).  They had a van that drove us and the driver was awesome!  Apprehensive on bringing clients there again but I should have lowered my expectations from when I called about the reservation.  Nice place and good food but less than friendly staff.   Oh well...  could have been worse?"
"See Ashley's review.  We went together, I've got nothing new for you.But I will say that this place is awesome, and I wish I lived closer to it.  I would be there all the time, getting my eat and/or drink on.I hope this place gets a lot of customers, because the inside is awesome, the food was great, and the staff were super friendly.Once the weather gets nicer and they open the beer garden, look out Chicago!"
"Great food! Amazing service! Fun for everyone! Free shuttles to games/events to united center! My favs: animal tots, chicken tacos, fried asparagus! More people need to hear about the hidden gem!"
"The beer price wasn't bad, the smoked chicken wings that I ordered were good. The service was less then good, not bad, but not good. The bartender from Michigan had to be told what to do. I shouldn't have to ask for a menu or a beer repeatedly. Maybe Chicagoans have a faster pace of living. After eating and drinking we took the shuttle to the hawks game. I will probably go back there."
"My husband and I visited Tavern In The Park several times and always had a great experience. The food is fantastic!!!  Everything we ordered was beyond my expectations!! Our waiter, John Besenhofer made our experience outstanding.  He was always on top of things and very proactive.  We never had to ask for anything.  He anticipated our needs before we knew we needed anything!  The last few times we visited my husband requested to be seated in John's station and to our disappoitment we were seated in another waiters station.  I don't understand if my husband requested John's station why we were not accommodated.  John gave us superb service and he is the reason we keep comming back!"
"Great place for any occasion, and especially before Bulls game. Food is solid for all ages. Good beer list. Had a great server. Take reservations. Will definitely return."
"Park Tavern makes me a little sad.  On one hand, the food is pretty darn good.  I've had the black bean soup, broccolini, jalapeno bacon mac, brisket sandwich and farmer's tacos and enjoyed them all.  The decor is cool, with lots of TVs, including a HUGE projector.  And then there's the outdoor space, which totally rocks.  So why so sad?  I'm 99% sure they won't make it thanks to the terrible location.  The only reason I even know about it is that I work in the building.  I walk by every day, and no matter how nice it is outside or how big of a Hawks game is on, it's never full.  I've tried to convince friends to meet me there after work, but no one ever seems to want to trek out to West Jackson.  So yeah, I definitely like it and hope that maybe the excellent Yelp reviews will draw people out, because it will make me a lot sad if it doesn't survive the Illinois Medical District."
"First time here & I will NEVER go any where else before a hawks game.   Best bar & restaurant in my opinion in the area.  The French Dip sandwich was voutvof this world.   And on top of the great food, free shuttle to & from the game for free.  Screw parkimg t the stadium,  go to Park & have a great time before & after the game"
"Animal tater tots - minus mustard - WONDERFUL!!  Tater tots with pulled pork, gravy, cheese, fried egg and green onions. Pizza- meh.  Canned mushrooms. Mediocre tomatoes. Very average. Just get beer and tots."
