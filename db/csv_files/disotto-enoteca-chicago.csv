DiSotto Enoteca
"Hands down, this is my favorite place to go on a date night in Chicago. The most romantic setting, a quiet environment, gorgeous wine selection, and the absolute BEST food. I have been here two Valentine's Days in a row with my boyfriend and we will definitely be back. On Valentine's Day they have a special menu which is always really fun! The menu seems to rotate on a regular basis, but I've never been really let down. Note: They are located in the basement of Francesca's, so you have to walk into Francesca's first, and then tell them you're dining at Disotto Enoteca. I also recommend having a reservation, since the seating room is fairly small at Disotto. The asparagus ravioli was the best ravioli I have ever had in my life, and I love meat. Their valentine's day dessert special was also the best dessert I have ever had in my life. I was waiting to write this review so that not everyone would learn of the secrets of DiSotto, but I figured it was time to share the love. The portions are amazing, the taste unparalleled, and the ambiance my favorite."
"My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out since its reviews were really good. However, upon arrival the service was extremely disorganized. There was no one there to greet us or bring us to our table. And so we just kind of walked in and sat at a table.We asked questions about the menu and the waiter has absolutely no idea how to answer our questions. At this point my girlfriend and I decided to get a dish and eat quickly so we can go to a different restaurant. After getting our dishes we were blown away. I got the pork belly and she got the mussels and the flavor was unbelievable.After this we decided to stay and order more food. Bad start, but the food was beyond incredible so I had to give it 5 stars."
"OH MY OH MY.For all you tourists out there, please visit this delicate place. You will be amazed."
"Delish food and great atmospere. We got a bottle of wine, salad and a pizza and were very happy. I was surprised it was pretty empty at 9 on a Saturday night but the service was great and not badly priced."
"Hidden in the basement of Francesca's is this lovely gem of a restaurant/wine bar. We had been wanting to go here for a while due to the numerous positive reviews on Yelp, though it does appear many Yelpers have been submitting reviews and pictures of Francesca's instead.Well, this place truly didn't disappoint. We were here on a Monday evening and our first reaction was why is no one here?! We were literally the only ones here though two other parties arrived later on in the night. Others stopped by and quickly left due to the lack of patrons, but they decided too hastily!Once you step into this place, you feel as if you've just walked into a grotto or an intimate cavern so it definitely has a romantic and rustic feel. I can imagine this place can get quite busy during the weekend dinner times, so make sure to get here early to snag your table.The wine selection is quite extensive and while the food choices seem limited, everything we tried was outstanding though be warned that a number of the dishes come with bread so be prepared for a carb overload! :)All dishes are meant to be shared family style and most closely resemble small plates like Quartino's or a tapas place. However, you will feel full after ordering a few dishes and you should definitely sample from each section of the menu. In addition to the wine, the dishes that stood out were the:- Mussels (Cozze e Sopressata)- Fontina cheese bread with egg yolks (Tostato con Uova)- Prosciutto e Caprese- Cheese and meat selection (Formaggi & Salumi)- Fried gnocchi balls that were part of the pork belly dish were very good- Fried eggplant meatballs were divine!- Chocolate lava cake with mint chocolate chip gelato (Torta lava)- Vanilla gelato (best I've ever had and I've tried gelato from a number of good places)- TiramisuYes, I listed all three desserts we had since they were all delicious! 5 stars for ambience, 5 stars for food and 4 stars for service since it seemed quite slow even though no one else was there. All of this rounds up to 5 stars, so if you're in the area, make sure to stop by!"
"I had been wanting to come here for some time, and I was really excited to try this place. I was not disappointed. This restaurant is located in the basement of Francesca's, and they do not take reservation. I came with a party of four, so I was pleasantly surprised that we found a table right away. We sat down and we were immediately greeted by our waitress. She was very knowledgeable about the wine and food menus. You get four pieces of crostini right away, served on a cutting board - they were really good!We started off with the Poppette di Melazane, which is eggplant meatballs. It was AMAZING! So good that we had to order it twice! Next, we got the Burrata Con Pomodori, which is sort of like a cheese-ball with pistachios and pesto underneath. It was a little watery, not sure if that's how it normally is, but it was our least favorite. We also got the Cozze e Sopressata, steamed mussels. They were really good, and the sauce that they came in was very flavorful. We also ordered the Pepperonata e Formaggio di Capra, which is bruschetta with a goat cheese spread. I'm not a big goat cheese fan, so I did not try it, but everyone else said they loved it. We finished with an order of the Gamberetto, which is shrimp and pickled veggies. It was very tasty as well. Overall, the really cozy and intimate environment combined with the great food and wine, makes this place a must. I will definitely be going back soon!"
"I had an amazing experience at Disotto Enoteca when I was in Chicago with somefriends. It's a complete experience that's a must-do for foodies and wine enthusiasts.To start of, Disotto is just gorgeously decorated: the interior is rustic and classy but comfortable enough that you can kick back and relax with friends. The servers are lovely and very knowledgeable about wines and are very accommodating about any requests you have. Five stars just for service alone! I believe my servers name was Elliot, he was helpful, respectful and very patient and also offered a lot of good suggestions. We tasted a few wines, all good recommendations before we settled on our carafes.What also stood out to me was the quality of the food- Disotto Enoteca serves small bites, so the food is generally the size of an appetizer. We ordered the Caprese - which has a large hunk of mozzarella cheese with fresh tomatoes, I am not a fan of cheese but this dish was really to die for. The cheese was soft, aromatic and just very delicious! It also paired well with the white wine. Very delicious dish and clearly too notch ingredients. The tomatoes were sweet and aromatic: unbelievably good.We also ordered the eggplant meatballs in marinara sauce. To me this was a stand out dish, the crispy eggplants, the delicious tomato sauce. I just wanted to lick the plate when I was done. Absolutely phenomenal dish. I will be dreaming of it from Cali.Lastly we ordered the truffle egg toast. Despite the popularity of this dish I was really underwhelmed. It's pretty much your run of the mill toad in a hole. Would really not recommend except for the fun factor.All in all I had an amazing experience at Disotto Enoteca and cannot wait to go again to sample more delicious wines and food!"
Great wine list. Many Italian wines. But also good choices of other types of wines. We had champaign with appetizers. We had the eggplant balls. And the Italian version of egg in a hole. We will come back for more. The food was fantastic. The atmosphere is fantastic. My wife and u both enjoyed the experience. The services was excellent. Relaxed setting.
"I'd have to say I had a similar experience to Paul J when I visited DiSotto Enoteca a few weeks back. The location is a little hard to find - it is below Francesca's, which means there isn't much signage out front and you have to actually go through Francesca's to get downstairs. Once we found it, we were greeted by a server but were told to just sit wherever, rather than being seated. We asked for some wine recommendations and we were guided to a very nice bottle, so the server knew what she was doing. Our food arrived rather quickly and we were pleased with it. The pork belly with gnocchi is delicious, but the portion is *huge* so order wisely if you are splitting other dishes."
"Phenomenal. Nicely-edited wines by the glass, amazing warm olives and snicky-snacks in a lounge-y, cave-like, romantic atmosphere. Loved the late-night vibe here. Perfect for a solo hideaway, intimate trist or cozy get-together with girlfriends."
The only way to describe this place is a hidden gem in the city. I used to live in Germany and traveled to Italy and this place is the best of both worlds in Chicago.Elliot is very knowledgable on his pairings and has impressed me on multiple occasions.  Currently the location has over 30 patrons and he has been attentive to all while making us (wife and I) feel like we are the only ones here. This is a must for wine enthusiasts and romantics.
Their menu looked good but just came here for some wine.  A nice place to chill from the busy Michigan Ave Street. The interior is really nice and pleasant. The staff were pretty attentive. It was empty when I went there but I'd be be eager to to try the wine bar downstairs.
"Had a lovely time at this wine bar .To start with it was beautifully decorated with a vintage charm to it . Food was delicious and fresh ! They had good music and Amazing service. Everything we had caprese,beet salad were top notch . Food was full of flavor and super super fresh :) Cant wait to go back with my girlfriends again :) Special Thanks to my server who made it a memorable experience :) A special mention to their dessert menu.. Don't leave without trying their desserts !! A must for everyone !"
"Favorite hidden gem in Chicago! We travel to Chicago from Central Wisconsin. This place is the reason we keep coming back. Cozy quiet atmosphere, awesome knowledgeable staff and amazing food!! Must try!!!!"
"I went here, solo, early on a weeknight. The star off was for not recognizing that a solo diner, early on a weeknight, probably wants relatively prompt service, not having a romantic or other companion to occupy the time. The cheese selection was sumptuous, and the ricotta e bottarga bruscheta was bursting with flavor. The wine selections were impressive as well. Very cozy, intimate setting. I'd come back again with dining companions."
Very cool and intimate wine bar that's a perfect way to cap off an evening.Attentive and helpful servers will guide you to the ideal wines and cheeses / salami that suit your taste.  Broad selection of unique wines and reasonably priced by the glass as well.Will be back!
We came here on a whim (and based on Yelp reviews)--we mistakenly thought we could get bigger plates here.  Imagine our embarrassment when our wonderful server said they only did small plates!  No big deal though--she gave us a menu for Francesca's and told us we could order and eat at DiSotto Enoteca.  The ambiance was great.  Not too crowded.  Service was impeccable.  Our sever was friendly and knowledgeable about the wine list and beer list.  My boyfriend got a milk stout he really enjoyed.  I enjoyed a white wine from South Africa with my seafood pasta.  We also ordered the mussels--some of the best mussels I have ever had!  We also ordered the apple puff pastry with salted caramel sauce.   Not overpowering with sweetness.  I enjoyed every aspect of our visit!
"Stopped by for a dinner since the environment seemed romantic and the food looked good...environment is definitely 5 stars...in a wine cellar with rocks/stones as the wall and dimly lit...but the food started with a bang with the eggplant meatballs!! Then went down hill with toast with truffle egg (looks great but really toast with an egg on top and then mussels was flavorful but pasta of the night was just ok, its not bad but not great...mussels were smooth (1/2) but other half had grains of sand in it...and we ended with tiramasu which was 4 star caliber...so overall environment 5 stars, food 2.5 stars, desert 4 stars with overall average of 3.25 stars..."
"I never realized there was a secret lair hidden beneath Francesca's restaurant if it hadn't of been for yelp. You walk into Francesca's and go down a flight of stairs that I would never have noticed. Suddenly you'te in a rustic wine cellar, with low mood lighting and leather chairs. This place is primarily a wine bar. If you come here with the intention to eat a full meal, their selection is very limited. It is mostly just appetizers, and there are three main course dishes that are all pasta (which is a problem if you're on a diet). The truffle egg toast is very delicious, I recommend it, I love anything with a runny egg on it. The ravioli was good, but it's a small portion that I gobbled up in a minute. The Staggioni pasta was ok according to my friend, just a bit salty. Come here to get boozed up on wine and share some small dishes I'd say. Good for a date!"
"Fresh foodPoor chefVery friendly staffFood was mediocre at bestPoor seasoningGot pasta, undercooked patateos, oily pasta, weird shrimp tasteFrozen dessert, lava cake wasNot very good combination of mint with chocolateOverall bill came out to $40 per person with tip and I would say its worth it but I would not give it more than 3 stars and would kor recommend if you are looking for great Italian food."
"Lovely Italian cheeses, cold cuts, and wine in a cosy and intimate setting. It had the feeling of a true enotecca in Italy!"
"This is one of the most under-rated places in Chicago as far wine choices go.fact: it is underneath Mia Francesca's maybe that has something to do with it.I think you can get the bread with different jelly's and honeys. WOW.if you combine the honey and the butter, that is not healthy but it is very tasty. Relax Mom. I dont do that every day :)People outside the Streeterville/Gold Coast area dont really know that it exists. I tell anyone I know who is looking for a good place for wine sipping or some sort of wine adventure to check this place out.I know they go through managers the same speed that some people change their toothpaste but maybe that is not their problem, right?The last time I was here I had some good Portugese wine for a tasting of 2.5 oz out which came to $5.50This brings me to my next point which is not many places have a choice between the price for a full glass and the price for a tasting.In a hood where people go out to dinner 5-7 days a week ( there still is only 7 days in a week) people should know about this gem.This place makes me feel like I am in a rustic wine cave in Italy. Good date spotor just a good place to unwind."
"Cozy little wine bar :) loved the ambience and the good was fantastic. I had the wine flight, which was expensive IMO $25, about a glass and a half. We ordered the beet salad, eggplant meatballs, bruschetta and the gnocchi. Everything was super delicious and the service was great. Best part was the dessert, banana bread pudding. Highly recommended!"
"Wow, all there is to say. Cozy, fantastic wine list and food was terrific! My waiter recommended the pork along with a chianti. Great dinner all the way around. Highly recommended!"
We went here on Saturday to celebrate my girls bday. We had reservations and had a fixed chef tasting menu that offered 4 courses. The food was really tasty  and flavorful. They  had vegetarian options available as well. I really  liked the decor. It was a contemporary rustic  feel. One wall was a mosaic of wine crates displaying the names of the wine. All and all we had a great time. The price was a little too high for my blood but I'm guessing you are paying for the overall  experience as well. I would Recommend.
"I planned a Saturday night date here with my boyfriend and loved it. The atmosphere, the food, the wine and the service were all great. There was no wait and the waiter was helpful and pleasant. We ordered two plates and loved them both. Great date place."
We absolutely love it here!! Our first time here was March 2013 and fell in love with the atmosphere and the concept. This is our second time back and we are so happy that it is still as cozy as we remember it. The small village engraved in the brick wall is a great touch. Elliott is extremely knowledgable in the wine selection and offers great service. He is friendly and attentive. It is not overly crowded or too loud. I highly recommend this place!
"Note: this is only for the wine bar. Mia Francesca's is another story. We were audibly assaulted by the noise of the street level place, the live music being more a cacophony than background, and the place was packed with people, the closest of which were families with children (hotel guests perhaps?)But I digress. The reason I mention the audio rampage upstairs was that it only served to heighten the disparity with the tranquility below ground. It was...as quiet as a tomb...but not at all in a bad way. One wall lined with wine, the other I believe had a fireplace, a small bar at the back with perhaps four barstools, and a curing room at opposite, with meats and cheeses hung on display.Elliot, our waiter, was present without being overbearing, steered our wine choices toward the more flavorful (even if more expensive) wines and told us the top selling plates. By the third small plate, and glass of wine, we were sated. The burrata was divine. I shall return."
"Hosted a surprise party for my in-laws here.  Fantastic location! Fabulous service!  Great food, drinks, and decor! Could not have been more pleased for the money we spent.  Thank you"
"Went here after reading the reviews. Was surprised to see how small the place is. There was a big party there and it was difficult to hear but once they left, it got a lot better. The food was delicious. The waiter was helpful and patient. Its a really cute place to go on a date and/or a girls night."
"Hosted a private dinner event at DiSotto Enoteca and it was superb. I highly recommend it if you have a group of 20-25 people. The atmosphere is undoubtedly unique and charming, with great lighting and acoustics - you are transported to a wine cellar in old world Italy. The space itself is located in the cellar level of Francesca's on Chestnut which is connected to the Seneca hotel. A separate door entrance can be found next to the hotel.Our dinner featured a 3 course menu and open bar and took place in the entire Disotto space from 5:30pm to 9:00pm. The food was great - portioned as an Italian meal should be. If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to be mindful of the time allotment for a private event. When 9:00pm hit, the space was open to the public and even though we were still wrapping up, strangers were able to wander into the space. All in all, a home run for a private dinner event. Would definitely recommend."
It should be 4.5 but I round up :)  the ambiance is truly lovely- the small pasta dishes and the beet salad were scrumptious.  The wine the waiter suggested was the perfect embodiment of not too sweet and not too biting- our description while explaining our desired vino.
"It was a special occasion without a special someone, so I needed my wine bar to be extra special and DiSotto did not disappoint. A wonderful, cozy venue for an intimate gathering  - in my case, some wonderful women from various walks of my life to give me company on a night when I needed it...An extensive wine list ensured we all were suitably inebriated. The small plates of DiSotto isn't ideal for a dinner, but we were able to order from the regular menu of Francesca's upstairs which turned out to be pretty great too.Loved the ambiance at DiSotto, surrounded by wine caves and wine bottles and hushed tones all around, it feels like an escape from the crassness of downtown - agree with several Yelpers here that DiSotto may be one of the most under-rated winebars in town, let's keep it that way!"
"I really wanted to love this place. Hidden away under the bustling Francesca's, it was quiet, dimly lit, and cozy - the perfect ambience for a romantic evening or glass of wine with friends. One star for ambience and one star for wine. Everything else was a complete flop.The food was nothing special. The cheese and meat we selected were just ok although the fig accompaniments were flavorful. The burrata was bland served with equally tasteless tomatoes. As for the eggplant meatballs other reviewers raved about, I was disappointed. They just tasted like cheese, which is probably why people liked them. Who doesn't like a deep fried ball of cheese? As for the sauce they came in, it was too salty and almost inedible.The service. Oye the service. Nonexistent and poorly trained. Upon asking our waitress   how a certain cheese tasted, her response was ""semi firm."" Um ok. When we got the cheese we realized it was a blue. Pretty sure that would've described it accurately. Given that there are only a few cheeses on the menu, it's not too much to ask that your server is knowledgable about them. She never stopped by while we were eating to check on things, only after we were finished to ask if we wanted anything else. At one point, we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for about 5 minutes. Just waiting for someone, anyone, to remove it from the tiny table. Had the place been larger and she had more tables to wait on, I would've understood her inattentiveness. However, the place is small and she only had a few tables. Not acceptable.I would recommend this place for wine only. I might be back but in all likelihood my experience put a rather sour taste in my mouth."
"Nice little place underneath Francesca's. Went there last night for nye dinner around 7. We originally had reservations upstairs but after noticing the seating downstairs they were very accommodating with switching our seats. I don't recommend Francesca's itself if you are looking for a quiet setting. Very loud and not very intimate. As for the wine bar, great service, wine list, and great food. Would definitely recommend the calamari. Really enjoyed the evening there and never felt rushed. Only negative I can say is the small size of the dessert for the price. I will return again!"
"The food and wine were so good!!! It's a really romanic/cute place. Wine bottles,  brick walls, candles. I can't remember the names of what we ordered but everything was so good. If I'm ever back in Chicago we will come back. And I recommend it to all winos and Italian food lovers."
"What. A. Hidden. Gem. This place teleports you to a different era, country or both. You'd never guess the basement of the Seneca had this place. My gf lives here, so we come quite a bit. Wine- all good by the glass. Prosciutto- superbCoppa- greatFinocchiona- excellent Taleggio- bombOrecchiette- my least favorite of the 3 pastas, but very good. Gnudi Pomodoro- excellent, simple. Dumplings with San marzano tomatoes, bufala mozzarella and basil. Cappellacci con funghi- so delicious. Mushroom filled pasta with truffle cream. It's a great spot for a date, very intimate and private, but I also have brought my 9 year old here. It does fill up, and not sure if they accept reservations."
"I liked this place.  They were out of the burrata, but the server suggested another dish, the eggplant meatballs.  I was somewhat skeptical, but ended up really enjoying the eggplant.  I always appreciate suggestions, especially when they work out well.  Service was all around good.  Tried a few different wines to accompany the eggplant meatballs and was happy with everything."
My perfect type of restaurant. Food is delicious and savory. Lots of fun wines to try. Everything is designed to share and small tasting glasses of wine available to really have fun blending the flavors of food and wine. Wish I had a restaurant like this back in Aspen!
Off the charts delicious! Intimate basement dining lounge and wine cellar. Knowledgeable and friendly staff.
"Fantastic service, food, and wine!  Our server Elliot was amazing.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommended perfect wines for what we were in the mood for.  He made our first time there memorable. The food was not your average bar food but made with love and inspiration.  Tostata con Uova and mussels were my favorites, but everything was delicious!  This place reminded me of a small wine bar in Italy with lots of culture in homey atmosphere.  If you are looking for a non-chalant, laid-back Italian wine bar in a basement, this is your place!  We went around 11:30 pm on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded with just a couple other tables.  I highly recommend this place!"
"First, I'm a tough grader and don't give out stars lightly.  That said, DiSotto Enoteca was a pleasurable experience overall. We arrived within an hour after opening on a Saturday night, yet were promptly seated.  The ambiance was perfect for our group of four to enjoy conversation and a light starter before dinner at another location.  I could see this as a nice starter location for date night too.Our server was friendly and generally helpful, although I didn't get the impression that he had a full grasp of the extensive wine list.  In fact, the most disappointing part of the visit was they were out of stock on two separate bottles I ordered before settling on an alternative suggestion from our server Elliott.The food was tasty, presented well and appropriately portioned.  We ordered three small plates which was plenty for four adults along with wine.  Total bill was just over $100.  Not bad at all.All in all, this is a nice spot that is likely overlooked by many."
"After a good fill of fun Chicago dive bars, I was ready for a nice glass of wine.  I did a Yelp search and Francesca's quickly pulled up.  We walked in, it was nice but the typical restaurant bar atmosphere.I see a stairwell and inquire of  the bartender what is downstairs. He replies ""an underground wine bar"".  A patron exclaimed ""OMG it is soo cool down there!"".  I was sold.We make our way down the stares to find a cavernous, dimly lit room with a large wine rack lining the wall. Glancing briefly at the menu  sealed the deal. I was in love with this place!  Their big thing is wine (flights, by the glass or bottle) & a gazillion types of bruschetta.I didn't have a chance to try the food but the wine and atmosphere was well worth the stop."
"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this wine bar on our first vacation together in May 2013.  It was a quiet, rainy evening and we were the only couple in the place.  The hostess seated us in the quaint corner by the meat cellar.  This place in one word: romantic.  I felt like we were in Italy.  The wine list was amazing, so many to try!!! Our waitress was very knowledgable and suggested many to taste that we otherwise would not have been adventurous enough to try.  We did not have dinner here, but we did share some small plates, some of the best cheese we've ever had! Great date place, definately intimate setting.  I hope to visit every time we are in Chicago!"
"Located beneath a well regarded upscale Italian restaurant, this snug, romantic, European style wine bar was just ideal for me. The menu is limited, really just bar snacks, but what bar snacks! Why bother with a full menu if you can get food of this quality. The wines we had were also first quality. This was not a bargain, but when I left I did not feel the least bit cheated. Everything I ate was excellent, aroncini , eggplant, pepperonata and olives. It gets 5 stars as a wine bar, but don't confuse it with a full scale restaurant."
"I had a really good time at this place, which hopefully doesn't cloud my judgment. I was staying at a nearby hotel earlier this week and hadn't had much luck guessing which restaurants to roll the dice on. DiSotto was great, though. I sat at the bar and met a steady stream of alcoholic octogenarian regulars. That is how you know a place is rock solid. When a rich old lady wearing 300 carats of diamonds, a mink, and lipstick all over her teeth is aggressively hitting on you at the bar while her husband shrugs and orders another carafe of gin, you have found the spot. The bartender (her name escapes me, but she has a degree in creative writing, I think) was awesome. She handled all the old rich drunk regulars with aplomb and was very entertaining. THE FOOD: I got the Fillet. It was good. I was happy. My brother got the seafood linguine. It was awesome. I was jealous. Everything on stranger's plates also looked good. CLARIFYING NOTE: I've seen in some other reviews reference to some place called Francesca's that is apparently in the same building (missed it somehow.) According to my credit card statement both restaurant's share an owner. My supposition is that DiSotto is the more casual sister-spot to Francesca's. Anyway, I've read some raves about the Francesca's wine selection, but if both spots have the same owner in the same building, then they probably share a cellar and you can get all those Francesca's wines at DiSotto too. Not sure, just a hunch, if that matters to you."
"Lovely atmosphere.  Downstairs below Francesca's on Chestnut (which, btw, has good food but is way too loud).The service was inept.  We ordered a bottle of wine. She came back to ask what was it again? Then a third return to announce they were out.  Great serving staff would have known that in the first place.  We pick another bottle.Then before our wine even arrives, the food arrives--all at once! The olives, the egg bread, and the ravioli, which then had to sit  getting cold while we ate the appetizers while (finally) starting the wine.  Nice olive selection, served warm, which enhanced the flavor.  The bread egg truffle was dull.  The ravioli was decent, pretty well made.Despite the fact that it is a wine bar, we were on our own for refilling water and wine throughout the evening.  Also, on a Saturday night, we were able to walk in at 7 p.m.--that says something...there are better alternatives.If they ever ratchet up the service and push the food quality up a notch or two, they will have a winning combination."
"My sister and I ate here during a small 2 day trip to Chicago. First of all, let me warn you that you will go through a glass door that says ""DiSotto Enoteca"" to get into the building but the restaurant you walk in to is NOT Disotto. Disotto is actually downstairs and what you walk in to from the street is Francesca's. My sister and I made that mistake and we were seated at Francesca's thinking it was DiSotto. Luckily we had an amazing waiter who allowed us to order from the DiSotto menu even though we were seated at Francesca's. Now on to the food. Food was delicious but very heavy! We had the pork belly with figs, egg in bread thing, burrata, and beet salad. The egg in bread thing, though it looked really cool, had too much bread IMO and was pretty blah - my least favorite. My favorite was the burrata. Soooo delicious and enjoyed the next day as well. This was definitely a fun place to eat and I would recommend it for anyone visiting or anyone that wants a fun meal with friends."
"First of all, Di Sotto Enoteca should definitely put up better signage in front of their building. Without the indication that the winebar was downstairs, I immediately thought the restaurant Francesca's (upstairs) was actually di sotto enoteca. It really did not matter though because BOTH turned out to be amazing! This review is specifically for BOTH venues not just Enoteca.Francesca'sAlong with my friends from Bejing & Algeria, I shared a Hall Merlot 2008 amidst some GREAT food & ambience. My friend had the fried calamari and a chicken diavola pasta...I just mooched on him and the bread (^^;;;) I just really loved the menu...they change it every two weeks!!!!The food was like family Italian food from New York (generous portions). The bread was delightfully warm...the olive oil unlike anything olive oil I've tasted before (:o) The diavola pasta I tried was fabuloso as well!As we sipped on merlot, we were listening to chill live jazz music. The decor really reminds you of New York. Overall, I'm definitely going back! (before I forget, the prices were also VERY reasonable). Di Sotto EnotecaAfter having had great conversations and a good time with the Merlot upstairs, we brought the party downstairs because Francesca's was closing. As Randy B. would describe this place, a ""charming wine cave"" is very accurate. Even quite medieval.! You gotta love places in general that make you feel like you've just entered a new world. Enoteca definitely did that for me. Staff was very friendly...I really wish I could have gotten a few names so that I could mention them here. There was a blond ale I had when I was here. Wish I remember the name...and I looked at the menu online and...they don't have it (:O)?Honestly, do not remembered the wine we ordered because I outsourced the ordering and was a bit inebriated. Well, what a swell night I had just had."
"Only had an app and a couple glasses of wine. With that said, great service but the bread and bruschetta were disappointing. I was pumped up from earlier reviews that this place would have a good wine selection, turned out to be fairly poor."
"We had the most amazing dinner and wine here. It had a warm, lounge feel to it. The wine selection is incredible and meat and cheese platter was fantastic. On top of that, Our pasta dishes (lobster ravioli and fettuccini pasta) will definitely bring us back when we visit Chicago!"
"The ambiance of this place was so friendly and quaint, I immediately new I was going to love it.  There were couples on dates, groups of girlfriends, tourists- a great spot for any occasion. Server was very sweet and attentive.  She chose our meats & cheeses which was paired with soft warm bread, figs and giardinera! Heaven!! I had the Gnudi which was pretty simple could maybe have used some (more) garlic.  Overall, I'd recommend this hidden gem to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out in the Gold Coast/Streeterville area."
"Cheap excellent wine. Great food too. The atmosphere is amazing; it feels like a wine cellar. Great service! I love this place! I need to go back. We had the bruschetta w/ pesto, sundried tomatoes, and goat cheese. We also had a pasta with a creamy sauce and bacon. It was excellent too. My new favorite place in Chicago!  I completely recommend it!"
"LOVE the ambiance of this place - feels hidden and feels like a wine cellar to me.  Our service was just meh, but that may have just been a one-off.  The food was okay - the main point to be there is good wine, not too pricey & in the gold coast.  I'll be back!"
"The disclaimer is that I didn't actually eat here I just called them to enquire. The girl on the phone was clueless to menu options and  asked what I meant when I asked ""how late are you open"". It blew me away so i wrote this review. The three stars are bec I didn't eat or taste here and hence they deserve the benefit of the doubt."
"Romance.  Intimacy.  Wine.  Cheese.   Who doesn't like any of these things?  And when you put them together, they all add up to a perfect night.  So find that special someone and take them to DiSotto Enoteca.DiSotto Enoteca is tucked away in the basement of Francesca's on Chestnut.  If you drive- the valet at the Seneca Hotel will take your car (it's only $10) and you will be free to wander down a steep staircase into what is an unexpected find in the shadow of the Hancock building.Wines line the walls, the convex brick ceiling looks like it has been there for generations (it hasn't as this space used to be a storeroom).  The leather seats gathered into cozy corners or the tables in the center, beckon you to come and sip wine and eat delicious meats and cheeses.We chose to sit at the small bar tucked away in the corner, and it was a great choice as we got to meet Kwame (server extraordinaire) and Elliott (a very new bartender who was also great!).  They made sure our glasses were never empty, had wonderful suggestions for wines, poured a great martini and kept the cheeses, meats and bruchettas coming.The menu is a series of ""nibbles"" that accompany the various wine flights that they pour.   And with the cheese flight comes nuts and some of the most amazing honey that perfectly accompanies the various tastes. They also will pour the wine in varying sizes so you can have a taste or a full glass.There are plenty of wine bars in our fair town.  But none with the intimacy that will surely spark romance like DiSotto Enoteca!  A perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city that surrounds you.."
"If this review is too long for you - skip to the bottom and read my final thoughts.  Thanks!:::::LOCATION:::::-The location itself is kind of in a dead spot of Streeterville.  If you're in the area any time after 9, the buzz is gone.  Unless you work in the area, or are staying in area in one of your insanely expensive hotels, you're probably not going to find another fun spot in the area.:::::ATMOSPHERE:::::Nestled in the basement of Francesca's on Chestnut, it's a nice little hidden gem for those looking to kick back and drink a glass of wine or 6.  The walls are rustic, and the furniture is modern.  The atmosphere here is quite suitable for a date, a night out, or post-work drinks.  It's small but intimate.The Dress Code is casual, but 9/10 people I've seen here are in cocktail dresses or trendy ""night out"" attire.:::::DRINKS:::::::The wine here is very delicious and the servers are quite knowledgable about what to serve you.  Too many options to pick? Ask for a flight!  The wine list constantly is updated, but from experience - I can tell you that you can't go wrong with an Italian Red or a French White.:::::FOOD::::::::The food here is nothing to write home about.  They do have delicious small bites, but you're better off going upstairs to Francesca's to eat.  However... if you're here, you're not here for the food.  You're here for the wine.  So I won't take points off for the food.  To give you an idea of their menu... they have antipasta, bruschetta, cheese, and salami that go really well with the wines.:::::SERVICE:::::A+.  The place is quite tiny, so it would be surprising if the service wasn't good.  They treat you well here at DiSotto and always keep your glass filled at your request.:::::PRICE:::::Flights and individual glasses start at the $10 range and go up to $$$.   :::::FINAL THOUGHTS:::::If you're looking for a great place to have post-work drinks, or a fun little secret cove to take a date on - this is definitely an option.  The variety of wines they offer will keep the conversation going, while the small plates will keep you satisfied as you order another glass.  It's small, cozy, and cute.  Escape from the winter cold and grab a few glasses of vino here.  You won't regret it."
"Great food, great service...good was good and had great taste. Wine by the glass was a reasonable price. Overall great experience"
"Visited this wine bar while I was in Chicago.  It was a little confusing once my friends and I entered the restaurant which was located above this wine bar. You think you're in the wine bar, but it doesn't look like the picture then you realize that it's actually downstairs.The setting of this place is great for small groups or even a date.  There are small tables along with cozy chairs located on the outskirts of the bar.  When we got here, it wasn't too crowded, but as time went on more and more people filtered through.  It's a small space, so I can see this place getting filled especially during the weekend.They have an extensive wine selection along with small bites if you need something to fill your tummy so the wine doesn't go straight to your head.  The server who helped us was super nice, he reminded me of Chris Rock, but without the comedic remarks but with insightful selections for the type of wine I was looking for.  Take a peek if you're in town or want to go somewhere to have a cute place to have wine and talk with a significant other or with friends."
"Incredible.  Very easy giving this place 5 stars.  It was everything we were looking for, and more!  First things first, it's in the basement so be sure and get to the right place.  You enter through a restaurant upstairs.  As you enter, you immediately feel relaxed.  The setting and exposed brick give the feel of a great, old-fashioned wine cellar.  I'm not much of a wino, but the staff was really helpful and we ultimately stumbled upon a great bottle.  The bruschetta was the best I have had.  The mozzarella was so creamy it had more of an ice-cream like texture.  Delicious! We stopped here prior to heading to a show.  What a great night.  Highly recommend!"
"Had a lovely meal with friends here. It was not too busy, service was prompt ad helpful -- our server had a backup plan for any issues, e.g. wine suggestions, appetizers -- and above all the food was so good. Generous portions of antipasti, and very good for sharing/sampling. The pane with ricotta & honeycomb was amazing."
"DiSotto Enoteca was the perfect venue for a law school social on a cold winter's night, where the wine flowed as freely and deliciously as the tales of courtroom dramas, and greased the wheels of legal camraderie and - er- where was I?Oh yeah, it's a nice, smallish winebar located downstairs, and if you're nice to the maitre d' at Mia Francesca's upstairs, he might just let you in on that secret.  They have a nice selection of wines that come in 2.5 ounce tastings or by the glass, and a subdued, library-like atmosphere, which I guess makes it easier to peruse their hefty wine menu. It was surprisingly empty for a Friday evening, but the service was slow despite the fact that we were the only ones in the room."
"Fromaggi y salumi, tostato, and burrato for appetizers. All excellent! Even the kids enjoyed!  Ladybird shrimp and pork belly for entrees. Also outstanding!! My 14 yr old son said ""that was exquisite"". Being a bit cheeky but he did eat a lot. Great flavors, very tasty!"
Great place for a good glass of wine and great food at a reasonable price considering the address.
"It was our first visit and not going to be our last.  Great food, great wines, and great service.  You can't go wrong by making a visit.  I highly recommend it.We were a little confused when we first arrived because no one was at the entrance to greet us.  So we just seated ourselves in a nice comfortable nook, perfect for the two of us.There was a rustic atmosphere--relaxing and comfortable.  Our waitress (Liz) was very helpful with her extensive knowledge on their large variety of wines and helped us choose the wines we would enjoy.A really cool place to enjoy some great wines."
"Just off the crowded Magnificent Mile and under the John Hancock's towering shadow exists a hidden secret (although not for long).  The name DiSotto Enoteca, translated as ""underground wine repository,"" says it all. Some of the more masculine may refer to it as their ""Man Cave,"" while I would call it a Wine-O's home away from home. To find your way, step into the Seneca Hotel's Francesca's on Chestnut, and follow the gaudy floral carpet downstairs...Before you know it, you're transported to a Tuscan wine cellar with arched, vaulted brick ceilings, hanging Italian cured meats, and a chill, low-light ambience. Once you find a nook to sit in, the queen of the lair, Amy, will make her way over to you. The fabulous welcoming and boisterous Jacqueline-of-all-trades (and super celebrity on Yelp's DiSotto reviews) knows the menu by memory, partially because she's been with DiSotto since it's opening at the beginning of 2011. Knowing this, I submissively let her take the reigns of my evening while she started me off with a global tasting tour of her top picks: 75&Co. Cabernet Sauvignon (California), Barbera D'Alba (Italy), and Guilberteau Cabernet Franc (France). All were full of flavor, yet pleasantly light on the palate. I couldn't help myself from accompanying my glasses of vino with infamous house specialty, Truffle egg toast with fontina cheese and asparagus (Toast con Uova, Fontina e Asparagi - $9). Whether you whisk the over-easy egg yolks with your fork, or just slice away with the knife, you will helplessly be taking one bite after another of this decadent antipasto.  I continued on my sojourn indulging on their bruschetta of rapini, pancetta, provolone and spicy olive oil that was perfectly crisp with an ever so slight kick of spice ($8).  Finally, I finishing off with a selection of cheeses, recommending to everyone the trio of smooth Caprini Misti goat cheese rolled in chives, paprika and pepper.With a wine selection of 35 by-the-glass pours and 130 bottles focusing on Italy and Spain, half a dozen bruschette, and a myriad of cheeses and salamis, you'll become cozy and at home to escape the tourist shopping craziness.  Keep in mind that DiSotto is open late on the weekends, but do not accept reservations.  I doubt they'll ever have a happy hour deal, but I can always keep my fingers crossed."
"After a long day of shopping, DiSotto Enoteca was the perfect spot to relax and unwind (that is, once you get downstairs, past the hectic atmosphere of Francesca's...).In any case, DiSotto was a calm oasis in the city.  Seated in plush armchairs, enjoying some wine and snacks was wonderful.  The room itself is great...exposed brick and 'candle' chandeliers are a nice touch.  The wall of wine was also nice (and the room with the hanging meat?  Sign me up for some of that!).  Atmosphere is a 5.The selection of wines is quite good and I would also say that the pour size is also generous (at so many wine bars, this isn't the case).  I tried an Austrian white - yum.  We also had the ricotta snack as well as a selection of meats.  the ricotta was delicious - heavenly in fact.  With honey and a the light, fluffy ricotta - simply divine.  The meat was also quite delicious (though, I didn't love the lardo selection, but that's my fault and it was good, just not really my thing).  Food definitely a 5.  Service was friendly, and at times a bit slow, but I chalk this up to our waitress being one of two people working on a busy Saturday night.  She was very sweet, though, and brought me extra bread for my ricotta, so score some points for that!  A 4 for service.The bathrooms were nicely done, though the doors in the women's restroom could have been slightly easier to close, but clean.  A 4 for bathrooms.As to value...Things were very reasonably priced, though we ended up spending more than I would have thought (probably due to the wine that I ordered...a bit pricey).  In any case, I thought the value was quite good.  The wine pours are generous and the 'snacks' were nicely sized (huge in fact).  Value is a 4.I will definitely return if in the area and may even seek this spot out for a charming evening out.  I'm rounding my 4+ review to a 5."
"One of the most romantic meals of my life. I walked downstairs with the gf into a warm, dimly lit cellar/wine bar. Iron wrought chandeliers hung from domed ceilings as floor to ceiling racks of wine shone back flickers of gentle, yellow light. With brick walls and generously spaced tables, for the first 10 minutes we were the only customers there and the waitress/bartender/hostess was FANTASTIC. Sitting here, chatting over glass after glass of wine while tapas are thoughtfully brought out was the cap to such a great evening. The menu selection isn't huge, but every dish sounds fantastic. The only one I am adamant you must order is the truffle bread with egg yolk. The heady aroma will make your knees go weak and angels will sing. Don't be confused with Francesca's on the first floor of the hotel, this is the wine bar below."
"Don't be fooled.  When you arrive, head downstairs to the basement area in order to find DiSotto.  Otherwise you'll be having a drink upstairs at Francesca's - while nice, it's not DiSotto.DiSotto is perfect for a small group gathering, or a date... it's warm (ambiance and temperature!) with brick walls & ceiling and a visible wine cellar and meat locker.Excellent selection of wines by the glass divided up by country.  What I liked is that for several of the wines you could also just get a 2oz pour.  If you're not in the mood for wine, but are looking for a well made Manhattan - then you've come to the right spot.  One of the best Manhattan's we'd had was made here.  Excellent liquor selection as well."
"Fabulous. Perfect. I love it. Please stay away. Our neighborhood has added a fabulous little wine bar, with great wines, comfortable and classy decor, attentive service, good cheeses (but too few), excellent small plate food, but not much room. It's already crowded by mid-evening on the weekend. Since Cru closed we've been hoping for a replacement place to relax on Friday nights. This is it, even better and, for us, even closer. No outside tables for people watching, but a really enticing decor. Its an Italian wine cellar with a glass walled aging room at one end and the bar at the other. Its hard not to order some prosciutto when you can see it hanging through through the glass wall. With a nice bottle of wine we had their truffle egg toast with fontina cheese and asparagus. Interesting, different, not exciting. Then we had their ""Montenaro"" - prosciutto, fontina cheese again, and a salsa with poscini mushrooms on bruschette. It's a great combination of flavors, simply delicious. We munched our way through that, along with a side dish of olives, then went for the cheeses we'd ordered when we arrived: taleggio, pecorino, and a capreni combination - one piece of capreni with chives, one with paprika, one with pepper. The cheese portions were very generous, which allowed us to sit and savor long enough that we needed more wine. A suggestion: Cheeses in most restaurants are served too cold. They don't sell enough to count on selling all the cheese each evening, so they leave it chilled until its ordered. Serving cheese cold means the flavors do not come through. It normally needs to be out for at least several hours to have full flavor, 4-6 hours for some soft cheeses. So at DiSotto Enoteca we ordered our cheeses as soon as we were seated, asking them to cut them and place them aside until we asked for them. Try it - it makes a world of difference. DiSotto Enoteca is everything we want in a wine bar. But please don't go. Too many people have discovered it already, and I want to be able to get a table on Friday nights."
Amazing atmosphere. Great for a first date. Staff is very knowledgeable about the wines and food. I highly recommend the Burrata con Pomodoro Fresco.
Great wine. Let the waitress advise you on what to get. They made all our selections on wine and cheese and it was great! Enjoy!
"Lived in Chicago for 2 yrs, and did not know about this place!  Super cool place!"
"After writing my original review for DiSotto they reached out to me via Yelp and apologized for my experience. They then explained that the usual staff was out sick and they completely understood where I was coming from in my review. They then asked me to come back in and give them another try. So I did. And boy was it worth it! They rolled out the red carpet - served us a fantastic wine (one I had wanted my first visit), it was already decanted and waiting for us when we got there plus all of my favorites from the menu and a few items I didn't get to try the last time (like the truffles!) The service was amazing and the food again did not disappoint. I'll definitely be coming back to DiSotto - they are a class act & more restaurants should take note!"
"Yeah, I think I've had my fill of Scott Harris joints.We had been here a year ago and it was fine.  This place has all the trimmings to be uber-romantic, super cool.  Very expensive, which matches the neighborhood, but if you know that going in, eh, you know how it's going to go.  Last year we had some cheeses and meats which were fine enough, nothing to get all hot and bothered about, except maybe about the portion sizes which are itty bitty teeny compared to the asking price.We were back the other night in search of dessert (which they no longer have) and while the decor is great and completely supports what they're trying to do, everything else was lacking.  A sit-and-linger wine bar is a great concept, except when it's super tiny and there's a standing room only wait, with nowhere to stand.  Tables don't turn over so it's hard to get seated.  Our server was apathetic, unfriendly and generally missing in action.  In general, the staff was very busy milling about, just not assisting tables.  My brother in law wanted some bread but our server ignored his request; my hubs informed him that they charge just for bread so he dropped it.  Some little plates were dropped off and my hubs noticed one had some black food goo stuck on it, so he handed them to the server on one of her rare visits.  She copped a bit of an attitude, asking ""do you want to inspect them all first?"" to which my husband replied in a shocked manner, no, please bring us a clean set.  We made our own nice time but we're tired of being treated poorly and pick-pocketed at Scott's places, so don't expect to find us here.  Plus the valet guys always make you feel like they're put out and doing you a huge favor by taking care of your car."
"Came here to the Cellar after the restaurant at ground level was busy an are sooooo glad we found this gem.  The Bartender was great and the staff was attentive and nice. I would definitely go back here!  We had the mushroom bruschetta, wine and a few other small bites and they were all very good. Check out the mini town imbedded in the stonework near the kitchen. Highly recommend DiSotto Encoteca!"
"Don't be fooled is right.Sitting at the bar, after drinking a bottle and being OFFERED; did you want to try something else? And being very measly tasted on three other wines... we were CHARGED for those tastes. Not very good wines nor suggestions at that.Oh... Do want bread? Yep, charged for BREAD too.This place is a straight rip-off. A mediocre wine list (at best) which is also over-priced, food is ok; but who leave WHOLE dried chilies in their broccoli rabe? Who serves broccoli rabe on toast? This place does.The markups on both the wine and the meager portions (but precious...) of food really makes for an outrageously priced experience, especially when you are going to get hosed on BEING OFFERED MORE BREAD and also, oh... ""Do you want to taste something different?""Look, I work in the restaurant business. I get that this is a wine bar and that they do offer tastings at $4-6 to what ever. I'm not an idiot. If I order a scotch and the waitress or bartender asks me: ""Do you want another"" or ""May I refresh your scotch"" I know it isn't a freebee.When I'm sharing a bottle with someone and the bartender states: ""Hey, care to try something else?"" It walks into a bit of gray territory and it should be STATED: ""Hey, try anything you like, I've got pricing for tasting portions as well. If you don't want to commit to a full glass"".Or, you open a wine menu in front of the person, point out what you are suggesting and with thumb pointing to the price of the tasting and the pinky pointing to the name of the wine.Scott Harris, if you'd ever like a lesson on how to do this so you can show your staff, hit me up and I'll be happy to show you.Edit 07/15/12:It IS worth noting that the Gm has reached out to me, apologizing for the experience and an invite to come back, which I haven't taken them up on. When I do, I'll post a re-review but don't want it known that... I'm a ""returning customer w/ previous bad experience"""
"I'm in love with DiSotta Enoteca. A friend and I found it randomly when we were looking for a place to grab a drink before a first friday party at the Museum of Contemporary Art. We loved it so much that we go back on a regular basis now even though it's not in either of our neighborhoods.The wine selection is amazing and the waiters/waitresses give great recommendations on everything... wine, bruschetta, you name it.  It's classy, upscale without being pretentious or overly expensive. It's in the basement and it's fairly quiet, so save it for those nights when you want to talk and enjoy the company of whoever you're with, whether it's girlfriends or a romantic date.I'm looking forward to going back to try the restaurant upstairs!"
Very good ambiance and location. Feels like a cool little European gem right under a popular restaurant in Gold Coast.
"Love.It!  This place is so wonderful, so much so, I hesitated to write a review.  I don't want the word to get out about DiSotto and then they become too popular.  DiSotto has a great wine list and the small plates are wonderful for vegetarians.  The service is top notch.  Every time I felt like I wanted something else, they were there!  I like that.  The space is warm, beautiful and cozy.  One of my yelp buddies introduced me to this place and I got bitten by the love bug.  Thank you Dennis S!!The only con is the parking.  It's difficult to find a park in this area and the garage prices are insane!  Other than that, I try to catch the train to DiSotto before I enjoy my splendid glasses of wine."
