Dive Bar
"Ooooooo yeah! Just fantastic.  My first visit was during a Sunday brunch event.  Lots of variety with healthy options too: chicken, pb and celery, pasta salad, bacon, cute little sammies, and more!  Strong mimosas...but I do have to drop a star for running out of champagne. They really underestimated how hard we brunch! It is at a perfect location and the staff is fantastic (they look great too).  I will def be returning, and you should too.Check out the bathroom if you go. It is pretty cool :)"
Came here for a brief app between bars...  Turned out soooooo much better.    Started with tuna nachos and red curry mussels.   Blew all the mindz.   Afterwards we had a conversation with the chef and he sent over an order of bang bang shrimp... Whoaaaa yum! From the food to Spencers excellent drink service everything was great.    Can't wait to bring more people here.
"when it comes down to it, its my favorite Gay, Tiki and nautical themed seafood bar in the world :)  There are no other places like this. The seafood was fresh and clean tasting which I really appreciate.  The crab fingers were our favorite, the tuna nachos were great and fresh and enjoyed the fish dip.  The oysters were fine, just not mind blowing as described. We each had a drink, the painkiller and banana hammock. Both were a little sweet, but at 13 bucks they were strong enough and enjoyable.  Service was a little tight, but it very busy.  A small, unique hole in the wall, I dig Dive bar."
"Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? I DO NOW! Dive Bar is a bar named for its under the sea theme. I was texting my friend in NYC looking for something to do on Monday, and she sent me a picture of a drink in a Marlin cup. I was intrigued for the following reasons: 1) I LOVE FRUITY DRINKS2) It was hoo-mid and tiki theme was acceptable3) who can turn down a theme bar? NOT I So I pressed onward! I was instantly obsessed (not just because I am a closeted Yankees fan in Chi-Town and they had the game on). I was less concerned with what was in my drink and more concerned with what my drink came in. As you can see from my photos, I drank from a Marlin, a Whale and a Parrot throughout the course of the afternoon (before and after the Cubs game). My friend was texting me directives on what to drink from --we were having a virtual Memorial Day party. Drinks were strong, yet they did not taste boozy. As such, I'd say they were expertly crafted. The marlin drink was the best - it was gin based so it was on the light side and was rather refreshing in the heat. Fear not! The barkeep said you can have any drink in any cup! And for $10, that Marlin cup can be yours to bring home. I needed food too so I tried the coconut shrimp. How delicious! It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was slightly sweet. The bathroom is like the inside of a shipping container. It's pretty cool. It keeps with the theme of the restaurant. Dive Bar, this is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship! Xoxoxox"
"Think Three Dots and a Dash, but the tiki bar in a tiki hut is now a yacht in a marina. (No but really: the back room walls used to be on the inside of a yacht and the bathroom is an old shipping container.)  Dive Bar has an expansive cocktail menu serving the classic fruity drinks (mai tai, bahama mama) as well as some soon-to-be new favorites (lava flow, banana hammock).  All of these doubled drinks come to you inside a crazy fun-shaped cup. (Somehow my Blue Marlin tasted even better when I saw it accompanied with a blue marlin mug.)  If you're in a group, you can purchase a sailor bowl, which will make any group merry and jolly real quick.  Don't care for cocktails?  There's plenty of beer, daiquiris, pina coladas, wine, mojitos, and hurricanes to go around too.  To sum it all up: everyone can find something to drink at Dive Bar, and you won't have to wait three hours in River North for it."
"I have wanted to try this neighborhood restaurant for awhile.  Recently, I was in the area so I did.  I was there early so I had plenty of tables to choose from.  This is not certainly not the Mexican restaurant that it used to be.  The place was totally remodeled to a beachy theme. On one side of the restaurant is a row of tables and on the other side is the bar and the open kitchen.  Spencer, had greeted me shortly after I was seated. The drink menu is extensive so you can find a drink you may want.  I had opted just for a Sprite.I had ordered the four (4) piece chicken and the Matchstick Fries.  Since I was the only guest there, my food was prepared and brought to me within 10 minutes.  The fries were nice a crispy and the chicken was more on the broasted side.  No problem with me.  I wish the chicken was a little juicier, however, it was so good.  Spencer checked in with me throughout the meal.  Always made sure my sprite was filled.Kassondra, Manager, had stopped over and chatted with me for a while which was great!  She made sure that I was having a great experience.  I see that she enjoys her job.For dessert, I wanted to try a slice of the Key Lime pie.  It was fantastic.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and my dining experience.  I would return and recommend this restaurant."
"Delicious, creative food.  Beautiful, fun ambience.  Friendly, professional, attentive staff and owner.  James was very helpful and personable.  He made us feel like we were old friends.  Stuart, the owner, was so happy that we found them and thrilled to have their beautiful patio open."
"One of the best brunches I've had in quite awhile exist here!I got an email from urban daddy or something like that highlighting the brunch menu here...I thought it was interesting. I have driven by this place for a few months as its been open since Feb...I thought it was just another dive bar calling itself Dive Bar lol. I had no idea this was a seafood joint.Came by this past Sunday (you can make brunch reservations on Yelp) to check out the brunch. It was nice out side so we grabbed a table on the two table patio. Our server Zack was more than cool in regards to going through the menu, pricing options as well as whats good and whats popular on the menu...he was very funny also. He let us know that if you got an entree and a signature drink, bottomless mimosas were free. WHAT!!!???? Sign us up...lolI knew I was going to get the SOS Omelet before I got there. This omelet was amazing (I don't use that term often) as I got it with egg whites, crawfish, shrimp, cheese, onions and tomatoes along with hollandaise sauce on top. One of the best omelets Ive ever had..the shrimp and crawfish was something special here. My friend got the shrimp and cheesy grits which was delicious and just as good as my omelet. I was told by other patrons that the Fried Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffles is awesome as well. I got the Rum Runner as my signature drink to get my bottomless mimosas which were a nice size and made for a very good buzzed Sunday afternoon. The Rum Runner is very good and makes you feel like you are on a beach in the Caribbean. It contains a couple of different rums, grenadine, creme de banana, simple syrup, pineapple juice, orange juice, lime juice and seasonal berries. This place is good for the area as its something different and not just another dive bar."
"Spanish green seafood bowl is definitely not worth the money, mostly rice and the sauce is lack luster. Tuna nachos are awesome, though! Po Boy was very good!"
"I've been waiting for Dive Bar to open so when it finally did I had to make a bee line there. The drinks are creative and delicious. The food is good, but the menu is a little limited and my friends wish that more fish options were available (i.e remove the burger sliders and add fish sliders). I will definitely be hitting up Dive Bar again for sure.Food Recommendations- Fried Potato Salad is a must try! - Party CalamariDrink Recommendations- Mango Raspberry Pina Colada gets two thumbs up- Dark & Stormy - Pink Flamingo"
"Highly recommend the tuna nachos. Totally unique and delicious! Ask to sit in the back patio. The pink ""feathered"" umbrellas are over the top."
This was my first time coming to Dive bar. I enjoyed the experience . I noticed right away that this establishment was well kept and  very clean .  My boyfriend and I walked in and were greated promplty at the host stand. Zack made our dining experience amazing he took time to explain the most popular drinks and menu items. The boom boom shrimp was one of his recommendations and it was excellent!  And the drinks came out very fast along with the food. I love the tapas style menu. We ordered the fried potato salad but wasnt available so the manager came over to tell us and offered us something else at no charge . The staff is so welcoming and accommodating.
This place has a great theme!  The drink menu was incredible!  All kinds of fruity masterpieces awaiting a taste.I did manage to try the boom boom shrimp in between.  It was quite tasty!  The shrimp was a perfect cross between crispy on the outside and moist and succulent on the inside.
"Nope. It's just too inconsistent and generally bad to belong on Halsted.I've been here maybe six times now. Each time we go here, we think: is it going to suck like last time? Usually, it does. I almost always leave Dive Bar feeling angry and like I fell for the same stupid prank. I'm about done for good.Visit #1: It took about 40 minutes to get our first drink. That drink wasn't very good.Visit #2: We thought it must have been a fluke so we went back. We were told it would take over an hour to get a table, but that it would be OK to go stand in the back by the bar. So we did. We ordered drinks there. Then somebody else yelled at us telling us we weren't allowed to stand there. The drinks never came. We just left.Visit #3: It was my birthday and the only reason we went there was as a central meeting point. I actually remember this visit being nice.Visits #4, #5: It's hard to remember the details. I can say that by this point I realized the one drink that I don't actually hate, and I probably ordered it once and left unimpressed as usual. I have never had a ""wow!"" experience here.Last night was the final straw. We decided to take an uninitiated newby -- with expectations appropriately lowered to the floor. We each ordered one drink and one food item. The drinks came out pretty fast, and everybody complained. The lava flow was described as a ""disgusting pina colada full of ice mixed with a ridiculously bad strawberry daiquiri."" All the food came out separately. I ordered the coconut shrimp again, but each time I get this, it seems to be worse. I don't know how you can screw up shrimp out of the freezer, but they are finding a way. My friend ordered some kind of grilled chicken salad, which he said was disgusting.Around this time the waiter started to notice everybody was unhappy. And our third food never came. So we complained and he offered to make everything right. Eventually he offered to send the manager over to talk with us and to replace one of the lava flows with a mai tai. That drink never ever came. Nor did the manager. We were offered a free round of shots and a free entree. The shots never came. Our waiter came back yet again and we pointed out that we still hadn't seen the replacement mai tai. Or the manager. We were all pretty disappointed -- and of course, that moment is when the third entree finally showed up.Then we got our check... with the three shots that never came added on, then ""comped."" Ultimately the restaurant wound up comping the ENTIRE check. But we never saw that manager. (Our waiter did a great job -- no complaints about him.)You can do a lot better at other places in Boystown that aren't so expensive, so slow, so rude, or most of all, so inconsistent. Good luck to Dive Bar; they need it."
"Was looking for another place and a joy ride to the City, and walked in here by accident. What a surprise. Its hip, and was busy on a Sunday afternoon noon. Tiki bar kinda decor, with the fancy rum drinks in fancy cups to drink out of. The crowd was great, the bartenders as well. Who could argue with the $4 well drinks in the heart of Boys Town. Babes, for some reason loves Boys Town. We had drinks and split a Shrimp and Grits dish, and it was a 5 on its own. It was more like a Shrimp and Nacho Cheese Grits dish. We will be back for more drinks and snacks, when babes is off the diet again."
"Food only average and I thought a bit over priced for the portions.  Drinks are tasty.  But, for sure NOT doubles like stated on their menu.  Service very nice and friendly.  Would I go back?  Not, sure!"
"TL;DR Dive bar with seafood restaurant pricesI'm struggling to decide if this is 2 or 3 stars... As an avid scuba diver I was quite psyched to see a 'dive/nautical' themed restaurant move in on Halsted. Yes it's new, but I like my seafood so it was worth a try. It's not a big place and so when we went 10 days ago it was worth getting a reservation for Friday night. Our servers were really sweet and very patient with us as we tried to decide on food and drinks.Drinks are pricey, they are all $13 each. Yes many of them come in festive glasses but this isn't Wood, which is my favorite place on Halsted to shell out for $13 (but really good) drinks. I had the summer lei and he had the negroni. I've had better leis (hee hee) than this and so I definitely did not want another. No sir.We started with the clam chowder which was fine, but for $8 it was a meager portion (think Oliver!) and for that money you get a large bowl of really good chowder at New England Seafood on Lincoln. We then had oysters (yum), crab cakes (also $8, the crab cakes are really small but the corn salsa and romaulade were awesome), and then the fried chicken ($10 for 4 pieces). I'm not a fried food fan, so I thought the chicken was good but I thought the biscuits that come with the chicken were better.The kitchen is super small. Almost too tight to fit 3 guys in there. Also the bathrooms are in the middle of the restaurant in reclaimed shipping cargo cars. There's no way to tell if someone is in there or not other than to try to open it.I think the biggest disappointment were the drinks, I wouldn't pay for those again. I think the food is fine but I think some items have some kinks to work out."
"I wanted to love this place!  Unfortunately the drinks were terrible.  We sipped twice, asked for the check and left.  They were too sugary, artificial and made us wonder if there was any alcohol in them at all."
"Super tasty drinks and a completely different atmosphere than all the other bars in the neighborhood so I was glad to hear of this place when it was opening. I haven't had the drinks so I can speak on that but I have had the drinks. I had the painkiller and the guava basil cooler. Both were tasty and well prepared and I enjoyed them all. The only downside because these are all speciality drinks, they take a bit of time to make so be patient - the wait is worth the tastey-time"
Was my first time yesterday and have to say the expirience was amazing! Service was phenomenal too bad I forgot my server's name but I do know he was training someone which btw was awesome as well. Ask to sit in the back patio it's nice and quiet. The food was also delicious the tuna nachos are exquisite and the shimp as well. In other words i loved everything and will go back
First time here and couldn't have ask for a better server! Drinks and food were both amazing. You rock Zach!!!
The food was spectacular and I loved the bartender. Andrew taught me so much about making drinks and it was an overall good experience. Coming back soon for sure.
"Fishy in Boystown - oh the irony!  On a serious note, GREAT addition to the  Halsted strip.  Dive Bar is a keeper, in my book....hook, line, and sinker!Cheesy Kiki bar theme decor, but done right and tastefully. The shipping container, bar, and ships wheel were awesome. The bar so beautiful I had to Instagram it. Our server, a female who I think Jessica was her name? was genuinely friendly and helpful with the drink and food menus.  The drinks pack a punch but are super tasty, and the food was delish.Only knock for one star is the pricing - $13 for specialty cocktails, $13 for 6-7 tuna nacho chips, $13 for three small chicken sliders, and $10 for a small basket of tiny breaded scrimps?  Surely not dive bar pricing.  Hopefully they adjust the prices just a tad, otherwise this becomes a 'once in a while' kinda place as opposed to a regular one."
"Service: The server/bartender who initially came to help us was an enormous a**hole. He seemed angry at the table we chose, even though the host told us to sit anywhere. My wife tried to disarm him by making a friendly comment, but he acted like he clearly hated us every time he came by the table. I mean, I sympathize with having a bad night, and we're totally not high maintenance people when it comes to service, but this guy's attitude was seriously unacceptable. We almost left then, and would have if we hadn't had a Groupon to use up. Our actual server ended up providing outstanding service and was very kind, so overall that kinda made up for the first guy.Food: When it comes to food, we are high maintenance, and this place doesn't stack up. You can tell the owners are really cheaping out. When I think of a seafood restaurant, I imagine healthy fresh fish. Not here. Almost all the options on menu are fried. Things like coleslaw are clearly straight out of the 5-gallon tub from Sysco. I mean c'mon, coleslaw is so delicious when made fresh and there are so many creative and delicious things to do with it. This was over-processed crap seriously on par with KFC, for 4X the price. Speaking of chain restaurants, the Boom Boom Shrimp tasted like something you would get at Applebee's. Everything just had that frozen, prepackaged, high fructose, just thrown-in-the-fryer kind of quality about it.Drinks: Tasty, but not super high quality, and definitely not double-strength as advertised. Ambiance: Pretty cool. Original decor and good theme. There was a lot of potential, if only the food didn't suck.Overall Rating: Boystown deserves better. Don't settle for this kind of food."
"I went last night for a second experience around 8, and I must say, my fiancee and I had an even better time. The Blue Marlin was excellent, and of the two drinks I had, both were fuller and less ice filled than a month ago- the volume and blend of flavors made the price worth it."
"Wow, what a place. I came here yesterday for their soft opening and I absolutely loved it! Dive Bar is a nautical-themed eatery, boasting seafood as well as comfort food such as fried chicken and cajun macaroni and cheese. The food is served tapas-style. Everything there was cooked to perfection. The fried chicken was so juicy and tender. The mussels were delicious as well. They serve some with a bit of curry to give it a kick. My favorite entree was the Boom Boom shrimp. It's a breaded shrimp with a kick, topped with cilantro.  Since it is a nautical-themed bar, there are many tropical, eclectic drinks to choose from. They carry over 150 different types of Rum (that's a lot of rum!) and make all kinds of wonderful creations. My friends tried the Rum Runner and absolutely loved it. I had a strawberry banana piña colada and a mango raspberry daiquiri. Both were amazing! They were the perfect combination of sweet and strong. Our server, Zach was awesome too. He tended to our every need and even went above and beyond what he needed to do for us. The owners, Stu and Jon came out to greet us and they were both so kind. They were genuine and welcoming to all the guests at the restaurant. I will most definitely be frequenting this place. Great food, great location and great people!"
"Recently paid a visit to what I thought was going to be an exciting place in my neighborhood....Food:Fish Bites (Best thing we tried.  Slightly reminded me of Thai style fish cakes)Fried Chicken  (decent but really bland)Fried Potato Salad  (nice but again, bland.  Add some fresh herbs, and seasoning to your potato mix)Boom Boom Shrimp (overrated.  Cheapy, tiny fried shrimp smothered in a sweet sauce. ) Yes there are quite few of them - but - they're so cheap tasting!). Notes:  This is not a seafood experience.  Lots of unhealthy items and fried things on this menu.  C'Mon guys.  Please step it up with some inventive, fresh fish and tasty fresh sides!  Pretty pricey for the current quality/offerings.Cocktails (we had 2 drinks a piece, 3 types):Pain Killer - Nice flavor, but weak for the price.Cocoa Colada - Nice flavor but weak for the price.  Lovely mug but the cocktails were ALL ice!!!Lava Flow - Nice again, but weak!Notes:  Lower your cocktail prices or make your drinks stronger.  ""Double?""  My eye!  Double juice and double ICE is more accurate.Service:Our server was just meh.  He was fine, but just meh.Ambiance:To anyone that thinks so....this is NOT a tiki bar, sorry.  There's  no real effort in the decorating and you could easily throw flat screens in areas and it would look like a tiny sports bar.  The back room though, was designed to feel like you are in a boat cabin wich is interesting enough - BUT - it's dark in there and the overall feeling of the place was cold and uncomfortable (we don't need the ""cold boat feeling"" with the look).  Also, they could use some candles on the tables.  Clean paper menus.  This would help greatly.  There was faint Polynesian music in the background and then it suddenly changed to Mellencamp!  Look, I like Mellencamp but what an awkward place to be playing him!Notes:  Please make this a more submerged, tropical/nautical experience!  You guys have a neat back room so don't stop there!  Continue the theme throughout!  Add a candle to each table and perhaps a floating tropical flower.  Incorporate a water element somehow!  I love the outside and the theme of your website so much.  Please continue this awesomeness on the inside!  Let it show in your food, too.  OUT OF FAIRNESS:  People, STOP trying to compare this place to Three Dots.  That's more of an upscale tiki experience.  You CAN have a tiki ""Dive"" bar!  That's what tiki truly is....relaxing, comforting and come as you are!!!  This place COULD be that.Owners:  Stop being cheap guys - it shows and it's a bummer.  You guys can create something really special here.  If you guys stepped it up, this would become my favorite neighborhood place!  If you guys make changes please let me know.  I'll come back in a heartbeat and change my review.  Otherwise, I would say that [other] people could stop in for a quick beer/pre-drink and a quick app.   That's it. That's all."
"The crab legs at this place are currently Chicago's best kept secret. They are seriously the best king crab legs I've had in a LONG time. Dare I say...comparable to Bob Chinns. Don't mess with the apps here...just stick with the crab legs and cocktails and you wont be disappointed. So good, very reasonable, and great service too. Not to mention I prefer a relaxed atmosphere when I'm cracking in to King Crab...and not the stuffy vibe you get at Joe's downtown.I'll be back."
Great new find in Lakeview.  Not the normal Boystown prices. ($4 well drinks ALL the time!!)  We had appys that did not disappoint. The Tuna Nachos topped with thinly sliced fresh tuna were surprisingly delicious given the combination of fish and guacamole.   And it's no coincidence the Boom Boom Shrimp are one of the best selllers.  Jessica and Spencer behind the bar made the evening complete.  Fun and engaging.  Just what you want your bartender to be.   Will definitely be back!!Oh.  And Tommy rocks too
"We've been meaning to try this place for a while so once a groupon came out we decided to ""dive in"" (see what I did there?). It was a warm day so I was excited to try one of their cocktails. They were ok but not worth $13. Weak and overly sweet. Now for the food:1) Fried Chicken - this was good and came with some good biscuits but didn't seem much better than Popeyes to be honest. 2) Boomboom Shrimp - these were pretty good. For fries shrimp they were cooked well and not overcooked. I like the sweet sauce. 3) Burger Sliders - kind of small even for sliders. Unremarkable. 4) Seafood dip - strange texture. Not very good.5) Matchstick fries - under seasoned, didn't seem fresh. Overall it was ok but I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes and lack of quality. The focus on fried food left us craving some fresh seafood dishes like a nice seared ahi tuna. There is potential here for better."
"Binged at the dive last Sunday and I'm coming back. We ordered too much food but ate pretty much all of it.  I'm embarrassed by how much we ordered. Some definitive treasures on the menu, our waiter was spunky, friendly and attentive.Sliders - delicious, charred, saucy Fried chicken 4pc - not a huge aficionado of fried chicken and I might have been drunk but it was damn good. Nicely seasoned, crispy not overly greasy.King crab - sweet, where are my crab tools man!  The butter is served in a paper cup...no buenoCoconut shrimp - good size, satisfying but not outstanding.Crab fingers - hard pass.  Too little, nothing special Boom boom shrimp - enjoyable, nice sweet spicy flavor Wedge salad - delicious - it's slightly different. The lettuce was fresh, dressing was creamy and not overly pungent - tomatoes + bacon...definite winner.Matchstick potatoes - hard, hard pass. Too skinny - almost like those damn potato strings in a can.  With the excellent Sliders we must have at least decent fries. Our waiter made the experience even better because he was also the bartender and he pours nicely. Something something with basil and deliciousness."
"My daughter and I stopped in for a light dinner the other night, we had a great time. Jeremy our waiter was friendly and helpful.  The oysters were really fresh and sweet....and the mussels in red curry were the best I have ever had.  Along with a delicious and well priced bottle of wine......everything was wonderful. In fact it was so good, we went back again today.  Dive Bar is on my list of favorite places from here on out."
"There aren't many seafood tapas places in the city and so we had to try this new spot! I ordered the tuna nachos, calamari and the 1/2 dozen oysters. For two people, this was enough food for the both of us. They also have a killer drink menu that'll make you feel like you're in Hawaii. Definitely a perfect place for some fruity cocktails and a small meal."
"I've heard great reviews from friends about Dive Bar so a friend and I went there to check it out.The waitress that we had was amazing, her name was Taylor and she described all the drinks and food on the menu which was a huge help. I had a strawberry daiquiri which was very good! I then switched over to the drink that won an award, I forget the name, but it was delicious and very strong (probably why I forget the name :))We got the seafood dip and shrimp cocktail, both were again, delicious! The best part of the meal were the Hawaiian sliders. SO SO SO GOOD! I would get those again and make a meal out of it.The staff was so friendly and the chef brought out two chocolate chip cookies on the house. Taylor made the experience great! She was very funny but also attentive and helpful. I already texted all my friends that we need to check out their brunch on Sunday's which look great too!"
"This place is a hidden gem that deserves to be exposed. A great concept, well executed. Service was remarkable. Comfortable and relaxing. Energy is welcoming as are the staff!! Locals are very welcome as well as visitors. They really go out of their way. This is a ""must go""!  And a must support - we all need places like this in our neighborhood!! (And I am based in LA - which means I am used to great food and service with attitude). Come support these guys!!"
"I think this place is called dive bar because customer service is drowning here.I went with two friends at around 12:30am on a Saturday night wanting to check out the new place in the neighborhood, and at the time only two other tables were occupied in the small space. One of my friends ordered a water while me and another friend ordered the tropical margarita.When the waiter returned with our drinks I had been in the middle of a story trying to describe something with a hand gesture. As the waiter approached (unnoticed by me) I accidentally hit the waiter with my hand, which caused some of the liquid in one of the drinks to spill a bit onto the table. I immediately apologized profusely. I would have cleaned it up, but we didn't have napkins at our table and our waiter had a towel available.The waiter didn't say a word. Nothing. He cleaned up the mess and walked away. The whole interaction rubbed me the wrong way (and was a generally awkward and off-putting human experience). I know I was in the wrong, but good service just states you smile, say ""no big deal"" and both parties feel better - especially if that customer is apologizing! But instead I just got the cold shoulder. The rest of the experience was equally disappointing. The drinks were too sugary (I doubt the OJ or lime juice they're using in the margaritas is fresh) and they were overpriced. Two drinks ended up costing me around $24.I haven't tried the food, but I don't plan to ever go back. If the service I experienced is the norm, this place will be swimming with the fishes in no time. #SkipIt"
"This place is a joke of a restaurant.  It's a CLEAR ripoff of Three Dots and a Dash in River North.  They even copied the banana dolphin in their drinks.  There is no creativity here - this is a result of a failed restaurant concept and replacing it with something the owners tried to replicate despite their own lack of imagination....and failed miserably.  First the service, the waiters and bartenders are more concerned with texting and trying to pick up a guy that they have no idea what customer service really is.  Even the owner was seen kissing some guys he knew in front of TWO parties waiting to be sat. The food is horrible.  Cheap in quality and no real direction of flavor profile.  It's a ""hot mess"" as the area locals like to say about things.  The drinks are equally disgusting and overpriced for what the ingredients REALLY ARE - yes the bartender had no shame in telling me the lack of quality ingredients.  Nothing is fresh, it's a mixture of Jewel Osco high fructose corn syrup mixes.....tasty right?The boystown residents are eating this place up because they clearly stick to their bubble and have no idea what an actual good restaurant establishment should entail.  I give it 6 months before this place goes under.  It's a clear reminder of how far people will go to avoid foreclosure.  Do yourselves a favor and visit a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, one with a hint of class, dignity, and dare I say actual good food.  Three Dots and a Dash, I can't wait to come back."
"Love this place. The decor is beautiful. I loved the food it was delicious. They're drinks are some of the best on the street. They have $4 wells everyday if I want to keep it cheap. The staff is beautiful and super nice. I love the owners of Dove Bar, John and Stu are two of the hardest working and nicest people on Halsted. Makes it even easier to get behind this bar. The patio is open too!"
"This place kind of sucks.  From the beginning, I was wondering why a seafood place was called Dive Bar, but the name fits.  They have an extensive island drink menu, which is cool, but the ratios of liquor are def not right, or the bartender was not that good.  The craft beer list is nice too, but not the best, if you can venture a few blocks in any direction.  What really disgusted me were the mussels, which no joke smelled like a dirty fish tank.  They were also smothered in A LOT of cheese, which was weird, as if the excessive amount of cheese was supposed to mask the rotten smell/taste.    I think the chef saw my disgusted face, so he came over to ask if I was alright, and I told him what I thought.  He told me he was not happy with the mussel supplier and that he was sorry, so I ordered the seafood dip instead.  It was alright, but after about ten minutes, it starts to look like a congealed bowl of goop.  The only thing I liked about the place was the Two Hearted IPA on the menu, but I will not be having another in this establishment.  Also, what type of seafood place does not have a reliable supplier? I think they are better known for fried chicken, to be honest. **The only reason I wanted to try this place was because I was so impressed with MEAT, an awesome restaurant that is somehow affiliated with Dive Bar.  A server told me I 'had to try their new spot,' but ohhh they were so wrong!  I will stick with MEAT!"
"Love love love! Stu and Jon outdid themselves. This is such a great concept for seafood. The nautical theme works. My girls and I had a fantastic time at the soft opening and will frequent this restaurant much like we have Stu and Jon's Meat on Chestnut. These guys know flavor. The boom boom shrimp was fantastic. They were just really zesty and meaty. We also enjoyed the mussels and chicken. I think I have a hard time deciding what was the best take away--the food, the creative array of drinks or the service! Zach!! We loved him. The entire staff was superbly professional and friendly. I would recommend the Dive Bar to all."
