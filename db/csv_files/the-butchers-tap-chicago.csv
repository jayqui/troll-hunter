The Butcher’s Tap
"Great little neighborhood pub for grabbing a quick burger or meal CYO burger was pretty good with avocado, cheddar and grilled onions. Will definitely be back!"
"I went hear on a Monday afternoon for lunch time. And to be honest the food was 4-5 star worthy. But the service just brought it down, they weren't rude they weren't mean just not on top of it and slow. After scouring the menu half because they have a really cool menu and half because the waitress didn't come for 15 minutes we both decided on burgers. I love their variety of options for types of burgers topping etc. they really offer something for everyone. We also got their cheese curds as an app and speaking as a true Wisconsin boy these are great and their dips are out of this world.  I'm also so intrigued in the picnic basket and cheese and meat platter. Both sounded great. As I said before the service was just slow and inattentive. They are situated across from Southport Grocery which is plenty busy during the lunch hour. Butchers tap is significantly less so, and I could not find a reason at all that out cheese curds and burgers meant that we were situated there for over an hour and a half. I'll definitely be heading back and crossing my fingers for better service next time."
"Been here a couple times - pretty much the same story each time, the burgers/sandwiches are great, everything else, not so much. Most recently, I've gotten the Zeus (lamb) and Tombstone (bison). The Zeus was kinda what you'd expect from a lamb burger, some good feta (but not overpowering), arugula, pickled onion, and they added a neat twist by including a bit of hummus. Overall it was good and the lamb was cooked very well.This last time I got the bison. Again, the blue cheese wasn't overpowering which I was grateful for and the buffalo sauce was quite good. They were supposed to include their own ""sopo"" sauce (sopo as in SOuthPOrt) but didn't. Again, bison was cooked well, and I'd probably be willing to get it again.But outside your main order, I've been a bit disappointed with Butcher's Tap. We go the wings last time and the dry rub didn't have a ton of flavor in my opinion while the korean had good flavor but just needed some more of it. That being said, one of the waiters who had overheard our discussion when ordering then brought us a shot when we were a bit disappointed with the dry rub. That's great service and I really appreciated it. Costs the restaurant next to nothing, keeps customers happy. Beer menu generally provides a good selection as well.Be sure to sit outside, it can get really loud on the inside, especially at the back where the ceiling's a bit lower."
"This place could be a huge hot spot but owners are cutting corners. The upstairs is a waste of space. The pool table is all wet from the condensation on the air ducks above. The pool sticks are all broke except one. The two dart boards are crap. One is completely garbage and the darts are terrible too. These small things make you wonder, what other corners are they cutting? Who knows what the kitchen looks like. Food is ok, I got the wings with the dry rub. Dry rubwas blan, thankfully they had a good spicy ketchup to douse them with. All in all, had lots of potential but needs a bar rescue for wasted space and broken equipment. Upkeep looks half ass."
"This is a 3-star place all around. 3 stars for food, 3 for service and 3 for atmosphere. I am convinced the people who owned The Wheel House simply changed the name of this place to reset their Yelp reviews as I can't tell much of a difference between that place and this. Sure the menu is a bit different and the beer list may have improved but the crowd is the same, the prices seemed to have gone up and the food is just as a-ok as before.  Living in the Southport area is frustrating. There should be better restaurant choices but sadly, there aren't many. I was really hoping that when this placed converted over it would be a place to go. I guess given the Wrigleyville crowd spillover, you're going to cater to whomever comes in the door. I'll give it another try maybe two to be fair but I'm not expecting much to change..."
"Great atmosphere and a fun innovative menu. There is a second 'menu', or bible I believe they called it, which contains information about their farms and distributors that you could literally spend an entire day reading! They really focus on the quality of the ingredients which is nice.They have an extensive selection of over 100 beers, 60 on draft, and unique seasonal cocktails. The beers are listed out by state on the beer menu which I really enjoyed!The cheese curds ($8) are battered in more of a tempura coating, super light and yummy. The pesto ranch they are served with has a surprising fresh flavor and was my favorite thing of the night! The Friend Chicken Picnic ($17) was a super fun idea served in an adorable mini picnic basket.  The chicken is boneless and you may disappointed if you are expecting a greasy crispy mess. It was good but I have a feeling they might struggle keeping it moist with this technique. Sides: Homemade chips and macaroni were both amazing!!The Chicago Cut Burger ($12) with Havarti, Arugala, Caramelized Onions, Field Mushrooms and Steak Sauce was delicious! Great cozy neighborhood place to get you through the monotony of winter, though I'm sure it will be just as fabulous in the summer!"
"Food was great. Friendly service.  Good atmosphere. Will come back again. Try the cheese curds, you won't regret it."
"The food is GREAT! I got the Chicago Cut Burger with fries. I got my burger cooked to medium. It was more medium-well than medium, but I still enjoyed it. The burger comes with Harvarti (I believe), sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, and some kind of sauce (got the sauce on the side. Thank goodness I did because it did not taste good to me - very tangy and not my favorite thing). I had gotten this burger once before, and the arugula came dry/fresh. This time it was tossed in a ranch or something. Not too much, so I liked it. The meat tasted fresh. The bun was toasted. The fries - some were crisp and others soft (I like both, so I was happy!). I would totally come back, HOWEVER the service is always veeeery slow (food comes fast, but that's because they have food runners). My server this last time was just really awkward, and I could tell she was new because she would take forever to come back to me. I sat around for more than ten minutes before she came to take my order - and I was there before the rush. TLDR; come for the food- not the service."
"I'm not usually one to venture out to sports bar, but the Hawks were in the finals, so we chose this destination for our group. It was crowded, but then again which bar wouldn't be with so many large TVs - great for watching the game from just about any seat. Thankfully we planned ahead and arrived early enough to score a good table, because they filled up quickly closer to game time. The crowd definitely added to the lively ambiance downstairs, and we did notice there was a large area upstairs with a pool table and darts.On to the beer list... Our table of beer snobs was in heaven. The craft beer list was super extensive, and we liked that most of the beers were served in 16 oz glasses, unless they were over 7% ABV's. I tried the beer flight first per our server's recommendation, which gives you four tasters of your choice, then moved on to the 16 ouncers. As far as food... we were told the dry rub wings were to die for, and they were speaking the truth. We also indulged further in fried cheese curds and pickles, a couple burgers (the Zeus - lamb burger... YUM), and one of their signature sandwiches (the turkey pesto and buffalo chicken were delicious!). We were there for a few hours watching the game, and ordered a couple items in between each period. Food came out just promptly, beers were kept full, Hawks won, and my group and I left very satisfied with our experience at Butcher's Tap."
"We enjoyed a late lunch here on Saturday. Overall, a good experience, but the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing each other. We were sitting under a speaker (and clearly, I'm very old). The food was great. We shared the picnic, with the fried chicken. As sides, we ordered cole slaw, potato salad and Mac and cheese. It was very good, and the presentation (little baskets with red and white check paper) was so cute. I also got to try The Diner burger. That was delicious and I would absolutely order that on my own. Tillamok cheddar is always a good choice. The cheese and meat plate was also very good - the gouda was outstanding. The red pepper hummus with fresh, warm pita and crisp veggies was awesome. The fries and onion rings were also very good and props for delicious ketchup. I would drop the volume a little, and although our server was great, I think there needed to be one or two other people on the floor, she was pretty far in the weeds most of the time we were there. All in, a great spot on Southport."
"A date suggested The Wheel House for a Tuesday night drink, but upon arrival realized this has turned into The Butcher's Tap. What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The bartender indicated it was taken under new management so they've redone the whole menu. I got the Dominican hot cider and my date got the Iced and Spiced Moonshine. Luckily he let me taste his because it was outstanding! Tasted like liquid, boozy apple pie. Pure deliciousness basically. My cider with rum was good too, but not as good as Clark Street Ale House's hot spiced mead. The amount of beer they have on tap was also impressive. With big screens mounted on the walls, I could see The Butcher's Tap as a good place to watch sports games.The bartenders were pretty friendly, and the atmosphere casual. There weren't many people there so service was fairly timely. I'll have to come back to try the food and update this review."
"Place/beer were pretty cool overall, but bartender Sam has one of the worst attitudes I have ever encountered in my life. He and I first bonded over our sports teams, but then he pulled a 180 and decided to tell me that I was going to bomb my super-important interview later this week. What happened?? He continued with these insults all night til my date and I left. I don't know about my date, but I'm never coming back"
"Went for the first time tonight for Michael Roberts wine class. This place is great!  Michael was a awesome, learned about wines of Spain and ate some great appetizers. My group had the butcher board, tostadas and cheese curds. All were very tasty and reasonably priced. Nice staff, nice facility and tasty food and cold beverages. I'll be back for another of Michael's classes plus to try some of the other menu items!  Check this place out!!"
"The ambiance was good and the staff was friendly, but the food wasn't good. Bloody Mary was ok, sangria was bad, sandwich and wings were terrible."
Was here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. The place wasn't very busy and we were seated downstairs. We ordered and waited 45 minutes for two sandwiches. I'm hesitant to blame anyone (maybe a big party on the second floor?) But the server never checked on us and the food was eventually brought out by a food runner. Had to go to the bar to ask for silverware and napkins. She only appeared when it was time to drop the check. Eh. Bartender was at least very friendly and nice. Would go back to be served drinks by him but will skip the table/food service next time.
Best fried pickles I've ever had. Service was amazing.  And the menu is fun to order from.Ps: the hot cider drink? Mmmm. Order two.
"My friend and I went to the Butcher's Tap last night for the first time. We walked in and asked the door guy if they served food because we weren't there to drink, he said yes and gave us a menu to look over. The items on the menu sounded good so we were seated. After 10 minutes a waitress brought us over two waters and asked what we wanted to eat. We asked for the hummus platter then ordered two of the sandwiches. About 25 to 30 minutes went by and we noticed no one around us had food on their tables. We then heard the couple next to us complain about their food taking a long time to the waitress, and she offered them free wings (it was half off wing night). We called the waitress over and asked when our hummus would be out, as we wanted it before our dinner, not with our meals. She said she would go and check in the kitchen. About 5 minutes later she came back and said it would be about 8 minutes. She wouldn't look at us directly and I asked if it had even started to be made, she then looked around anxiously and said no. I then asked how long it would be for our sandwiches to be made and she said about 45 minutes.We cancelled our orders, all she said was sorry and that the kitchen had been backed up all night and she could 'rant about it to us.' I understand that the kitchen was backed up but to begin with the door guy should have told us this when we walked in and told him we were only there to eat, not drink. Then the waitress knew the same thing as well but never told us it would be an hour and a half before we would get our dinner. This was also at 9PM at night. It left a really bad taste in our mouth as we had never been there before. We went to a restaurant a couple blocks down and got seated within 5 minutes, our appetizer within 10 minutes and our entrees in about 20 minutes."
"One star for the food.Three stars for the atmosphere/TVs everywhere.Two star rating.I went here to meet some friends for lunch on a Sunday. The place was surprisingly busy, then again, the NFL playoffs were happening and there were Packer fans everywhere. Between the game, music, and people, it was loud.The beer list is extensive. I ended up going with a $4 can and one of us even got a bloody mary to have with lunch.Service was not the best. It took a while for someone to come take our order, and it felt like a really long time for the food to come.I shared the picnic lunch with one other person. We got chicken and 3 sides for $17. Not a bad price, I thought. We picked fries, cole slaw, and mac and cheese.The chicken is boneless, which I liked, but it was just so dry. The rub had good spices, but the dry-ness was overbearing. We asked for some BBQ sauce and it took more than 10 minutes to arrive. (The waitress told us they had to go get some from the basement). The fries were good, but the cole slaw and mac and cheese were not. The cole slaw had close to zero dressing, so it was mostly cabbage. Ick. The mac and cheese sauce was watery, very very watery. So watery that a bunch of liquid accumulated in the little bowl it was served in. Shouldn't mac and cheese be thick and rich? I'd go back to try their cheese plate, but if that wasn't good, I don't think I'd be back again."
"The ONLY reason I am giving this place such a low rating is because they stupidly employ the practice of not writing down a person's order.    I am not impressed by someone's ability or inability to remember an order.  Accuracy is key here folks, not service showmanship.Loved the cozy fun atmosphere and good menu inspired by the butcher shops of yesteryear.  Nothing really trendy here, but a solid offering of great meats and cheeses.  Everything from truffled bologna and jowl bacon to organic gouda and heritage white cheddar.  Offerings are limited and that was ok...from signature sandwiches, wings, hummus, cheese curds to burgers, tostadas and quesadillas.  To start with, we ordered some of the Maple Farms drunken cheese curds that were marinated and beer battered.  Upon arrival, though tasty, we found them to be significantly under fried.  We kindly asked the server if we could get more oil time and she happily obliged.  The result was oh so much better.My dining companions opted for the burgers and I decided to do the ""create your new favorite"" sandwich option.  OK, so this was just one area that so calls out for writing down specifics as you choose your bread, meat (s), veggies, and dressings.  I opted for soft Italian bread, roast beef, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, hot giardiniara, avocado, and sriracha aioli.Heck after a few drinks, I didn't remember exactly what I ordered.  When the sandwich came, it looked super good.  However, after a bite I noticed no avocado.  So we had to waive down the server and she subsequently presented some slices to me on a plate.  After another couple of bites, I noticed no giardiniara and no aioli.  By this time, I was saying uncle to my plate, and had no interest in flagging down the server every time I noticed a missed ingredient.  Please, Butcher's Tap, stop this silly practice.  You have a nice operation going, why piss off your customers?"
"high chairs for the high tops...that wins me over all the time ;) the folks know they need to cater to the sopo/lakeview young families with their half pints in tow! in an effort to stay paleo-veg-lite (yes my own lifestyle craze), i asked to sub in egg for the cheese in the fried green tomato salad. they didn't bat an eyelash at the weird request and produced an amazing dish! luscious tomatoes and wow - balsamic vinegarette that wasn't overly sweet. it was perfect. as were the fried pickles - not too overcooked or greasy.great atmosphere - sports bar feel but also really chill. a definite 'regular' for us with or without the half pint."
"Very disappointed about the food. Ordered chicken Brest sandwich - received 2 dry chicken fingers on a bun. Side salad was dry and saggy with chopped tomatoes that were sitting for hours chopped before. I don't think that it's worth $12.00. Beer was good, service too. That's gives 1 star / each =in  total 2. To the chef: ""it's not a rocket science to make a great chicken sandwich. Really! Watch a YouTube video perhaps?"
"The pics look awesome but not so much in real feel. Atmosphere is  ok, just ok. Service was a waitress serving us drinks after we had both said no thanks and there was minimal face time overall. When our food did arrive we were surprised by the lack of it and it's inflated cost. Our medium rare burgers were well done; the bison was tasty but my special order burger came with ingredients I didn't even order. Had to stop for dessert at another spot just to fill our bellies. Damn could have gone to Five Star! Oh and the music was perfect for the crowd... a little boring."
Great food and great service. One of the best places to eat on the block! I had the quesadilla and it was very yummy. Our waitress was super nice! Just watch out sometimes they have the music blasting so don't expect to talk to the people you are with.
I'm sure the beer is great and the food is good. I just sat at the bar for ten minutes on a quiet Wednesday and couldn't get a beer. I'll spend my money elsewhere.
"We went to watch a Blackhawk's game and the bar was crowded, but the service and food were great. We got a blackened chicken quesadilla and a custom turkey sandwich and both were delicious. Also our server Michael did a great job despite being really busy. I'd definitely go back there again."
"Good food and good beer. Can't really ask for much more. Their trivia is also pretty fun on Wednesdays and they have a pretty sweet pool and dart set up upstairs.Only complaint is that they are a ""THE"" Ohio State University affiliated bar. Maybe why they put the ""the"" in their bar name ;)"
"Service: It took us three hours to get dinner. The waiter kept avoiding our table and never explained what happened. When we finally asked what was going on, he offered us shots. Um, no thanks. They did end up discounting our bill without our asking.Consumables: The food was ok. Not worth the wait, though. Cheese curds and fried pickles were the best thing we had. Diner burger was awful, and just incorrectly made. Nice beer selection; Old Fashioneds were gross, but the Manhattans were decent.  Ambiance: Too many TVs, too many tables crowded into the space. Music was pretty lame and a bit too loud. Also seemed like it had the potential to get pretty douchey, especially around Cub season, but to be fair, there was only one table of drunkenly obnoxious people, and over a period of 3.5 hours, that's not too bad."
"Went to try it out shortly after they changed from Wheel House to The Butcher's Tap because we live in the neighborhood. First of all, I have never sent a meal back to the kitchen in my life. Never and I'm in my mid 30s. Until this place. Ordered their veggie burger. It didn't appear to be cooked - mushy sweet potatoes and not palatable. I showed the waitress who took it back. She brought another one - same problem. I showed waitress and told her I couldn't eat it. A man came over - never introduced or identified himself - maybe a manager? I don't know but I am assuming he worked there. He suggested that when I order the veggie burger, I ask to have it cooked a certain way because that is much better (what? if you know it is better than the mush you serve, why not cook ALL of them like that?). At no point, did anyone, not the waitress or the man who talked to us, apologize for my experience or inconvenience. I ordered something different  - a sandwich - to go, because I was ready to leave and my husband had finished his meal a long time ago. When I got home, there was a hair in my sandwich. Yup, that's way too many strikes. One bad dish at a new place could be redeemed by good customer service. But bad dish AND indifferent customer service? Nope. We'll be spending our money somewhere else. Never again."
"Stopped in on a Friday night for after dinner drinks. Party of 4, we were able to find a table quickly although it was very crowded. Ordered drinks; had good service. We were asked to change tables as we were in the waiters walk way, don't leave a table there.... End of evening, splitting bill 4 ways. Not sure why this happens, waiter chooses one persons card to run for the entire table and then runs everyone else's cards. I have now been waiting all weekend and into 2 business days to have my funds cleared. I choose my place of business carefully and while good food and great service are huge considerations, charging me $70 extra tops everything."
Waited over 45 minutes for a hamburger on more than one occasion. Food is good but not sure it's worth the wait.
"After checking this place out for the first time over the weekend, I saw something mentioned in the very first review for the Butcher's Tap that I feel is worth reiterating so it doesn't get lost to time: they charge pint prices for 12-ounce pours, which is equal parts lame and shady. They have a decent beer list, but I can't imagine ever going back to a place that thinks $7 for a 12-ounce draft is an acceptable business practice."
"With a name like Butcher's Tap, I wasn't really sure what to expect when coming here. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised! I came here on a Tuesday evening for trivia night and there was quite a good mix of people there. It was pretty full for a Tuesday night, but I was able to score a good seat at the bar. The trivia was fun and they give out free drinks for winners of bonus questions. The prize for winning trivia is a $40 gift card to Butchers. Not too shabby! Oh, and their drinks were strong. I love me some strong drinks.I hadn't eaten dinner yet, so I ordered their macaroni and cheese. It was delicious! Not too yellow, more like white-cheesy macaroni. They gave really good portion sizes, which I was pleased with. You usually expect crappy fried food at most bars, so this was a treat. The bartender was super nice too. Haven't met many bartenders around here that I can actually say that about. Even more props to him because he was running that very busy bar all by himself that night. I loved the atmosphere and laid back, fun vibe of this place. I will definitely be coming back!"
"Great menu and atmosphere, all brand new construction and so many taps."
"Great menu, attentive wait staff, FANTASTIC beer selection, and a great atmosphere.  It's definitely worth a try!"
Good quality pub grub. The Mrs said the cheese curds where the best she'd ever had. Meatball sub was good.Good atmosphere.The name reminds me of pub's back in England so bonus star for that.
I try so hard not to write negative reviews but this place was terrible. We came in for lunch today because we had heard the food was really good. We ordered out meal and then proceed to wait an HOUR...we had our 2 kids with us. The waitress never bothered to provide an app or anything at all except 'Sorry the kitchens backed up'. Maybe you should tell customers that when they sit down to eat instead of waiting 45 minutes to say something. We finally left...food never actually showed up. Never going back to this place again.
"I am very excited to update my previous 1-star review. Less than 2 weeks after the original review, The Butcher's Tap has updated their operations to reflect the feedback that I, and 2 other reviewers, left on Yelp. It's great to know that the management is willing to actively incorporate the viewpoint of their patrons to improve the customer experience. I will be back again very soon. Thanks, and cheers!"
I'm a craft beer nerd and baseball aficionado. Most of the wrigleyville haunts are full of frat guys getting toasted and the bars around the stadium cater to that crowd with light beer and fried generic food.  I am SO glad I found this haven only a short walk away.  Great beer selection and fresh tasty food.  If you like hand cured sliced meats and cheeses and craft beer this is your place.  Service was excellent also with a bartender that asked each persons name and used that to ID is instead of taking our credit card.
"Just going to keep it short and simple. I've lived in the area for 2 years now, and love everything southport has to offer. I've been to the Butchers Tap over a hand full of times now, and this is not counting back when it was Wheel House. But still always run into the same problems great food, great beer section, but the service is always below average. Watch out for the blonde meat head bartender who won't give you the time a day unless you're one of his buddy's or some bimbo. My roommate and I thought we would try some new beers and grab a bite for the Hawks game. After sitting down at the bar, we didn't receive any type of greeting besides a literal toss of menu for both of us to share. Finally when he decided to approach us all he had to say was ""you know what want?"" Other then that he would just give us a stare to see if we needed a beer. Other staff members brought out food and checked in to see if everything was alright. I rarely tip below 20% but this guy came off very rude, so I only tipped 15% which I wouldn't have done, but this has been multiple times at this bar were the service just isn't quite right. Still worth going in for the food and beer, but it's basically a coin toss on service."
"This place has made a change for the Better! Great food! Try the dry rubbed wings! The fried green tomato salad is amazing, the server even suggested adding chicken! I suggest that too. I'm not a ""beer person"" but this made me realize maybe I am, I'm just not a your typical ""miller, blue moon, angry orchard"" type of beer person! The bartender asked my flavor preference and whipped up a TASTER FLIGHT with LOCAL CHICAGO beer! Very impressed! They seem to be doing a lot more ""fun"" things... Beer and dinner pairings, wine tasting, oscar parties, looking forward to making the time to attend one with some friends. I suggest not passing this spot up! You won't regret it. There is something for everyone here wether it's beer, burgers, wine, meats & cheeses, and even spicy ketchup! ;)"
