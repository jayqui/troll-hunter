Little Bad Wolf
"When the boyfriend and I saw pictures of tacos that other Yelpers had posted, I knew I wanted--nay, needed--to eat at LBW. The liquor and beer lists are impressive and the bar and waitstaff were all very nice-- when I asked about a particular beer (Sweet Action by Sixpoints) the bartender said if I didn't like it, he'd drink it. Guess what! I liked it. But what I really liked were the tacos. I had to have a fish taco and a potato taco and the boyfriend ordered some baos and, well, we ended up sharing all of it and ordering more because it was all so insanely delicious, including the elotes, which were kind of spicy but really, really tasty. I have a feeling this is going to be a regular spot for us."
"we came for dinner on the sunday night and didn't wait to sit down. We orderedpork baoslittle burgerbad burgerwolf burgerI thought the burgers were ok, slightly greasy. The bao was ok, not worth the money."
"They got the bad right. Four of us came here last night and none were impressed. We shared the chips, guac, salsa, and pico, and thought the chips were delicious, but everything else was just okay. We ran out of chips with half of our salsa & pico left so we asked for more ...that would be an uncharge of $3. Seriously? For chips? Maybe give us enough to begin with!My boyfriend ordered a fish taco and the elotes. His $4+ taco was tiny and not very good. It's a good thing he didn't get the 3-4 tacos recommended to make a meal. The elotes were better, but didn't exactly taste like elotes. Unlike the taco, my salad was huge, but tasted just okay. I actually wanted to try a burger, but unfortunately, unlike even the lowliest joints, they don't substitutes the meat patty with any veggie alternative, so I was forced to choose from their very limited selection of non-meat options. The service was as mediocre as the food. We waited, and waited, and waited, for everything. At one point, we sat there and watched our waiter sit at a table texting for at least a good 5 minutes while we waited to ask for the bill. I definitely won't be back. The Adriatic Cafe and Tanoshii are just across the street, and they offer much better food. Hell, Subway is right next door! We probably should've just gone there."
"This proved to be an amazing find for not only me, but the two friends I was with, also! The alcohol selection was just amazing, and the menu was smaller, but carried all of the essential grill food, in addition to a few seafood items. There proved to be three separate pages, with what must have been size 8 font, to their beer, whiskey, and wine selections. The atmosphere was relaxed, and inviting, also, and the playlist going throughout the evening only helped fuel a relaxed, enjoyable summer evening out. The staff was also amazingly friendly and willing to help in a moment's notice or less. It is highly recommended, and I am already looking forward to my own return!"
"This place is a favorite date night for the hubby and I! The food is beyond mouth tantalizing! I've had the baos, tacos, chicken, Mac n' cheese, and my fav-the mussels!!!!!  Oh my God, those have to be a recipe from heaven! The drinks are delish too! The ABSOLUTE BEST Russian Mules! The decor and ambience is trendy & symbolic! LOL! Literally! The restrooms feel homey and are clean! They even personalize it w/quality hand sis and lotion! The owners are so down to earth & hospitable, and bartenders are quality servers! The only flip side is this place is small! Hopefully they'll buy out the spacing next door because an expansion is mandatory! This place is so happening that it gets crowded, but that's because of the superb service!"
"Ok... I get it; dealing with a bunch of gays for someone's birthday isn't everybody's idea of a terrific time. We all show up at different times-at different levels of intoxication-and we are more interested in talking to our one-year-older pal than figuring out what we want, post coconut curry mussels...But, come on. Not everyone is in the industry. We all know how annoying those people are who put one cocktail on a card and close it out. We all know how obnoxious it is to have to subtract an amount from the tab and split the difference down two cards. BUT, we work in the service industry. Shit happens, and it's as annoying to you as it is to us-a PART of the group. Disappointed in being reprimanded for not schooling the server on how the checks would be split as my best friend's pals slowly filed in over the course of the night. He shouldn't have to see anyone counting dollars; monetizing their contribution to his birthday shenanigans. The food is great... But not worth being talked to like you're worthless by pretentious servers who forget they're on the border of Andersonville and Edgewater."
"QUICK HIT (Must Go vs. Consider Checking It Out vs. Pass/Don't Bother): Consider Checking It Out - 3.5 StarsAtmosphere: Great ambience. Despite the frenzy of people and loud acoustics, the restaurant maintains a seemingly laid back, anything goes feel. Both separate table seating and communal seating, TVs that flank both ends of the restaurant, and bar seating make for a social setting.Food: -Cocktail options were excellent. My Moscow mule was really well made.-For an appetizer, we ordered the Chips & Guac. Both the chips and guacamole were made in-house (along with the salsa accompaniments), were fresh, and absolutely delicious. Great portion size too - they didn't skimp on the chips, so easily shareable for several people.-Also ordered several of the tacos and baos. Honestly, these were mediocre. I thought the combination of ingredients looked great on the menu, but unfortunately the flavors of each item weren't realized in the dish presented. -My entree was the steak frites. Steak was cooked to perfection (10 oz.) and sat upon a huge pile of fries. Huge, as in so many fries, that there wasn't even room to cut my steak. I'm not complaining. The fries were crispy and seasoned nicely. I ate all of them. Oops.All in all, the meal was quite good.Service: Our waitress was awesome. She was friendly and helped us navigate the drink and food menu. She made sure we were well taken care of. Much appreciated.Recommended? Yes. Andersonville is a great place to be, and this is a nice addition to the community."
"I've been reading great reviews about this place for a while now and we decided to head over there Saturday night to see what the hub bub's about.. glad we did :DSo get there around 8:30pm, it was PAAAAACKED!  We had 6 people in our party, so it was going to be about an hour wait.  The place is small, its honestly not big at all.  If you have a huge party, you will probably need to wait until one of the bigger tables is completely empty.  Besides that, I really could not find anything bad about this place.  I can't wait to see it when it gets nice out.  I know its going to be even harder to get a seat then.  but we will give it a shot.Saul, one of the owner's was a real cool cat.  He got us seated as soon as our table was available, he was really nice and accommodating.  He checked up on us and thanked us for coming in.  The decor is cool, you'll see wolf paintings and a really neat red riding hood painting, very unique.  The tables are plain wooden tables, communal seating and a few 2 seaters.  The bar has some seats as well.Drinks were exceptional, I must commend the bartenders, they make some mean drinks.  They have a great selection of all sorts of spirits.  I stuck with a delicious Manhattan.  Brother in-law ordered old fashioneds all night and they looked great, might have to try one next time.  I did taste the Green Eyes drink and it was on point.The foooooood! wow, we started with a pound of fried shrimp.  They were perfect, not rubbery, big and the batter was nice and crispy.  Reminded me of some good ol' south side shrimp fries from back in the day, but turned up a notch.  i had to try one of those baos after seeing them in pictures on here.  I tried the BBQ pork bao, the pork was crispy and saucy, the bun soft and fluffy like a cloud, i could have devoured a dozen of those.   Then I moved on to the Three Little burgers... i only ate 2.  those burgers were big for being ""little""  oh and i upgraded to mac and cheese.  I think its the best mac N cheese i have had ... seriously.   i know thats a bold statement.. but it is.  I inhaled that...  I tasted a few fries and those were great too.. i was watching the guy in the back smashing potatoes through the manual slicer, explained it all.  This place is great.. and to make it even more perfect.... they played amazing hip hop the time i was there.. whaaaat!  Nas, EPMD, lauryn hill... whaaa! Where was i!? I was in heaven.. Saul keep it up buddy!  i will be back soooon! too soon! thanks for a great experience.do it! do it!"
"Sooooooo good. Please for yourself and to keep it in the menu, order their Mac n' cheese! Best I've had in this city! We will be back!"
"Came in for a date night and I must say I definitely want to come back and check out more things on their menu.  It's a small place in Andersonville with a fun crowd - locales and foodies alike.  We sat at a small table near the door, and shared a variety of small and not-so-small plates.  Two different types of bao (I'm pretty sure we had fish and... maybe shrimp? I don't remember now..), a side of elotes, and the entree portion of mac n cheese.My hands down favorite was the elotes - roasted corn kernels in a creamy delicious sauce topped with fried avocado.  Although fried avocado is pretty much a piece of fried heaven, it was actually not even necessary - the corn would have been totally wonderful without it. But I still ate the shit out of the avocado, because I mean c'mon, fried avocado.Drinks there were on point as well - I had a few old fashioneds that were quite delicious.  Will be coming back soon to try their other menu options."
"We went to Little Bad Wolf on a nice Friday night. We were quoted a 30 minute wait for a table for two. They took our number (big plus) and said they would text when our table was ready. We got the text just over 15 minutes after we put our name in. Seating is mostly communal, but we didn't feel cramped or too close to the party next to us. We started with two cocktails. I had taken a sip of mine when a worker came over with a drink and said the bartender had forgotten an ingredient in my drink and she wanted me to have it the correct way. So I got the correct drink in addition to the one with the forgotten ingredient. For food we tried just about everything. We had tacos, a bao, a burger and mac and cheese. It was all so delicious. I had the shrimp taco and fish taco. They were two of the best tacos I've had in a long time. The mac and cheese was so so good!  We loved our evening here and can't wait to go back!"
"Gluttonous. We had the chips, salsa, and guac and the mini burgers. The food is so good. The difference between four and five stars for me: the grease needed taming. The burgers just needed to rest before putting them on the bun, and the chips were glistening. I wanted to eat it because it was good. I didn't want to eat it because it was obvious I shouldn't. I will be back, though!Edit: I should also mention -- they had a pretty decent beer list."
"Pretty nice and seems quite new. Wonderful staff. Very cute but quite small. They don't take reservations as they have only eight tables. The Mac & Cheese is noteworthy. Also enjoyed the Pork Bao. I mean really,  anyplace that delivers a well made Boa in Andersonville deserves at least 4 stars!"
"Nice Baos, Good Salad, Excellent Macaroni and Cheese. If I was there to drink it would've been better, but it was a nice dinner indeed."
"Came back to try a salad like I said I would and just wasn't impressed. I got the chicken Caesar, it was huge, but the dressing was bland and the chicken was over salted. Got the crab cake again because it's great, but realized that's it's just not $12-great. At this point there really isn't anything else of interest to me on the menu so it might be my last visit. Again, incredible service, cool atmosphere, solid beer list. Maybe I'll just come here for drinks sometime."
"It's hot and new for the neighborhood, so that means that this artisanal hipster cocktail bar with craft brews, communal tables, small bites and even those de riguer bare Edison light bulbs can be standing room only. Both times I was here, I sat at the bar. I like the dark, dry brunette bartender. Her wry sense of humor and no-nonsense approach to service are a delight. I'll rave for some of the house cocktails: El Chupacabra was a rum concoction with smoked spices and packs a delicious punch. I also loved the Green Eyes vodka option with celery and pear. They play special attention to ice here as well. The four drinks I've tried had four different styles from crushed, to small and medium cubes, to an improbably large baseball in my manhattan. Everything worked except that baseball, which struck me as silly.The generous basket of fries I shared the first time were extra brown (great!) but all between one and two inches long. I'm not a size queen, but those were too short to dip in the ketchup. I went for dinner and drinks the second time. I don't think they take reservations and there was one table available, but the host told me we should eat at the bar or next to a couple of people at the end of a bench. This time, we tried the chips and guac, which were very tasty since the chips were house made, and I really liked the tomatillo salsa. The shrimp bao were a great value and super tasty. The crab cake was shared and we both loved it. We also tried the lumpia, a Filipino pork filled thumb-sized fried spring roll served with a sweet spicy dip and loved them. Everything is designed for small plates and sharing. The vibe is kinda dark and Victorian. It really works, because as unoriginal as the concept is, the execution is spot on, the drinks are delicious and potent, the food is yummy and right for the times, and the crowd is cool."
"Baos, Baos, Baos, Think of a little wolf pup barking in your ear. Bao Bao Bao! Incase you missed it. They have great baos here! Be weary though, Pork, Steak and Fish all kinda suck. I did one of each as it was my first visit. The show stoppers here are the Chicken and Shrimp. Do 3-5 of the boas pending your hunger level and you won't regret it. The shrimp especially stand out. Very refreshing and tangy.This place is also awesome for their extensive bar with some pretty interesting cocktails. Notably the one I go. (Green Eyes) it's kind of like a more subtle mojito, though a lot more refreshing with a sort of non-minty minty flavor. @ $10-11 each (can't remember which) it's worth noting you can rack up quite the tab if you are intending to pound them back.My lady had the Half fried chicken with a side of bacon mac and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were interesting kinda tasted like their maybe some type of heavy whipped cream in there with maybe Gruyère cheese? Very smooth and creamy. The chicken was a half or a whole chicken which was nicely fried and very bready, but not overly done. It was well spied and seared so as to lock in a good bit of moisture in the meat. Delicious! The Mac and cheese wasn't really my thing. And it should be noted I LOVE Mac N' Cheese. However my lady loved it and thought it was some of the best she's ever had. Eh, different strokes I guess? All in all, two signature entrees, drinks, tax and tip it was $60 for 2. Not too bad for an early dinner in a trendy part of Chicago."
"I am SOOOOO glad I finally came here and checked this place out. I'm obsessed with the decor, the ambience, and the energy from this place. Service is so attentive and prompt. We tried the guac&chips which was superb. The chips were fresh off the fryer! ++++++ from me! I also got the shrimp taco (honey bacon dressing, pickled cabbage) which was amazing. My friend ordered fries and a salad which the portions are HUGE so def know you're getting your money's worth. They have a great drinks menu also! I am def going to come check this place out again very soon!"
"So delicious!!! Loved everything about this place. The bao's are amazing and the cheeseburger is out of this world. The mac n cheese is so tasty! The cocktails were very good and they have an extensive beer selection. The decor is chill, hip and relaxed. Great music and nice staff. I will be back! My only negative comment is that there is only have one bathroom, and at times the line got pretty long, which was a bit obnoxious."
"If I could eat only one item from the Little Bad Wolf menu, it's a side of elotes.  I've never liked corn as much as I liked this dish.  The elote is a dish of corn covered in a creamy sauce, cheese, and spices, topped with two slices of deep fried avocado.  It's perfect comfort food.The menu is simple but provides a good variety.  Tacos and bao can be ordered individually, so I basically crafted my own meal.  I love the bao, it's soft and sort of sweet, a delicious alternative to a corn tortilla.  Surprisingly, my favorite was the steak taco.  The steak was tender and had a lot of flavor -  I should have ordered it as a bao!  The best bao was definitely the chicken with peanut sauce.My only dislike was the fries.  They taste good, but they are cut so tiny that it's difficult to dip the fries into the sauce!  Also, a ""large"" serves more than two people - you've been warned!Wash it all down with something from their beer list like a Sofie or one of their unique cocktails.Although Little Bad Wolf is a bit far from home for me, it was worth the trek (we also did some shopping and later went to a bar in the area).  Getting THIS far north in Chicago is a rarity, so we also drove through some new and unfamiliar areas which I particularly enjoy.  Street parking is available in the area, but there is also a parking lot behind the building which is free.Don't judge Little Bad Wolf by its cover - even though it's wedged into a strip mall next to a Subway, the inside screams ""chic"" and ""hip"" with the Edison lights dangling from the ceiling and the blue velvet tufted sofa booth lining the walls.  The restaurant is complete with distressed wood tables and a copper bar lit up like an art piece.Price-wise, it really depends how hungry you are but I'd say the average diner will probably spend $12-15/person.  So it's time to get off the beaten path, head to Little Bad Wolf, and see what the neighborhood has to offer."
"Came here yesterday and while looking at the menu, I wanted to try quite a few food items.   I had two specialty cocktails that were made perfectly.   I had Green Eyes which was fresh and the Chupacabra cocktail which was spicy because of the pepper and I LOVED it.  I enjoyed the music they played.  Mixture of hip hop and rock.The staff was friendly and very attentive.  I will definitely go back.  Make sure to try the fish taco and baos."
Favorite restaurant in Andersonville! Such a cool and trendy environment. Salads are huge! Go immediately!
Amazing food and drinks and I can't believe the kitchen is open so late. I was able to eat one of the best meals of my life after midnight!
"Little Bad Wolf is one of my favorite midweek dinner spots; it's never too crowded (maybe that's changing now that it's warming up) and there's a nice buzz in the atmosphere. People rave about the tacos and baos, but to be perfectly honest I've had neither, nor anything else, because the burger is so effing good (and it doesn't require a ridiculous wait). Unfortunately, the fries do nothing for me, they're just not my style. The drink list is solid: full of craft this and that, bitters here and there. Since I usually don't notice the crappy music that's playing anywhere, I should point out that the soundtrack here is always spot on."
"Well, I was disappointed - sorry, LBD - I do love the space!I would give the cocktails 4, and the service was good.  Specifically, the green eyes was tasty, and I also tried two of the rye drinks (sorry, names are escaping me) and they were well executed, although small and quite frankly a little more sweet than they needed to be, hence 4 stars.   Service was prompt and helpful, and the bartender the night we went was approachable and smiling.Food, however, suffered. The bao (fish & steak) were quite frankly bland, and on a bed of wilted greens.  The lumpia were a huge disappointment - if you want good lumpia, go to Uni-mart on Dempster.  These were mushy inside, oily, and flavorless and served on the same blah bed of greens - there was just something awfully unappetizing about those greens.  If the bao and lumpi had anything going for them, I honestly wouldn't even comment, but it just added to the bland.We split the wolf burger - I really wish it didn't have american cheese or you could at least choose something else.  It was salty (in a good burger way), and tender, but really, nothing particularly spectacular.  I'd go to Edzos instead...  The fries were overdone and there weren't many of them (although frankly I didn't need a lot more, so probably ok).So, yeah, meh.  I WOULD go back for just a drink or two, as the space is small, intimate and interesting, but it's just not that great."
"So we weren't sure this was going to be a good experience or not....went on a Monday night and it was, to our surprise, pretty packed. We put our names on the list and went to the bar. It's a tiny place so everywhere we stood we felt like we were in the way. When we were finally seated, it took quite some time for anyone to acknowledge us, however, once Zach greeted us, everything vastly improved. He gave us fantastic service and Everything we tried, we loved! We had several of the tacos, a burger, the Mac and cheese, and the elotes. Wonderfully delicious!"
"I'd had Little Bad Wolf on my to-do list for quite a while - it's featured pretty prominently on the front page of Chicago Yelp, next to big names like Girl and the Goat - and with 4.5 stars after over 100 reviews, expectations were sky-high. The verdict? They delivered on some fronts but not others. But the food was good enough that I'm happy giving them a solid 4 stars.We came in at around 7pm on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy, but we only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a seat. We ended up sitting at the bar (though we were the second party in line, so I doubt it would've taken much longer to get a table) because we like chatting with the bartenders. The only problem with sitting at the bar here is that people who are waiting for tables usually order a drink while waiting, so they hover around you while ordering their drinks and it's a bit claustrophobia-inducing.I don't know how the Yelp business description has this place listed as being ""average"" noise. It is SO LOUD in there. My dining companion and I had to shout in order to hear each other, despite sitting next to one another. So where LBW is lacking for me is the ambiance - which is honestly just a personal preference. It was a little too loud-drunk for me.All that being said, the food that we ordered was actually quite good. We ordered the pork and shrimp tacos (both amazing) as well as the pork and fish baos (pork was really good, fish was meh in my opinion). One of my favorite dishes we had was actually a side dish of elotes - their adaptation of a Mexican street food. It's basically grilled corn kernels with various toppings/condiments. Amazing. My dining companion had the Bad Burger with a side of fries, which I tried a bit of - the burger was decent, though probably nothing to write home about, but the fries were really good. They tasted like McDonald's fries in the best way possible (I know, you're rolling your eyes at me, but I actually freaking love McDonald's fries, so I completely mean this as a compliment).Overall, I'd come back for the food but not the atmosphere. If you're in the mood for a relaxing, cozy dinner, I'd skip it. But if you're up for good food served in a loud and rowdy environment, you could do a lot worse than LBW."
"I've really enjoyed this place since it first opened. It's right on my way home, so I'm thankful to have a great option for classy food and drinks right in my home neighborhood. It's definitely a welcome addition to andersonville's other restaurants, and even raises the bar a bit. I found it a bit odd that there was pasta in the salad, but that was merely my own not reading the menu properly. The vibe here is very rugged and sexy with dark wood and copper in the design of the place it really feels like an old tavern melded with an industrial almost masculine vibe. The craft cocktails are excellent. I forget the name of the drink but it was the tequila craft cocktail. It was light and refreshing."
We had the best experience at this restaurant!  We ordered the burger with Mac n cheese and also the steak and pork boas.  We both named it the best burger we have ever had!  The specialty cocktails were worth a try.  I recommend the old fashioned.  This place put a lot of work into the small things.  Fresh ingredients and neat ice cubes.  Atmosphere was relaxed.  We will definitely be back!
"When Au Cheval has a 2.5 hour wait. take the trip to Little Bad Wolf as their burger is just as amazing though lacks the dijonaisse and red onion. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy her tacos - one fish, one shrimp, and one potato. We had two servers - one super nice and accommodating. The other, rough around the edges but polite enough.They have an excellent beer list and some of the house cocktails read very refreshingly tasty. I had to drive so I stuck with the root beer - yes it has alcohol. LBW is a small space and seats about 25 people not including the bar or outside so it may be best to go at off-peak hours."
"Great drinks, my sister and I tried the bad moon rising and the little bad mule. The staff is super attentive and the food is delicious."
"Wow. For a small space, Little Bad Wolf is bringing big flavors.The drinks are lovely - inventive and classic. Plus the beer list is legit - from ciders to stouts to 10% ""root beer."" I don't eat beef so I can't talk to the burger (which my friends love), but the baos, tacos and mac n cheese are top notch.I've never had to wait for a table but I can imagine it gets quite busy at certain times here. Go for lunch or an early dinner to avoid a crunch of people."
"Oh my god the mac and cheese! Probably the best I've had in Chicago and second best I've had anywhere. We ordered a large one for the table and it was a great decision. Full of flavors, very tasty.I also had a burger, which was tasty although not extraordinary. Fries were good and the sauces that came with were tasty.The bao and tacos were fine (no one was unhappy, just not ecstatic like we were about the mac), but the surprise star was the lumpia. One member of our group said he would have happily just eaten those for dinner. The elotes were also quite good, although I only wanted a couple bites and we wound up putting most of it on the bao/tacos (which worked pretty well). Alcohol list was extensive and had something for everyone. My only complaint: an hour wait for Thursday night dinner, and they don't take reservations. Get a bigger space! Take reservations! Something so I don't have to wait this long for that amazing Mac and cheese."
"Insanity. In a good way. There's a ton of amazing reviews here - so I won't repeat all that's been reported - but I wanted to be sure to put in my vote for this place. Everything is impeccable and fun and different. Aville has a hard time keeping delicious and interesting places open, so I hope this one makes it through!They just added a beautifully adorned patio in the front - what are you doing still reading this - go there now!"
"Little Bad wolf has a magnificent modern but laid-back decor.  Their whiskey list is impressive and extensive, and so is the wine list.  They have a creative and well executed cocktail list.  Little Bad Wolf also has a well curated draft menu of 14 different (mostly) rotating beers.  They cover most styles of beer with local breweries and some pretty stellar choices.  I'm a little bugged by the huge bottle list.  Fifteen bottled IPAs is unnecessary and isn't doing anybody any good.  But, overall they have a sincerely great bar program.  There were two of us and we had a cocktail each, a beer each, the Charcuterie board, and 4 Bao Tacos.  My old fashioned was spot on!  The Charcuterie board was humungous and delicious (it was also $24, so it should have been).  We had a couple of local beers that I hadn't had the chance to try yet, and the Bao tacos were enjoyable.  I will have to come back for a burger.  LBW gets crowded because it's small, but it's crowded because it's good.  Try coming here on a weeknight for a more intimate experience.  It also looks like they have a reservable large table in the middle of the space."
"I love, love, love Little Bad Wolf.  It truly is the exact type of restaurant I would open if I ever chose to.  To set the scene, The Little Bad Wolf has a hip, moody vibe.  I chose to have my birthday dinner there and was thrilled to hear late 90s/2000s hip hop playing.  I mean, it is like they were inside of my Ipod!  The crowd was a mix of hip 30 somethings so I felt right at home.  There was even a couple there with their baby. To eat, my guests and I ordered the chips and guacamole to start things off.  My husband and I LOVE Mexican food and both agreed these were the best tortilla chips we have ever tasted.  They were crisp and salted generously with salt but not overly so.  As an entree, I order the steak bao, chicken boa and the shrimp taco with HONEY BACON MAYO (what?!)! My husband ordered a steak bao, a pork bao and the shrimp taco. My friend ordered a steak bao and totally raved about the potato taco she had.  We were so torn as to which sides to get so we practically ordered one of each.  The three of us enjoyed the Mac and cheese, Brussels Sprouts and creamy elotes. Our table got a bit crowded.  The Little Bad Wolf has a very generous wine, cocktail, whiskey and beer list.  I enjoyed a refreshing margarita with my meal.  Because it was my birthday dinner, our awesome waitress Shameeka gave me a shot of tequila to cap the night off.  The only things I wish the restaurant had was a dessert menu.  I am not holding that against them though, my party and i went down the street to George's for some yummy ice cream after."
"Took a trip over to Andersonville & found ANOTHER gem. Cozy, cool & delicious! The bartender Troy is cool as they come & one hell of a tender.  The menu selection was eclectic & delicious. Perfect mix of small plates & entrees without being an overwhelmingly enormous menu. Craft beers & cocktails house inspire & rotating regularly. Excellent mussels, Mac & cheese worth the mention. The best Baos I've ever had & killer tacos. They're on my new hot spots list & im happy to have them close."
"I had high hope for this place, but was just disappointed. The decor looked nice and the food concept was intriguing. But the execution was just not there. The food fell flat and didn't live up to the description on the menu. Maybe they had an off night, maybe that was the usual, but I think I'll use my calorie allotment at another place. The beer list was its bright spot. So maybe go for a drink while you wait for a table at another place."
"Came here for lunch when I was in the neighborhood working. Had a mixed experience, but I think maybe that's because I wasn't here drinking or over-indulging. Some thoughts: (1) the bar itself is really cool looking. Dark and copper. Very cool. (2) the bartender was handsome and very nice. (3) the salad I ordered was pretty bland and underdressed. I think this isn't a ""salad"" place. (4) the buns my husband ordered looked better but he wasn't ""blown away.""(5) the elotes were not the best I've had--overly spicy. They made me sneeze which hasn't happened to me before!Would like to give this place another try, perhaps during an evening for drinks and snacks. Don't come for the salads"
"My newest favorite restaurant in Andersonville: trendy interior, attentive staff, and excellent food. I had the chopped salad, which was too much too eat and very well prepared.I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
"Extensive list of wines/beers. If you're looking to try a combo of baos and tacos, three is plenty for one (with a side of fries). Three sliders with fries: 4(The burgers were deliciously greasy, but could've used less grease; fries were crispy, thin, and good for two).Baos: 4Steak and chicken baos were really good, but I preferred the tacos over the rice buns (bao).Tacos: 5Steak and chicken both equally great. Beer:"
Chicken Bao and Pork Bao blew my mind. PAIRS NICELY WITH THE barrel Manhattan mm mmm mmmmmm
Good size portions for sharing. Great drinks. Can be loud but it's a regular place for us if we need something we know will be good.
"Good drinks, decent burgers. There are better burgers in the city but this place was fine. The staff was nice and everything was reasonably priced. I didn't have a bad experience by any means but given the copious amount of burger places in the city, I don't think I will come running back soon."
"Not a bad restaurant to visit, just off Clark.  After about a 1.2 mile walk, I ordered some lumpia (a different twist, the meat was more shredded than traditional lumpia, but still delicious) and the steak tacos (basically 2 saucer-sized tortillas with a bit of meat and vegetables on them), but the portions were quite adequate for me after that walk.It's an intimate environment, not terribly big, the bar is about a quarter the size of the number of tables in the restaurant.  They do have an extensive wine list as well as hard liquor, but neither one were my ""cup of tea"", so to speak"", during my stay.  I would return if I had a craving for that lumpia, for sure."
"This place is an absolute must visit in every way possible. Little Bad Wolf's burgers are right up there if not better than those served at Au Cheval, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning. Made the executive decision to go with the Wolf burger , a triple cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon, and wished I had ordered a second to take home. The pork bao came coated in a barbecue sauce that I wish came bottled, it was so good. Elotes as a starter dish came with deep fried avocado, a nice touch that added a lot to an already fantastic appetizer. Service can make or break places like this, but the bartenders and wait staff absolutely know what they're doing, being attentive without being over the top. Speaking of the bartenders -- the cocktail menu is, like the burgers, outstanding. Definitely worth the trek to Andersonville to check this place out."
"Yeehaw! Great drinks, tacos, buns, and everything in between!Stopped by for a bite with a friend and we did not wait for a table. We sat right at the bar and were served immediately. I got the Green Eyes drink because I'm a pansy when it comes to strong alcoholic drinks. This one was nice and refreshing!I really wanted tacos so I got the fish and al pastor. They really layer on the meats on those tacos A+We also split brussel sprouts and mac n cheese. Brussel sprouts had delicious bits of bacon and the mac and cheese was very creamy! I hate it when you order high end mac n cheese at restaurants and you can barely taste the 4 cheeses they put in there. I was very satisfied and maybe had more of my fair share of it :)Mussels come with a shit ton of toasted bread too and lots of sauce for dippin'.There were many more drinks to order and craft beers for that matter so I'll have to be back!Pricing is great here. Cheap drinks--think logan square prices almost."
"Solid 3.5, and I round down for Yelp purposes. I had dinner here on a Friday evening around 7:30. They quoted me 45 minutes, but no one in front of me wanted to sit at the community table, so I was able to sit there right away. This was awesome because the bar area was packed. A couple walked in right after me, and I assume they were also quoted 45 minutes for a 2 top. I checked my watch when I noticed them being seated, and their wait was just over an hour. But they had cocktails in hand and didn't look too upset. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but service was pretty subpar the entire night. We got waters right away, but then it took about 15 minutes for them to return to get the drink orders and apparently later in the evening they ran out of glassware, so drink orders were literally taking 30 minutes or more. Mind you, this is a pretty tiny restaurant. To top it off, the drinks weren't that great. The Old Fashioned was apparently pretty terrible according to my friend, and I tried a variety of drinks that were just ok but never what I was expecting and never balanced well.The food does better than the drinks though, and they have food runners, so it arrived hot. We tried 2 different tacos and two different baos. We also shared the slider plate with fries. I had the steak taco and the fish baos. The bao was definitely my favorite. The wasabi mayo and the bao itself was pretty delicious and the fish tasted fresh. I thought the burgers were pretty delicious as well even if they were a little greasy, but they're sliders so I expected as much. Fries were good, but I hated the dipping sauce and would have asked for plain ketchup if our server ever came to check on us.All in all, good food, but their servers and bartenders were definitely in the weeds on that Friday night. I would come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so, and I would want to make sure it was a week night hoping that the crowds are smaller resulting in better service."
"This place has a cool vibe--trendy, funky, cozy. In a different review, someone wrote that ""it was a perfect place for a casual, unplanned date,"" and I'll have to second that. It was a Tuesday night but we still had to wait for table, which was fine because we just stood at the bar with some drinks until it was ready (margarita and old fashioned... both good). But just know that it is a popular place with a decent weeknight crowd.My boyfriend and I ordered a lot of food (we decided to go for an impromptu celebration outing in honor of him finishing up grad-school), and it was all delicious and exciting. (Note: we eat vegetarian/fish out, so I can only speak to those items). What we loved in particular:- Potato tacos (was skeptical at first, but the blackened, smokey corn really added wonderful flavor and spice to the potatoes; also, I discovered I'm a big fan of cotija cheese. Like a cross between feta and parm almost).- Fish baos (the dough was perfectly fluffy. Inside with the fish was a slaw and wasabi mayo... yum).- Fried avocado (they called this side dish ""Elotes,"" which means corn on the cob. Basically, the dish was like the corn described above in the potato tacos with battered avocado on top. Uh.. heaven? Warning, this dish is big for a side, so we had a ton of leftovers. Which ended up being fine because I had deliciously creamy corn to take home, which made for a great lunch add-on the next day).- Mac and Cheese (without the bacon, of course, and it was still really, really good. I know, it's hard to go wrong with mac and cheese anyway, but this one was especially gooey and toasty).I didn't mention the fish tacos only because they weren't all that memorable. Would have gone for a second fish bao instead. A quick word to the wise: don't order the large size of frites for just 2 people. It's ginormous. I ate fries for lunch the next 3 days, not exaggerating. (Come on, the waitress should have warned us as well).In any case, overall, loved it. Will be back again for more."
"Little Bad Wolf is definitely my favorite restaurant in Andersonville. I have been here several times since the opening and I have never once been disappointed. as I work my way through the menu, everything I have ordered is spot on and absolutely delicious. I always start with a manhattan cocktail, which are crafted perfectly by each of their bartenders. The burgers are great, I love the tacos, and the salads are HUGE. The best part of this restaurant is the Mac and Cheese.. get it, seriously. The only complaint, if I had one, would be that it's a little small. Go early! Great Job LBW"
"This place is great and is increasing in popularity by the day.  The place is pretty small but the service is quick so tables turn over quickly.  Came here with 5 people told us it would be a 30 monite wait or so, grabbed a table by the bar where you can grab a drink drinkno problem.  Got sat in about 15 which was awesome.  Service is great, they seem really invested and interested in the food and drink the are putting out.  I had the bad burger, which was one of the better burgers i had in the city, and the baos looked so damn good i got the bbq pork one.  Didnt disappoint.  Ill be back."
"This place is great! So far, I've been once and have already been recommending Little Bad Wolf left and right. It has quickly become a neighborhood staple. We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed so we grabbed a couple drinks in the standing area prior to our meal. With two others, I shared the guacamole, burger, fish tacos, and macaroni and cheese - all fantastic. Next time I'd love to try the baos. Megan was our server and she made great recommendations. Even though it was a busy night, she really made sure our experience was the best. She told us about the Instagram @littlebadwolfchicago, so naturally I feel like I need to go back every time a picture pops up. All in all, great place, great food, great staff!"
"I finally got to come here to try the Bao tacos and that burger, after seeing all the pictures on Yelp and drooling. When we arrived we had to sit at the community table or the bar, we chose the table because no body was sitting there.  I hate sitting next to strangers when dining out, luckily nobody ever sat right next to us.  The only annoying thing was the couple that sat at the other end of the table kept staring at our food.  I just wanted to shout at her ""Has anyone ever told you staring at someone's food continuously is impolite!?""  Oh well enough of that let's talk food.We order the steak, pork, shrimp, and breaded fish bao tacos, and we each got the triple burger.The Bao tacos were really good and bursting with flavor with very fresh ingredients.  I highly recommend the shrimp Bao tacos, those were the best in my opinion.  The burger meat was delicious and oozing with melted cheese and a sunnyside egg to go with it.  What a creation, what a greasy one, what a delight!  This burger was so good it melted in our mouths and made us full as could be.  The skinny hand cut fries were to die for and the garlic aioli sauce was heavenly, but seriously, I did not even need it because those fries are the bomb and served in a wire basket!  I could eat those fries all freakin day!This place is small so get there early to avoid a wait, and get ready for community seating.  The owner was a good guy and asked how we liked the food, I told him I am giving a 5 star review, and I do not lie about things like that, so here it is the 5 star review, I will be back!"
"Stopped in over the weekend to check out the newer place in Aville.  I am in agreement with the other reviewers that this is a great addition to the neighborhood.They did a complete makeover from the Burger Philosophy days and added a bar.  The space is very accommodating and the service was very friendly.  Since we went mid afternoon it was not super crowded so we grabbed two seats at the bar.  There are 3 large tv's which 2 were showing sports and the 3rd CNN.  I do enjoy the fact that the news is on as you can catch up on current events while also catching a game and something to eat.We had the crab cake and fried shrimp.  Both were very good and the smaller sized (serving not shrimp size) was good enough for the two of us to share.  The people next to us had a burger, fries and the sprouts which all looked amazing.We will certainly be back.  I can see this place securing quite the following which may make it a little harder to grab a seat but it is good to see a successful business in the neighborhood."
"This place awesome!  Visiting my daughter from Florida.  Definitely recommend I had crab cakes, fried chicken with mashed and bacon gravy. Omg!Then a cheeseburger with onion straws bacon, egg and cheddar. Yum!"
"Visiting from out is state and this was the best stop of the trip. Food, service and atmosphere was amazing!!! Would recommend to anyone.  Bar tender Troy knocked our socks off. We declined out table so we could stay at the bar for dinner. Thanks Troy!"
"Very cute place and can get crowd during lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Great selection of beer and drinks.  For lunch we order the bad wolf burger, pork and fish bao, the shrimp taco, and elotes. We had all intention of order a salad but as the waiter said the salad are huge.. so as he was saying this I see this oversize pho bowl getting delivery to a family of 4 and say ok we will have to come back and try it next time. The elotes with the fried avocado was really rich but good. I think my favorite was the shrimp taco with the slaw and second would be the fish. My hubby said the burger was juicy but I didn't a chance for bite before he finish it."
"When Burger Philosophy closed, I was super sad.When Little Bad Wolf opened, I was super happy.I decided to have dinner there this past week.  When I walked in, I really loved what I saw.  The decor is amazing - industrial shabby.  And I am very happy in that type of space.The music was an eclectic mix, and played low enough to have conversations.  The lighting fixtures are Edison type bulbs hanging around the room on sparse cords.  Really smart looking.The true show stopper - the bar on the back wall.  It is pretty close to being a work of art.  So, like I said - I went for dinner.  To start - I ordered a manhattan.  My favourite drink - if a place messes it up, that is a measure of their worth to me.  It was brought over a few minutes later by a really charming waitress.  One sip - they nailed it.On to dinner - I ordered a burger and fries.  There was a lot more on the menu - but I was gaming for a burger and fries.  I'm not gonna lie. It was tasty!  And the fries were so good.Good food + good ambiance + good drinks = Matthew coming back again.Welcome to the hood, Little Bad Wolf.  I hope you're here for a long time."
"We came here after a day of golfing and did not expect what was going to happen. The food, service and libations are amazing here. The menu goes from tacos to triple stacked burgers. Two thumbs up to this joint! If you're ever in Andersonville, this is the way to go!"
"The atmosphere in little big wolf was unmatched by many restaurants. The decor was on point and inviting. My friend a I both ordered salads which had very large portions. The pork bao was flavorful and the fresh cut fries were well prepared. I wish I would have gotten a drink-- their drink menu looked amazing! Overall, I would definitely come back for the delicious food, friendly service, and what I hope will be a satisfying drink menu."
"So I officially need to put myself on Little Bad Wolf time out, because I definitely ate and drank wayyy too much when I was here... And then forgot the end of my evening. I came here with my husband and best friend and we tried to eat as much off the menu as we could.  I started with the El Chupacabre (spelling?) drink and it was amazing. A little smokey, a little spicy with a tad bit sweet and tart. It's was sooo good. My next drink was the Fraud or Fable and well... I don't remember much after that. I do remember how delicious it was, and since I especially like cocktails made with egg white, it really topped off my evening nicely. My husband ordered a half a dozen different beers and was definitely impressed with the selection. As I write this review I realize we both have a drinking problem, but that's besides the point. The service was on point. I can't remember our server's name, but she was tall and blonde and my husband kept saying she looked like me, but whatever, I was seeing double at that point and I'm pretty sure he was too. Anyway, she was good and knew her stuff. The bartender (Claire I think her name was?) was also very friendly and helpful when explaining the drinks. She even warned me about how strong they were... But I didn't listen. I never do. Back to the food. The mac and cheese. Wow. I could eat this every day of my life. Creamy and rich with a nice crunchy topping. So delicious. For dessert I had the brussel sprouts and fish taco. Both were so tasty and not overly filling, yet full of so much flavor it made my hangover the next day a little less brutal.I guess I had the mussels and a couple bites of burger at some point too, but I can't actually review either because I think I was a bit brown/blackout at that point. However, my husband and friend said they were amazing. I'll have to go again and report back. But then again, I'm putting myself on Little Bad wolf timeout... Or checking into rehab."
"Finally we get to try this place for the first time.  We were pleasantly greeted by a waiter and a bartender, or may be the owner?  The place looks modern chic.  They offer impressive selection of alcoholic beverages, much more than food selection.I missed the chix plate when they were Burger Philosophy.I have a bao fish sandwich and a fish taco.  They both are petite serving.  Both are quite good, except the taco shell was a bit too greasy, hence 4 stars instead of 5.All and all we will come back to try something else.  It is a nice place to hang out and catch up with friends.  Oh and the bathroom is nice and clean."
"Food: Whoohoo!Drink: Variety!Service: NiceAmbience: Cool and cozy!Price: Deal! We enjoy the food, drink and ambience. I would love to go back and taste different food."
"This is the restaurant that I wish existed in Lakeview (where I live). I was impressed with every part of the meal. Cocktails: top notch and excellent recommendations from our waiter. I had the El Chucabra which was one of the better mezcal cocktails I've had. The other bourbon drink was well rounded and not too sweet.My wife had the fried chicken and I had the burger w/ macaroni and cheese. Pretty standard bar food but well executed. I was a fan of the bun used and mayo on the burger while the chicken had an excellent breading.Finally, the ambiance might not be geared for families (loud rap music) but gave an overall cool vibe with lots of personality. I will go back."
"So good. Tacos, baos and corn are delish. Good beer selection too.  Beer a little expensive"
"Went with a friend on a typical Monday night. It wasn't crowded at all so we had immediate, fast, and friendly service!Food was delicious. We both got 1 Shimp Taco, 1 Pork Bao, and a side. I got the Elotess, my friend got the Fries. Everything was juicy and savory. It was even fulfilling when it seemed like we ordered nothing. Waitress was super friendly, and they made sure our water was filled!Highly recommend trying this place. Also a great place for drinks!!"
"One of my college friends was in town, so I wanted to show her a nice restaurant with some speciality cocktails. We walked in and it was crowded with little standing room. The host was very very rude. Rude enough that this is my first yelp review. I can't emphasize enough how rude he was, we almost left because of the way he spoke to us. That being said the cocktails were great, we loved our waitress and the Mac and Cheese was killer. Get rid of the host and you'd have an amazing establishment."
Outstanding upscale burgers and tacos. The buns they use are buttery and sweet- very nice touch. Cocktails are made with skill and the owners put forth a real effort of hand work on the floor keeping things rolling smoothly in busy times.
"Great little spot.Friendly staff, tasty food and nice drink selection for both beer & cocktails.The menu is simple, there is something for everyone and everything we order was great.  You can tell by the presentation that they've put a lot of thought into everything.The decor is casual and inviting.  The space is a nice mix of tables, high tops and bar space.Good addition to the area and will definitely be back."
"I'm very selective when it comes to mac and cheese, because it's my absolute favorite thing in the world next to bacon. Well... one bite into their Mac and Cheese and I don't know if I was hyper emotional that day, but it was so good I nearly shed a thug tear! I was not expecting the place to be as small as it was, and although we went during the day (2pm) we had to wait about 15-20min for a table. It wasn't a problem, because the staff kept checking up on us and making sure we were alright. I had the double pattie burger, with bacon and a fried egg. Let me tell you, this is my NEW FAVORITE BURGER! it has replaced Kumas, and Au Cheval. You can tell that LBW is about quality, because everything for their fries, ground meat, to their shrimp is really fresh and of course, yummy!I will definitely be back, my sister and I had a great experience. Our server Troy was very attentive, he made us feel at home. Thanks Little Bad Wolf!"
"Food was great - We got the chips/guac/salsa appetizer - chips were homemade and hot.I ordered the Bad Burger and it was phenomenal.  Mac n Cheese for the side, also delicious.The service was very friendly and prompt."
I honestly wish i could give this place more stars. Everything we ordered was extremely tasty! I ordered their Wolf Burger (3 patties) and was immediately excited once i saw the juices from the meat start to come out as i grabbed the burger as that's a sign for deliciousness. Even their tacos were great and packed with flavor. The best part of all of this was how cheap our bill came out to! Hands down this has to be the best place to eat and not worry about the bill at the end.
Best gastropub in Andersonville - the land of a thousand gastropubs.Our waiter was amazing. I'd trust her negotiating with North Korea based on how well I saw her handle some problem customers.
"Burger philosophy has reopened as this and the renovation is looking good. Higher ceilings, better seating arrangements, and more importantly has a full bar that's open late. I'm going so to go out on a limb and just say that the burger was one of the best I've ever had. It came with a dipping sauce that looked like 1000 island and a frying pan of fries. Overall this place was awesome and our server Dustin was great."
"Oh what a place, A Gem of Andersonville I should say. Awesome drinks, passionate staffs and delicious food. What more can you expect from a food/drink establishment. All of the drinks are made to perfection. I ordered Fish and Steak baos, Fried Shrimp and the Burger. Damn they were tasty, and the burger, it was just way up there. Staffs were very attentive and nice, and they made my visit to this place just perfect. Highly recommended and I will be back very soon. Kudos to LBW and I hope they continue the quality performance."
"I would also like to share my love of this place. I have learned the hard way to not throw out a five star review for a local place that I love until it proves itself a few times. I have been here about 10 times already and tried most of the menu and I can attest that this place is top notch! The owner is often there and it shows how much he cares about this place. The food is all so good with just the right balance of tried and true goodies (burgers and fries, mac and cheese and salads) and fun things that are less common (bao, lumpia and delicious white fish). A really great beer menu, and bartenders who know what's up! The cherry on top is the tiny but cozy space with really cool  yet comfy modern touches. Warning - This place is small and busy on weekends, so try to hit them up on an off time."
"This place is absolutely amazing!!! I had the burger, fries, and mac and cheese and everything was fabulous. The staff is wonderful-particularly Troy and Jeremy-who was an amazing bartender with awesome drink recommendations-try the Green Eyes! Best drink ever. The atmosphere in this place is super cool as well! I would recommend this place to anyone and have already told all my friends and family about it."
"Awesome burgers, good service, very generous servings:) great neighborhood restaurant, one of my favorite in Andersonville. Staff is friendly and nice."
"LBW has to be my favorite places to go to in Andersonville. The food and drinks are outstanding as well as the people that work there. Every dish that I've tried, I was not disappointed. Fries are one of my favorite things to eat and their fries are AMAZING! What kind of oil do you fry them in?!? so yummy! If you love burgers you will love Little Bad Wolf's burgers..their BAOS are delicious and their fried shrimp is so crispy and juicy. The Elote side dish is another fave..who would've thought FRIED AVOCADO to garnish. So good! Their chop salad is so good and so big and that homemade dressing that comes with is tasty. Their drinks are so good! Nothing like you ever had before! Green Eyes & La Lupe is my favorite. The decoration is original and love the copper. Definitely will be coming back. =)"
"OUTSTANDING!!!!  Great food, great service. The burger is my #1, juicy and has a soft bun with a crunchy edge. Freshly made chips with the guacamole."
"I have been here now several times since it opened and they have delivered every time. It is a small joint and can get crowded, so I recommend coming on a weeknight evening or earlier in the day when the wait will not be as long.  I love the music they play and energy in the bar.  My favorite drink I have had is the Fraud or Fable, don't be deterred by the tequila and egg whites, it is delicious.  My husband's favorite is the whiskey cocktail, Red N Wolf. They also have a great beer and wine list. We recommend the Lumpia  and Fried Shrimp as appetizers.  I am hoping to try the crab cake next time we go. The boas and tacos are good, but the burger and fries are an absolute must!  We also really enjoyed the elotes and the mac and cheese. Keep up the good work Little Bad Wolf.  We are happy to have you in the hood."
"Some of the bombest burgers in the city.. they're the no frills type.. just meat, cheese, sauce, fried egg, and a bun... possibly some onion strings but that's it and it's pretty killerTheir mac n cheese is rich and creamy and their fries are salty and crispy.. the perfect complements. You could put yourself in a 24 hour food coma if you do all three though.I wasn't too impressed with their bao's to be honest but that's not what i'm going there for now that I know how good their burgers are"
Amazing! Everything from the service to bao to tacos to the beer and cocktail selection is perfect! Go there and whatever you order will be something you can't wait to have again.
"Great cocktails, great music, nice atmosphere."
"I will keep it very short: if you're looking for a little cozy place to take someone you may be interested in and what to impress them with great food selections and long with drink choices, not too big or too many people, and in one of the coolest neighborhoods around this is your place. Awesome service, awesome food. It's my go to place these days..."
"Loved this place. Went to LBW for a Friday lunch, and had a great time. We sat at the bar, and had excellent service from a few members of the staff. The drink list was impressive, with REALLY cool cocktails, and a thoughtful wine list--refreshing for me, since I am not as into beer, and that seems to be the big focus in so many places. The Chupacabra cocktail was smoky, spicy and perfect. They make a killer G & T, with homemade tonic. The food was a treat too. Delicious Bao, the tacos were yummy. Try anything with shrimp. I will go back asap! Such nice people, and the product they are delivering is made with great care!"
"Best burger in town. Get all the additions: egg, onion straws, bacon. I haven't had anything bad here, and I've tried most of the menu. Some if the best cocktails I've had. The bartenders definitely know what they're doing. Great beer selection, both on tap and in bottles. If you haven't been here yet, go ASAP."
Seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had in Chicago. And you must try the max and cheese. Oh my lanta it is so good! The prices are good. The inside is so nice and the patio rocks. The service is always fantastic. There is literally nothing negative I can say about this place. If you haven't tried it then go right now because they are also open late :)
"What a great addition to the neighborhood! Super cute new place with a bar and dining seating. The staff is nice, the food is amazing. The salads are big enough to share. We had various small plates and the steak which was SO good! Definitely coming back."
"Great burger, so-so service, few options for vegetarians.First time here. There's no logical ""flow"" to the place, so we stood just inside the door trying to get someone's attention for a few minutes. When we were seen, we were advised to ""sit anywhere"" then shooed away when we were about to sit at a table by the window, as it was ""reserved.""We settled into a table along the back wall, and after promptly being served water by a runner, we waited several minutes before a server arrived to take a drink order.The beer and cocktail menu is comprehensive with plenty of good drafts. The food menu is more focused, with few options for vegetarians. Actually, there's exactly one vegetarian option; the potato taco.I ordered the Bad Burger, my boyfriend, vegetarian, improvised and asked to have the Mac and Cheese without bacon. Despite the name, my burger was quite good; flavorful beef patties with just the right amount of grease. The burger came with fries, very thin, crispy and delicious. The portion of fries was decent, but the fries themselves seemed weirdly short, and hard to eat without a fork.The Mac and Cheese was pleasant but pretty bland, amounting to a big bowl of elbow noodles with velveta-ish cheese sauce. The Mac would've benefited immensely from the addition of a little roughage; onions, broccoli, spinach, anything really, just to add some color and texture.The food was solid overall, but they could stand to offer more options for non meat-eaters. It wouldn't take much effort to do so.It's a small space, and it wasn't particularly busy, so the lapses in service are hard to explain, apart from the place being new. Everyone was perfectly nice, just not very attentive."
Delicious.  Love the baos and the burger is the best I've ever had.  Beer selection is always great.  The waitress is a little slow but the atmosphere is very nice that we usually are not in a hurry to leave.
"BAO TACOS!COCKTAILS!ELOTES!These three things will keep me going back all the times. It gets a bit packed in there, but it is definitely worth the wait. The staff is friendly and accommodating."
Thank You! had a blast last night with my college friends! your drinks are f'cking good!!! we will be back next week!
"I have been here twice- once with a party of four on a Saturday night. It was super crowded but we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Food and drinks were great, atmosphere was crowded and loud, but fun.The second time was-- well, right now. I'm doing work on their free wifi on a Saturday afternoon, post-lunch and pre-dinner crowds.  Drinks and snacks make working on spreadsheets infinitely more interesting.Both visits were great, and I will absolutely be back!  Very happy to have LBW in the neighborhood."
"Anybody who regularly posts on Yelp does so for any variety of reasons. My motivation?  I'm a fanatic junkie for good food. Whether its a greasy spoon diner or a fine dining establishment with white tablecloths,  I love to eat.  As a A'ville resident, I'm always glad to see the addition of a  food-focused restaurant.  Along Clark St. between Lawrence & Bryn Mawr, there are a decent number of ""good"" restaurants, yet  I'd be hard pressed to find something ""terrific"".  Not unlike Little Bad Wolf, numerous of these places along Clark have undergone revisions.  With difficulty making ends meet,  they shut their doors within 2-3 years, and ""re-invent"" themselves.  LBW opened as  ""Burger Philosophy"", which only lasted 3 years.  The new iteration is definitely a step up from Round # 1.Yelper comments  about the food quality were consistently good. Unlike it's predecessor Burger Philosophy, the burger at LBW was really decent (now there's a concept!) The 3 patty Wolf Burger had to weigh in around 10 ounces.  While the server couldn't tell me what type of ground beef  it was made of, I'm guessing that it was at least an 85/15 mix of beef to fat.  Bottom line, fat makes a burger taste better.  What else contributes to flavor ? .......""salt"".  The burger at LBW needed it badly.  While the texture and fat ratio was good, the burger lacked favor.  The perfectly cooked bacon didn't lend enough saltiness to the mix.  And the best part, melted ""American"" cheese.  While other cheeses might have assertive flavors ( think bleu or Gruyere), nothing beats the meltability of good old processed American cheese.   The fried egg on top and perfectly thin, crispy ""frites were over the top.  The bun , lack luster. The bao craze hasn't yet gripped Chicago as it has in NYC.  We've been inundated with mediocre variations of Korean-Mexican tacos.   I predict that Bao will be next, so fasten your seat belts. They will be on every menu within the year!  The bao at LBW were at least Asian-influenced, and had good flavor.  Were they as great as some of the bao I've eaten off food trucks in San Francisco or even in Chinatown in Chicago?  Nope.  Pluses, great service, good food & drink.  Downside, Very, very loud, (Was even difficult to hear the person sitting next to me) long waits for seating on busy nights. But, I'd go back in a minute,"
"Food and rinks are excellent. Bao and Tacos are what we always stick to. Service is great. A little noisy, we like the corner tables. You can tell they love what they do here!!!"
"Great food! This place is a hidden gem and I feel that the chef (back in the kitchen) deserves some award for great taste and innovation. First and foremost, what I absolutely approve 100% about this pub is that the food ain't just a secondary accessory to the drinks. The food is legit. I LOVE that the food ain't salty. Often pub food is doused in salt; but not at this Bad Little Wolf. Service was excellent. Very attentive staff. Not to mention how kind and congenial they were. The drinks ... freakin' unique. I had the Root Beer (10% alcohol). It tasted just like my favorite soda pop PLUS a light buzz. Awesome.Our party ordered quite a bit of food. We had:- Three baos (fish, chicken, and pork). These were excellent. I feel it's their signature eats. Definitely get these if you frequent this place. - Wolf Burger. A mean three-pattie burger with perfectly smoked bacon, melted cheese, onion strings...ugh. It's a heart-attack packaged into a scrumptious meal. We got side of mac and cheese with it - delicious in their own right. - Elotes. I usually see these at base ball games or at street corners, where they serve authentic Mexican treats. I didn't know what to expect getting these at a pub. But for $4 - why the heck not? I'm glad I got them! The fried avocados were a pleasant surprise - really good; really memorable. The elotes were perfect - not too sour, not too cheesy...just right. We devoured this dish. - Large Fries. I like their fries. Not salty. Will definitely be returning shortly."
"It's the third time I've been here in 2 weeks. Cozy, chic atmosphere; delish cocktails - especially the Green Eyes; inventive yet accessible food - the tacos, baos, Mac n cheese, grilled romaine salad have all been perfection. I hesitate to put this out here in case we can't get a table. Keep up the great work LBW!"
"I Went here today after reading some yelp reviews. Right off the bat we had awesome service. They told us 25 minutes and that we could get drinks in the meantime at the bar. We walked over to the bar and it was kinda busy, a server passing by offered to get us drinks which was nice. We sat down and ordered some bao tacos. They ended up putting it in wrong and gave us regular tacos, when they noticed the mistake they put in our order for regular tacos and gave us half off the bill. We didn't even ask for it. Great service, great food, awesome atmosphere.Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"
"This is such a great spot..I visited Little Bad Wolf for the first time two months ago and ever since then i've been enjoying in their great cocktails and food...One of my favorite cocktails is ""Green Eyes"".. You must try it!About the food.. Menu is really simple,and meals are really delicious..I tried Shrimp Bao , Pork Taco,Caesar Salad and all the burgers,everything was perfect..Caesar salad is great,Chicken is really crispy and full of flavours and burgers are like they are not from this planet ,juicy and tasty :-) Service is great too...Servers are really polite,so as the owners..They are doing a great job managing this place! I always have a great time here...See you soon LBW!"
"Went here for the first time the other night and I had a very positive experience. The staff was fantastic - attentive without hovering, good-natured, and had fantastic recommendations/insights to food and drink options. The drink list is large enough to be overwhelming if you're not really sure what you want, but there's diversity enough that there's definitely something for everyone. Everyone's food was done perfectly - interestingly, we had a view of the kitchen and it looked like the head chef was the last person checking the food before it went out and he would occasionally send dishes back into the kitchen. This sort of quality control is absolutely amazing, and it showed in the food. It was impeccable. Prices were fair, the atmosphere is fun and lively. The only reason this wouldn't be 5/5 stars is that conversation was challenging - it's a small place and pretty much consistently full which I can see making talking challenging, and I understand that. However, they played music a little louder than I thought was necessary. If someone wasn't sitting right next to you (or right across) you would have to shout to (try) to be heard. It was a bit of a struggle.Still, I really enjoyed their menu, their staff, and the atmosphere. Fantastic place and I would absolutely recommend it to people (and go back myself.)"
"This place is outstanding! It was one of the best burgers I have had in Chicago.  Great cocktails and appetizers as well. The service was top notch! in addition to the burger, I recommend the chips and chopped salad. Mac N cheese or fries with your delicious burger, you can't go wrong at Little Bad Wolf!"
"Cocktails are awesome, beer list is solid and the food is flavorful, appropriately priced and well-executed. As a vegetarian, it bums me out a little that there's no meatless sandwich or burger on the menu, but I assume you can order the mac and cheese without bacon (but I haven't tried that yet).Where this place really lacks is the service -- not in attitude (everyone's very, very kind) but in the logistics. There's no host stand or anyone by the door, so you just kinda stand in the middle of everything while you wait for someone to notice you. I've been here twice, and the first time were were seated quickly enough but we rarely saw our waiter throughout the meal. The second time, we went back and were ignored for a while. Which, whatever, I expected. It was really, really busy for a Wednesday night. So I flagged someone down and asked if I could put our name in for a table -- I was totally cool with waiting; I just didn't want to eat dinner at the bar. That's awkward with a party of three, you know? I gave someone my name and he told me that it'd be 15-20 minutes. No prob. After 30 minutes, we grabbed open seats at the bar just because we were tired of standing. The bartender asked if she could take our order but I told her that we were on the list for a table. 40 minutes and figuratively no service later... we were done. We watched 3 parties get seated before us and by this point, I'm ready to gnaw my arm off. To their credit, the manager (I think?) approached us as we left and asked us how everything was. We told him that we were leaving because we were famished, and he was really sweet -- he apologized for being so busy and offered to take care of us the next time we come in. Hopefully that happens.TL;DR: Definitely try this place out. It's very cool. But try to be assertive about how long you've been waiting. I think our flaw was sitting at the bar -- they may have thought we didn't want a table anymore. I dunno.If we go back and the service is better, I'll update this review."
"Small, but great menu!  The Bad Burger with add-ons like a fried egg and onion straws was smack-tacular!  And the drink menu is impressive and slightly intimidating.  Don't be afraid to ask your server for his opinion too.  I ended up getting the Old Fashioned, and it was amazing!  Ended up having 2 ... :-)  I will definitely be going back to Little Bad Wolf!"
"Nicely done. Mac and cheese was well done and flavorful. Very melty not baked to death.  Pork Bao was delicious. Shrimp were huge and nicely/lightly battered - never had shrimp like this before - loved them. Brussel sprouts were a B - no big surprises, a little sweetness would be nice. Fries were thin, crispies and a nice portion. Family run, the owner's brother was our server and he was fantastic. And apparently the chef is the owner's father.   What's not to love about all that family action. The decor and ambiance was nice and cozy and sexy dim - we got way too comfortable hanging out. Would definitely add to the short list of aville restaurants to frequent."
"Excellent food, service, atmosphere and location. Eclectic and interesting. Great addition to the neighborhood. Highly recommended."
"Great beer list and cocktail menu. Always busy.We have been looking to try LBW since it converted from Burger Philosophy a couple months back. Here are a couple of things you should keep in mind before you go:The place is super small. There are only a couple of 4-6 tops, then one big farmhouse style 10 top in the middle. Where they will seat you with strangers.I wouldn't go here with someone you really want to catch up with or have a deep convo with. We could barely hear over the music and the other diners basically sitting on top of us.It stinks the place is SO busy all of the time because I love the decor. They really did an amazing job with the booth seating along the wall, the light fixtures, and this awesome copper covered bar. Just very cool. OK so now that I have that out of the way - let's get to the food & drinks!I am definitely a fan of a good house-made cocktail and still cringe a bit at paying upwards of $10 but I am happy to report that my LBW margarita was delicious, rather large, and strong. I was able to sip on it through our stay just fine. I also tried the El Chupacabra which was a bit spicy for my tastes but very good and definitely a unique flavor.The service was good - our waiter was attentive and even great about an awkward mishap with the combined style seating (he didn't take our other parties orders because he couldn't tell they were with us! but he came right back and apologized when he realized what he did). I ordered the chicken taco and the shrimp bao on a lettuce wrap. The boyfriend got the Bad Burger and fries, which he greatly enjoyed. The fries were delicious. The shrimp lettuce wrap was definitely my favorite. The shrimp itself was nicely fried with a good sauce and avocado slices. I also tried my sister's side of mac n cheese (hold the bacon...vegetarians, sigh) which was just the way I like it - cheesy and crispy. The chicken taco was forgettable and the consensus of the other tacos was that the potato was the best (again, vegetarians), and the others (shrimp and tilapia) were way too corn-heavy.The bottom line? I would definitely come back here for a burger and fries considering it is probably the best and also most well-priced in the neighborhood ($10 for a burger and fries is like unheard of!). For my taco fix? I will still head to Takos Koreanos over on Foster (and well, it's BYOB)."
"Great drink list and cocktails.  The menu is actually deceptively large, in my opinion.  The girlfriend had the sliders, which were larger than expected and quite tasty.  I had three bao (chicken, steak, and pork).  The chicken was nice, the steak was enjoyably complex, and the pork...oh my.  I'm going to have dreams about the pork bao.  We also had a side of mac and cheese, which was nice, but everything else we had was really filling, so we didn't get to enjoy it as much as I would have liked.We had about a 45 minute wait for a two top on a Saturday night, which was worth the wait.  I have no complaints about service.  The price was surprisingly reasonable given the amount of food we got.We definitely will be back.  This is one of my new favorite restaurants."
"Love this cute new bar and restaurant! The ambiance is adorable and the details definitely show.I had the Moscow Mule and it was delicious. Best cocktails in Andersonville.The burger is on point with Au Cheval, which may be the best in the city.  I got the mac and cheese and it was creamy with al dente noodles, which is so important in a noodle dish.We started with the fish bao, the fish with the wasabi mayo was a perfect combination. We also had the mussels and I wanted to drink the sauce!The service was quick and the wait was not too bad.A+ for Little Bad Wolf"
It's a good smallish bar with amazing bao!! I had the fish sooo good!! & the pork...which was just okay. Drinks are mediocre but the atmosphere is chill and you can tell it's a place people likes to hang out at. Love the blue booths! !
"I am so mad I just moved away from this neighborhood not too long ago only to discover my new favorite place.I read some of the reviews that said some really nice things and thought they might be a little too exaggerated, but to be honest my own experience mirrors many of the other yelpers.Such a great addition to the area and may be contacting my old landlord to try to move back here sooner than I originally planned. haha;)"
"Saw this place just opened, so my buddy and I went to go check it out. Got there early, so got a table right away. This place would be 5 stars if it weren't for the NOISE level. It was so loud in there, and there weren't even that many people...I don't know if it was bad acoustics or what, but it was like we were all in a metal barn.But the good: Started with some guac, chips were nice and fried, serving was small, but salsas were tasty. The burgers are so simple, they're amazing. Fries were near perfect, and even tried a pork bao that was nice and crispy. Cocktails took a bit to make.Overall, great food. But service is lacking a bit, and they need to lay some rugs down or something to soak up some of that chatter. Still new, so I'm sure they'll work it out."
Been wanting to come here for a while. A friends friend is here visiting from out of town and we finally came. Great food and awesomely friendly ambience. I found my fave new watering hole. FYI... Try the Green Eyes cocktail!!!!
"This is currently the best rated restaurant between Andersonville and south Evanston. But if they want to stay that way they are going to have to make some tweaks mainly on the food service side. Basically I think they are doing fine if all you want is a pub, but the gastro- clientele may grumble a bit.I showed up about 6pm on a busy warm Sunday. I was given a six-page drink menu pretty quickly and asked if I wanted a drink. I asked the server what was interesting and he made a couple of thoughtful recommendations, one of which was the ""Fraud or Fable"". This was composed largely of tequila and cinnamon syrup with some Cynar (artichoke/herb bitters) which made the combination less candylike and more complex. Great so far!Then, after ten or fifteen minutes, the server came by and asked if I would like to order any food. Sure, I said, but can I see a menu? Oops, service mistake number one - the food menu was supposed to be attached to the drink menu as page seven but it wasn't there. So he brought a replacement, and I ordered a shrimp bao and the roasted Brussels sprouts.After another fifteen minutes or so they were delivering a crab cake from the kitchen and I was asked if it wasn't my order? No, I said, and my server went back to the kitchen for another try. Ten more minutes and I had a little frying pan with the Brussels sprouts topped with some crispy curls, and a bao. But the crispy curls were actually a bit on the rubbery side. There were a couple bitter spots in the sprouts too. Overall I would call this dish good to very good but not superb.Then I started on the bao - and it wasn't a shrimp bao, it was a chicken bao. It was tasty, though, so I didn't make an issue of it. But I started to wonder how this would go over if Gordon Ramsay showed up. Around this time the guy who had been faithfully refilling my water glass came by and asked, ""How's everything?"" ""Well.."" I began - and he was off across the room. He was a nice guy, mind you, but he wasn't prepared to listen to an actual answer to his question.I got to pay the bill pretty quickly, so I got out at around ... 7:15 or so. So how do I score this? I would call it four stars if it weren't for the service troubles, but there were enough little things that I have to knock a star off. Sorry! And if you have plenty of time and don't mind occasional surprises you may think four stars is fair."
"Been here twice already and I love it so far.    This place has a gastropub feel without being too crowded or pretentious.   ie.  (Hopleaf, Longman and Eagle, Owen and Engine)The burgers are the real deal here.   Even though I like grilled burgers as opposed to griddled (cooked on a flatop grill), the burgers are juicy and awesome.   Easily the best burger in Andersonville by a mile.  And for 13 bucks, a triple stacked burger with bacon, shallots and egg with fries is also an excellent deal. I had the pork and beef bao, which were quite tasty too. But once the word gets out on how awesome the burgers are, this place will do just fine.  Ample whiskey list, lots of draft beer and very good craft cocktails.   The menu is also excellent.   Service is generally friendly and prompt.   I'm a fan.   Can't wait to go back."
"Great addition to the neighborhood. Good beer list and the price are reasonable. The food is dynamite. Great burgers (thin patties fried on a flat top), mac and cheese, tacos and bao. If you can't tell, it's a pretty diverse menu, but it's all good. Staff has been helpful and kind every time we've gone."
"Absolutely everything we had was great. We got steak, chicken, shrimp, and pork bao and each one was wonderful. The lumpia appetizer was so good!!! It's a little small inside but the bar selection and food more than makes up for it. The owner/host was incredibly nice."
"I had heard great things from my friends so decided to give it a try! My best friend was moving out to San Diego in a few days so we wanted to have one last supper. She was so ecstatic that this was her last meal in Andersonville before she moved. It was a Tuesday night and we walked in and were seated right away. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday. We both ordered drinks which were absolutely delicious! For an appetizer we got the Brussel Sprouts which were very good although they didn't bring a utensil to serve them with and trying to use our small spoons was a but difficult. Then came the main course....WOW. We each got burgers and I have to say they were amazing! So juicy and flavorful!This is definitely my new go to spot when friends from other hoods come up my way!Also, the service was great and our food came out super quick! Awesome new addition to the neighborhood!"
"Wow. After a horrible brunch experience at a new restaurant this morning, I was reluctant to check out another new spot twice in one day, (Don't judge me, I don't grocery shop!) but I'm glad I did!My partner and I stopped in tonight around 9:00 and had a great dining experience. The ambience was sleek, comfortable and somewhat industrial. Sounds like a weird mix, but it worked. Relaxing and hip at the same time, as the music was upbeat and lounge-y. Our server Zach was extremely attentive and friendly. We started with a margarita, the bad wolf mule and the ejotes. Great opener. The drinks were awesome; the margarita wasn't overly sugary or ""mixy"" tasting and the mule was nicely balanced. The ejotes was fresh, flavorful and had a nice touch with the fried avocado on top. Sounds weird, right? Nope. 'Twas delicious!We both ordered the bad wolf burger and can honestly say that I have never experienced something so juicy and delicious. The meat literally melted in your mouth. I opted for the thin frites, which were delicately seasoned and hard to stop eating. My partner had the Mac & cheese as his side dish and he was extremely happy. We can't wait to bring people back here because of our awesome experience. Too bad it's not right on the Clark strip, as I fear many people will overlook this gem when dining out in Andersonville. Oh well, maybe that's better for us then to keep this little gem to ourselves. ;)"
"Met some friends for a midday Sunday cocktail. Place has a nice vibe once you come in. It may have trouble enticing folks given it's location--a strip mallish location on Bryn Mawr and Clark. It's Next to a subway. But the decor is inviting and modern once you're in. Had a Sazerac and it was lovely. Friends had some food and enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to going back. Tried a sip of my friend's ""green eyes"" drinks. It was very nice. Herbaceous, but not overpowering.  Looking forward to going back. Great place two hang and watch passersby."
"My new favorite neighborhood spot, even though I have to drive there!  Great menu and everything, EVERYTHING is well executed.  Have a cocktail (Fraud or Fable, El Chupacabra, Green Eyes), or a glass/bottle of wine, or a draft or bottled beer.  Have a Steak Bao and a shrimp taco.  Have a salad.  Talk to the bartender or watch tv or socialize amongst yourselves. Use the gorgeous comfortable bathrooms. Squat on the free wi fi.I know this place is going to get packed once word gets out so I hope they can somehow expand.  Great food, people with heart, great service.  This is the place!  Please open one closer to Sheridan and Thorndale/Grandville!PS. Great place to hang while your car is being serviced at AB Marathon. What? You're still using Jiffy Lube?!?!?! Well cross the street while you're waiting..."
"Was excited for this new neighborhood spot... right down the street from me!  I went with 4 other guests the first week they opened and had a pleasant experience.  The ambience is nice...very chill, a little hipster (which I don't mind).The place was busy but packed.  I think they could have used another waiter or 2 on the floor, but it was their first week so not going to harp on that.Great cocktails... I may have had one too many moscow mules ;)"
"Tried this place for the first time today. I really like how they transformed the dining room of the former Burger Philosophy. I had the ""Bad Burger"" and added the onion straws - it was amazing and I'll definitely be back again for another. Tons of choices of beers and I overheard our waiter telling the guests next to us about gluten-free beverage options. Our waiter was very polite and welcoming. I liked the ambiance of this place. The dark charcoal paint on the walls, rustic table and copper accents provided a calming feel. I also loved all the 80's tunes they were playing. When this place gains popularity - which I think is going to be soon - seating may be a challenge. But when that does happen, the food will be worth the wait."
"We've tried just about everything on the menu.  No complaints about any of the food , & the bad burger is the bomb.  This is also where I go to get my Not Your Father's Root Beer fix - on tap & 19% alcohol!! Trendy atmosphere, all around good vibes.  The service has always been great, & the owner is dedicated enough to work the front of the house most nights.  They don't have desserts yet as they aim to prefect their menu before they offer desserts.  Definitely a neighborhood fave."
"Actually worth a 3.5. The food is delectable, served hot, and worth another visit for. The burgers were excellent! Juicy and savory. The mac and cheese was the best I have had so far in the city. The specialty cocktail that I had was called C'oer D'uer (I definitely did not spell that correctly, oops!) is without a doubt my new favorite thing of all things. It was not made too strong or too sweet, I joked about getting a pitcher of it (even though I would have if the opportunity presented itself!) All in all, the foos and drink are a winning combination. It seems like a hip, different, local bar with beautifully plated and outstanding food, most of which is not typical bar food. I cant tell if it leans more towards being a resturant with a small menu, or a bar with exceptionally good food. Our waitress was super nice and accommodating as well. I did dislike how loud it is inside. That's always a turn off to me, is when the music is just way too loud inside a bar or resturant, that you have to be on the verge of shouting to be heard. Also, the tables are very close together. It was difficult to conversate comfortably. I heard pretty much everyones conversation sitting around me. They need more space. The menu is definitely on the minimal side, which isnt bad, but I do like personally a little more to choose from than what I was presented with. All in all, will possibly go back for that incredible cocktail!"
"Very tasty drinks, cozy and cool atmosphere, kind and attentive servers. Great place to catch up with friends!"
Went during the middle of the week and this was my first real meal after spending a week in the hospital.. and I made a great decision. The burgers were cooked excellently and the root beer was alcoholic. Those two alone will have me go back. Let's see what else is on the menu...
"The best bao I've ever had. Ever. I have been here quite a few times now, and I've had all of the tacos, all of the bao, and the Bad Burger. I can't find a flaw in anything. Cocktails are great and beer selection is even better. We've mostly gone for lunch because it is jam packed almost every night. They are currently setting up some pretty sweet outside seating, so this will be a go-to for this summer."
"From the minute I saw the cool ""Little Bad Wolf"" sign go up where Burger Philosophy used to be, I was pumped for this opening. Not only do I live a mere .3 miles from LBW, but it offers yet another unique drinking and dining experience in my beloved Andersonville hood. I thought I had read somewhere that it wasn't opening until 2015, so imagine my surprise when I was driving home and saw people sitting at the bar. I immediately ditched my previous plans to watch Gilmore Girls in my pajamas and ventured out to the bar, only to be welcomed with a truly fabulous ambiance, a whiskey shelf that'll surprise even the most dedicated drinker and tons of little touches that ensure that LBW will for sure become a popular place for me to while away my paycheck week after week. Service was great, the atmosphere is awesome and all the food looked so good. Haven't had a chance to try it yet but it's happening soon."
"One of my new favorite spots in Andersonville. It gets packed on weekends for dinner and it's a small place, so plan accordingly. But seriously their food surpassed my expectations and they make a damn fine Manhattan. That's all you need to know."
"Baos are delic, the steamed buns are perfect vessels for the yummy goodness inside. Shrimp and pork ones are my fav. Burgers are huge and fantastic, top it with the fried egg. Drinks are eclectic and never disappoint."
"We couldn't be happier that this place opened up right down the street from us.  As a devoted craft beer drinker there are literally no options on the North Side of Andersonville that have a compelling lineup.  Edgewater Lounge has such basic options that we were fearful LBW would go the same safe route.  Have no fear that is not the case here!My girlfriend and I stopped by the second night they were open and were super impressed.  What we enjoyed...- 3 different craft brews, one rare vos Belgian style ale I hadn't had before, all were  excellent- ordered the lumpia a sorta Asian infusion dish, small egg rolls with the water chestnuts and a delicate sweet sauce for dipping-2 different tacos, both had fresh ingredients and focused more on flavor then filling you up, always the right call with small plates-my favorite the pork bao- crispy pork, daikon on a soft chewy bun-the Mac and Cheese with chicken, the chic was definitely too much and the Mac was classic, cheesy super filling and no extra bells and whistles, I like my Mac traditional but my gf was disappointed it didn't have more flairThe owners were there and sent over some free fried shrimp which was also surprisingly good for a basic dish.  Big sized shrimp served cutely in a fry basket, only complaint is I think an array of sauces would've been better then just the cocktail it came withThe service was nice but not overbearing so perfect.  To top off the great food and drinks the music was bomb!  Per the other reviews the decor is hugely upgraded and it's sorta amazing to see knowing what the old burger philosophy looked like.  Beautiful art work, steel industrial chairs, soft banquette seating and high ceilings.Oh! We also had two cocktails.  They were pricey but worth it.  It wouldn't be a place I'd go to throw back a bunch of spirits but more one I'd go to enjoy some really good ones.  The music and the drafts are drawing us back again this afternoon.  Legit- our new favorite spot."
"LOVE. LOVE. Burger!The burgers (and buns!) were delicious. We walked in and immediately felt as though the decor/environment was something out of our dream home catalog. Not to mention I had a mini dance party with myself with their amazing music selection. ;) You usually can't go wrong with a burger. Well this place went way way right! The service, decor, and food display were impeccable. We can't wait to go back and try out their page after page of specialty drinks."
"My friends and I came in on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. The place is a little small but very cute inside. Deciding on what to eat was very difficult as everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. I ordered the bbq pork bao, the shrimp taco, and the fish taco. My friend ordered the same but opted for a chicken taco over the shrimp taco. The fish taco was good. It was a corn meal breaded piece of fish which is different than most and rather than coleslaw or mayo, it came with corn and salsa verde. The shrimp taco was maybe the best shrimp taco I've ever had. The shrimp was lightly battered and came with honey bacon mayo (UM YUM) and pickled cabbage. The bbq pork bao was good but not the best I've ever had. I would recommend the tacos over the baos. My other friend order the bad burger. Wow, I gotta say it is one of the best burgers in the city. Very similar to Au Cheval's burger. Buttery bun, good pickles, mayo, good patty and american cheese. It's only 10 bucks with fries and it won't take you 4 hours to order it. We also split an order of elotes, which is corn in chipotle aoili with fried avocado on top. Again, very delicious. I really liked eating here, the experience was very enjoyable - the service was friendly and on point, the atmosphere was great, and the food was some of the best in the city. I would definitely come back here just for the burger and the shrimp taco!"
Amazing tacos & baos!! I had the al pastor and steak tacos & they were very authentic & delicious. I only had the pork bao & was to die for! Will have to go back to try the other kinds!
"imagine my surprise that this restaurant has chinese bao, the type they usually have lined up in a circle on a large plate with roasted duck in the middle for you to fill it in.of course I had to order (I usually just eat the bao itself in Chinese restaurants because I don't like duck)They had four different meats to choose from, and I got pork & steak. Pretty flavorful and good; only gripe is that they have it on a plate where the bao kinda sticks to it.would def come back for the food, and to try other beers they have on hand."
"I'm overdue on this review!  My husband and I followed LBW on instagram and facebook and could not get over the pictures of the food.  We knew that when they announced the opening night we HAD to go.  Overall, Little Bad Wolfe delivered on the hype and we will be back!Lets get the bad (or should I say opening kinks) out of the way first.  Food was oddly timed and I heard this from a friend who went the next week.  It happens.  I found the music to be just a tad loud and the place to be a tad dark.  We sat at the bar so a few extra candles would be great to read the menu as opposed to busting out the cell phone light.Now for the great, food and booze!Husband confirmed the spirits list is great and most of the $11 cocktails were well priced and poured.  Wine wise there was something in a lower price point and up for the high end folks.  For the food, we really splurged and jumped all over.  The charcuterie board was amazing but way to big for two people.  I would have also liked a few more slices of bread.The bao, was FANTASTIC!  I had the steak and I think my husband had pork.  The bao is very fresh and soft, slightly sweet, and the fillings are great.  We also had the lumpia, which was OK but I could have used a sauce with more kick.  The fries were great and while I'm not a mustard person, my husband really enjoyed their special sauce. The bar is amazing, it is so pretty and they did such a good job with the interior.  I'm jealous of people that ordered the burger and hanger steak, so that's up next!"
"Loving this place just wish it was about 50% bigger.  But maybe that would ruin it a little as well.  Stopped by on 2 occasions before finally going in on a Tuesday evening when it was about 60% full.  Grabbed two seats at the bar and waited to be greeted by the bartender.  And waited. The wait wasn't due to being ignored, though a quick nod would have been appreciated.  With the craft cocktails it certainly takes longer then pouring a tap beer and with just the on bartender it took about 10 minutes to be properly greeted and asked if we'd like a drink.  The wait was worth it for sure.  The drink, a take on a Negroni, was fantastic.  I could have had several of those for sure.  As for the full drink menu I'd encourage folks to be adventuresome and explore all they offer.  There are some very tasty creations!Next up was the food.  We ordered a side of frites, which let's say would be sufficient to handle a table of 4 if not 6.  They were tasty and crisp and didn't go to waste, though I know they went to waist!I ordered a couple of tacos.  They were very good though I wish they had doubled up on the tortilla.  By the time I got to the second taco it was falling apart and for the third it became a fork taco.  The double tortilla would have prevented that from happening. Overall it was a very good experience and the drinks/food were excellent.  Some additional help behind the very small bar would have made this a 5 star experience.  Looking forward to more great experiences."
"This place goes on the list as HIGHLY recommended.  I'll just cut to the chase...the craft cocktails are some of the best tasting and best priced in Chicago.  At $10 a pop for most of them, I found them to be a bargain for the quality of ingredients (spirits, house made bitters, etc)...and I'm a sucker for a good Mezcal cocktail.I was lucky enough to go with 8 friends that love sharing, so we literally ordered the majority of the menu.  And although everyone had a different favorite, these are the highlights that should not be missed:  1) Pork Bao 2) The Bad Burger 3) Mac N Cheese 4) Elotes.If you go and order those 4 items, you are guaranteed a great (and affordable) meal."
"The copper bar is a nice touch in a space that encourages you to meet other patrons. The artwork and drinks make for a nice space to nosh on tacos and other goodies, and street parking is easy to find. Not a bad little place to stop for a quick drink on your way to Grandma's house."
"Went for a girls night. Great service. Awesome drinks, like really great. Small menu, small portions, but the food was really tasty. Appreciated the patience of our server since I was with a group of girls who were very undecided about what they wanted. Love this place and looking forward to going back!"
"This place is EPIC. I really liked it! We waited a good amount of time (at the bar) to get a seat. While that happened, we had these funky drinks (El Chupacabras; has mezcal and pepper in it!) prepared by this lovely bartender with a tattoo on her right forearm.When we finally got our table, Rachel made everything to make our night out the best. Another funky drink (La Lupe) and some Ace pear ciders, some Baos and shrimp and steak tacos, slider burgers, elotes and fries.The only thing I'd advise: have the option to not fry the tortillas (just keep them soft), add some fresh-cut limes and cilantro on the side and prepare 1-2 salsas --from scratch. Do this and you'll see ;-)I'll come back, for sure. Oh, and price was right! Ambiance, music, decor, crowd. Everything just right."
"This new iteration of Burger Philosophy (very good in it's day) has the added benefits of atmosphere and a full-bar.  To it's credit, the quality of the food is still there and that's a good thing.  On the other hand, some of the service process has changed and suggest it needs upgrading.  I can somewhat appreciate the lacking in this category because there was once a lonely Order Taker behind the counter and now management has to train and supervise many more all for the same purpose.  This new paradigm may have confounded the back of the house.  Having said that and without going into the gory details of the experience, I have a suggestion for the newer and expanded wait staff:  ""Write down the order as it's made and don't try to memorize.  It never works""."
"The restaurant and patio were crowded and their was a wait, but we were able to find a seat at the bar right away. This place is adorable and has a very cool vibe. I loved the old school hip hop playing in the background (Common, The Fugees, etc). I love that they barrel age their own whiskey for their specialty drinks. The bartender was attentive and made great drinks. The food was delicious! Definitely get the pork bao!! I can't wait to go back. Would definitely recommend this place."
The burgers are fantastic. We had the Bad Burger which has 2 patties and cheese. It's a top 5 burger in Chicago and top 2 in the neighbordhood.Kids had the Mac and Cheese and the mini cheeseburgers. The portions were perfect and everything was delicious.And we had a Sazerac that was awesome.So glad for another fantastic restaurant in Andersonville!
Great bourbon selection. Bartenders who know what to do with it and great food and chefs who know how to prepare it. This is a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. Go before the rest of Chicago finds out!
"Great food!!- Try the mac and cheese, you will not regret it! Chicken taco's are also delicious! Drinks!!! -Excellent beer menu, however, I ordered ""green eyes,"" yum!!!  I could easily put a few of those down if I could hold my liquor better.  Space- super cute. Has a very lofty, chic feel to it.  Music is great.  Has outdoor seating.  Price- very reasonable for the generous serving size, and more importantly, quality of food your getting - this isn't frozen left overs from the night before, everything is made fresh and in house! Definitely going back again!"
"Went on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend after friends had urged us to go. SOOOO very awesome. Where to begin...Atmosphere- I love the decor. It was inviting and homey but still sophisticated. It was early so there weren't a lot of people in there but it's big enough that, if it were crowded it seems like it would still be comfortable. The bourbon casks on the one wall were very cool. The whole place had a comfortable but not pretentious vibe which I liked. It was a perfect place for a casual, unplanned date.Drinks - I got their root beer beer which is dangerously delicious. It doesn't have a heavy alcohol taste but does have a kick, which is both good and bad. :) He got a draft and loved it from the first sip to the last. (and he is very determined in what he likes and doesn't like)Food- Oh the food. We decided to split some bao and some tacos. We ordered the fish and steak tacos and the pork, chicken and fish bao. I'll start with the tacos because I don't have much to say about them. They were just okay. We both found them to be a bit bland, and nothing to write home about (which I later found out was what my friends thought as well; wish we had talked ahead of time) but, admittedly, they were done a great disservice by being paired with great drinks and the baos. Oh, the baos. I could honestly go there every day and have some of that pillowy goodness. All three tasted fabulous. The flavors were layered perfectly and everything was a perfect balance of sweet and savory. We opted to get two more baos, because we were still hungry, and went for the steak and shrimp to round out the menu (there are five varieties) Delicious. Very unexpectedly, as I am picky about shrimp, the shrimp was my favorite but all five were fantastic and you can't go wrong with any of them.Bottom line... go, and go often. Their prices are reasonable, especially given the quality of the food. The service was great and the atmosphere is wonderful."
"This place is amazing! They have a huge list of super tasty cocktails and delicious food. It was definitely the best burger I've had in Chicago. Also, try the pork spring rolls. They were so yummy! They've also done a great job decorating because the ambience is perfect inside. I can't wait to go back again."
"Great atmosphere besides the blonde chick/waitress who seemed a bit weird at first but then I finally realized that she was only that way towards the ""only black people"" in the bar (me and my 2 sisters). Maybe a bit racist?! Don't wanna jump there but she was so much nicer and friendly to everyone else but us as soon as we stepped foot in the door. That is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars... I would like to give 4 bc of the food and drinks but she was rude.As for the food... The skirt steak for $20 is well worth it and the wait. Fries could be a bit more fresh but what do you expect from a bar right?! Very very good drinks--kinda pricey but I didn't mind spending it $$."
"Stopped by for a late night bite and drinks and was not disappointed. Great service and food. Couldn't have been happier with the sliders and appetizers overall. A friend recommended the mac and cheese, and it was fine, but nothing special. Would love to see them expand their menu."
"I went to Little Bad Wolf for a friend's birthday. We sat at the bar for about 45 minutes while we waited for a table. It was worth the wait for sure. At the bar I had a Root Beer and it changed my life. For dinner I had the macaroni and cheese with chicken. I probably won't get the chicken added next time, because the mac was fantastic and didn't need any extra help being so good. I already plan on taking friends from out of town to this place."
"So, was stomping around Edgewater, got hungry and decided to stop in for a quick bite and I do declare, this place has some awesome food. I ordered the bad burger and my dining companion ordered two baos and a taco. The burger got me from the first bite, and after that, it only got better. We shared everything, and both agreed that this place is a real find.Their menu of drinks, beers, bourbon and other drinkable s is prodigious,  take your time perusing the options. I ordered the LBW Old Fashioned and was not disappointed."
"We were sick of all the same options in Winnetka and decided to take the short drive to Andersonville. What a treat! First the beer selection was great. Also a great selection of whisky and wine if that is your choice. Small inside but three people asked to help us and were as nice as they get. Sat at the bar for 5 minutes and there was a table waiting. Server was top notch. We first has the mussels and WOW were they great. Actually asked for more bread to soak up the juice. Then an assortment of Bao's and tacos for the table to share. Followed up by Brussel Sprouts and mac n' cheese. Person we went with loved it so much he took a group back a few days later. We are going to go try the burgers next, but it is a must go for anyone in or out of the area. Great work people! Wife told me it was the best spot I picked ever and that is saying a ton."
"I decided to stop in to Little Bad Wolf one night since I was in the neighborhood.  I have been here previously when it was ""The Burger Philosophy"" which was a great spot to stop by for a quick bite to eat.  Quite surprised at what the owner's were able to do with a burger joint after the renovation and I will definitely be backDecor / Ambiance:Again, love the renovations these guys did.  Great use of the space, few flat screens on the wall if you want to catch a game  or two but with fixtures more akin to a fancier pub.  Copper bar top (very nice touch) with plenty of bar stools as well as a nice bench running along the back wall with plenty of table space.There is usually a good selection of music playing (90's hip hop during my last visit) but not too loudly to the point where you can't have a conversation.  Overall, it's a place I'd feel just as comfortable taking a few friends to watch the Bears but also nice enough to bring a date to.Food / Drinks:I tried the Wolf Burger with some Mussels as an appetizer.  The burger was cooked nice and juicy and I loved the addition of a sunny-side up egg and thick cute bacon.  Not bogged down by unnecessary fillers like lettuce or tomato (i'm a purist) with a generous side of crispy fries on the side.  The mussels were also cooked great and had an amazing broth, which as everyone knows is the best part.Very wide selection of craft brews and beverages including a few gems like the infamous and dangerous ""Not Your Grandfather's Rootbeer"".  Great selection of hand-mixed cocktails as well with some nice touches such as homemade bitters for the Old Fashioned.Staff:Everyone was very friendly and eager to talk about the newly designed menu (as this place is relatively new).  Quick service and overall very knowledgeableDefinitely a must-try if you're in the Andersonville neighborhood."
"GRILLED ROMAINE SALAD! Did not know what to expect, but it was insanely good. Smoky crunchy lettuce with corn & cheese and cherry tomatoes...def the highlight of the night - though the lumpia and shrimp bao were also excellent. Great atmosphere and service as well!"
"Ordered the Bad Wolf burger, which was really good, except for one thing: American cheese? Why go through the effort to craft a gourmet burger with good beef, delicious bun, and tasty toppings only to cheapen it with processed ""cheese""? If this burger had a nice slice of real cheddar on it I would have rated it 4-5 stars. Everything else about the experience was good. I miss the broader selection of burgers that the former Burger Philosophy offered, but the food and service were still good. Nice atmosphere, too. Next time I'll try the tacos. They looked tasty."
"So glad we came here! A perfect little hang out with outstanding food and cocktails. I appreciate a place that has a smaller menu, it allows the dishes to be perfected. I had a shrimp taco and a steak taco. The bacon mayo on the shrimp taco was so delicious. The flank steak on my taco? Perfection. So tender for arguably the toughest cut to get right. My BF had the Wolf Burger. The patties were thin and well-seasoned, not to mention the cutest french fry presentation...a mini fry basket! Rachel was our server. She was so sweet; attentive without being all up in our business. We decided this will be our new summer hang out, no question! Andersonville keeps continuing to impress!"
"This is my new hood joint. Mixology at its finest, cocktails are fresh old kichy drinks (bourbon balls anyone??), dank beer, and small menu with food done right! Great for dinner or for just drinks. Classy, hoppin, and never a disappointment!"
"This is my new go-to place! I've been here a few times. It's an upscale vibe with craft cocktails and moody decor, but it's so comfortable that I feel like I could roll in here any odd day and just feel at home.I can hardly pick favorites of the food but if I had to - fish bao and taco, the amazing juicy burger, and the fried shrimp with spicy sauce. Also the lumpia are not to miss - like a crispy pork spring roll. Favorite cocktails are the Red and Wolf (I think that's the name - it's like a bourbon mule) and the negroni - I'm a huge negroni fan and not everyone gets it right. This one is slightly sweet - could drink that all night. They also have a ton of beers in bottle and on tap, and a good wine list. Lots of meat on the menu but definitely options for vegetarians.Great prices, friendly servers, really eclectic menu but it's like everything you'd ever want while you're drinking.What a great addition to the neighborhood! Come here for a date, late night food or just for a burger on a lazy Sunday afternoon. They have tvs but they're usually only on during the day for sports. Looks like they'll have a patio come spring. Next step brunch...? One can hope!"
"Saturday night out with friends was a success!! Place had a great vibe when we came in and sat down. Our waiter was awesome and was around constantly, even with his other busy tables.Food and drinks were the best. The burgers were so good just writing this review makes me want one! The specialty cocktails were good, the green eyes was the best for sure! -Ketchup never came even when we asked, but I will let that slide. Street pay to park was not bad.Definitely coming back.*We had a large party of 6 and paid cash so I am not sure if they would have split the checks."
Amazing. Our recommendations: Bao with pork. Shrimp tacos.  Grilled romaine salad with chicken. Packed at 2PM on Saturday. Great beer list and cocktails look amazing.
"What a great new addition to the hood, great character and nice simple affordable menu. The mussels appetizer was perfect, generous portion, large mussels and flavorful broth. Salads were also generous portion and great price. Our waitress Megan was very charming. Only recommendation, don't order your main dish until you've finished your starters, food comes out pretty fast."
I have to give this place a 5 stars because their baos were wonderful and I loved their El Chupacabra drink!  Very well made drink!   I want to thank the wonderful waitress for recommending this drink.  The drink and the baos were a perfect combination for a nice warm spring day in Chicago.  The inside decor was really cool and fun!  I'd recommend this place as part of daytime adventure.  I'd definitely come back.
"I was tempted to give this place a one star review so the high rating would go down and word wouldn't spread how good this place is. Unfortunately I have a heart of gold and couldn't do that to LBW. Holy crap this place is awesome. The service was great, quick, and friendly. The ambiance is perfect. Dimly lit, rustic, Edison bulbs, and every detail was not missed. The freaking knife they give you looks like a switch blade; very cool. The beer selection is off the charts and they have a huge selection of cocktails. The food was amazing. My wife and I had the 1/2 lb of shrimp and they were huge. A great portion for 2 people if not 3-4. The tacos were fantastic and prepared unlike any I have had before. The Mac n cheese was great and so were the elotes as the sides. I cannot wait to have an excuse to back to this place. Glad Andersonville finally got a new hot spot. I hope it stays around, I can't see how it couldn't."
"Came on a Sunday around 3 with 3 other friends and it was busy, there was a wait but they took our name down so we went to a bar a couple doors down to wait.We ordered a little of everything and it was all SO GOOD!The lumpia, JUMBO fried shrimp and french fries were all delicious.The mac and cheese is to die forThe elote tastes just like the elote you'll get in Pilsen or Little Villiage, very authenticMy favorite was probably the grilled heart of romaine salad my friend ordered. It sounds weird and I expected the lettuce to be hot and weird tasting since it's grilled but omg, your taste buds will love you! It has this smokey taste that is just killer.Drinks I recommend are La Lupe, their Moscow Mule and an old fashioned. All very well made! Props to the bar tender, for real.This place is awesome, the decor is SO cool and for the most part the staff is great(only reason I didn't give them 5 stars)definitely gets busy so expect that but the trip/wait will be worth it."
"The burger is second only to Au Cheval. Great service, nice staff, well-executed food. A great addition to Andersonville!"
"For the next three weeks, we live in Chicago and I think we will be living here.  Bartenders are great and the food is amazing.  Get the shrimp tacos and the mac & cheese!This place is awesome.   When people figure out that it's there you won't be able to get in the door."
"I was here this weekend with my family and everyone loved it.  We had Meghan as our server and she was very friendly and attentive.  She really did a great job helping us choose the right drinks and food. We had the mussels & chips and guac to start, then the pork bao, fish taco, shrimp taco,  Bad burger and fries, and a side of mac and cheese.  Everything we ate was so delicious.  We also had a giant Waldorf Salad with grilled chicken, and it was so big we had at least half to take home.... and it still tasted great the next day. Lots of craft brews to choose from, I think about a dozen on tap and then TONS by the bottle.  There is something for everyone here.  I had the Green Eyes and Manhattan and loved them.  My brother had the Old Fashioned and a beer, and he said the Old Fashioned was one of the best he's ever had.  I tried it and I think he was right!  Props to the bartender who created these delicious drinks and eclectic menu. Thank you Meghan for the great service and thank you to Little Bad Wolf for making my trip to Chicago!"
LBW never disappoints.  Extraordinary drink menu and amazing food!
"Great Food, Great Music, Great Vibes and Great People. Can't go wrong at the Wolf! #hiddengem"
"This place was awesome. The food is excellent and they have great beer. Its overall a small place but you wont wait more then an hour to be seated. Very classy place with a laid back feel. I had the burger, taco, and fries. The burger had an egg on it and was delicious."
"***update***my 3rd visit in 1 week & this place does NOT disappoint! The service is always spot-on, the 2 owners are very hands-on & attentive with the customers, and it's bringing out the non-existent burger fanatic in me! Keep up the great work guys! Big fans!!!"
"Food was very good and the atmosphere is fun but the service was extremely slow - I counted one server in a completely full restaurant. The wait staff should also have a better knowledge of gluten-free vs non-gluten-free menu offerings. Also a major pet peeve: when ingredients not listed on the menu appear on your food. It's easier to say ""leave it off"" than pick it off."
"Place is very legit.  Tacos and Bao I had were all very tasty.  I had the steak taco, fish taco and shrimp bao.  Also, an excellent whiskey/bourbon selection here.  Great service.Fantastic addition to the neighborhood.  Will eat many future lunches at LBW."
"Great Cosmo! Fresh squeezed juice makes this Cosmo the best ever! Love the food, service is friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is hip without being stand offish. A great place to hang out."
"I'll get straight to the point. Food, cocktails, atmosphere, decor and service were all on point. If I could give this spot 10 stars I would!! Best burgers in the city, hands down."
"Beer list is pretty ok, tad bit overpriced.  The food was horrible. Chicken bao with peanut sauce was horrible.  Tasted like a jar of jiff was spread on it.  The fish taco was as tasty as water. Skip the shrimp taco and steak bao as well.  Added a half pound of salt to try and make it go down."
Best burger I have ever eaten. Soft potato bread bun lightly grilled. Straight up deliciousness. Can't wait to return and try the rest of this amazing looking menu. I am yelping from the table. That's how good it is!
"Found this little place in Andersonville. Food was terrific, it is a little venue but everyone was super nice and wait staff was very helpful. Its worth it to just go for the french fries they were amazing. The salad was way better then i expected. If your in the area it is a must try. Its small, so gets busy really quickly."
"Theres a reason this restaurant is at 5 stars, especially for being new. We wanted to find a place in the area that was open late. I called to ask if they were still serving food, surprised to hear until 1:30. The drink options are endless and the food menu is smaller but thats a good thing. We ordered our drinks which are your typical craft cocktail which are good for sipping. We ordered several tacos, a few baos, the mussels, and eventually ordered a burger. The mussels are awesome! If you're into tacos, you won't be disappointed. And the minute I took a bite of the burger, I was in heaven. It was like a homemade burger from mcds....greasy patties, soft bun, and american cheese. We will def be back!"
"I went here on a friday or saturday night.  It's definitely not a big place by far but when we got there there were two spots open at the bar that we sat at.  We waited about 15 minutes until they cleared out a table for us.  There's maybe enough seating for 50 people total at the bar and the tables so you're bound to wait for a bit if it's a weekend night.  They have a broad drink menu having a lot of specialty beers, wines, and cocktails.  Their food menu isn't that extensive though it'd be nice if there were a few more options.  We got the order of mac and cheese which was very good and the baos which i didn't taste but my boyfriend liked.  The atmosphere is also very nice and trendy.  I would definitely be back."
very good.....great atmosphere and staff. Food and drinks....lots of choices and everyone in our party (4 of us) really liked their meal.
"A small, intimate ""must try"" new spot... That everyone is trying. That being said, if you don't like crowds, this is not the place for you. But seriously great cocktails. Everyone in my party order some sort of taco so I tried every flavor- delicious. A group of 7 of us went around 7pm on a Friday and waited about 15 mins for a table. Any later then that, and I think we would've been standing the whole time. All the staff was super nice and is was easy to get a delicious drink in your hand"
Coat Hooks: No
"I find LBW to be a cozy place for me to clutch a cocktail and graze on some a la carte treats (in the form of tacos & bao). The sliders are big enough to be share-able, and we recommend swapping out the American cheese with some gorgonzola. Mmm, gorgonzola. The only area in which Little Bad Wolf is truly bad/naughty is in its love affair with cilantro, which even made its way - inexplicably - in my otherwise mah-velous Waldorf Salad. (?!) If you MUST utilize the wretched weed, you should at least cite it on the menu so I know to steer clear or ask for it to be left off. And since I know you just got your new menus printed & likely can't do that, how about ditching it altogether? ;) Ok, ok, a girl can at least ask, because cilantro or no I'll be back for another shrimp taco..."
"I live in Andersonville, and I feel that the restaurant scene has become over saturated. I was a little hesitant to try yet ANOTHER new restaurant, but was def curious about Little Bad Wolf. OMG, my partner and I absolutely LOVED it. We both consider ourselves foodies... but we are jerks in the sense that one bad thing can keep us from going back for a 2nd try. NOT ONE bad, or even lukewarm unpleasant thing to report. Food: We ordered a burger, 2 bao's, a taco and brussel sprouts. Presentation was utterly delightful. The fries come in a miniature fry basket! The brussel sprouts come in a little cast iron frying pan!!!  The only thing I might suggest is maybe putting a small square of wax paper under the bao's b/c they stick to the plate. (I am a restaurant GM-- used to manage an Asian place so can't help myself.)  Every bite was delicious, right down to the sauces.Ambience: it is VERY small and I am guessing often very packed, so if you have a large group expect to wait for a table. We were a party of 2 on a Monday night, and there was a wait so we sat at a communal table. This is something we never do, but it turned out to not bother us at all.  The painting are really cool and ominous. Walls are dark but tasteful. very sturdy tables and a wooden bench along the front wall. The banquet looks very comfy-- cushioned. All in all, it is very laid back vibe.  Music was 90ish hip hop, which we loved. Drinks: They have a HUGE selection of spirits/liquor. Great selection of beer. I did not taste the cocktails (b/c I had a tasty draft raspberry beer) but I will FOR SURE be back to sample them. Service:  Service was just the right level of charming for such a small joint. Something was almost delivered to us that was for the other people at our communal, but even that didn't bother us b/c it looked and smelled so good. The guy who brought it over was very nice, and apologetic. They took very good care of us, without being intrusive. My partner drinks a lot of water and soda, and her glass was never empty. All staff pitches in to help each other, which is something I have always felt is the marker of a well run restaurant. All staff seemed geniunely happy; everyone smiles! I know this seems like it shouldn't be worth mentioning, but this is really rare.  My partner says it is her new fav place. (she is very hard to please).  I can't remember the last time I was inspired enough to yelp... but I did this as soon as I got home b/c I want this restaurant to make it. If you haven't been there... go.. right now. Excellent on all fronts. Well done Little Bad Wolf."
Everything is SO delicious! I love the burgers and the fries. The tacos are also great and I really enjoy the atmosphere.
Great spot! The entire staff is very friendly every time I go. They have not your father's root beer which is amazing. Cocktails are all spot on delicious. Try the Fish/Shrimp Tacos and the Pork Bao. And of course the burgers and mac n cheese are bomb!
"I enjoyed this place, and my review is solely based on the drinks and ambiance.  I will definitely need to come back to try some of the food after reading the other reviews!  I knocked off one star because of the bartender's ""holier than thou"" attitude with my friend and I while we sat at the bar.  Wasn't very outwardly friendly and didn't really go out of his way to provide helpful information on drink recommendations.  More or less reiterated what was already printed on the menu.  I'm not letting that ruin my experience, as everybody has off nights.  Will be back!"
"The pork taco and the bao were delicious.  The burger was good but not as creative as I wanted.  Also, why even bother with the American cheese option, it just seems cheap and not daring... go for the gusto... be a big bad wolf or, better yet, a wolf dressed in red riding hood's outfit... surprise and delight with your sharp claws and pointy fangs.  The service was good, I'll be back."
"Came here on a Friday night and the atmosphere is definitely cool and unique. Started out w a bunch of craft cocktails that were all simple but very well put together. The crab cake is the best appetizer our group ordered but the fried shrimp were huuuge. Now on to my favorite part of the night: the fried chicken. It was juicer, crispier and seasoned better than any fried chicken I've had in this city. I'll definitely be coming back."
"Great addition to the awesome food offerings of Andersonville.  Burger was GREAT, on par with DMK & Au Cheval burgers.  Love the funky industrial decor vibe, great cocktails - will plan on eating here on the reg!"
"Great place!  They still need to work it some kinks with their serving staff, but it's a new spot so that's to be expected.  Owner/manager is very friendly and came over at least twice to make sure our meal was alright.  Food was great, I don't usually like fried chicken because it's too greasy, but it was pretty amazing here!  There were six of us and everybody loved their food!  Super reasonable prices.  Support this place!"
"Love this place!  Andersonville is a tough neighborhood to compete in, restaurant-wise, but I can already tell that Little Bad Wolf is going to develop a cult following.   The space is warm, cozy and beautifully decorated and the staff and owners are SO amazingly nice.  The bar menu is off the hook, with over a hundred beers and an array of unique liquors and fun, funky cocktails.  And the food.  Oh man, the food.  The first thing I tried was the Bad Burger, and it was perfection.  Meat Nirvana on brioche, with homemade pickles!  I tried the baos last time, also ridiculously good.  My husband got the tacos, and he inhaled them all and then literally licked his plate clean before I had a chance to steal a bite.  He said they were the best tacos he's had in Chicago - even better than Big Star.  ""Nuff said."
"As the other reviewers stated, the food is delicious.  The place is SMALL.  Somehow, despite reading over and over and over again that this place is quaint, small, wishes that it was bigger, I still didn't expect it to be as small as it was. No matter, we went on a Monday night around 8:00 p.m.  It was perfect because it wasn't crowded at all.  We sat at the bar and was tended to right away, our drinks and food came out right away.  The drinks were cold and delicious and the food was hot and tasty.  To drink we ordered Green Eyes and La Chaparara (or something like that).  To eat my husband had the Wolf Burger with fries and I had the fish tacos, one with corn tortilla and one with Bao.  Both were absolutely delicious.  They have outdoor seating, so I'm looking forward to visiting when the weather gets warmer!!"
"This place almost has it nailed, I'm hoping they continue to grow up and refine the food and ESPECIALLY the service. Brussel sprouts were really tasty aside from being salty enough to turn Lake Michigan into the Dead Sea. Chicken Bao was too spicy for a spice lover, will be a turn off for most palates. Otherwise,  we tried almost all the tacos and Baos,  they're all very solid. Mini burgers were PHENOMINAL as were the fries. They really need to work on the attitude and speed of their service, I've been there 2x, in parties of 2 and 6, service was annoyingly slow both times.  Waited 15 minutes after ordering the first round with the group of 6. Lastly, after the ridiculous wait and missed drink order, the sazerac was undersized but a VERY good cocktail."
"We went to LBW on a Thursday night with a group and the place has a great vibe. The decor made for a nice and cozy setting.  Great lighting and a unique copper bar top that is very inviting. Robust selection of cocktails, beer and bourbon to keep a guy happy. My wife and I were just there for drinks, but others in the group had dinner and it looked amazing.  Let's just say that we'll be eating there next time. Highly recommended!"
"Little Bad Wolf is awesome! We had an amazing dining experience. The ambience is very cool- decor was sophisticated and unique. I've never walked into a place that looked like this. The food was also very impressive. The tacos are incredible. My wife and I shared the pork, chicken, fish and steak. We loved them all. I can't pick my favorite. These aren't ordinary tacos. Each one had its own twist. Whether it contained jalapeño, pineapple, bacon, or the lime cream, they were absolutely delicious. You have to try them. We also shared the Baos. These are Asian steamed buns with different meats inside. Very satisfied with these tasty buns. I really enjoyed the shrimp Baos with avocado and some type of sweet soy sauce. The Thai chicken and the Japanese pork were delicious too. This place also had wonderful selection of beers and spirits. But most of all, the staff was top notch. They are very attentive, friendly, and make you feel at home at Little Bad Wolf. We will definitely be back for a great dining experience. And I would easily recommend  this place to friends and family."
The Green Eyes was delicious. But the El Chupacabra was tasty! They serve food too. You have to try the fresh chips & guacamole. But the Elotes is a great side to try! YUM....enjoy!
