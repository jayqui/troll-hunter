The Bento Box
"This is a hidden local gem!  The food is fantastic and the portions are huge (plan on having some leftovers to take home). It's byob, if you forget, there is a liquor store just down the corner. (With an atm as it is also cash only).Be a little patient with the food delivery, as great care is taken delivering freshly prepared food to order.  Great staff - they also do delivery and take out!"
"Another flawless and delicious visit to Bento Box leaves me wondering if there is anything they can't do.  This was my husband's first visit and he was as blown away as I was. We called an hour ahead and easily got reservations for two on a Friday evening. I was too pregnant but my husband took advantage of the BYOB and no corkage fee. The two of us shared the pork & cabbage egg rolls, the fried oyster bahn mi, and the red chili chicken Singapore noodles. The noodles were just as amazing and delicious as my previous visit, but the real surprise was how amazing the other 2 dishes were.  The food was plentiful and we ended up bringing a portion of the noodles home with us. Both of us were satisfyingly stuffed and all for only $42. In two trips to Bento Box, I've now experienced the best noodle dish I've ever had, the best green curry mussels I've ever had, the best egg roll I've ever had, and the best bahn mi I've ever had.  I've had many meals I have been blown away by in Chicago, but Bento Box is one of the few places who has delivered a perfect meal each time. We already plan to come back next time both appetizers are on the menu and just get an order of the egg rolls and two bahn mi sandwiches."
"Had a wonderful Friday night experience at Bento Box. I ordered Spicy Singapore Noodles with Chicken and it was wonderful - soft but crunchy noodles with a nice and mild spice to them. My wife had the Korean Beef Bi  Bim Bop, which was also quite tasty. Both meals were rather generous portions, and with the cozy, intimate setting and kind staff, we will be back.BYOB (no corking fee); reservation recommended; cash only; menu changes daily."
"The food: 4/5. We ordered pork spring rolls, Red Chili Chicken Singapore Noodles with Thai Basil and Grilled Scottish Salmon with Tempura Mushrooms. Pork spring rolls came as a set of 2 and were very flavorful, albeit a little greasy. The Scottish salmon was cooked to perfection, but the fillet was on the smaller side and the tempura mushrooms were mediocre. The red chilli chicken Singapore noodles was the most disappointing dish. It came as a huge portion, but it was all noodles and barely any chicken. The little chicken in it was tender and flavorful, but had skin on and was very fatty.  We took left over noodles which lasted us another 2 meals, but would I pay $22 again for basic noodles and little chicken? I think not. The service: 2.5/5. When we made the reservations, they said we only had an hour and a half because they were closing for a private party. On the off chance we showed up 40 minutes earlier and were seated right away. Although we finished our meal in  an hour, there was an entire bottle of sake for us to finish, but we were getting dirty looks from the hostess waiting for us to leave. We also got zero explanation of the menu when ordering. The first greeting we got was the question ""what would you like to order?"". Overall: 3.5/5. It's a more contemporary spin on East Asian food, but there is absolutely nothing Japanese about the Bento Box. A little overpriced, but the food is enjoyable, even though it's not on my short list of places to go back to."
"Small, cozy, and very favorable food.  Love that it's BYOB"
"Went here the other night. The food is great, we had the Beef Bulgogi and the Singapore noodles. Is it worth $22 per entree? I'm not sure. I think around $16-18 would be more reasonable, although their serving sizes were large. Based on Yelp's standard of $$ meaning $11-30/person, it's accurate. But, usually this means there will be a few entree's below $20 in my experience. But, there were only 3 menu options, all over $20. Appetizers were either $8 and $12 on the night I went. The place is very small, probably 6-7 tables with their daily menu in chalk on the wall, so you won't really know what they're serving until you show up. Service was fine, but the food took 30-35 minutes to arrive despite having 1-2 tables open. Definitely a good idea to BYOB to pass that time."
"Had an excellent family style meal here with another foodie couple who had highly recommended this place.  It is definitely a small and cozy space, so make reservations ahead of time to ensure a spot.  The menu changes daily, so there's a nice variety of dishes and the availability is always changing.  The advantage of eating family style is the chef chooses the menu items for the table, so there can be a mix of what's on the menu as well as a dish off menu.  You can also request specific menu items you want to try.  The flavors and ingredients are fresh and complex.  I typically don't like spicy and my mouth was on fire for several of the courses, but it was worth it!  My favorite dish was the Red Chili Chicken Singapore Noodles with Thai Basil.  Food presentation was amazing.  It was a lot of food per course, but we were able to split the leftovers to take home.  Just don't forget to bring cash and booze since it's BYOB."
"First off, let me say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. But here's what you need to know about this place before going.-Very small. Seats about 22. Best to call ahead to see if there's a wait.-BYOB with no corkage fee!-Changing menu with probably about 4 entrees and 2 appetizers listed at a time. They do run out of items.-There is no bento box at this place! Apparently, they tried it and it didn't work, but the owner kept the name. Also when we went, there were no dishes that were Japanese which is also deceiving. Items listed when we were there were korean bi bim bop, korean beef bulgogi, tandoori chicken, green curry mussels, and egg rolls.-CASH ONLY!-Price: entrees are $20-25 dollars."
"I live right down the street and it took me almost 2 years to finally come, but now that I've been I'll be back for sure! Great food, great service, BYO, tiny spot... what's not to love? This is actually the only place I've been where the $20+ bi bim bop was totally worth it! In addition to everything else we had."
Love this place. It is around the corner and went twice this week.  The Singapore noodles are great with pork or chicken.  Try the family style stuff when ordering.  Jackie is great and yes you should make a resi
"Well spiced, seasonal,thoughtful food.  Really great Asian Fusion, with a large nod to Indian cuisine, a cuisine that in my experience is typically overlooked in this food genre.  They make all sauces and curries in house, and have a limited rotating menu that is written on the chalkboard.  I especially love that aspect, because it usually takes me forever to decide on what I am going to order!The waitress/hostess/runner/ is so friendly and really wants you to enjoy your dish and is great at helping you pick what you want to order.  They always have some type of curry/rice, noodle, and appetizer, and then have different meats/fish rotating through as well.  We had the monkfish curry, vegetarian Singapore noodles (a couple of dishes can always be made vegetarian), and OMG Amazing Mussels (I wanted to drink the broth after we were finished). Dishes all have just the right spice, whether it be heat, salt, sweet, etc.Last thoughts: BYOB.  Make reservations.  Only 16 seats and they fill up fast on a busy night.  Cozy but modern.  And I love the giant buddha/sumo guy painted on the wall (apologies if I am ignorant on the proper classification)."
"I would give Bento Box 10 stars if I could!!  We love to explore this city through food and drinks.  We ended up at Bento Box on a Friday night after reading so many positive reviews on Yelp.  What a spectacular place with spectacular food!  So much flavor in each dish, we were totally blown away.  Plus it's BYOB, bonus!  Bento Box is now in our top 5 favorites in all of Chicago (it's a big deal to say that!).We took our parents, who are all ""foodies"", here on Easter weekend.  We did what they call Family Style which simply means we pay $40 per person and the chef brings you multiple courses, even some items that are not on the menu.  The chef is such a great guy, very personable, and so talented.Tips: Bring cash, its cash onlyBYOBGo with a group and do the Family Style so you can try many things (best value)They do to-go food...yummyFree street parkingMake a reservation, they only seat 18 peopleLIKE them on Facebook so you can see their menu (changes daily)"
"Bento Box is now one of my top 5 BYOB restaurants in Chicago. They consistently delivery exceptional quality Asian food with that captures the essential characteristics of the ethnic cuisine...aka this is not Americanized Asian food. Don't get me wrong...this is also not a hole-in-the-wall asian food joint where you get heaps of authentic food for ~$5 per plate...no Bento Box takes a step in the gourmet direction. What types of food? The spicy beef bulgogi is a staple here and is always delicious. Sometimes they will do soba noodles, a bibimbap, korean or japanese style chicken, but whatever it is, they do it well. What I like most about the chef is that he is not afraid to go bold and spicy with his flavors. If a dish is meant to be spicy, it will be spicy! On our last visit we tried the lamb samosas which were excellent - spicy minced lamb filling and a perfect mint chutney sauce to accompany it. The new Jindori chicken with saam was also superb - really nice smokey bbq, soy, and chili flavor.I also appreciate the fact that the chef is sourcing most of his meats and vegetables from local farms/producers. This is a big plus for me. My only complaint is that they are closed Mon-Wed. Otherwise, do not hesitate to bring a bottle of wine and enjoy some delightful asian food."
"I have eaten at Bento Box twice now and both times were fantastic experiences. Every menu item has been above and beyond my expectations. As some of the other yelpers have mentioned, it is very small. I, however, find that to be part of its charm. It is BYOB and cash only as well. Love this place!"
"The short menu here is a mix of Asian cuisine: Japanese, Indian, Malaysian, etc.  The ingredients were incredibly fresh and flavorful.  We had the Singapore Street Noodles which was very flavorful with fresh basil, although I would have preferred the dish a bit more spicy.  The Lamb Rogan Josh was outstanding and happily it did have a bit more heat! It's also BYOB with no corkage fee which makes it the perfect neighborhood spot!Make sure to call ahead for a table as it fills up pretty quickly."
So first you need to know that I am not a fan of Asian food. My friends are trying to get me to expand my horizions.That said this place was awesome!Right away we were greeted and welcomed warmly. After we were seated the chef came over and asked us about any dietary needs. He asked us to trust him and just let him cook. Now I was a bit nervous since as I said I am not a fan of Asian food but he assured me that his food was not typical Asian cuisine. In the end I agreed and I am very glad I did.We started off with his pork egg rolls ... they were amazing! Extremely flavorful and just a hint of heat.The second course was a kind of Asian taco that was again awesome!The last course was his take on Pad Tai ... it had cuts of beef and shrimp ... it was very good.As previous reviewers have said this place is BYOB ... they were very accommodating ... my friend brought rum and coke ... they went out and got a bag of ice for him so it would be cold ... great customer service.This is a small place that doesn't take reservations so I would not take a large party despite the other review talking about taking a party of 7. Not that they can't do it but they may have just gotten lucky.There is street parking and I saw several spots very close to the restaurant even as late as 7 PM.I would highly recommend this place and if you are nervous about Asian food give this place a try you won't regret it
"Right off the bat Bento Box started strong - friendly welcome from the staff, good atmosphere, music at a conversational volume. Drink orders/BYOB assistance was immediate and helpful. Then the menu was described. Everything sounded delicious and because there were four of us I got at least a bite of most things. Had both the mussels and egg rolls to start, then bison on green tea soba noodles, Korean fried chicken, pork noodles and beef bulgogi. Everything was amazing. Definitely a new favorite place in the neighborhood. Reasonably priced too for the quality and service. Get a reservation and get there soon!"
"Umm.....this is some damn good food.I'm so glad I live around the corner. I've gotten take-out and dined in half a dozen times now and have loved every single thing I've ordered. It's a small, changing menu, so there is always something new to try. They can also turn most of the dishes into vegetarian or make something off-menu for the veggie eaters out there."
"It's hard to stand out in a neighborhood replete with quality BYOB eateries, but after two years living in Bucktown I'm ashamed for not having eaten here sooner. This has to be the best eats for not too much money in the entire city. Perfect balance of heat and savory and sweet in the Red Chili Singapore Noodle bowl. I want to inhale this food instead of oxygen. Get your butt over here and enjoy the night!"
"This place is a rare gem.  It's about as big as a Bento Box, but man, what great food AND service.   Do NOT miss the fried chicken, even if you order it as something extra for the table.  And if you get the mussels, order extra toasted bread up front.   It's BYOB but if you're not prepared, Evolution Wines and Spirits is close."
"This restaurant is one of the main things I regret about moving away from Chicago! After nearly 30 years of disliking anything with curry (even after spending 2 weeks in India), a curry dish at this place opened up a whole new world of food for me and my husband. I think it was a coconut curry with sweet potato and the chapati that did the trick. The Singapore noodles and the bi bim bap are my favorites, and the hostess and chef are so friendly! The space is small, clean, and comfy. It's also closed three days a week, so make sure to check the hours before you go. We loved Bento Box so much we asked the chef to cook a few meals a week for us after our first baby was born. My husband and I got to focus more on our baby boy, and less on meal planning and preparation, and our son got to eat some of the tastiest food when he first started eating solids. The ingredients were always fresh and Rick was great to work with. His food was delicious, and put to shame most of the other home cooked meals I've eaten since. The more I write about this, the more I miss being able to just run down the street and get take-out from the Bento Box."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to The Bento Box and will be back very soon! This place is small but cozy with probably less than 20 seats. The menu is displayed on a chalkboard and its byob, yay! We really enjoyed the spicy tuna tempura rolls, tandoori chicken, and red chili chicken Singapore noodles. Service was good, food was amazing, I will be keeping an eye on the ever changing menu."
"This is an overall excellent restaurant. It has everything you have ever wanted - food your tastebuds will thank you for, BYOB with no extra charges, very sweet wait staff, and enough food to enjoy for two days! The menu changes weekly or daily... Never been there with the same options, but it is always good. If you like a little heat to your food this is your spot! The stand out is any noodle dish. Their noodles must be made from scratch because they are the best I've ever had! I suggest calling ahead since this place is tiny! I usually order an appetizer and two main dishes and my bill is always under $50. My boyfriend refers to this place as ""first date magic"" ... Definitely a great date spot!"
"Insanely delicious. Great food, good people, and great atmosphere. I would recommend following the chef's menu where they cook for larger groups and have a bit more freedom with what direction they go in. Highly recommended!"
"This was an absolutely outstanding dining experience.The chef offered my friend and I a multi course tasting menu, which included the bibimbop, pho, egg rolls, and chicken with these incredible chili potatoes. It was absolutely beautiful from start to finish. The chef was personable and informative, and the server/waitress Jackie was an absolute sweetie. It was such a stormy night, so the place was a bit slow until around 8.  I couldn't believe how much each dish exceeded my expectations and offered such a lovely spin on traditional asian dishes. I will definitely be back- everything I had was truly delicious and left me feeling full in the best most nourished way."
"This place is worth the drive from wherever you are from! Wisconsin, Indiana or far suburbs.  Bring a bottle of wine and just enjoy the delicious, cooked to perfection Asian cooking. Had the Chicken Singapore noodles and Curry Mussels.(large portions) Great service as well.  This place is always crowded, therefore I suggest making a reservation.   Highly recommend!"
"OMG sooo good!  They have super small menu just written up on a chalkboard that they told us can change daily based on what fresh ingredients the chef is able to find.  There were 3 of us and we tried 3 dishes, we were so stuffed but wished we could have tried more!  Everything we had was so delicious!  Service was also really great, really nice waitress who chatted with us and told us about the restaurant.  The chef also came out and spoke to us for a little while!  Totally a hidden gem, such a nice place is not what I expected from walking by it everyday.  So glad I gave it a try!"
"This place was seriously good. Thank you Yelp for your guidance! The food has a ton of Korean influence. My girlfriend got something like Bi Bim Bap with  salmon... It was awesome. I had the Vindaloo (curry). It was incredible. The meat was so crispy and I could have drank a cup of that sauce alone... So good. And of course, you can never beat BYO."
"Since we live in the neighborhood, we've passed by this place numerous times without really understanding what it was.  Bento box for $20 seemed to be a little weird and expensive, but I am so glad that we decided to give this place a chance!We came here on a Wednesday night (called first to make sure there is room, since it is tiny) and armed with a bottle of crisp white wine - were immediately seated.  The server explained the menu in great detail (we didn't even look at the board) and provided her recommendations.  It sounded so good from the descriptions, we just told her to pick 2 entries for us, since we couldn't decide.  Since we were starving, we started out with the egg rolls, that really were excellent, despite being $7 for two small rolls.  My understanding is that they use the freshest and best ingredients in their food, so it is at a bit of a premium.   The food sure tasted good, so I believe it and will pay for freshness!  This is why their menu changes all the time as well, which I totally appreciate.  For our main courses, we got the beef Singapore noodles and chicken jidori - both were finger licking good!  Portions were pretty big, I had the noodles for lunch the next day.  They are award winning for a reason.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back and try other fresh things in this place!  So glad that we finally gave it a chance.  There were much more take-out orders that Wednesday night, and I do think that the place (being so small) might be better suited for that."
Fuxking love this place. Can y'all pick a better music channel? Can you do jazz or blues or something else other than 90's rock.  And damn you people for catching on.  Now I usually have to wait to eat. BYOB
"Quite possibly the nicest, most delicious food I've tasted in this neighbourhood. Great atmosphere, fantastic staff, can't praise it enough. Reasonably priced, great portion sizes, byob! Definitely going to be a regular customer. I had the bulgogi beef and rice, so many levels of flavour! We also had the Singapore noodles.....amazing! Can't wait to go back"
One of the best places I've ever eaten! Order what the waitress recommends! The staff is so nice and you will have food enough for another meal! Highly recommended!!
This place is amazing.  We went here with a group of friends and had the family style chef's choice. Everything was so amazing.  The restaurant is really quaint and the staff is so nice!  We will definitely be going again soon.
"Was here this past Saturday night.  The place is extremely small so make sure to call in and make a reservation.  Sits about 20-25 people.  We arrived early and luckily, there was a table for four available.  The place is BYOB and they were extremely helpful with helping us get situated.  Brought us a bowl of ice and rocks glasses as we were making mixed cocktails.  They have a rotating menu.  Literally, items were coming off the menu and new ones were going up while we dined there.  We ordered the entire menu.  Probably 6-7 dishes and shared them all.  This was some of the best food I've had.  Food highlights: We started with the mussels.  They had a buttery garlic with coconut milk sauce at the bottom.  Very subtle coconut milk taste.  Mussels were served with Italian sliced bread, which was so good when dipped in the sauce at the bottom of the dish.  Mussels were perfection.  Egg rolls were pretty good.  Loved the wrap, which is made in-house and you can tell.  Next we had a fried chicken dish, which was served with cold soba noodles and had just a hint of sesame oil.  The fried chicken coating was perfect and did not have the ridiculously oily skin you find in other fried chicken.  Good combination of chicken with noodles.  Almost like their version of chicken salad.  One of the best dishes was the braised short ribs with potato salad served with a fried egg on top.  Great combination, short ribs were soft and tender with the potato salad topped with a fried gooey egg.  Anything with a fried egg tends to be a fave.  Good combo of textures and flavor all in one dish.  Best of all, after ordering the entire menu, we spent about $150 after tip.  Not bad for four people!  Can't wait to come back!"
"This place is outstanding!  Food is seasoned to perfection. My wife and I were amazed at the Chefs deft hand. Nothing was overpowering, but everything was full of flavor. Curried mussels, fried chicken and the pork belly fried rice were big highlights; however, everything was great."
"Similar to another reviewer, we live in the neighborhood and have never been. Ordered to go the other night. I knew they have a limited menu that changes often, so I called and the woman who answered was SO nice and walked through the entire thing with me. We settled on lamb curry and the vegetarian bi bim bop. When we opened it up, everything was nicely labeled including all of the small side containers (peanuts etc.). Both dishes were absolutely excellent. My only gripe is that it's very expensive. I understand that it's fresh ingredients, but it was almost $50 for these two things. We would probably go once a week if it weren't for that!192/365"
"This place is absolutely incredible. We got the egg rolls (YUM), and I got the bulgogi with rice and homemade kimchi which was so good I want to eat every day for the rest of my life. BYOB, and very friendly staff. It's absolutely tiny in there, but we were seated immediately so it didn't seem to be a problem."
"This place is AWESOME! The food is SO good. I can't wait to go back there again. The staff are nice. I was a little skeptical because the outside is very unassuming, but I was blown away by how good the food tasted. I got the bulgogi, and I wanted to kiss someone, it tasted so good. I enjoyed the egg roll, and I don't even like egg rolls. I tried my friends' dishes, and those were good too. My only qualm with the place was that it was a little chilly. We went towards the end of winter/beginning of spring."
"Major neighborhood score!  Living just down the street from this little hole-in-the-wall, we are super pumped about how much we LOVED it.  I stopped by to grab takeout for lunch on a Tuesday.  I placed my order and the woman working the register let me know it would be about 15 minutes and offered me a glass of water and a seat at one of the tables.  The order was done in probably 10 minutes and I was on my way.The menu changes all the time, so I'm not sure how helpful this will be, but should you see the pork belly Singapore noodles on there - get them!!!!  OMG, I can't stop thinking about those noodles.  Best I've ever had.  And yes, they're a bit steep at $16, but my husband and I shared them for lunch and it was more than enough food.  We also had an order of the pork eggrolls, which are 2 for $7 and they're delicious as well.  Seriously, this place rocks.  We'll be back SOON, maybe to dine in this time since it's apparently BYOB."
"Probably the best pan-Asian I've had in Chicago.  Amazing noodles, egg rolls and bulgogi.  Will become one of my regular places."
The food is all high quality and well thought out. BUT it is expensive for take out and their menu revolves around the same 10 items. I have been there 4 times. I have tried everything on the menu at least once. wont be back till I see something new.One plus is that the map room is across the street for after dinner beers.
"I adore this place!  Fabulous food. Although the menu is small, everything is perfectly prepared and seasoned.  Definitely make reservations because the restaurant is tiny and packed with locals who seem to love the place as much as I did :)"
"Went for another trip, and MAN, my second trip the service must've been off, because this time, it was AWESOME!  We split pork egg rolls, fried oyster banh mi sliders, and pork belly and sweet potato curry.  Everything was perfect!  Big flavor."
"Bento Box is a great little restaurant with a small but inventive Korean/Vietnamese type menu.  As others have said, they are BYOB, which makes up for the fact that the entrees tend to be priced on the high side for this type of food ($14-20).  It's definitely worth every penny, and it has become a regular place for me.They are losing a star because at least four times that I've called to order something, they have been ""out"" of that item.  Their menu changes daily and they only serve 4-5 items per day.  How are you ""out"" of chicken?  There are butchers everywhere.  Go buy more chicken, and give it to me.  They seem to make enough money doing things this way, so they probably don't care, but seriously - give me my goddamned chicken.Edit: I got my chicken, it was amazing, I don't care anymore."
"Bento Box is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. For starters, the food is delicious. Everything is made from scratch, down to the curry sauce (not the packet seasoning that most places use!) and is always fresh and seasonal. Because of this, the menu is constantly changing, which makes it fun to go back time and time again. Also, I need to mention the Singapore Noodles, I mean...ridiculous!! The icing on the cake is that the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There is only one waitress, who is both friendly and knowledgable, and the head chef is always nearby (you can see right into the kitchen). Plus, it's BYOB. Perfect date spot."
"Holy bulgogi!Yes, this restaurant is the size of a large bento box (16 person capacity), but delicious things come in small packages!At first glance, the daily changing menu looks sparse and a bit expensive (entrees ranging from $18-22).  Don't be fooled.  All you need, all you'll ever want will be printed on their menu chalkboard.  Bento boxes here are also supersized versions of their original skinny Japanese selves.  They're also BYOB, so that'll help you rationalize the cost.Menu changes daily. Everything made from scratch. Massamam curry short ribs with chili jam ($21).  The oh so tender cuts of short rib were swimming around in a mild yellow curry along with small bites of potato and peas. The side of cauliflower was surprisingly delicious.  I hate cauliflower but whatever sprinkling of paprika, herby fair dust they used truly worked its magic on my tastebuds.  Julie R.'s pork belly with Singapore noodles and oyster mushrooms ($18) was above and beyond what I expected. Salty, crispy, tender pork belly atop a mountain of crunchy think egg noodles.  Thank goodness, she likes to share!  Needless to say, I'll be making a return trip to Bento Box and I'm hoping the dishes we ordered will be making a come back too!  \"
"Not many places get my five-star review, but this place was such a surprise, it is well deserving. Went with a group for a birthday, I knew nothing about the place but when we arrived they started bringing out dishes that amazed everyone. From the pork egg rolls, brisket pho and Jidori Chicken, I was so stuffed! We shared everything and still had plenty of food left. The service was wonderful and well-timed for a large group. The space is small so I felt bad taking up so much room but it didn't seem to get overly crowded at all. And it's BYOB- which just totally makes it a go-to. Can't wait to go back!"
"o m gsooooo loved this place and it was soooo not even on my radar until now.  Not usually my neck of the Chicago woods, being in Bucktown but we were meeting some friends who swore it was awesome.  They were right.BYOB which I am always in favor of.  I admit to being a little picky when it comes to my beverages so picking my own before hand is always preferred.But the food was really great.  Not crazy pricing and excellent asian fusion.  I tried something from nearly everybody's plate.  It was okay.  They're all good friends.  Chicken and pork were my favs.  But noodle dish was my serious hit of the night.  As the name would imply, they were those incredibly tasty skinny noodles like I grew up eating even though they had no nutritional content.  Ramen?  Only created by an actual chef and spiced to perfection.Sorry to ramble.  On the run to a meeting.  Just wanted to get this one on the books for posterity.  Short version is ""go eat here""  ""delicious"" ""good pricing"" ""byob"""
"Fantastic!  A gem of a place! My hubby and I did not know what to expect and we where blown away with every bite. We had the egg rolls and the mussels to begin with, they were both delicious. For an entrée my husband had the bison flank steak and I had the salmon over jasmine rice with coleslaw,  they were both heavenly delicious. We'll be coming back soon and I can see ourselves being frequent visitors."
"This place is one of my favorite in Chicago.It's a every small place but you can go there with a group..The menu is changing almost every weekend, and everything is so good!It's also BYOB.So recommended."
"The day already started nice with receiving my payout for winning the football pool last week (thank you Dallas for beating Indy).  So my pockets got fatter and I headed home from work.  On the drive back, with cash money burning my pockets, I saw this place open for business.  There hasn't been anything on this property for awhile, so I was excited.Get the bbq bulgogi, it does the damn thing.  It was spicier than other bulgogi I've had, but I think that made the meat more flavorful.  It was good.  I tried the pork belly fried rice and though it was kinda overcooked, it still tasted nice.  The baby bok choy that accompanied it was outstanding.  My only thing was that the portions were kinda small.  But take that with a grain of salt because I'm ravenous and famous for eating two dinners. The menu changes every week, so check the web or call for updates.BYOB for now, and the place is tiny.  We're talking 12-seat dining room tiny.  Friendly owners, and hopefully this place stays awhile. Oh, and I'm going with Dallas again this week over Philly.  Add that to your parlay card, my upset special."
"A friend and I decided to grab drinks in Bucktown and as we sat there we decided we were hungry for dinner so I pulled out my trust yelp! app and looked to see what was in the area. We saw that The Bento Box was in the area and had great reviews so we decided to get it a try. Walking past the restaurant was a little deceiving as it looked like a hole in the wall, there appeared to be no lights on so we could not tell if the place was open as it was 9 pm. However, we looked at the sign and it said they were open until 10 so we walked in. My first impression was small and empty as only 2 of the 16 seats were occupied. We were greeted by a women and she could tell we were a bit uneasy about the lack of customers and so she explained that they are mostly a catering business and through speaking with her we decided to give it a try once we read the menu on the wall. As everyone has mentioned the menu changes daily, when we visited we got the chance to try the spicy tuna roll, tempura oyster mushrooms with chilled soba noodle and jiido chicken with lime leaf curry. Everything was amazing! The lime leaf curry was my absolute favorite!Also, how can you beat BYOB?!?!? There is a liquor store conveniently two blocks away so you don't have to go out of your way if you forget this. The feel is trendy but causal, perfect place for a date!"
"Got the Crispy Beef & Egg Noodles with Sweet Soy & Chipotle Sauce to go. As the girl handed it to me she inquired if I'd had it before (i had not) and then replied that I would love it. Not sure how she knew, but she was right, it was damn good. Somehow the beef managed to endure the trip home and was still crispy and hot when I tore into the over-sized takeout box. Seriously this was the biggest to-go container I've ever seen and it was filled with the delicious noodles and beef. My only complaint is that the meal cost $17. Sure its somewhat reasonable considering the quanity of food, but it'd be great if you could get a half order at half the price..."
my new favorite place. the food was outstanding. best meal i can remember in a long time. the mushrooms were out of this world. so interesting. great atmophere. im so glad i moved in to the neighborhood.
"My only complaint is that quality is inconsistent. The head chef/owner also runs a catering company, so when he is not at this 18 -seater restaurant, the food is not as good. We've basically have had everything on the menu and we've never had anything we didn't love. I'll never admit this to my fiance, so it's a good thing he doesn't read yelp, but I think the cooking here is better than my own cooking. It's the only upscale Asian food in Chicago I'm willing to pay for. Food is well cooked, seasoned, and made with quality ingredients."
"""Simply magnificent"" came out of my fiance's mouth after a few bites. He is not british, nor over 60 years old, and I've never heard him utter anything remotely like this. So, as you can infer, Bento Box is simply magnificent/amazing/delicious/awesome/incredible. We live in the neighborhood and I pass it every day on my commute. We thought it was a ""hole in the wall"" until some friends recommended it and we realized on further exploration that it was actually supposed to be nice and yummy. We were totally blown away! We got same day reservations for Friday night at 6:30, but it was packed when we were leaving (only seats 16). Started with the mussels in a curry sauce with crostinis and seriously, one of the best bites I have ever had in my life. We split two entrees- a short rib masala dish and a fried chicken sweet potato kimchi dish. They were both fantastic but the masala takes the cake. The meat was cooked perfectly, flavors were interesting but not overly done. Only complain is that they don't have dessert! Not like I could have fit it in my belly anyway."
"I wonder if the staff gets a bit nervous when they see Asians walk in to dine.  hmmmm....We were seated right away, but it was very small.  The waitress was very nice.  Explained the menu to us.  Ordered promptly.  I got the Jidori chicken and the hubs got the Bulgogi.  Both delicious.  The bulgogi was tender and nicely spiced sweet and savory.  Served with kimchi and jasmine rice.  The kimchi was standard, like the $5 jar from H-mart.  The chicken was delicious in a curry type sauce and very tender, nicely grilled, not rubbery.  Served with a ginger slaw.  The ginger slaw was refreshing and not too gingery.  So the food was delicious, only the main courses... not so much with the sides.  It would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't overpriced.  $16 for the beef, $18 for the chicken.  $3 for an extra side of jasmine rice?  Yikes.  I guess to an Asian, the $3 for the tiny bowl of rice was overkill considering we know that a 25 pound bag of Jasmine rice on Argyle is $29.99.  And because the place is so small every time someone walked in, a cold blast of arctic air would blow our food cold.  Boooo.  Maybe we'll try this place in the summer and I'll give them one more star back for the door opening..."
"Bento BoxCall ahead if you are coming from far!Menu changes everyday, for updated menu check their Facebook page!The Jorie chicken is delicious!"
Solid menu. Love the kim chi and bulgogi. Never a complaint!
"You have to appreciate Bento Box. First, it's BYO. Second, the food is fresh, refreshing, and flavorful. We've been a few times now and our only complaint is that the limited menu (of 5 entrees) is frequently recycled. But nonetheless, we'll be back."
"We ordered take out from here.  The daily Bento was some sort of pork and sweet potato curry.  The first few bites were ok, then I had a bite that tasted like rotten fish.The pork egg rolls were OK.Not worth the money, or even LESS money.  I ate crackers for dinner and they tasted better.This wasn't just a case of my taste either.  My girlfriend also did not like hers.How are all the reviews so good?"
"Why don't I like this place?  Am I asian?  Everything about it seemed appealing to me...tiny hole-in-the-wall but with cool decor, small menu, bento-box service so you get a little bit of everything... But, uhm, my dish was pretty bad.  I ordered the beef bulgogi, and it was so oversauced and salty I was almost angry.  The bulgogi sauce was the spicy red chili sauce you get with most bulgogis, but it was the same sauce used to flavor the house-made kimchi and the cucumber salad that made up the other parts of the bento-box.  So basically the whole box was covered in the same red sauce and you can't taste anything else.  I gobbled the rice, picked at the beef bulgogi, and sneaked bites of my husband's chicken dish (which was much better) and left hungry.  So disappointing."
"This place has amazing food and is just steps away from my apartment.Things I have had here that I get repeatedly:- Bulgogi bento- Tempura oyster mushrooms (the dipping sauce is to die for) with soba noodlesThings I have gotten once but would hands down get again:- Singapore noodles- Jidori Chicken bentoThings that were slightly disappointing:- Hangar steak (which also happened to be the most expensive dish I have ordered here, so definitely a pass)It's BYOB, so remember to bring some good beer or wine! My only other observation (gripe) is that the prices have been creeping up since they first opened, I'm hoping that it has come to a plateau for now otherwise I'll have to sacrifice bento box for belly shack more often :("
"Low down on Bento Box - it is small.  The one server/hostess/greeter/etc was extremely friendly. The food was extremely tasty and fresh.  The small space allows for an intimate setting for you and whoever you go there with, I would just recommend bringing 6 people or under, less if possible.  The seating in the place all together only seats about 12.  Go there semi-early to guarantee yourself a spot.  We went there at 530-6 on a Saturday and got a table just fine, but don't always bank on that I guess. It was an extremely gorgeous day out that day, so maybe tons of people were BBQing instead ;-)  Everything I tasted was lovely.  The menu is revolving, so the options are always changing.  All in all, this is a great place to bring a significant others, or parents, or friends, or even a ""work date"".  Just be aware of the small space, semi-small menu and sort of steep prices."
"If everything in life was as delicious as Bento Box's Vietnamese Pho, we'd live in a much happier world. In the meantime, I basically just want to eat their Pho every day. However, everything I've ever eaten there has blown away my expectations (Beef Bugolgi, Jidori Chicken, Singapore Noodles).. even ""plain 'ol"" pork egg-rolls at Bento Box are so good I might never be able to eat another egg roll again and be happy.As for the reviews that comment on the small restaurant, slightly higher prices and possible wait-times, etc. my recommendations are to go early or go for lunch and realize how fresh and high-quality the ingredients they use are. Their chicken is amazing and that's coming from someone who feels ""meh"" about chicken.Long story short, Bento Box makes me happy. Especially now that they are open 7days and deliver."
The food was amazing but the portions are small.
"I don't usually eat meat but I'll make an exception for this place.  Their menu is small but they change it just about every week so you're always going to get something new.  Hopefully you can catch them when they're serving buns because they're amazing.  I'm going to keep trying until I catch their fish dishes because they have to be epic.  Bento Box only has seating for 12 so it's mostly a carry out place but they are BYOB in their tiny dining room.  I really hope that they stick around because the're great but I hope they don't get so busy that they run out of dishes and you can't ever dine in because that would make me super sad trombone.  So if you're reading this review:  carry out yes, dine in no, kthanksbye. Love, Kelsey."
"Dam* this place rules. I try to go here at least once a month. The setting is intimate (only a few tables, which could be seen as a problem -- but there's always take-out), the food is neatly prepared, and the ingredients are alarmingly fresh.Typically they have about four entrees from which to choose, and these often rotate on a daily/weekly basis (though there are some mainstays, like the bulgogi beef, which comes highly recommended). Sides and extras also change a bit, but they're always welcome. You'll likely get spicy kim chi, tempura oyster mushrooms, chili jam, or some other eclectic set of complements to the main dish. There are a few appetizers, and I can't recall which ones I've tried, but they've never disappointed.The place is also BYOB, and the liquor store down a block east is perfect for picking up a bottle of wine or a six-pack (from their surprising selection of good beer). If you're arriving from the Blue Line, there is a liquor store on the corner of Milwaukee and Armitage that has a good selection as well."
Go here for lunch and get the Bulgogi Tacos...best tacos you will ever have. I like many of the other dishes here too...Short Ribs are great...but the thing to get are the tacos. They will rock your world. I am pretty sure they are serving them for lunch every day now but call ahead or check their website to make sure.
"We had the pork belly with sweet potato curry and bulgogi for take out.  Super delicious food.  I would give the taste a solid-5-star.  I've taken one star off because of the price.  My husband commented it's the most expensive take out we've ever had.  Also, portion size is small for what you pay.  I finished my box still wanting more. I wish it came with a bit more rice."
"AUHmazing! Yes, I said it. Went here last week and I've been dying to go back! I had the chicken...heaven! The kimchi was uber spicy, but delicious. I think the ultimate winner was the corn on the cob, the lime/cilantro dressing on the corn was the perfect combo. LOVE this place, BYOB and they deliver! It's a small place, probably 6 or so tables, so during the week is prob your best bet. I went Wednesday and it wasn't too crowded. The weekend will be a different story, but they do take a reso for 6 or more, fyi. Overall, bomb.com - Can't wait to go back!"
"Absolutely loved the family style dinner at Bento Box a few nights agowe had the pork egg roll, bulgogi tacos with kim chi salsa, jidori chicken and chinese bbq pork singapore noodles and green curry with lemongrass everything were fabulous and the service was good tooBento box is awesome and i can't wait to try the pork belly buns"
"This has got to be the best addition to Chicago's resturaunt scene in a long time! A small gem flying under the radar, I visited this place 6 days after opening. With only 8 tables, it's a casual atmosphere, almost feels like your in someone's kitchen.  The menu changes every week, the day's selections were posted in the wall. The prices were very reasonable, each Bento Box included a main dish and 3 sides, everything was under $14.  We didn't see any vegetarian options so we asked the chef for suggestions, the benefit of having the chef accessible to you dietary preferences. Wish I lives in the area, I would order on a regular basis. Five stars all around!"
"Asian fusion at its best. LOVED the crispy beef, and the chicken dish we got was so fresh that it tasted like the chicken was slaughtered that day. The place is small and simple, so be prepared to go for the food not the ambiance."
"This was a perfect little dinner spot. They cook everything from scratch, and the menu is always changing. The service was warm, friendly, and attentive. The food was delicious, just the right amount of flavor and spice.The only qualm I could nit pick- is that the tea we ordered was extremely overpriced. They use ""stash"" tea- which you can buy at target for as much as bento box sells one bag. So- Order food - byob - do not order tea unless you like giving away your money."
"Not quite sure how to describe this place, but it literally is a bento box. 5 tables total and the best ever-changing asian-fusion menu Ive ever had. They have about 7 or 8 items to choose from and every single one sounded incredible. Get it all, I dont know how else to put it! They also do provate parties where you can bring your own playlist and they will make Bento Box your very own customized, intimate gathering. A hidden gem for Chitown."
"My husband and I went there last night.  We had the pork belly and sweet potato curry with chili jam and cilantro potatoes.  We absolutely loved the curry.  We would've licked the plate clean if we weren't so stuffed!  We also ordered the beef brisket and noodle soup.  It was basically like Pho but more fancy.  The beef was very tender, and there was a lot of it.  My first reaction to the broth was that it was a little too sour.  We found out that there's lime juice in there.  We still enjoyed the noodle soup, but wished it was slightly less sour.  Other than that, everything was delicious!It's a tiny place with only about 4 tables.  The chef/owner cooked and served our food.  My only criticism is that they need to smile more.  :)  He was very attentive, but kind of unfriendly."
"THE GOOD: Delicious, intimate, ample servings, great presentation, friendly staff.THE BAD: May be impossible to get in unless you are with a private party. THE UGLY:  Nothing ugly"
I ordered the Bulgogi beause there were so many yelps about it. I was quite happy - it was really tasty with a great seasoning and sauce. The other bento box option was a chicken curry dish. I highly recommend trying that if you can. I have no idea what it tastes like but our server said the chicken was killed yesterday kind of fresh. That is some fresh sounding chicken - so try it - and then yelp! Homemade kimchi was a thumbs up. The buns were sticky bun goodness. I wanna go back to here. The hostess did a great job of accommodating us in the small space. You might have to wait - so be prepared to leave and come back if you don't want to stare at other people eating. It's that small.
"I found the menu to be a little confusing as it incorporated Korean, Viet and Thai into their entrees. I honestly had low expectations, and had already pre-judged this place to be one of those trendy asian fusion restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my pho was VERY tasty. It's definitely not as good as the pho you find in viet town, but it was good in its own way. I sort of love that this place is tiny, unassuming, delicious and most importantly BYOB. I'm going there again tonight, so I will write an updated review when I get back. I've heard that their pork buns are really good so I'm definitely trying that tonight."
