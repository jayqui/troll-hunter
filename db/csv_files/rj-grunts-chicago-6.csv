RJ Grunts
"Came here with my husband and another couple after taking pictures at the LP Zoo. We loved it! We started with the onion rings and fried pickles (my fav) which were really good. I got the California wrap which was really good and my husband got a burger which he really liked. The portions are HUGE! And the prices are very reasonable.The atmosphere was fun and our server was really nice. My only complaint would be that after the ice and fruit, there wasn't much Sangria in my drink, but it was still very good!Wish we lived closer, we would come more often!"
"Found this lovely place on my cab ride to Lincoln Park Zoo(just across the street). The staff were all super friendly. My server was a gem. She walked through the menu as it was my first time there. Got the salad bar( huge compared to most, very fresh), the BLT( Yummy!) that comes with 2 pickle spears and fresh made potato chips. As there was a carafe of ice water waiting on the table, I ordered one of their amazing shakes which you can customize. I got a chocolate peanut butter shake that was to die for. I will definitely return here the next time I'm visiting LPZ!"
"great ""chain-like"" food...the menu is similar to that of your suburban brew-pubs and the like, however tastes much better ;) loved my veggie burger - not heavy on the black bean filler and i could actually see what veggies were used to ""create it"". i upgraded to the sweet potato fries and sure glad i did - shoestring and delicious. hubs loved his patty melt and our kid was presented with a fun tray/plate, animal crackers and wikisticks (in addition to the usual coloring sheet and crayons).better than average salad bar, but for $15 a pop, it's not that great. i'd rather get a nice hearty plated meal.only 2 complaints: it's tight in there! i had to keep scooting my seat closer to the table to avoid salad bar traffic. thank goodness they didn't seat anyone in the awkwardly placed 4 top wedged behind us and a pole. i basically could place my elbow on the corner of that table!also - the bathroom...eekoids! small and stinky and of course my kid had a diaper doo doo so it was like a video game trying to change him (on an awkwardly highly placed changing table) and avoid getting whacked by either the (only) stall door, an elbow of someone washing their hands or the bathroom door!"
"THE. BEST. WINGS. IN. CHICAGO. PERIOD. I'm a wing aficionado and I've easily had wing at over 100 establishments in the city and these are by far the best. They're always served piping hot, perfectly crisped and Coates in delicious sauces. Bird's Nest is a close second but for my money, no one beats RJ's wings. The atmosphere is cozy, the staff is friendly and the drinks are stiff. I've inly had the wings, but the salad bar is its own marvel."
"I really wanted to like RJ Grunts. We showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation but they couldn't accommodate us. Not a problem. We walked over to the zoo and enjoyably killed the time till they could seat us. When we got back, they seated us almost immediately. This gives them lots of bonus points in my book. Hence, I wanted to like it.Feeling adventuresome, we decided to try the fried pickles as an appetizer. Not a great choice. Basically it was like chicken McNuggets with a pickle in the center instead of  mystery chicken parts. Not something I would ever get again. I tried their signature burger, the Grunt Burger, as a main course. Big disappointment. It was a very ordinary burger for $13. Not bad, but nothing I would ever get again.The only exceptional part of the meal was the dessert. We got the Cookie Bowl. Wow, that was great. My buddy got an ice cream sundae which he said was very good. So if I were looking for a place for dessert only, this would be a go-to place. But for a dinner, there are a lot of other options that are way ahead of it."
"Not a family friendly place, which is sad, bring across the street from the zoo.  The waitress was not very friendly when informing us of their no strollers policy.  Hopefully some family friendly establishments will open up nearby very soon."
"Good spot to grab a lunch or dinner.  It does get busy so it's wise to make an advanced reservation.  Huge salad bar with lots of choices of greens, pasta & soup selections.  Look thru their menu before going because they have a large selection of choices (Menu: leye.com/files/Menus/Gru…). Overall service was Ok; our server was attentive and prompt with our needs & requests; wait for the food wasn't long and the ambiance was a bit retro with dark amber lights and 60's pictures of women every corner of the wall.I ordered the Old Hickory (Chicken Breast with cajun spices) for $10.95.  It's always an odd feeling for me to order a burger priced over $10.  I am not a fan for paying that much of a burger. My sandwich lacked cajun spices and tasted mediocre.  My wife ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger for $11.95 and tasted like any other burger.  There is nothing here at RJ Grunts that placed their food or service above other restaurants besides their prices. Kids menu available but I don't recommend it.  Very small portions.  Kids ordered chicken tenders/strips and it came with (2) descent sized strips with their homemade chips (potato chips). I don't see a reason to recommend RJ Grunts. It's is over priced.  C'mon who pays $8 for grilled cheese?  Two slices of bread & Kraft Velveeta cheese melted in between (I prefer bacon) too. Gave (3) stars because it's descent but nothing to rave about."
"Great burgers a few blocks away from Lincoln Park Zoo. This place is known for its burgers. I happened to be around the neighborhood and decided to give it a shot. As I was walking towards the restaurant, first thing I noticed was the smell: we could smell hypnotizing delicious burgers even half a block away!Menu is generous and they offer more food beyond burgers. But I wasn't there to explore anything else. I ordered a burger with a poblano pepper inside and was fascinated by it! At first it seemed to have too much cheddar cheese (the fake orange kind), but it turned out to balance the flavor just right. In a party of four, each one of us loved their burgers!I high recommend this place. They offer decently priced and delicious burgers!"
Went here after a long and exhausting day at the zoo...Everything here other than burgers is very PLAIN and boring.  Even the chips with the salsa and guacamole appetizer was the most bland tasting salsa and guac I have ever had.  My fish (I ordered fish and chips) needed to be crispy.  The fries were just not good.  Reminded me of high school cafeteria fries.  I can't stand when a place can't make something as simple as french fries taste good.  Very friendly service though.  I expected WAY better from a Lettuce Entertain You joint.
"Great wings and burgers! Also, a big salad bar if you are trying to eat healthy. They have been around for decades and have pictures of all the waitresses that have worked there over the years. A very cool place and it's one of the first lettuce entertain you restaurants. It's very casual and people are usually friendly. Definitely worth checking out."
"My friend and I were going out to dinner on our way home and decided to get off at a random stop of the Clark bus in Lincoln Park. We ended up here because the sign looked cute. We were immediately seated; the restaurant wasn't busy. Our server immediately greeted us with a smile. We had to ask about specials, which I can shrug because she was extremely sweet. I'm in the industry, so I usually know what to ask about- ie specials, faves, industry discounts, etc. Our server told us that the burgers were the best, so I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger with a turkey patty on a lettuce bun instead of bread. With sweet potato fries because I'm a sucker for those things! My friend got the salad bar with one item (it's an option) - his one item was wings. The salad bar is gigantic and has anything under the sun. I was tempted, but man, I wanted a burger. My burger was amazing! Too much lettuce as the bun, but I just didn't eat what I didn't want. The mushrooms were cute little button mushrooms. Sautéed perfectly. The Swiss was melty and delicious. The sweet potato fries were really good, too! They're cut like shoe string fries. She brought out a chipotle mayo of some kind for me to dip it in because it was something that she liked to pair it with. Service details! I gobbled my whole meal up!I only had water. I would've gotten a cocktail but am on meds because I was a messy bartender the other day and slashed open my finger, putting me on meds to prevent infection- whomp.What was awesome was that, since we were first time guests, our server brought out a 1/2 warmed up chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. HOW CRUEL. We were so full, but one bite into that ooey gooey chocolate chip cookie + it was a wrap! So. Delicious. What a great idea to make the experience memorable. I would go back to try the salad bar. This place is GOOD, yes, and our service was great. But it's nothing too too special, you know?"
"After an extremely long day at work, I had decided to stop into this Lincoln Park gem.After waiting a short time, I was seated in Dori's section.  She is outstanding.  To make a long short, I decided to order the BBQ Ribs, which was the daily special.  When I was presented the incredible platter of ribs.   OMG, the ribs were outstanding.  Dori would check in with me without being overbearing.  There were enough ribs, I had to take half of the ribs home. Again, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Go-to lunch diner spot. Perfect mix of sandwiches and other yummy foods. I've had the turkey burger and also had the salad bar. The burger was fantastic especially with the sweet potato fries. The salad bar is relatively pricey but worth it if you're hungry. I've only been there for lunch so not sure how dinner service is but the lunch service has been good every time even during slightly busier times. Overall it's a decent lunch comfort food spot in the area.
"Amongst all the amazing culinary choices in Chicago, the food is rather unremarkable, but what makes this place shine is the training and service you will find at all Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. That really is a big part of the experience. It seems that all employees have great attitudes, excellent customer service skills, and really leave you feeling happy. They really have great formula - great service, consistent quality, and fair prices. It's always a safe bet. This place seems to be very popular with families with small children. BTW, the turkey club was really delicious!"
"I came here a couple weeks ago with a girlfriend for an early dinner because I have a Lettuce Entertain You frequent diner card and you can make reservations on OpenTable. After reading reviews I was hoping to be blown away. I sorely was not!  :(My burger (Green Chile Cheeseburger) was good, but was supposed to come with cheddar cheese and mine definitely had american on it. My sweet potato fries ($2 up charge!) were mushy and cold. Let's just say that my meal filled me up, but was no where worthy of the price tag on it. Lastly, the decor had a ""run-down Applebees"" vibe to it. Not what I expected. I probably won't be back unless a friend insists we go here."
"Go for the amazing burgers, stay for the tower of onion rings. I run hot and cold at times on the idea of burgers as anything but convenience food. This place totally confirms that the American icon of food can be a high quality taste experience. Cooked to perfection, juicy, on a bun that stands up to the moisture through every last bite - I was so impressed!Did I mention you really should get the tower of onion rings? They're not the thin, crunchy variety you'll find at a lot of fast food places, nor the battered donut kind restaurants tend to serve. They're just thickly sliced onion in a crispy golden coating, and quite perfect. The service was so-so. This didn't affect loving every bite, but had to be mentioned. Our waitress visited our table once to drop off menus, once to take the order, and once to drop off the check (other staff delivered the food and she never checked back). This isn't enough for me not to go back, but I'd be interested to see if it happened again. I was there in a twosome and every other table seemed to be 6+ on that particular night. It's worth bringing friends or the whole family for the quality though, that's for sure."
"This place is dark and kind of small. They are known for their salad bar, so of course that's what I had. It has a wide variety to choose from of lettuces, veges, fruits, and dressings. The service was great even during peak dinner hours. It is also affordable too!"
"Came here after a trip to the zoo and was very pleasantly surprised! The decor and vibe of the place was so unique with pictures and strange paintings all over the walls. It was really packed but for some reason we didn't have to wait to long for a table of 6. Ended up going for the Santa Fe wrap instead of s very tempting burger that they're so famous for just because it was so hot outside I didn't think I could handle something really heavy. When I saw the glorious burgers other people ordered I got a little jealous, but my wrap was actually perfect! It was very fresh and the flavors were amazing. It came with some cottage fries aka essentially some crispy/some soggy potato chips that could've been upgraded to actual fries, but I didn't mind them and they went with my wrap pretty well. The service was really great and I would definitely come back again for burgers or bring other people here if I'm trying to show them a cool restaurant with good food."
We accidently stumbled on this location and were very happy with our lunch choice.  The service was very good and we didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was very friendly and she did a great job of taking care of our kids with their needs.The menu had a lot to choose from for your typical lunch. The restaurant claims they serve the best burgers in Chicago. And they were very delicious. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The homemade chips were also amazing. The only downfall of this restaurant is the small dessert menu.  We have no complaints otherwise.
"Came here after 4 hour delayed flight from DC as it's near my friend's place. It was around 11pm so the waitress did not look too happy to see us. Oh well. There were a few people at the bar and a few others came in while we were eating. I was famished so I got a mushroom burger which came with homemade chips. The food was good. Of course I was starving so may have been biased, but my friend likes this place. Funny: my friend spotted chocolate chip cream cheese on the salad bar that she just had to try. So she asked the grumpy waitress if she could have some which we got. I don't why she was so excited to try this, but she was. I have to say it was weird, but actually pretty tasty. Mostly it was just hilarious though.I'd say if you are looking for a burger and a beer this is a pretty good place. Nothing outrageously outstanding, but it's good. They do have chocolate chip cream cheese though so there's that....."
"Did not care for their salad bar, which looked like it had not been updated since the 80's.  Also, their veggie chilli was not very inventive ... or flavorful.  My bf thought his burger was OK, but wouldn't make a trip to RJ Grunts for another one."
"As someone who formerly ate beef very infrequently until the demise of my health that is Chicago, I developed an affinity for cheeseburgers when I moved to Chicago.  It's true.  I ate a burger about four times a year prior to living here.  Times have changed.  Times have changed indeed.  I've now had enough burgers to rank them!  The best burger in town is not here!  I've been to RJ Grunts several times and am never impressed.  It's just okay and pretty unremarkable.  They do have a nice menu of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, entrees, milkshakes.  This spot is cute, casual, low key, but the spacing and seating is crowded and feels crammed and tight and unrelaxing.  Overall the menu is  overpriced considering the quality and taste.  The burgers are just okay.  The homemade chips are good but often times soggy and undercooked.  The fries are okay but I believe there is an extra charge for fries as your side dish.  The salad bar has a nice selection but is very overpriced.  The brunch is disappointing, not a big selection of items and feels like a cafeteria.  The chocolate chip cookie dessert is good.   Service is always unremarkable.  Overall, this place is just alright but there are far better similar spots."
"I met up with a few friends in Lincoln Park yesterday for dinner. This place wasn't all that it was talked up to be. The booths are very small and I'm not even a big man. They're almost uncomfortable for four people. I'll say this is a cool neighborhood restaurant/bar to have a drink at or something but I wouldn't spend my money here again for dinner. The margaritas were inexpensive. My burger was not worth $15.00 at all---I could have a much better burger at First Draft in Printer's Row for less than what I paid at RJ Grunts. The service was decent, nothing spectacular. I'm actually quite shocked this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant."
"As a newbie to Chicago, I've been on the lookout for new spots and with RJ Grunts right in our building this one was an easy choice.Known for their salad bar, it does not disappoint. It comes with unlimited salad and a choice between two soups of the day. There is some vanilla frosting with chocolate chips that is an absolute must. It's perfect on the fruit, or on the waffles that are a part of their weekend brunch. I'd definitely order an appetizer if you just plan on getting the salad bar, as their pricing structure will result in the total cost about being the same as the salad bar on its own.The rest of their menu is phenomenal comfort food with daily specials, and a monthly gourmet burger that is always tasty. They make a great grilled cheese complete with multiple types of cheese and you have the option to choose between cottage fries (homemade chips), regular fries or sweet potato fries.The biggest drawback is the bar. While they do offer a selection of craft brews, they are on the pricier side. There are some seasonal cocktails that they offer, but it's really not a place to go if you are looking for drinks to be a integral part of your experience. Stay away from the Bloody Mary, it's just some standard bottle mix and a celery stick. Nothing special at all."
"One really can't go wrong at Grunts...a nice little casual family restaurant on the near north side. Grunts was the first Lettuce Entertain You palace for Rich Mellman. He started it in the 1970s and it quickly became a little hangout for the Chicago Bears players of that era...which insured Grunts of gaining a bit of press and buzz. Early on Grunts used to take pictures of the waitresses and put them up on the wall...and they remain their today exhibiting the fashion and hairstyles of the 1970s. Now to the food.Started really as a hamburger place they have expanded into a wide ranging menu. They still make great hamburgers and patty melts, but also serve up wonderful slabs of BBQ ribs and wings (three heat levels of buffalo or just plain BBQ), along with daily specials such as salmon and carne asada. Grunts arguably started the salad bar fad back in the 1970s and continues it today. There are something like 50 items on the salad bar including two daily soups and a little jello or custard finisher. You can get the salad bar with any meal or all by itself...refills are always unlimited. All around portion sizes are large.For the libations...Grunts has a little bar on your right when you walk in (you can also eat at the bar). It is a full-service bar that can mix up most any drink...and they make a few specials every day, albeit a bit pricey. The Grunts margarita was just ok...premade and a bit on the small side. Look on the mirror on the back wall of the bar and you'll find the listing of the craft beers offered that day. They do not pretend to be a beer palace and do not have a particularly large selection of craft beers, but do offer a half dozen or so stand-bys...along with PBR tall boys for $3. Basically they don't want you to hang at the bar...they want you in to eat at the restaurant...but that's fine with me.They do take reservations and that can be useful since they get crowded at times. Great location and really nice pub food make this a stop worth finding. They have been here 40 years for a reason...go find out why."
"We came here for lunch on a Friday. It was busy but they take your cell number and send you a text when your table is ready. They also have stroller parking outside which is great.I really did not like the feel of the restaurant. Too crowded- cramped. It was hard to get to our table. The salad bar looks amazing but is right by where people are sitting. I just didn't like it. Plus, the bathrooms are tiny! I know this is a chicago staple but I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere. The food was good and the service was good. That's why I gave 3 stars. However, the chips were soggy, I would get fries next time (if there is a next time). I got the Yowza Burger which was cooked perfectly and the pickle was perfect! I should have asked for another :)I'm glad I checked RJ's out, but won't make a special trip to come back."
"Ended up here because ranallis wasn't open until 5 pm. Needed early dinner before volleyball. Yuck! What a waste of money. Brought my sister and whole family visiting from out of state and just so disappointing. Grumpy waitress, old fries that must have been sitting there forever and they just didn't care to give us fresh. By the time waitress came back we had finished most everything else didn't bother getting decent ones. Salad bar was ok. The fried pickles were about the only thing memorable.  Overall I can't believe I wasted calories and a meal here."
"I would not come here for the food. Good salad bar, but everything else was very mediocre. High point was the $5 Bloody Marys, not because they tasted great but because they tasted good enough and I needed some hair of the dog.  Brunch buffet was a big let-down, and frankly a place like this should aspire to be better than buffet trays of basics as the only choice. No excuse for not being able to order some better fare as an alternative.  We only came here because it was a large group with kids, and this was the best we could do on short notice."
"rj grunts is the gold standard for chicken fingers in chicago. everyone else talks about burgers and the salad bar at this place.no. chicken fingers are WHERE IT'S AT. My friends make fun of me for my love of chicken fingers, saying i eat like a child. I don't care, they're delicious. I've lived in chicago for two and a half years and have been on the hunt for my favorite chicken fingers. about six months ago, i discovered rj grunt's and have literally not gone anywhere else for chicken fingers.the food is simple but good. i don't ask for a lot, but these guys NAIL it."
"Best burgers, Milkshakes in Lincoln Park!!!My recommendation is to go straight for the gruntburger your first time here absolutely phenomenal!!!Juicy burger you can't go wrong with!!"
"I've been here numerous times and haven't had a chance to review. This is a Lettuce Entertain You establishment. Walk through revolving door into bar area and hostess station. Full bar with tv mounted on wall. Behind the hostess station is the main seating area. Booths line the walls and traditional table/chair setups fill in the middle. It can get a little cramped in there during dinner. Their salad bar is fantastic, lots of options, and great soups. I've probably had about 4 or 5 of their burgers, but my favorite would have to be the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger. Burgers are huge and cooked to specified temperature. Burgers typically come with cottage fries, which are essentially potato chips or you can upgrade for fries for $1 I believe. They also have dinner specials. Shakes are equally good. Overall, great place for burgers or salad bar. I would recommend reservations if going for dinner."
"Went for a send off of a friend, its kitschy 70's /80's and i was able to sing a long with every song. However, I am really not a fan of overpriced food. $15 for the salad bar. The salad bar was large though and the broccoli cheese soup was delicious."
"Totally family friendly. I am here at 2:30 and it is packed with smiling families, eating. They have a stroller storage place outside with a lock so no worries about stroller going missing. Awesome 70s music to boot.  I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich; delicious!"
"Server had no idea we existed...finally after heading back to the hostess she alerted the server.  Salad bar looked ok, was probably ahead of its time 10 years ago, now it's just ho hum.  Portions were large and the food was good.  Not the best and not the worst.  Even at 3 stars I would eat here again."
"I've been here 2 times and on each occasion I've received good service. The serves are always helpful when it comes to providing information on the menu options, they keep your glass filled with you beverage of choice and they truly seem to enjoy working there.When the burgers come out they always look like something you'd get at a 4th of July BBQ, but they taste delicious. I recommend the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger with the creamy caramel milkshake.Just know that this place gets packed on weekends with people coming from the zoo so it's best to make reservations."
"Read about this place (near Lincoln Park Zoo) in the Chicago Lonely Planet guide. Quaint, quirky little place that didn't disappoint with thick, tasty milkshakes, tasty burgers and chicken sandwiches. Good kids' menu, too. Service was fast, friendly and attentive. Great way too cool off after wandering around the zoo in 90+ temps..."
"If you're looking for delicious food and restaurant with character - look no further. We had 1 day to spend in Chicago and decided to go to RJ Grunts for lunch after going to the zoo. I had the salad bar (amazing- cut up fruits, entire apples, dessert, soup, etc.) and my husband got a classic cheeseburger (greasy and delicious). We had some draft beers from local breweries and enjoyed some 70s music while we ate. You know you've picked a hometown favorite when the local EMS and police department are there on lunch break...would highly recommend!"
"Amazing salad bar. There is so much to choose from and the employees are super nice. If you're looking for a healthy option and want to enjoy your meal, come here!"
"I am defiantly a regular at this restaurant because of the kind service, great food, and good prices. The service is very good, and the waiters constantly check in on you. They are very nice, and almost all of the waiters know me and greet me with a smile. You have a wide variety of food choices,  with a good kids menu. The adult menu has many options too. The salad bar is also a very good option with lots of toppings for your salad. RJ Grunts has a good beer menu which is always a plus for the adults. The prices are fairly good for the food you receive. They accept credit cards and Let us Entertain you gift cards. You will defiantly want to make a reservation because they are often busy, but it is worth the hassle.  I would defiantly recommend going here!"
"Pros:- Good for groups/families/kidsCons:- Expensive for what you get- Food is not great, especially the inconsistent cook of their meats- Wait time=======================================I went here for a lunch double date after visiting Lincoln Park Zoo. I suppose it should have been expected given that it's within walking distance of the zoo, but the place was filled with toddlers and families. We were told the wait would be about half an hour. We waited inside almost 1 hour without any sign that we would be seated soon, so we went up and inquired about our table and were magically seated right away (?). Not sure if it was coincidence or they lost our names for some reason, but regardless it left a little question mark in my headI ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger ($11.95), medium rare. The other 3 people in my party also ordered their burgers medium rare. Unfortunately, mine came out quite rare to the point it tasted cold and soggy. I understand if one restaurant may cook their ""medium rare"" burgers differently than another, but within the restaurant I feel like there should have been some consistency --- especially if the orders all went in at the same time. I don't even honestly remember the mushrooms or cheese or other components because the meat was so terrible. The burger was quite remarkably bad, especially given the very remarkable price tag. The best part of the meal was the side dill pickle --- I had to steal my boyfriend's pickle to fill me up because I couldn't finish my burger.Note: their cottage fries basically taste like thick burnt potato chips. I'm not sure what the french fries or sweet potato fries taste like, so I can't comment on whether it's worth the $1-2 upgrade."
"Don't know why it's taken me so long to come dine here, but great food all around! I had the pulled-pork sandwich with the ""chips"" and our table split the onion rings and buffalo nachos for apps. I say all of it is a definite try! The pulled pork was great! (Usually I am bias and think only BBQ joints can really pull off great pulled pork because it's a process to get it done right, but Grunts did it right on!) FYI - it doesn't come with cole slaw so if you like your pork sandwich slaw-stacked be sure to ask for it. The buffalo nachos were soooo good! Definitely get them. And I love how they serve them in a bowl. Nachos are meant to be piled high, but it always baffles me why some places serve them on a dinner plate and they fall all over the place. I don't want to play Jenga with my food! Onion rings were great, too. Thick cut onions with a thin, tasty crunch to the breading. We were treated to the cookie sundae. (Nice surprise!) It was so big, five of us shared it. It was really good, but after all that food, we were barely able to clean the plate. But we manned up and did it anyways. Just had to waddle our happy, fat asses home."
"Not exaggerating when I say the best buffalo wings I've ever had. And I've eaten a lot of buffalo wings. Great taste, perfect crisp, nice size. Perfection."
"For how this place is hyped, I found it pretty mediocre. Let's talk about the Sunday brunch, because that's what I got:The breakfast was excellent although pretty small and nowhere near fresh - I know it's a buffet, but still.The salad bar is complete profit for them. The serving utensils are tiny, meaning you need 3+ scoops just to get a decent amount of anything. They put the cheap veggies (celery, corn, etc.) up front, and the more costly stuff including fruit in the back. This wouldn't bother me terribly except that anyone my height or above (average male) has to bend down under the splash guard and reach towards the back for anything that actually cost them money. There is ZERO protein at the bar and quite honestly not much variety. At least the ingredients there seemed more fresh.The waitress was really nice but extremely slow...but to me it seemed they were understaffed rather than bad. Overall, a little below Lettuce standards if you ask me."
"I have a love-like relationship with this place. I love it because it is the place my husband took me to on our first date over 30 years ago. But I am not particularly in love with their food. Their salad bar is outrageous at $14.95 per person and nothing to write home about except that it does include a soup and usually a warm plate of something. Their burgers are ample at least a half pounder but their chips this time were sitting around for a while and not freshly fried to a crisp. My husband had the Buffalo Chicken nachos which looked good. But I only like the food. I came here out of convenience because I was at the Lincoln Park Zoo and it was the closest restaurant that was open and would entertain my 4 year old grandson. His burger was good but his fries were cold, too."
"This is a restaurant caught in a time warp with an inexplicable decorating scheme.  The best I could find on the menu was choosing between a Patty Melt and chicken tenders.  Maybe you could eat there on throwback Thursdays and partake of a salad bar that definitely feels old.  But it was very popular.Plastic greenery tops windows and large framed picture portraits line the walls.  No, not famous celebrities, but servers from the restaurant from the beginning of time - lots of Charlie's Angels hair.  Not even the green tinted floor to ceiling mirror panels from the '70s could help.This place gets 3* only because the food was pretty good."
"This is the original Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant, I believe, so my friend and I decided to give it a try. We made a reservation for 7:00pm, not sure if it would be busy on a Monday night or not.We arrived around 6:20pm. They were not busy at all. [It is also great to mention that they are located right by the Lincoln Park Zoo so if you don't mind walking a block, it's free street parking.] Our waitress greeted us within minutes of being seated and she was not friendly at first, no smile, and I don't recall her giving us her name. When she asked if we had been there before, I replied ""no,"" and she just said,"" oh, well the burgers are the best thing we have here."" She gave us some time to look over the menu - about 20 minutes to which is a long time. We proceeded to split R.J.'s Famous Chili as an appetizer. It was hot in temperature, topped with shredded cheese, full of beans, ground beef, onions, and topped with cheese [I mean, how can you really mess up chili?] Then, I ordered the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger [supposedly the most popular burger]. This has bacon, cheddar cheese, with fried onions, lettuce, tomato and BBQ sauce. Served with your choice of side and a dill pickle. You can choose from their signature fries or upgrade to sweet potato fries for $2 extra. From my personal expertise of burgers, this burger is highly recommendable. The meat was cooked to exactly the temperature I wanted it and it was juicy. I also love BBQ sauce and bacon.My friend ordered the Green Chili Cheeseburger - Fire-roasted poblano chilis, cheddar cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, pickle and red onion. She said it wasn't too spicy, but still very tasty. We also noticed they had a soup and salad bar, which seemed popular with some other guests.For dessert, we ordered the full sized chocolate chip cookie with fudge and three scoops of vanilla ice cream. Delicious if you love sweets, but also very filling! Burgers were up to par, but service definitely needs some work."
"My older brother usually orders wings from here with his buddies every Super Bowl Sunday. He recommended me and my group of friends to order here this year. My friends thought they were fabulous wings! That's a statement because we all grew up going to Buffalo Joes Wings in Evanston nearly every other week! No need to make the trip to Evanston anymore to pick up wings since RJ Grunts is more of a convenience and just as good!The manager, Ron, is very respectful and understanding. I accidentally ordered to many wings, but he accommodated me! He cares about the customers and runs this place right!GO RJ Grunts!"
"This place is teeny tiny.   We went there several days ago because it is kid friendly.   We made a last minute reservation on OpenTable and as luck would have it, they gave us a booth which is a lot better than their cramped tables.  They gave my son a menu to color and crayons.   We ordered onion rings which were so good.  There aren't too many that come in an order but enough to get you wanting more food.  I had the salad bar for my meal.  The salad bar is kinda awesome.   Plenty of choices unlimited trips. I had three trips.  Two for salad and one for soup!  My son got grilled cheese and fries.  My hubby got a burger and fried chips.  Fries were awesome and fried chips were just okay.  Burger was really good.  I would go back here but definitely would lean towards the salad bar because it was that good!"
"RJ Grunts is a solid establishment in the area, though I think it falls short of the Lettuce Entertain You standards for restaurants that I have grown over the years of dining in Chicago. I believe this is one of the older Lettuce Entertain You restaurants and you can tell it's a little worn in the decor. It feels tired and in need of some revamping. The salad bar is good here. I definitely recommend you get that. I got the burger, which was A-OK. I don't have any real complaints about RJ Grunts, to be honest. It's a solid place in the area and probably one of the cheapest dining options that you'll find around here short of the fast food route. For that reason alone, this place is worth coming to if you want to grab food before a show but don't want to have a fancy culinary experience. I know I said I had nothing to complain about, but I will say that service was on the slower side, although perfectly cordial and friendly for every interaction we had with the waitstaff. Unless I have somewhere to be at a specific time, then I really have no issues with waiting a bit for my food or check. It allows me the opportunity to enjoy the company of whomever I'm with, which is a big part of going out to eat for me, so I wasn't displeased. If I had had somewhere to be, then it might be a different story. Overall, while I wouldn't consider myself a ""fan"" of RJ Grunts, it gets the job done, and it also has a charm to it. I would say it's worth coming to at least once as a Chicagoan. It has a ""Classic Chicago"" vibe to it. Out-of-town guests might also appreciate the character and history of this place."
"RJ Grunts is the perfect place to eat after wandering around the zoo.  They must know this because as soon as you sit down they bring over a huge carafe of water.  It is pretty tight inside, so they will lock your stroller on a line outside.  The burger I had here was so unique:  melted brie, spinach, garlic aioli, and fig jam.  Sounds odd for a burger, but lemme tell ya it was delicious.  I upgraded to sweet potato fries, and was glad that I did: sweet crunchy goodness.  Just be careful with the beer:  if it's not happy hour it's $10 a pint.  Ouch.  My kids loved the food with Chicago style hot dogs, chicken tenders, and fries.  They also bring out coloring books and toys.  Outside of the restaurant is a city playground, so if there is a wait for a table someone can head across the street with the kids until the table is ready."
"Not entirely sure where to begin with this review.  I can not express how much we enjoyed RJ Grunts.  It all began on Saturday when we walked all the way from the south loop up to Lincoln Park.  With our luck it began to rain as soon as we got to the zoo and it was raining hard.  Everyone in our party knew it was time for a drink.  We looked on Yelp to find the closest bar and RJ Grunts was just about the closest place.  We walked in a marveled at the decor and found empty spots to sit at the bar.  We were immediately waiting on by a wonderful bartender named Ricky.  He was knowledgeable, made great drinks and we got to enjoy conversation with him.  My friend asked for a drink with vodka and he made a moscow mule which she really enjoyed.  I stuck with beer and so did my other friend.  They had some really great local beers on tap.  We stuck around and ordered chips, salsa and guacamole.  The appetizer was very reasonable priced and came with a lot of food.  We sat around for a while and enjoyed each others company and the bar.  I hope to try their food soon as everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing.  Can't wait to return here."
"Came here late on a Friday. We had a reservation, but were a bit early, but we were able to find a spot at the bar while we waited.Good service and a great beer selection at the bar. Our server was helpful and attentive as well. We didn't wait long for drinks, food items or any follow-ups.Overall a good experience at a nice place with a throwback vibe!"
Food was awesome but the service really made the experience. You should definitely try the buffalo wings or a burger. California chicken wrap was good too if you want something lighter. Will happily go back again the next time I visit Chicago!
"After a particularly long number of days eating somewhat unhealthily, I needed some greens in my diet. I had long wanted to check out RJ Grunts, and decided to make the plunge one random night.After reviewing the menu I quickly realized that they smartly set it up so you either spend $15 on the salad bar, or like $21 for a burger and the salad bar. How can you turn down a $6 burger? That's Freakonomics at work for you. I feel for the bait, but I filled up on salad and saved half my sandwich for the next day.There's no meat in the salad bar except for some unnamed pate (nothing is labeled actually), but you do get a choice of two soups. There's also random pasta salads and fruit.PROTIP: There's a white marshmallow looking dip they have. After some research I found that it's actually chocolate chips in a cheesecake dip. It all came together when I saw they offer graham crackers for dipping.I got a patty melt which was rather large, and nice and cheesy. Actually, that kind of explains RJ Grunts pretty well too. The trip wasn't as healthy as I had hoped, but I wouldn't mind coming back for more."
"I was really excited to eat here as I was told there were gluten free options... however that excitement turned to extreme disappointment as the options were presented and the food came out. Salad bar = lots of options, except all of the lettuce was either soggy, wilted or going bad.Gluten free bun = gluten free toast... that's not a bunBacon = NOT gluten free, how is a product that's supposed to be just meat have flour in it??Mayo = NOT gluten free... how??Shredded lettuce on burgers is a cheap filler and poor product, food left a bad taste in your mouth. It's pretty sad that an organization that started called ""Lettuce Entertain You"" comes from a restaurant that has the worst quality lettuce I've ever had. I highly recommend spending your money elsewhere."
"I don't know why a friend of mine said this place was awful, but I ordered my Yowza burger over the phone, picked it up and had the juiciest burger! I've been looking for a great burger in Chicago and I'm happy to have finally found one. The sweet potato fries are super addicting. Really friendly staff, so accommodating and nice."
"This place hasn't changed - in a good way!  Visited after a 10 year hiatus and everything was great, reasonable pricing too. Great stop for lunch during a visit to Lincoln Park Zoo."
"Good stuff. My wife and I  both had French onion [good], she had a California wrap and I a yowza burger. Both of those items were also good and my burger was cooked to proper temperature. Then at last, my wife's favorite, was the cookie bowl with ice cream, delicious! Good ambiance for if this I'd what you looking for."
"Let me start off and say not all Lettuce Entertain is alike. I've written a couple of other spots that are simply amazing. With that said, when I think of RJ Grunts, I am reminded of watching all the subpar or B movies that made it onto the big screen. Point it is it gives hope to all the movie makers AND restauranteurs that anything ""fodder"" is possible.Comparative to today's standard and niche of the dining/ bar experience it was OK. RJs is simply that old blanket that people can't seem to throw away. The salad bar is unique to be found in a bar. The burgers without the discount is just a burger. The decor is woodsy and Olive Garden ish circa 2000 down to the chairs.I understand preservation. But wouldn't it be nice to add real support to this place than a few catchy indoor signage? Overall a few steps higher than McD or BK."
"We visited this place for my boyfriend's birthday dinner after Emma K. raved about their burgers, and it was a huge home run! We have been to RJ Grunt's once before, for brunch, but left a little unimpressed with the brunch buffet. When I hear buffet, I like to think of a table with sprawling options. Of course, you can fill up at the salad bar too, but there were only about 6 different brunch options. BUT, when we went back last night, my opinion immediately shot up. I was so thrilled with the Yowza Burger - it delivered the kick that the menu promised without being too spicy. The rest of our table was equally pleased with their cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger, and hickory smoked bacon burger. Great sized burgers, and they stayed together surprisingly well. My main complaint with my dinner is that the sweet potato fries were lukewarm and weren't crispy at all. I will forgive them for that but will make sure to get regular fries or the chips next time :)The icing on the cake last night is that they brought out an ice cream sundae for my boyfriend since it was his birthday, and ice cream + a warm cookie for our friends, since it was their first visit. Even though this is more of a ""no frills"" type place, they really made us feel welcome, and we will definitely be back."
Great for an casual easy burger.  The salad bar looked amazing! I don't think you could go wrong with any burger on the menu.
"To be honest I'm surprised that LEYE keeps this open.  It seems past its prime.  Maybe in the 80s this was considered kitschy but I found it to be annoying.  The salad bar used to be one of the best in the city.  It now needs to be updated.  The seats are small and tight and even if you have a reservation they'll tell you they'll seat you in a few mins when they should say it'll be at least 20 mins.  Its kind of chaotic in there.  The prices are crazy.  $5 for a scoop of tuna from the salad bar?  They charge extra if you want fries instead of their homemade potato chips, and even more if you want sweet potato fries.  The most annoying part is the menu.  It doesn't tell you what the item is.  For example the tuna sandwich says something like, do you remember the first time you had one of these?  No I don't because I'm not sure if this is tuna salad, tuna steak, on a bun or toast, with cheese?  Annoying!Their redeeming qualities are the wait staff (not the hostess) and the food.  I shared the buffalo nachos with a friend and they were excellent.  We also had one of their adult milkshakes which were insanely delicious.  If I'm seen back here its b/c the food is delicious.  I just hope that they revamp the place sometime soon."
"This is without a doubt the best burger I've ever had in the city and I've tried a lot.The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is from the 70's and exactly the same as when it opened I imagine.  I'm pretty much a regular here with my girlfriend (she raves about the salad bar also!) and I'm sure I'll be back at least 10-15 times this year as well."
Seriously get  the burger. Chicken wings are good too. French fries  as well. Chips and guac are out of this world.. Well just get it all.
"I was pleased to return to RJG's after many years and see it has stayed true to its roots.  They were one of the original 'salad bar' places back in the 70's and it still runs strong.  Puts places like Ruby Tuesdays salad bar, and entrees, to shame. But all for a reasonable price."
Food was good nothing really special.  Service was also good. The restaurant was small and it was really tight spaces.
"I can't say that I'm impressed. I came into town yesterday from Denver and planned to meet family here, I made a reservation because we are a large party...  big mistake. First of all the place is tiny.. and crowded and cramped. When we got there they said it would be just a minute, which turned into 20 and most times that wouldn't be to big of an issue but they have no where for a party of 8 to stand and wait, I don't know about you but I don't want to stand outside in these temperatures with kids. We finally got our table and wow what a joke, they put all 8 of us in a table meant for 6 or less, horrible. The food is so so, a burger joint but I've had way better. The salad bar is 15 $$ really? For lettuce?  Really nothing to write home about. I got chicken  fingers which were ok, but they do charge extra for fries.. umm ok...  Our service was the best part about this dinner."
"The burgers are just epic; they're huge and you have so many choices (there were probably 12 different option the menu, many with really exciting cheeses, etc). They hype their salad bar a lot, but I'm not sure how many people actually take advantage of that, you're in a burger place and the amount of food is already overwhelming. In my group of 8 people, no one finished all their food (in a good way), there was just so much. We came for a restaurant week deal that made the burgers much cheaper after 10pm; we told the wait staff what our plan was and they were polite enough to enter our orders well before 10, and to bring us drinks etc, even if we had to wait a bit for the burgers to take advantage of the deal. A great place to stop by after walking around the zoo to burn off some calories before hand (you'll be so comatosed after that walking around the zoo won't be an option)."
The buffalo chicken nachos. Friend waitstaff. Great classic ambiance. A little pricey but the nachos are so worth it. Salad bar is great too.
"I want to come back to RJ Grunts to try the burgers, but I thought the weekend brunch was just average.  For the same price, I think that Stanley's does a better job and has more choices outside of the salad bar, which RJ Grunts does very well (if salad is your thing for breakfast!).Got to RJ's on a Sunday morning right when they opened.  The choices are reasonable--outside of the huge salad/fruit bar, your hot items include eggs, egg whites, bacon, chicken sausage, small waffles, and potatoes.  Besides the large, well-cooked bacon (not crispy, not undercooked...mostly just right), nothing on the hot bar was memorable.  I also added a milkshake, as I am a big milkshake guy...but these shakes were not memorable.  Not too thick, and not exactly overflowing, since when I dine in I expect to get a massive glass of shake plus the tin, but when I got that shake, it was mostly melted and not very thick-spun.  A negative.The space is a challenge; booths are very small and we were seated at one of four tables situated in a plus-sign alignment, so that only three chairs were accessible at each of the four tables.  Weird layout, and tight throughout.  I got bumped a few times by people walking by me to get to their table or to the buffet, so try to get a booth by the window if you go with just one other person to be out of the way.Meh.  Tasty but a minor letdown.  As the first Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, I was hoping for legendary...maybe on my next visit!"
great food and atmosphere. kinda cramped inside but it adds to the restaurants homey laid back vibe
"I brought out-of-town guests here because it was the restaurant that looked the most promising that was closest to Second City. It was a bit complicated finding a seat because I was not allowed to place a reservation, but we did not end up having to wait too long. However, our meal was a bit rushed because we had to get to a show. I absolutely loved the kitschy decor in this restaurant. It was quite unique and the space and real character to it. Our waitress was friendly, but not overly attentive. I noted that she never re-filled any of our water glasses. We had to flag her down to come to our table to get more water. The food was A-OK. I got a veggie burger and it was not handmade or anything special. It tasted about like what I might make for myself at home with a slightly more substantial bun. My dining partners were satisfied with their meals, though not overly impressed. I should also note that quarters were pretty close and it was sometimes difficult to have our own conversation because it almost felt like we were interrupting the conversation going on at the table next to us. We flagged our waitress to get our check and were on our merry way to see Second City in perfect timing.My conclusion is that this isn't the type of place you come for the food. You come here for convenience, you come here for charm, and maybe you come for that ""amazing"" salad bar (which I did not sample, so I cannot comment). If I'm ever in the area, I will not be opposed to returning to this establishment, but maybe only if I'm not in a hurry. Tip: Careful when you use the bathroom. The door will close quickly behind you and will make a very loud sound! Also, be prepared: the bathroom is certainly nothing to call home about."
Went there for dinner this evening with some family members. The food was just ok. I got the hickory burger and it was kind of dry and didn't have a lot of BBQ sauce on it. And the fries - they went fries. More like kettle chips or Saratoga chips. I don't think I'll be back.
"after reading the raving reviews, we came on a weekday to tryr j's famous chilipineapple coconut shakebuffalo wingscheeseburgerhickory bacon cheddar burgersweet potato fries.everything was just ok. i'd say the best thing was the fries that came with the burgers."
"RJ Grunts is my favorite sit-down restaurant in Lincoln Park. We go there all the time and I have never had anything but a 5-star experience.THE FOOD (5 stars out of 5):Works Burger. French Dip Enigma. Mr Chicken. FRIES. No matter what we get, it is always amazing. If you like a great burger or sandwich then there's really no reason not to check this place out. They have everything you need and everything that we have ordered has been fantastic. If you order temperature soup with your entree, you are charged the high temperature that day (in cents) and that's it. So when it's really cold out, you're adding a hot cup of soup for pennies. It's amazing. Beyond that, the rest of the menu prices are reasonable. You can expect to pay around $30-35 for dinner for two (sans alcohol). Can't speak to the Salad Bar, as that's not really my thing, but I understand people love it. THE SERVICE (4 of 5):Service is usually good. Sometimes when they are busy things slow down. But what can you do? We never really have any issues beyond waiting a little bit longer than expected for the check to show up. Food always comes out fast and hot. THE AMBIANCE (4 of 5):CROWDED. But if you're into that sort of thing then this is your spot. It's a tiny place and they pack people into every inch of the dining area. If you aren't at a booth or at the bar, you can expect to be pretty darn close to other parties around you. It's also very loud in there when busy, but what restaurant isn't? This is my kind of restaurant and even though the crowd may be a touch overwhelming at times, once the food shows up you will completely tune it all out. I promise. Plus, they have portraits of past employees plastering the walls. Decor has a sort of late-60s/early-70s theme. The restaurant has been there since 1971 and is the original Lettuce Entertain You spot. BOTTOM LINE (5 of 5):We go to Grunts pretty much every other weekend. It never gets old. We never have a bad experience. It's the perfect neighborhood restaurant and it's in a great location near the Zoo. Check it out, seriously, you will NOT be disappointed. 5 stars all day every day."
One of the best salad bars in the city. Value for the money is great. Quality is comparable to other lettuce entertain you restaurants but the price is much lower.  Wait staff is always wonderful here. Great personalities. Family friendly and close to the zoo.
"I have been to RJ Grunts a few times. The place is small, dark, and cramped; but that is part of the atmosphere. RJG has great milk shakes, an average salad bar, great burgers, and temperature soup. What's temperature soup? It is soup that with the purchase of a meal is included at a cost of the high temperature of the day (free on days the high is subzero). RJG has a signature burger that changes regularly. I have never actually ordered off the menu. I always order the signature burger and my only regret is that my stomach isn't larger. The burgers are very large and filling but always delicious.The last time I visited RJG, the signature burger was a delicious bleu cheese burger. I also had their chicken tortilla soup for $0.17 which can't be beat. I wish I had room because they also have an amazing peanut butter shake. The reason for the 4 star rating is due to our waitress on my last trip who seemed entirely upset and inconvenienced to be the server for our table. Not sure what her issue was, but she was unfriendly and seemed pissed off the whole meal. The service was still pretty timely, just not as pleasant as I expect."
"I live near this place and get their delivery often -- decent bar food for the price! Plus, the portions are HUGE, so I usually end up getting two meals for one."
"My boyfriend and I took the kids to the zoo this last weekend and decided to stop in to Grunt's for lunch.  We chose this restaurant based on its proximity to the zoo (right across the street) and for the great Yelp reviews.  It was Sunday around 2 so the brunch crowd was still lingering and we waiting about 20 minutes for a table for 4, no big deal at all. It was a beautiful day to stand on the sidewalk and chat.  The place was packed and loud with conversation.  Normally I'm not grumpy about the music volume in restaurants but it was positively blasting.  Forget talking with my boyfriend who sat across from me at our 4-seat table, I mimed to him for most of the meal. Seriously, turn the music down when it's busy!The service: Whoa, was our server awkward.   Quiet and hardly stopped by after taking our orders.  The look on her face every time we interacted with her made it obvious that she'd rather be elsewhere.  I will say that I noticed the other servers around the room and all of them seemed lively and attentive.  Just our luck we got the strange one.Our food: So horribly mediocre. I've had better at Applebee's to be honest.Santa Fe Wrap: This is what I ordered.  Blahhh. So bland. I chose it hoping it would have a little kick but it was 50% iceberg lettuce inside and hardly seasoned.  I was starving after a very small breakfast that day and even so only ate about half. We paid extra for sweet potato fries with my order and they were a disappointment, too.  Mostly cold and no seasoning.  I only ate a handful which is incredible since I love, love, love anything sweet potato.Grunt Burger:  My boyfriend had this with their house made chips.  His comments were that it was a good burger but not great.  I tried a couple bites and agree.  It was a good burger but sooooo far from the best in Chicago.  One thing that was missing for me was the delicious crust that a good burger has on the exterior from the grill.  He ordered the burger medium and it was the same texture through the whole thing.   Had I known the wrap was going to be so bland I would have gotten a burger instead.  The chips made in house...equally blah.  Mushy and tough and under-seasoned.Pulled pork sandwich: Our 11 year old ordered this after the kids menu fell short of offering a hamburger.  On that note...what?? This place advertises itself as a burger joint (that point was even promoted by our waitress)...and there was no burger on the kids menu! When we inquired about having a smaller burger made for my boyfriend's son the waitress simply replied ""Hmmm, no. Sorry we don't do that"".  The pulled pork was very fatty so I got to sit and watch him spit out pieces of fat for most of his meal. Lovely. Kids menu, Mac & Cheese:  One comment here, I know it's a kids item but I thought the portion was pretty puny.  My boyfriend's daughter is 8 and she was complaining for more food at the end.  The meal included a very small bowl of mac & cheese (less than a cup definitely) and an individual bag of animal cracker (cute touch with the nearby zoo). That's it.  It was served on a school lunch tray and half of the compartments were empty...? Would have been great if they included some apple slices or yogurt.  If the rest of the kids menu is portioned this small I would say that it is probably best for kids 5 and under.  To conclude, I'm thoroughly confused by Yelp's mostly positive reviews of this place.  We use Yelp all the time when searching for new places to eat and have had great luck many times but this place was so incredibly average."
"Um. No. We chose RJ Grunts because it was walkable from our hotel, got great reviews and it was 4 degrees outside so we didn't feel like taking a cab, walking to the L, etc. We arrived and it was packed on a Sunday night. We were told it would be 45 minutes for a table but that the bar was open seating. Good, we found spots at the bar within 10 minutes and the bartender was friendly and helpful. It seemed like a cute little place and obviously popular so we were looking forward to our food. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Sean ordered  the green chili cheeseburger. Fries subbed for a dollar extra (is that really necessary?) The burger was good sized, but not sure why the cheese was just a giant handful of shredded cheddar thrown on top. Traditionally, cheese is melted on cheeseburgers. Even Wendy's knows that. It wasn't exactly nasty, just odd and didn't really add anything to the meal. Fries were completely limp and soggy. Not a single crunchy fry in the lot. They seemed to have been sitting around for some time.I wasn't that hungry so I just ordered some wings. I'm never sure what to expect when a place tells me that something is 'spicy' so I just went with the regular buffalo sauce which RJ says is 'spicy'. The wings are where the wheels really come off for RJ. I have never had nastier wings anywhere. First, they were not hot - you could tell they'd been sitting out awhile before being served. No. Wings should be just out of the grease when served. Second, they were not spicy at all. Not even a little bit. Sure, I could have ordered the next level up but that one said 'really spicy'. If you're going to put 'spicy' next to a menu item, it should have a little kick at least. Third, the sauce was just a gross consistency. Goopy and almost gelatinous. Yuck all around.Never have I had more disgusting wings. Sean's burger was passable I suppose (not inedible like the wings) but that's hardly a compliment. No, no and no. I guess we missed the memo about this place? Wondering what are the secret awesome things to order. Even if there are such wonders here, our experience will not get us back to try them."
"Stopped in on a snowy Sunday. Zoo lights had just began, so finding a parking spot was a little more difficult than usual. Luckily I was with my parents and my Dad dropped my Mom and I off to put our names in. We had to wait about 45 minutes, but it was better than going back into the blizzard and trying to find a new place and parking spot. So, we had a drink at the bar and before we knew it, the host stand sent me a text that our table was ready.I was so hungry then not anticipating such a long wait on a snowy Sunday night. We ordered right away and waited another half hour or so for our three burgers. Our server was super nice and assured us she had not forgotten about us. She was worried that we were upset that the food was taking so long, so that helped keep us lighthearted. When they were ready and served to our table, they were amazing. We stopped talking to each other and focused on our awesome burgers and huge pile of fries. We all got a different version of their killer burger and were very happy. So, prepare for a wait and you will enjoy a great burger. (Salad bar looked good too!)"
"Family style old school vibe. This place reminds me of my childhood dinner outings with my parents. Good veggie burger the size of my head and excellent fries. I really don't understand why people complain about $1 charge for the fries? The portions are giant! The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Yes, it was packed but we were nicely tucked away from the screaming children in our little booth. I would most def go back."
"Was very excited to try this Chicago staple and grub on a delicious burger. The atmosphere was great but our mood was soon dampened when it took around 20 minutes to get our first drink order (a beer and cider...it was not crowded.) We barely saw our server throughout the night. I ordered the Yowza Burger and my husband ordered the Patty melt, both with french fries. Honestly the best part was the crunchy pickle. I thought the burger was mediocre and the fries were fine. I definitely think the burgers at Five Guys are better. I will not be returning. Too bad!"
"This place is absolutely FANTASTIC. I had the monthly special burger and it was f****** elegant. The soup was also 18 cents for the temperature outside, it was also delicious. I will come back here ... All the time."
I love this place. It's a nice little neighborhood spot to enjoy a good meal. I normally get a burger but once tried the pulled pork sandwich on Texas toast and it was super. Don't skip the salad bar; it's worth it to add it on. The soup special (cost as much in cents as it is degrees F outside) is a bargain and the soups are always delicious. They have sloe gin fizzes on the cocktail menu and most of the bartenders know how to make it perfectly. The music always inspires me to sing out loud. Service is friendly. What's not to love?
Had an awesome Sunday lunch here! Burgers were seriously one of the best I've ever had... And believe me... I've had a lot of burgers :-/The Yowza burger was so juicy and perfectly seasoned!! Not too big and not too small! Didn't have too many toppings like some places try to make. The best burger was actually the turkey burger! We all know how bland a turkey burger can be! But this one was juicy and tasty!!! We started off with the nachos today but I'm sure we'll be back for the onion rings - they looked delicious! Good times!!
"The only reason I love coming here is for the salad bar. The food is pretty standard but I'm a sucker for a salad bar. Tables are cramped unless you get seated in a booth by the window. The salad bar is on top of other tables, much like being at relatives house for Christmas Eve dinner with all the foldable tables and chairs brought up from the basement and crudely placed around the room. You might have to throw a few elbows just to get your salad back to the table. Waitresses are always super friendy but can sometimes be painfully slow, or they just feel slow because the food comes out in lighting speed. Overall I would only come here if you have kids, are a die hard salad fan, or just want a burger and a shake."
"My friends celebrated my birthday here couple of years back. And since then, this place has become one of my favorite spots. I am a vegetarian, so imagine my delight when I found that I can eat any of their burgers with viola.... veg pattie!!! The cold coffee and Oreo cookie shakes are absolutely delicious. I love their vintage style ambience - with walls full of pictures of all the waitresses who have worked there since 1971.Downside: The popularity makes it hard to find a seat sometimes, especially on the weekends for groups of 4 or more.Tip: Oh and you get half off burgers on Mon-Sat after 10 pm. Now, isn't that a steal!"
"Back to Chicago to visit friends, and just had to stop at Grunt's for a burger. The room is nothing fancy, but the food is tiptop! Great little salad bar too, but this place is all about the burgers. And here's the deal: as far as I am concerned, there is no better burger in the world than the Grunt Burger at RJ Grunts! It's a real Chicago restaurant gem that I hope never goes away.I'll be back."
"SOMEWHAT DISSAPOINTED in the overall experience.  The food gets 4-1/2 stars but the atmosphere and service get 2 stars.  Heres a hint...if your serving dishes are larger than the booth/table, you might want to consider downsizing them.  Very cramped, close, uncomfortable quarters.  Lackluster service, but the flavor and quality of the food was very good."
"Boyfriend and I stopped here for a meal after visiting the Lincoln park zoo located a little down the street. The atmosphere is dimmed and cozy with vintage black and white photos of workers, servers, and bartenders from when the restaurant first opened all over the walls. There is a bar with two flat screen tvs but they are off to the corner so you won't be disturbed if you're looking for more privacy or a quiet place to eat. This place has an extensive menu of alcoholic beverages on the fun side with things like hard cider, grown up milkshakes, champagne, and hot chocolate with chocolate liqueur. The menu was very fun drawn in cartoon caricature so it adds a fun vibe to the whole restaurant. The servers are polite and nice and wear denim jeans so you can come casual, but I'm sure they wouldn't look down on you for dressing up and stopping in for a bite to eat. It's like a southern charm place without the actual southern type food, but my burger was hearty and served hot. I ordered the works with regular fries and my boyfriend ordered the YOWZA burger that comes with bacon and spicy ketchup. This place was a little more expensive than I would have liked for a couple of burgers (they're not gourmet) but the food was good and hot. In total we ordered 2 burgers with fries, 2 sodas, one glass of champagne, and one milkshake for desert(which I might add, one milkshake is good enough for 3 people.) The bill was $51, so a little much, not including tip although I could have saved $7.50 by not ordering a champagne. the portions are nothing to complain about at all. Btw the salad bar looked delicious, although we did not try it during our visit."
"RJ Grunts isn't kidding when they say they have delicious burgers. You have to get one, ANY one, when you're there. If for some reason you aren't feeling the burgers, then get the salad bar! The options seem endless and it looks pretty delicious. I personally didn't have any, (there was no room in my stomach after demolishing the burger), but it's also supposed to be phenomenal.Overall in terms of staffing, by far, we had the friendliest waitress ever. She was amazing and more than helpful with my indecisiveness when it came to ordering food. I was a little disappointed with the chips that came with my meal. Nothing fantastic and could have used a little more flavor. I also had a bloody mary which was delicious! Surprisingly though the draft beers cost more than the bloody marys. Overall, a great experience!"
"Needing a little something to eat before last night's party, we went to nearby RJ Grunts.  I liked that they had a few decent craft beers on tap: 3F Gumballhead and Arctic Panzer Wolf, Descutes Chainbreaker IPA and Goose Green Line.  My lady had the Gumballhead and I called in the Wolf and he solved problems.  I was thrilled to see that we both got full pints, overflowing at that!  Perhaps my only complaint about the craft beer boom are those bullshit goblets and snifters that I was expecting to get this Imperial IPA in.  Nope, full pint.  Cheers.  As for food, we started with some wings.  We got them medium spicy with the fuego on the side.  We usually like spicy and the way hot would have been too much for us, that sauce had quite a kick.  The wings were very good and we enjoyed them.  Cajun chicken sandwich for Kris and cheddar bacon burger for me.  It was a great burger done to a perfect medium rare.  Sadly the Andy Capp style fries were a big disappointment to me.  Of course it didn't stop me from eating them all.  Eating away my sorrow.  A round of Gumballhead and we were off to party."
"The boyfriend and I have heard so many great things about RJ Grunts. We were in the area Sunday night and decided to see  what all the fuss was about. The place was not at what I originally had in mind. Instead, it kinda reminds me of the Regal Beagle (the bar in the tv show Three's Company's...info for those youngins). The place is quite small too. The menu looked alright. I opted for the salad bar and fried pickles. Gotta admit the fried pickles were mighty tasty. The best part about the pickles is that the breading stayed on the pickle without coming off!  Let's move on the salad bar. The salad bar has some weird pricing..15 by its self or 7 with an appetizer..well you get me. The salad bar has two soups, chicken tortilla and tomato bisque, on the day we visited.  The salad bar has a  good selection. No meat options.  However, they did have a chicken liver pate..yumm yumm!!  There was one item in their salad bar that threw me off. This item looked like a marshmallow salad, but when you bit into you realized nope not sweet ...almost tangy and there is chocolate chips in it. After googling this item...lo and behold it was a chocolate chip dip. It is almost a deconstructed chocolate chip cheese cake. Now it makes sense why they had graham crackers in the cracker bowl!! The salad bar is ok...would I travel out of neighborhood just to go to this place..nah probably not"
"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place last Friday (4/4/14) since I had a gift card for LEYE. He wanted a burger, so this places seemed like the best fit. The place itself it pretty kitschy, but I really love that sort of thing. The menu was fun and they had an AWESOME burger special that was a burger wedged between two grilled cheese sandwiches. Sorry not sorry about the calories on that one. It was all around great, but seriously, it was our waitress that made our evening. I feel bad because I point blank asked her name and completely forgot it. I believe it started with a T and was really unusual. Medium length brown hair and thin build. ANYWAY she.was.awesome. It really made our whole evening. Very attentive and kind. I just wanted her to wrap me in a blanket and tell me everything in the world will be ok and I would totally believe it. I felt all warm and happy inside when she talked and genuinely felt like she enjoyed what she was doing and explained everything with pep. As a former server, I appreciated the hell outta this. I would come back to RJ Grunts just to have her as a waitress again. So when you go, ask for the woman with the unusual name that starts with a T because she is awesome!"
"Better than expected. Nice vibe. Slow-ish service, but the room was relaxd and easy-going so I didn't mind. My burger was average but my date loved her food. If you're in the area I'd recommend this place over the bar food joints that are also nearby."
"I really like this place. It's always crowded, but the menu is great and so is the service. Not many healthy options here, lots of throw your diet out the window and indulge options. Fun energetic atmosphere, nice servers. I can't leave without one of their delicious shakes."
Awesome burger!!! Great service!!!! Very cool atmosphere. I will be coming back often
"I've been here a few times, and the food has always been really good. I've had the salad bar, chili, a grilled cheese, a cheeseburger, and a turkey club sandwich. Everything was really good. The service is really good as well- friendly and attentive. There is also a cool atmosphere here."
Everything they say is true! Fantastic food at a very reasonable price. Get the chicken wings. Yup!
"Good food and great sangria but boy does that place need a scrub down and a fresh coat of paint. It's kind of ""Grungy Grunts"".  Lots of cobwebs hanging above our booth. Yuck. Framed photos with grease rubbed all over it. Yuck. Too many other nice places to go."
I thought the salad was sub par.I have gotten better and fresher salad at a Dominicks.The bathroom is horrendous. I wold change that.It's a place that does not encourage dressing up at all.Maybe just show up in your underwear. who knowsIf they were going for the feel of a remote cowboy bar in Wyoming this would make sense but its in Lincoln Park for gosh sakes.This place has inspired me to write a list of the best bathrooms at establishments in Chicago. I will do this in the coming week so that I have time to talk  myself out of it
"RJ Grunts was VERY mediocre.  Someone had recommended their salad bar and I was pretty disappointed.  Their unlimited soup and salad bar was 14.95 which, I suppose is an OK price, but I was hoping that there would be more to it.  There was two soup choices.  If you want any form of meat on your salad, it costs extra.  The service was TERRIBLE.  It took 10 minutes for a server to even come to ask what we wanted for drinks....and this was only after I had asked two different servers to send a server over.  I highly recommend asking for your check as soon as you get your server like we did...or prepare to wait."
I highly recommend an adult milkshake. My favorite is Peanut Butter with Baileys and Kahlua.
"This is NOT a place you want to go to on a weekend night without a reservation. Who knew you had to make reservations to a pub-like burger place. It is small...dark....and we were a bit creeped out by the walls full of pictures of young ladies from the 70's. Seating is really tight in the middle area...they put way to many tables and not enough space to breathe or move your chair without bumping into someone.Prices were reasonable for the quality and amount you get. Menu is pretty standard..wings, burgers, sandwiches. There is a great (so many choices) salad bar and soup combo.We ordered milkshakes (Strawberry & Oreo)which were great...who cares that they are like a million calories anyways!Many burger options...from bacon..to green pepper. The burgers are a great size.. and the fries are thin cut home-made potato chip like. My mom loved the burger...it also had some great aioli sauce that added great flavor.We also ordered the chicken wings which were crispy and super saucy! Loved them!Overall, just for the food it is a great place for a lunch! Another LEYE restaurant to love!"
"I'm a huge fan of the burgers at RJ Grunts! I can't honestly give an opinion on anything other than the burgers, chips and beer though because I always stick with that.I almost always order the burger with cheese and crispy onions and the homemade chips that come with it. Healthy? No. I love it though! The beer list is decent. I'm always happy to order gumball head. This place is packed all the time! Parking can be a nightmare but reservations are easy. Service is always friendly."
"One thinks of funny things while standing at the urinal. Unless of course, one is a gal. Anyway, I was thinking of how small and New York-like the bathroom is here. And how they've probably paid the mortgage 10 times over since 1971 when I first came to Grunts. With a big girl I knew from Michigan who tried to put the big moves on me in her sister's bachelorette pad. I'll spare you the outcome, along with any further nostalgia. But I don't think the decor here has changed since it opened.Grunts was really the precursor, I think to all of the Frat bro gastropubs, as its menu confirms. The nachos, the wings the fried apps and burgers. Rather a dull menu these days, but very hip and fun in its day. And still a good place for burgers and a beer, and of course the famous salad bar. I made many a trip to this salad bar for Sunday brunches back in my twenty-something Lincoln Park days. Lettuce Entertain You has always excelled at fresh food, value and a great vibe. And it still seems to work for them. I had a burger with a friend here on a Tuesday at lunch, and the joint was jumpin'. I forgot, too about the friendly little bar at the front. It's not a bad place to hang out if you're in the 'hood.So we add this to the list of Great Brunch and Salad bar spots, a reliable and consistent source of delicious juicy burgers and shoestring fries. Not too mention it's the flagship of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, an iconic Chicago institution,and one more  survivor in the class of Chicago Old School casual neighborhood pubs. And one at time in the John, please.Sincerely,RJ"
"My friend loves this place in Chicago, so we went for their famous salad bar....it is supposed to have been the first one in the country and it is very good....not HUGE, but very fresh and tasty.    I love their tuna salad, bean salad, beets, fresh veggies and soups.    We had a plate of chips, salsa and guacamole and it was devoured within minutes....Top quality all the way around...."
"First time I went was with my husband. Awesome beer selection.. mmmmmm gumball head.. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about all the food and the beer. Their buffalo chicken nachos were soooooo delicious. As was the rest of their food. The next time we went was last weekend during the day- with our kids (5 & almost 1)- scary. The highchair was tiny and awesome so people weren't constantly tripping over the baby. The tables and bathroom are also tiny-not awesome. A woman came in to the one-stall bathroom while I was at the changing table and we had to maneuver around so she could get in the bathroom while my baby was on the table- after I got hit with the first door when she came in. Had to move around again while she was trying to get the paper towels to dry her hands. That was the only downfall- pretty annoying, but I'm big on bathrooms, so that's part of why I'm taking off a star. Other part, tiny tables.. You have to move everything around to eat your food. Pretty annoying. Everything else was excellent. Fast, prompt, and friendly service, my husbands drinks were refilled before he asked, and I had a pitcher of ice water at the table  their macaroni and cheese was really good- my kids loved it. We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos again and were just as happy as the first time. Everything was great. I just wish I wasn't on the other side of the city. They're as far east as you can go and I'm as far west. Worth the trip. We'll be back many times. With and without our kids."
"I recommend you go somewhere else. Alot of people rave about the food, so went to try it. Waited for 10 minutes and no server came by.No matter how good food is if service is horrible no one will want to go back.Go somewhere else"
"The salad bar is amazing, I wish I could have it every day, always kept fresh. The milkshakes and dessert menu are a must try."
"Throughout college, I had the opportunity to work for a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant downtown Chicago.  At the time - I thought the week long training was a bit extreme for a server job. BUT - as I became accustomed to the LEYE values, I learned they really want their restaurants to give the best service to its' customers and it really shows.  RJ Grunts takes care of their guests from the moment they step in the restaurant to the moment they leave. Their service is amazing, food is delicious, and eating out at RJ Grunts is a true dining experience!"
"Grunts was pretty good. We tried the grilled cheese, cheeseburger, and chicken fingers. The food is good bar & grill type grub. My husband really liked the cheeseburger and the kids loved the grilled cheese. I had the chicken fingers which were tasty. The sweet potato fries were really good as well.They're shoestring, but not too crispy.Our waitress was really nice and the service was good, so we would try Grunts again if we're in the area."
"OVERPRICED. I've had waaaaaaaay better burgers elsewhere.  And charging extra for fries is ridiculous!  The quality of their burgers is not worth $15 a pop!The 2 stars are for the staff.  They were accommodating to my crying infant despite the cramped spacing in the restaurant.  Our server and host were the only good things about RJ Grunts, other than that... go elsewhere for a burger!"
The Mr. Chicken & the Grunt burger are fabulous plus the soups are aaammaazing! Salad is great but pricey. Staff is AWESOME & friendly.
"Things started out rocky when they seated us 25 minutes after our reservation, but thanks to our waitress, Dori, we had an amazing time. The food was amazing, and the Buffalo Chicken nachos are a must. After our meal, Dori brought us a chocolate chip cookie sundae on the house because we had to wait so long. But she didn't stop there, she also knocked the nachos off our bill. I will definitely come back!"
"Came late on a weeknight and was pleasantly surprised to find that their kitchen was open late.  I'm a big fan of late night kitchens!  I'm also a big fan of late night kitchens that don't suck.  RJ Grunts kitchen is awesome.  It being late, I was hungry and had those hungry eyes.  Everything on the menu looked amazing but the special farmhouse burger couldn't be passed up.  The salad bar looked super fresh (especially lit by a DISCO ball) but was due to close in 15 min.  Had to pass up said salad bar for a farmhouse burger.... I was *not* disappointed.  I also did not leave hungry.  In fact, I ended up leaving one belt notch bigger (don't judge!).I'm going to have to come back for the **all you can eat** brunch and the milkshakes.  I'm also going to have to (sadly) not come to RJ Grunts that often.  Yes; there are healthy menu options... but let's be real.  I'm a fatty... I have no will power.  I may need hospital attention if I come here often."
"Would have loved to eat here, but unfortunately they told us it would be a half hour wait....After waiting over an hour, they took every other party waiting (arriving after us), but told us it is difficult to seat 7 people.  It is difficult to wait over an hour for a table.  Bet it is not difficult to accept payment for a 7 person check... won't be getting ours.  Guess they have never heard of pushing 2 tables together..."
As visitors from Australia we found RJ Grunts to be a great experience with very generous servings.  We were very happy with our waitress who gave us some history of the restaurant which we found very interesting. thanks for a great first night in Chicago.
Still yet to have the famous salad var but the burgers and cottage from fries are always good. Imo you can't go wrong with the grunt burger
Great food but don't expect to sit too long since the bench seats are so hard and stiff.  Great chili and sandwiches.  Love the history of this place.
Awesome atmosphere and excellent food!  Went there with the family (2 kids and my lovely wife) and we all found something we enjoyed and had a great time.
"I went to RJ Grunts for some grub before heading over to the Lincoln Park Zoo over the weekend.  Crazily enough, probably because ZooLights was opening up on Friday, the place was packed!  We made a reservation on Tuesday and there was only a 4 pm reservation time!  So we took it and ran with it.The menu is large but the seating is on the smaller side.  I felt like our booth that sat four sat us okay but is more comfortable with two (originally the booth only had two sets of utensils).  Generally our service was pretty good with a few minor hiccups with getting some requests, but our orders were taken quickly and food was brought out on time.  I thought the food was really good.  Some orders at the table included the buffalo chicken sandwich, BBQ sandwich, and I got the french dip.  Their french dip was exceptionally good because the bread was made with garlic bread (what an amazing idea!).  You have the choice to upgrade your chips for $1 more (which was phenomenal although the chips are equally as good).  We also ordered some of their drink specials which were really fun.  They had a toffee hazelnut milkshake, a hot chocolate tini, and a spiced apple cider - perfect for the holiday seasons!This is your place to go for a very reasonable price, and some perfectly American food.  Fun place to take kids or adults really!"
We enjoyed this restaurant.  They take reservations which is great.  Burgers were great and service was terrific even though we chose to stay a bit long and it was crowded.  No one made us feel rushed which was AWESOME.  We will be back.
"RJ Grunts is always good.  I been there when it was packed and when it was empty and the food and service are always spot on.  You can't go wrong with a burger or the huge salad bar they have here.  It is what they do and they do it well.  Though last time I tried their fried chicken which is the Sunday special and really blew my mind.  A great breading and you could really taste the buttermilk in it.  There are usually a good brew or 2 on tap.  They routinely have Three Floyds which is always a plus.  You can't beat the location either, right by Lincoln Park Zoo.  Now there is a great date,"
"this place gets packed pretty fast.. came here on a Saturday night and the wait was long unless you sit by the bar.. which we did and it was a little crampy and uncomfortable...we ordered 16 pc wings in spicy for appetizers.. i could of done without.. the wings came out warm instead of hot.. and the sauce was just not my cup of tea..i ordered the yowza burger which has peppercorn, spicy ketchup, pepper jack cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce & tomato.. i asked if they can make it into a double and how much to do it since i didn't see that as a option in the menu..the waiter went to ask and said yes but they wouldn't know the pricing yet? next thing i know my burger came out w/ the double patties and he still didn't tell me how much it was.. but at that time i was already too hungry..  the burger was delicious!! good flavoring and the patties was juicy.. all the ingredients complimented each other well.. the portion size is big too..we figured out the price when we got our check.. it was $9 to have a extra patty and a little more bacon... i thought it would of been like probably $4 or $5 tops..i will come back just for the burgers tho.. this time without it being doubled! haha"
"Great selections, delicious food, cool atmosphere.. Temperate soup is an interesting concept.. Good beer selection too"
"I ate at RJ grunts for the first time on Saturday night. I found the atmosphere to be very warm and inviting. The place reminds me of a neighborhood restaurant in the 70s. It brought back good memories of the excitment eating out brought me as a kid. Doesn't look like they have remodeled the place since the restuarant's inception but I love this. It has charm and warmth as a result. The best part is that there are pictures of every server who has ever worked there hanging on their walls...very cute.As for the food, I got the BBQ pork sandwich. Although I found it unique and very tasty, the portion was too way to small, in my opinion. I don't consider myself a huge eater, but I could have easily eaten two sandwiches. Also, it came with ""cottage fries"" which are basically just homemade potato chips. Next time I will definitely upgrade to the fries or sweet potato fries.What I thought was very nice though, was that the server brought us a complimentary dessert due to it being our fisrt time dining there. It was a warm chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream. That alone makes me want to go back soon!"
"First of all, I did not eat at their renowned salad bar that has been there since their opening 1971. What am I? A rabbit? Nope. But I did eat some Soup, Chips and Guac and a Burger with Sweet Potato Fries. All were A-OK and I even had a gift certificate so it made my visit there even better.It was a blustery cold day and I wanted some soup and RJ Grunts was there to warm me up. I bellied up to the bar and ordered a Pabst Tallboy and a cup of soup. The soup du jour was Loaded Baked Potato and it was a tasty cup of soup. I noticed they have half off appetizers from 3-6pm on weekdays. I order the Chips and Salsa/Guacamole app and it came out promptly. The bartender was friendly and kept the Tallboys coming. The chips were fresh and fried fresh in house. The salsa was ok, but the guac was really good. After I devoured the half priced app I asked for suggestions for an entrée from the bartender. ""French Dip or a Burger?""I inquired.  He said ""get the burger"". I got the burger.I ordered the Gruntburger, medium, with Sweet Potato Fries. And when it came the burger was cooked to a perfect medium and the meat was accompanied with fried onions and bleu cheese. No need for catsup and mustard here. The Sweet Pots were crisp and there were a lot of them. There better be a lot of fries for the extra $2.00 they tagged on to my bill. It was a good burger, it wasn't a Lockdown, Kuma's or Bad Apple quallity burger, but it satisfied. RJ Grunts you are ok. I shall come back again to experience more Tallboys and half priced appetizers. I did not even see or notice the renowned salad bar, by the way."
Still a great beer selection. They are offering a discount late night after 10pm after the zoo beer tasting. Fantastic.
"If this is the first LEYE establishment, then one of 2 things have since happened- they haven't changed much from their original ways and/or, they've provided a lesson on how to improve future LEYE establishments! We came here tonight in a super early reservation at 4 pm before going to Lincoln Park Zoo for Zoolights (that in itself is another review).  We were surprised how packed this place was and the place was tiny!  Waitress said they're known for their salad bar and the steep $14.99 pp price tag was accompanied by an ever-threatening message on the menu reminding you not to share plates!  I scoped it out and about the most exotic thing the salad bar had were the pitted kalamata olives.  I ordered the burger and little did I know I shouldn't have assumed that it would come with lettuce or tomato- it's a good thing I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger or it would've been just the meat and the bun.  We had a big group with 4 kids in tow and no one was impressed enough with their food to even mention anything about it.  It was also an uncomfortable dining experience, with tables packed elbow to elbow and when you get up, you run the risk of either bumping into the server or another diner.  All in all- I've had better and for the quality of the experience, I think it's more nostalgia that people come here for."
"I had high expectations for this place since it is a lettuce entertainment restaurant, and it was everything I expected. The kitchy decor and menu were cute and unique, and the food was delicious. I went with my mom and two teenage brothers, and it was the perfect lunch spot for a family. They're known for their burgers & salad bar & of course, the temperature soup! Their soup is priced based off the temperature outside! The colder the weather, the cheaper the soup, which is awesome. 22 degrees=22 cent soup! The buffalo chicken nachos were also delish. The prices were a little steep for a burger joint, but the food & atmosphere makes up for it."
"GO SEE DORI.  This place is a hit!  I brought my parents here for some good burgers and the awesome salad bar.  My parents fell in love with not only the atmosphere and food, but the service.  Dori was our waitress and she was outstanding.  She knew the specials and really could pin point the best meals for each of us.  She even brought us a complimentary cookie skillet at the end of our meal as a thank you for finally stopping in, as we told her we have always wanted to go just never made it happen.  This is a definite stop!"
"Meh. I wanted to like this place since I'm a fan of the Lettuce franchise, but the poor service ruined my experience. Went in around 11am on a Saturday and it was not busy at all. We were greeted and promptly seated but it all went downhill from there. When our server came to the table she rattled off the specials so quickly I could barely understand her; needless to say, she wasn't friendly or welcoming. Moreso, she appeared preoccupied the entire time, even though it looked as if we were her only table. I struggled to even find her when I wanted a refill on coffee and we had to flag her down even for the most basic thing. The (breakfast) food was okay, but I've definitely had better in the neighborhood. I'd give it another chance but I won't be having breakfast and I hope for better service."
"I visited for dinner with my wife and some family just before Christmas. We decided to come here because of location as we were already by it to see the zoo and the Christmas lights. It was an extremely cold day and this place was completely packed, so I'd guess that they are usually busy. We did get a table for 8 pretty quick though, but I'd imagine that it's not always that easy.I ordered the burger as the waitress recommended it as their specialty. I was very pleased. It was the best burger I have had in a good while at a restaurant. It was fresh and juicy and made to near perfection. The fries were not bad either. My wife got the salad bar, which was pretty awesome. There was some nice fruit in it and she seemed to enjoy it. Although she had a bite of my burger and said she had wished that she had gotten that instead. The burgers are the reason to come here judging from what others ordered at our table. The price was a little more than I would expect, but not awful. I would come here again."
I have fond memories going here for a lifetime.  The food and location is great. I remember them having a fabulous salad bar and burgers but entire menu is satisfying.  Go for lunch/brunch and dinner. ENJOY!
"So apparently I'm the last person to hear of this place... Haha, but I randomly went hear with a friend for lunch on Mothers Day. The entire atmosphere is a typical Chicago family restaurant. We were the youngest people there, minus the actual babies. But our waitress was insanely sweet! I ordered the Mr. Chicken and oh my, it was so good. It's basically an Italian beef but with chicken, loved it! Their fries were amazing too (I'm a fry lover). Ended our meal with a chocolate malt, also delish. For randomly walking into this place, I was beyond satisfied and will definitely return!"
A Chicago staple. Their food never disappoints and priced reasonably considering its location and amount of food received. Great atmosphere and great service. A personal favorite are the wings but their burgers are just as good. Don't forget to get the warm cookie and ice cream for dessert!
"Very solid food, the hamburgers are very very good. Other than that, wouldn't get too excited.. Yes - good, pleasant service. Yes - nice salad bar and diverse menu. However, restrooms were filthy, and I don't like when that happens! All in all, a good choice after a walk in the zoo!"
Great food and great service. This was my first experience here and I will definitely be coming back!
"Very friendly, awesome service. Loved the atmosphere. Been wanting to go here for awhile. So glad I did!"
"We stopped in here before heading to Lincoln Park Zoo with my son. Burgers are great no question. The salad bar looked incredible but at $14.95, I couldn't justify it. Biggest complaint is the service, which is the reason for the 3 stars. We were seated right away and the restaurant was full but not insane, since we were there between lunch and dinner. It took over 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table and that was after I went to the hostess to find someone. The waitresses and either understaffed or under experienced. It was surprising to see in a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant."
"I was in Chicago this week for business, and I was lucky enough to end up at RJ Grunts . . . twice. ;) Literally, this was the best salad bar I've had in my entire life. I believe it was $14.95 for the salad and soup bar, which may seem steep, but it was absolutely worth it. I had a cup of cream of tomato soup along with my salad, and it was fantastic as well.The salad bar was stocked with fresh ingredients (no brown lettuce!), lots of veggies to choose from, plenty of cheese, and a couple of pasta and bean salads. The dressing selection was great as well. I've never been so satisfied with a salad in my life! I'll be back in Chicago in December, and RJ Grunts will be one of my first stops.The first server I had couldn't have been nicer. I didn't get his name, but he was super friendly and informative, and brought us a delicious, complimentary cookie/ice cream dessert since it was our first time. I literally came back the very next day (because I hadn't stopped thinking about the salad bar)--I had a different server, but he was also super nice and friendly.Can't rave about the salad bar enough!"
This place really is great for all ages.  Its small and gets crowded so if you don't like louder family friendly places this is not for you.  It is the perfect location for dinner/lunch after a day at the zoo.Atmosphere - Oldies are playing throwout the place.  The decor is simple no frills.  Food - Amazing each and everytime I've been here.  Nothing is bad.  Things I loveCalifornia Chicken Wraps Green Chili BurgerFish TacosNachos Nirvana and Buffalo Chicken NachosWings - seriously the best wing sauceOnion Rings - Home made and so good. Chili is outstanding as is the French Onion SoupGo Enjoy Have Fun!
"It is really hard to find something bad to say about this casual dining establishment. Well, perhaps, the only negative thing that I can say about this place is that there are always 1000 kids there every time I stop in.  Not necessarily a place for dates, but it is family-friendly, and I can appreciate that. Every single item on the menu is consistently good, and the salad bar, which I believe was either the first salad bar in Chicago or in the United States entirely, is always fully packed with fresh ingredients. For you drinkers, they serve gumball head on tap and always have, which is much appreciated."
"I would have probably given this place 5 stars if I wasn't trying to eat gluten free. I found out after ordering that they may have a gluten free menu. I ordered a burger without the bun and it was OK. What moved them up to 4 stars was when I asked for the check, they brought out a small, complimentary dessert, since it was our first time joining them. It was a warm snickerdoodle cookie, with ice cream, caramel, and cinnamon. Gluten free took a break. Wow was it good, and a nice touch. Very convenient to Lincoln Park Zoo."
Great hamburgers and salad bar is wonderful but service is really slow.
"American as apple pie!Heard of this place a few times and just happened to pass it while hangin' around lincoln park zoo and north ave beach.  Stopped in for some lunch and it also just happened to be part of the lettuce entertain you network to which I had a gift card on me. Even better.  The whole menu is fair priced, surprising given the area.For lunch, along with another diner, we went halves on a california chicken wrap and the patty melt.  Both executed perfectly to the point I can't pick which was better.  For sides we had regular french fries and sweet potato fries. Also cooked well I just have a personal bone to pick with shoe string style.  Appetizer on deck was a milder version of red robins tower of onion rings but they were classic and a more modest serving size.Lettuce entertain you gave me the push to go in and I'm glad I did so.  The atmosphere inside is a little rustic and I had to ask the server what was up with all the pictures on the wall of mostly women, but some men.  Turns out I thought right that they were all pictures of every server that has ever worked there up to the current staff.  I would definitely go back if I needed some lunch and I was in the area again."
"I am probably the last in the city to try RJ Grunts. Yum! Had the daily special - chicken fried steak, Mac & cheese, and veggies. Everything was down home delicious. Had the brownie for dessert & it was meh."
"Today I had lunch with my Aunt Arlene at R.J. Grunts!Now, gotta say that I love this restaurant, it's one ofRich Melman's Lettuce entertain you restaurants and it isone of the coolest places, 70's themed, even 70's musicplaying in the background.Now, Grunts has the coolest menu and on the week-ends they have a brunch that includes breakfast items, a phenominallooking soup and salad bar, lotsa fruits and other assorted goodies.Now, whatever possessed me to order the fish tacos today I don't get but.. I just had to have them..I mean  grilled tilapia tacos sounded really good, I never had them before but I just had to have them today for some bizzare reason.Okay, my tacos were loaded with cilantro and I hate cilantro! Yuck!I hate cilantro like I hate sauerkraut, it's just nasty.Grunts is famous for burgers but I had to order those damn fish tacos!So, I pulled the tilapia out and ate it like that, it came with somereally good rice though..So, I am not dissing R.J. Grunts by any means, they have reallygood food other than the fish tacos that is.Don't think I'll be doing fish tacos again in my lifetime..My next visit to Grunts it'll be a burger for sure..:)"
"I  hate being a contrarian. I never want to be ""that person."" But RJ Grunts did not really measure up.The salad bar that everyone exalts didn't look super exciting or well-stocked, especially compared to others I've seen. The brunch buffet was extremely limited as well. I got the green chile burger. The burger also had grated cheese on it - not something you see often. I've had messy burgers before, but this was completely impossible to eat, almost as if no thought went into how someone would actually eat it. Props to them on the green chile being spicy, as well as the waitress being very nice, but I do not get why this place has such high ratings!"
I've been coming here since I can remember. It always is packed but fast service and even better food. The staff is always nice. I usually get a burger and their chips which are always good and don't forget the soup which is priced based on whatever the temperature is that day!
"Kind of baffled as to why I've never written a review for RJ's. Classic Chicago, the first LEYE restaurant does not disappoint. While it can get incredibly crowded, I've never had a bad dining experience here. Definitely make a reservation as I've arrived to find large crowds, even at off times. Once made the mistake of taking my grandparents here...they couldn't hear anything anyone was saying the entire night. Definitely noisy and cramped, but that's just part of the atmosphere!Everything I've had at RJ Grunts is deeelicious, especially their turkey burger, onion rings, and milkshakes. Their wings and chilli are also great options if you're looking for something on the hearty or filling side. Typically, I go with the salad bar. Filled with tons of toppings, you can make an impressive plate of greens. It also comes with a couple kinds of soup. RJ's offers a brunch buffet as part of the salad bar which is decent, but I'd stick with lunch and dinner."
"This place is dangerous to be within walking distance of my apartment. I had the Yowza burger (awesome!) and the sweet potato fries (equally awesome!). And, to mitigate the significant hangover and lack of sleep I had, I topped it all off with a strawberry oreo shake. In case you're wondering, as I was, what the heck oreos were doing in my strawberry shake, it was awesome and RJ Grunts will mix flavors for you because that's what cool kids do.Their salad bar has everything under the sun, which I will definitely check out the next time I am there."
"My go-to for wings. SO YUMMY. They always hit the spot and with free drink refills, how can you go wrong?? The salad bar is also great. I once got a burger there - don't bother. Just have wings. And salad. Or just wings."
"This place is like a non-Italian Bucca de Beppo of the North Side.  Lots of photos adorning the walls, friendly staff, cute drawings on the menu.  There are lots of options...burgers, entrees, HUGE salad bar (get it, $5 add on with a dinner...there is cream cheese chocolate chip dip up there), and a nice drink menu that even includes glasses of wine.  My vegan friend picked this place - so it's vegan approved.My bacon burger was good, nothing to scream about, and their fries were yummy. My only complaint is that it's a bit tight.  Ask for a booth, they're a bit small, but I wouldn't want to be bumped by passer bys and salad bar lines at a table."
I like this place. Decent burgers and not to expensive. Stopped by here for a late lunch on Friday and we were seated right away. Willing to give this place another go round to explore something else on the menu
"The food is pretty good, but I'm not crazy about the atmosphere. It's very dark and seating in the bar area is limited. I would give the food 4 stars, but definitely not the atmosphere."
The service was impeccable. Very friendly and accommodating servers. Good food too (I had the ribs!).
Good place for nice lunch.
"Very tasty burgers and beer, wish it would have stayed open longer."
"Some things never change, some things shouldn't.  Grunts must never change.  It's perfect the way it is. From handmade milkshakes to fantastic sandwiches, quality and value are always top shelf.  Just don't expect a seat at lunchtime on a school holiday--the zoo empties into this joint"
"I know this is a burger joint, but the french onion soup is one of the best I have ever had. The burgers are outstanding too, with a lot of variety. Parking is a nightmare, however, so I would suggest walking if you can. Prices are a little excessive as well, but you get what you pay for when it comes to food."
"I'm upgrading my review since I recently ate here again and everything was fine.  This place is really a classic.  The food is always pretty good, the decor is fun, and the location right next to Lincoln Park can't be beat."
I really wanted to like you RJ Grunts but really you lost me not long after arriving. The atmosphere was great as was out server but...1) really! $1 extra for fries with the burger as opposed to your cottage fires (aka overcooked potato slices)2) everything arrived luke warm at best...this might be why it took 40 min for 2 burgers in an empty restaurant.3) what was with the blood spot on the bottom of my bun?  There was no blood in my burger so you may have some cross contamination issues in your kitchen 4) burgers despite great names were uninspired and the patties themselves were profoundly lacking in flavour My two stars are for atmosphere and our server...I won't be back.
"RJ Grunts is fun, hip and happening in a far out way!  Located in Lincoln Park this is part of the LEYE group.  My boyfriend and I went on Saturday night for date night around 8:45pm.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, but we survived by having a few beers at the bar while we waited.  They don't have a huge beer selection, but the beer geek in me found one to tide me over.  We were seated in the dining room area, just around the corner from the salad bar, which I've heard is a great salad bar, if you're into that type of thing.  Me, not so much.The walls are adorned with random photos of women, with 70's style hair and clothing. (think Farrah Fawcett) Not sure the relevance of each woman, but whatever. My date and I ordered the fried pickles to start.  They came out hot and they were the fried pickle chips, not spears!  Bonus!  I hate the spears the breading always falls off with the first bite.  The dipping sauce was also very good. We both ordered burgers.  I ordered the special for the night, a farmhouse burger topped with a soft white cheese similar to gruyere, peppered bacon, arugula and a fried egg.  Burgers come with chips, but you can opt for fries. ($2 upcharge)  I went with the sweet potato fries.  My burger came out as I ordered, medium, and it was delicious!  The flavors were all very complimentary!  For two burgers, an app, and two beers our tab came to $46 and change.  Not too bad, considering we had a $50 gift card. RJ Grunts is a chill place to go grab a burger, or sandwich, a couple of beers and oogle some random photos of chicks from the 70's.  Good for date night or family dinner."
"Been going there since early 1980's.  Cramped seating, but love the salad bar ans soup!  Make a reservation!"
"Well as a chick that adores the 70's, this place rocks my little world. Hell, my favorite movie is dazed and confused and am still bumming that salad bars have gone by the wayside.  But not here!  I think this was Rich Melman's first restaurant (with a partner that passed away many years ago :-() and the salad bar was their new fangled concept.  And, what a salad bar it was and is!  I remember the first time I saw it stacked a plenty from top to bottom and THEY had chocolate cream cheese! OMG, this suburban girl in 1980 was stoked!  So many choices, so many things i had never seen before!  They even had dressings that went beyond Italian and Thousand Island ;-).  Chowed down on a huge ass salad and had a sammie that i can't remember now but i recall it being effing good.  Fast forward many years and me and hubs and daughter or sans daughter freequent this place...alot.  Now, i still have to get their salad bar but now I get it with their baked French onion soup, another 70's treasure.  The soup is the real thing.  You can tell it's from real, slow cooked and simmered beef stock with plenty of onions and the creme de le creme topping of plenty of gouda cheese melting all over the crock.  I love that it still has its original kitchy decor.  I hope this place stays around forever!  Hey Rich, remember this, I was quite mad at you when you were going to close it a few years ago.  Yep, i was one of ""those"" that called and begged you to keep it open...and you did.  Awwww, thanks."
Knocked down from 4 stars because 1) there was a wait and we had a reservation 2) service was slow 3) my medium rare ordered burger was medium at bestHad the Gruntsburger. Wish I went with just the salad bar. Would come back for the salad bar. BOMB sweet potato fries.
"Food is really good, known for their Salad Bar which is awesome I might add.... Great service and pretty good selection of beers.... although many of them are pale ales which is annoying"
Great neighborhood burger joint bar next to the Lincoln Park Zoo. It is more family oriented than late night bar yet you can get a late night burger at a value better than dinner or lunch! Love the chips! A place you get an urge to eat at every now and then that has a friendly atmosphere. I have yet to bring someone here who did not like it!
"This is one old school, straight outta 1971 cramped joint. My guess is there was more room to move around on the dance floor at Studio 54.Usually, I don't care about the ""intimacy"" of the seating. But RJ Grunts revolves around their ""famous"" salad bar, which requires diners to stand up and walk back and forth to the...well, salad bar. While impossible, a couple of more inches between tables would be nice.That being said the--no joke--inch-thick burgers are cooked precisely to the requested doneness. The servers are efficient and engaging Sunday through Thursday. Fri/Sat? Well, on those nights, the seating isn't the only thing cramped around here.The salad bar really isn't much to brag about, but it's a nice add-on to your dinner. Cross your fingers and hope the salad bar offers tortilla soup during your visit. They cook a deliciously mean one.There always seems to be a Lincoln Park family with an unruly toddler, but I've begun to find that aspect endearing....""HANNAH!  STOP KISSING PEOPLE!"""
"Did not get value for price paid. I am not sure what the hype is about. I think people get wrapped up in what other people say and they can't have an opinion of their own. I have been to other lettuce properties and had a great experience. This one was disappointing on many levels. Service was OK. Our server was attentive but did not offer information about specials or menu items that change daily. Way over priced for what you get. My $8.00 sangria came in an 8oz glass filled with ice and fruit. I got probably 4oz of sangria. My son's $6.00 malt came in the same size glass along with the metal cup they make it in which was 1/3 full. Any other restaurant will give you twice the amount for $2.00 less. My other son's $7.00 kids meal was a small bowl of mac & cheese, not more than a cup of mac & cheese in the bowl, a glass of milk and a bag of animal crackers. The animal crackers were not even a name brand, some off brand named Austin. It also came with a pack of 3 bendaroos type of toy. What a rip off. My wife and I ordered burgers which were tasty but the hamburger patty was smaller than the bun. My burger came with sweet potato fries that I was charged an extra two dollars for and a pickle. All for the rip off price of $15.00. My wife's burger was $14.00 because she got the sweet potato fries too. The salad bar looked good. I was interested in trying that but to add the salad bar to an entree cost $9.00. Not $3.50 or $4.00 you might expect to pay for a salad bar add on at other restaurants. Over all the food was okay, not great. Everything was way over priced.Don't think we will be going back to RJ Grunts again."
"Last time I was there was over 25 years ago and honestly it hasn't changed much.The burgers are very good but would be better if the bun was special.The salad bar was messy and picked over so we took a pass on it.Our waitress was great and service excellent. But I'm afraid it time to spend some money and upgrade this place.Its cramped,old and kinda dirty looking."
"Close to the lake, attentive staff, and awesome burgers! You can't go wrong here, especially on a sunny day by the water."
"Two stars primarily for the hostess staff. So I called last night to find out the wait for my party and was told we'd be seated close to 7. I gave my name and since we were about 10 mins away and that seemed fairly reasonable. So we sat in the bar, adults had drinks and we hung out. The hostess comes over at 6:45 and tells me that we should be OK for our promised time of 7:30 and I calmly told her that I was told we'd be seated at 7, not 7:30. She offered up a booth and I told her it would work for us, then she came back and told me that there was a party finishing up at a table for 6 and we'd be seated shortly. WTF? why couldn't we go to the empty booth? No explanation but I turned around and there was a couple seated in the booth I was shown. That really pissed me off, and I would have left but then I still would have to figure out what to do about dinner for my family. Now we're still waiting and I've seen many groups seated before us, I'm hoping that it is because they were smaller than my party of 6.  When we were finally seated around 7:15 my kids were so tired they barely ate their food so we wasted about $15 ordering them food. Our server was quite nice and even gave us a little dessert. The food service was prompt and food decent however I'm not hurrying back anytime soon based on the hostess staff."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Lincoln Park.  I generally have fantastic service--the one time it wasn't the owner intervened before we said anything and sent us a $30 gift card to apologize.  I have three main loves/go-to items:(1) chicken fingers with buffalo & ranch on the side.  The chicken is quality, the breading is unique and delicious, and when dipped in buffalo & ranch sauce the combination just couldn't get any better.  I know, chicken fingers, but try em.(2) their onion rings!! can't go to grunts and pass up that delicious fried tower of goodness(3) their temperature soup: always tasty and costs 5 cents when its 5 degrees out, $1.00 when it's 100 degrees... you get the ideaOnly downside is the wait.  It gets crowded because it's awesome, so be ready."
Great atmosphere after catching the Lincoln Park Zoolights. Chili is perfect for a cold night and the salad bar is a fun surprise...but must go back for the signature burgers.
"MOLD ON FOOD. Place should be shut down. Is it possible to give zero stars? I've been to this place 5 times out of convenience to the zoo, but will never return. Hope the health inspectors out there are reading this."
"Went here a few months ago and loved it! Bloody Mary and pulled pork sandwich, Amazing!! Can't wait to go back"
The food is average to a little above average on a good day. I go there a lot because its a great location and a real good spot to hang out and grab a casual meal.
"Love this place. The beers are always decently priced and the food is awesome. I've had the buffalo chicken nachos which are a heaping pile of awesome, one of their burgers and we even hit the salad bar one day. The place itself isn't all too large and the booths and tables seem to give you a fair amount of privacy wherever you sit. I'd say if you are looking for a second date type place this may be as good a stop as any if you are looking for a casual meal. The salad bar was actually very impressive. They had a great selection of toppings and salad dressings and I honestly can't wait to try the salad bar again. I've heard the sunday brunch/breakfast bar is equally as impressive but haven't had a chance to try it yet. It's really hard to say much about this place because it is all so good. Just try it out for yourself sometime and if you are doing the salad bar be sure and come hungry."
"I've been to RJ Grunts a million times - usually to eat a club sandwich or french dip. However, I recently discovered that they have one of the best GRILLED CHEESE sandwiches in town.  Yummm, I can't stop thinking about it. Their homemade chips (cottage fries) are dreamy too. The only downfall is that on an unlucky day you might land some shoddy service or an awkwardly cramped seat. I'll happily take my chances to eat the delicious food."
RJ's has brunch on both Saturday and Sunday now! Me likey.
"Super fresh salad bar!  Everything was delicious, turkey burger and fish tacos were yummy!  Love the atmosphere! Go by the free zoo if u have time!"
"My wife and I take our (now) 11 year old daughter here regularly after a zoo visit and we always have a great meal.  Yes, the place is small and tight and yes, you will likely have to wait on weekends around brunch for a table.  But, the burgers are great, the music is great (if you like 70's music) and the location is perfect for the zoo.  The green chile burger is awesome and we love the fried pickles.  Go for a burger and a beer."
"If you love LEYE restaurants, you've got to come here since it's the original one!  I've been here twice and have had phenomenal experiences both times.  The menu is expansive, the staff is friendly, and the ambiance is comfortable.  There's truly something for everyone with their huge menu -- their salad bar is awesome, their burgers are great, and even people with dietary restrictions/preferences can find something to eat.  The only downside is there isn't really a ""waiting area"" -- so if you're going to dine their during peak hours, call ahead to reserve a table.  Regardless, I've had a great experience dining here and think you will too!  Hint - If you're at the zoo, I highly suggest venturing over here instead to eat -- you'll get great food that's reasonably priced!"
Terrific hamburger.  I had the yowza burger which is great.   Good selection of beers including my favorite gumball ale.  Nice atmosphere and  close to the zoo.
"I've gone back several times now and still love RJ Grunts.  Now if we are even remotely close to Lincoln Park and its getting close to lunch or dinner, this is my go to place.The french dip sandwich is really good, but my new thing is their wings.  Love them, make a great appetizer, love them so much thinking of skipping the meal and just getting a double order of the wings."
Ok I understand the salad bar was the first in the country but come on you cannot tell me the salad bar is great? Its a regular small salad bar and its over priced at $15 come on man! And the place is very small you have to cram in with everybody else. I did not have the burger but I will try to have it next time I go in there if I do
"We went here after finding that the original place we wanted to go was closed for lunch and tight on time we just wandered upon this place. Lucky us! We loved it! And we ate way, way WAY too much- their servings are huge! I got the patty melt with a turkey burger instead of a beef burger and it was loaded with cheese (yay!) and everything you hope a patty melt will be. Their house made chips are super yummy. And whatever dessert they give you if you're a first timer is like... pee-your-pants-of-excitement good. Also- their Sangria. Word. Really yummy and different, it's not sweet but it's loaded with spices. I think I finished it in two seconds."
Went here for the first time on Sunday. DELICIOUS. Sat at the bar and had a beer while we waiting for a table. We did not have a reservation. Had some hot buffalo wings and the Yowza burger. The burger was great but the wings were amazing. If you're claustrophobic it may not be a great option for you. The tables are packed very tight. I'll definitely be back.
"I don't really get why this place has a 4star rating... Maybe in it's heyday? Like, four decades ago? I think yelp needs to filter out archaic ratings.I did not have a bad experience here, but a rather ""Meh"" one. Like everyone else, the $15 salad bar is kind of crazy. I peeked and saw nothing special about it. It's already overpriced, but then, anything you want extra is a dollar here and two dollars there. Burgers were $11 with 'chips', if you want to substitute reg fries for that, +$1, sweet potato fries +$2. A scoop of tuna salad with your salad bar? +$5!! Are you kidding me?! Ok maybe.. if the food is really good. but it isn't. I was kind of disappointed at how soggy my burger was. It was loaded with mayo and too much of other slop. I could barely hold it, as the bun slowly disintegrates with every bite. The burger was just alright. So all in all, save your money and walk a little bit more to Clark street or Lincoln Ave and find you another bar/restaurant."
Very crowded at 3pm on Saturday but good service. Broccoli Cheddar soup was vegetarian. Solid burger and salad bar. Can't go wrong here.
"Very good food.  Notable: salad bar, burgers, chicken wings and hole in the wall warm ambiance of 70s meets 80s awesomeness!"
"Holy Salad Bar!If you are hungry and in the neighborhood this is a wonderful place for lunch or dinner. Appetizers, burgers, fries, beers are all delish but salad bar is where it's at. Really, really fresh ingredients and a lot of um. The menu is really cute and it is fun to check out the old servers pictures that are plastered all around the restaurant."
"Went here on a Saturday night which was very crowded.  Make reservations at Open Table ahead of time or you can be looking at an hour wait.Due to the animation on the website, I was under the impression that this place had ""hippy  counterculture"" theme.  However, with the exception of 1970s pop music and black and white pictures of women on the wall, it feels like a traditional pub.  There is dim lighting, inadequate space, and single stall bathrooms.  The line to the washrooms can get a bit pushy as it interferes with the staff entrance to the kitchen.   THE CROWD:This place is kid/parent/grandparent friendly.  When I went on a saturday evening, approximately 15% of the crowd was 4-9yr old kids.  THE FOOD: This is your basic pub burger style menu.  In addition, you will find a 70's style salad bar.  Due to cost, you will have to choose either salad bar or burger as there is no ""combo"" deal option.  The menu even jokes about the salad bar only being available ""alone, by itself and including nothing else.""  The burgers are thick and tasty, but still your standard pub fare.  They are available with bacon, cheddar, chiles, etc..  They include home made potato chips as opposed to french fries. THE SERVICE: The service is ok.  We requested sweet potato fries but were served regular.  In addition, I had to ask for soda refills.  OK, not great service.  Nothing to get upset about though. WOULD I GO BACK? Yes, the burgers are great and the atmosphere is good for entertaining a more conservative crowd.  Look elsewhere if you are looking for a more edgy experience."
"Good reviews for this place baffle me. The salad bar is no better than any cafeteria-style restaurant. The sangria is awful, almost all sugar. The burgers are mediocre at best. The nicest thing to say is that the wait staff was pleasant."
"Good food, great service, and a bizarrely awesome atmosphere best describe my experience at RJ Grunts....Our server (Michelle I believe) was incredibly friendly, funny, and informative.  The atmosphere at Rj Grunts is that of an old school joint stuck in the past (in a good way).  The soundtrack is awesome and consistently playing music from decades ago.   The food was solid.  I've had a burger as well as the simple yet unique Chicken Au Jus sandwich.  Both were great, and a solid beer list as well.  We even got free desert as it was our first time in there.  I cannot stress how good the customer service there was."
Packed on a Saturday night at 5pm- my kinda place to the bring kids. Food is good and inexpensive. Pretty good beer selection. TVs in the bar to catch up on the game.
"I love love love when I can upgrade a once bad review to a now great review. This review is for service alone... Stopped over at RJ Grunts for an appetizer and a couple of drinks on a Sunday afternoon... The place was packed but there were a couple of empty seats at the bar. PERFECT... I like sitting at the bar anyways! Brian the bartender is awesome! Funny, quick, suggests good beers, and won't let your drink go dry... GREAT service... Thanks Brian! p.s., The blackened chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty!"
I have work with RJ Grunts to cater lunch at our office a couple times now and both times everything was top notch! They went above and beyond making sure everything was to my liking and the food was delicious and fresh! I haven't been to the restaurant yet but I can imagine it being just as great !
"Love their salad bar and it comes with soup! it is a lil pricey, but it is always fresh and full!  This is a great family place with a huge menu!  Everyone will be able to find something.  If you come on a saturday, you must get their ribs!  It's their saturday special!"
"Picked up a Gruntburger - about a 5/8 lb patty with grilled onions and bleu cheese.  Ok for $9.95, with SP fries."
"Was at a regatta near the zoo and the food selection area wasn't great so we just got some fries to-go from here. Fries came out luke-warm and pale... I'm not afraid of some oil, guys, I ORDERED JUST FRIES, I think I can take it. And as I entered, the revolving door ruined my sandals because some crazy guy came barreling out of there like an asshole. Most expensive lackluster fries I've ever had."
"Phenomenal burger, shakes, and salad bar.  One of our favorite, casual places in the city for just ""good food"".  Extremely kid friendly and always great before or after the LP zoo.  That said, we drive down to the City regularly just to go to Grunts."
"This place was yummy :)  My favorite part was the ice cream sundaes!  The hamburgers were nice and juicy, but I have had better.  The decor is cool inside and we had a great booth seat at the window.  Make a reservation is my reccomendation if you are going on the weekend, as this place is small inside. Our waitress was very nice and the service was also great.  Valet parking was easy and we only $8, not bad.  I would come here again for a round two."
"Always well served. A pretty nice place to eat at whether its for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Overall, they have a wide variety of toppings for a salad. Amazing burgers. Never had a bad experience here. They have friendly waitress and waiters. They have a nice and clean enviroment. Nice place to eat with the kids and a group of friends."
"Average shakes, very mediocre food and definitely overpriced.. if the food was better or the prices cheaper I might have given this a better rating, but that is not the case"
"Delicious! Delightful! Delovely!We had a bit of a wait, so sat at the bar and enjoyed a $5 bloody mary, which was perfectly spicy.  I even asked the bartender what brand of mix they use (I've since forgotten. Sad face.)The seating is tight, my guest and I were jammed at a very small 2 top next to a support beam.  Between our waters and bloody's, we barely had space for anything else on the table... a little too far to be considered ""cozy.""We both ordered a wrap and the salad bar.  I am usually wary of salad bars, but my guest insisted.  It was very good.  The balsamic marinated mushrooms and fresh beets were the best part for me.  The soup also looked good, but I didn't want to fill up.By the time we returned from our trip to the salad bar, our wraps had arrived.  The waitress offered to ""take them back"" until we had finished salads, but this way, we could bounce back and forth.  The Buffalo chicken wrap was outstanding.  Perfect sauce to bleu cheese ratio, big chunks of meat, not overly breaded.  The cottage chips are TO DIE FOR.  The portion was huge.  I ended up taking half of my wrap home.Seems this place is very popular, and I can see why.  We went at 2:30 on a rainy Saturday, had a wait, and the place was packed."
"Very good for our family. Early reservations are a good idea-- when we left the wait was over an hour and a half.Burgers were good, $5 bloody Mary's and outstanding kid sundaes. Service was excellent and the proximity to Lincoln park zoo was perfect."
"Fries were dead, chips were soggy, bacon was well if I have to say something bad about the bacon (witch I am) I think we all can agree it was bad.  Burgers, and service were ok. Nothing to boost about."
"RJ Grunts is a great casual dining establishment close to the main entrance of the Lincoln Park Zoo. For those who are fans of the Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant Group, this restaurant where it all started. A fun and eclectic atmosphere that proves to be fun for all ages.I made my first trip to RJ Grunts during the Summer as I had heard good things about the restaurant. I felt lucky to find a seat inside (a small restaurant with a small but fully stocked bar). The service was great from the beginning, giving you a feeling that you had been there a thousand times before. Since it was during the Summer season, I was looking for a great sandwich and go for the awesome looking salad bar. A fried-green tomato BLT Sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries definitely caught my eye... And I'm glad it did. All tasted very fresh and was just what I wanted. I also saw a great line of burgers on the menu that I will likely tryout.Overall, I was impressed with the restaurant and will likely return."
"This place is too damn busy, and the hype is too damn high for what this place really is...an over-priced burger joint. Ya, the atmosphere is cool; however, it's totally cut-off. Is it a bar? Is it a family restaurant? Is it a tourist trap? I have no clue. I just don't like it here. The salad bar is amazing...so I've heard (I have not seen anyone order a salad here).  the burger was not CRAZY awesome like all the poster/bus ads may lead you to believe. The seats are cramped, the waitresses/hosts are dippy/ridiculously under-trained, and the menu is not THAT impressive. I really expected more from this place. I suppose its one of those places where all the little tidbits add up: Poor service, dumb staff, mediocre food, small spaces, no elbow room, slow service, no parking....ugh...it just gets to you. It IS close to the zoo, though....so if you're starving and need a beer before you go home to shut the kids up, then I imagine it's an ideal location. the only reason I am providing 2 stars is because the service was not horrendous, and the soup was pretty good."
This place has some of the best wings in the city hands down. Their French dip sandwich is made on garlic bread and is ahhhhmazing!!
First time back in over 20 years.  Food was tasty and service excellent.  Hard to beat on a weekday for lunch.  Go there to see a how a restaurant remains relevant over such a long life span.
"The salad bar here was great! Got a salad with balsamic vinaigrette, Israeli couscous salad, and caprese salad. YUM! I also ordered a side of the cottage fries. Awesome. Service was fast here and seating wasn't a problem. I just sat at the bar when I came in and didn't have to wait."
Cool burger spot and wonderful salad bar.
"I have been coming to RJ grunts for a little over 10 years. There is a reason for that.  So, the place has been here for some time.  Early 70s I think, and really, it does not look like it has changed much.  Really, it does not have to. Great atmosphere and fantastic service in a city known for both.  I must confess, whenever there I go directly for the salad bar.  It is, by far, the best I have ever had.  The variey and freshness of the items is great.  And the soup...... Liquid gold.   Last time I was there, I had the corn chowder.  I actually blacked out and woke up with three empty bowls in front of me.  If your really lucky they will be serving the potato soup.  My irish uncle made the best potato soup I have ever had.  This may be better.  Aside from that, the burgers are excellent, wings are strong, and the drinks are great.  For me, it is the atmosphere that sells it.  Walking around on a fall afternoon and stopping by a warm friendly place with good food is just so chicago.  I really love it and cannot recommend it enough."
"Waited 50 + minutes to get a burger and fries to go, when I was told it would take only 20. The fries were saggy because they left it sitting on counter for more than 30 minutes. So not only am I dissatisfied with the service I am now dissatisfied with the food.1 person behind the bar, 2 cooks in the kitchen in an over-packed restaurant.Never EVER coming back to this crappy place of a restaurant."
"Location is great if you are headed to the LP Zoo.  Food is ok, nothing special.  Typical burger and bar food with a bonus salad bar.  No plans to go back but would consider"
"I've heard about this place so many times and finally checked it out.  Here are the highlightsProsSurprisingly no wait (I hear it gets busy)Service was fairly good, she was pleasant and gave us a free dessert because it was our first timeDecor was pretty coolHoliday adult beverages were interestingConsOverpriced - by a mile ($15 salad bar? $17 brunch?)Really wanted breakfast, but couldn't spend the money out of principle (Stanley's down the street has a similar deal with a huge selection that I consider worth it)The ""brunch"" is basically the salad bar plus a few breakfast items and wasn't anything specialBooths are very small and tough to manage.  I know America is bigger now than in 1970, but I'm not and it was tightMy wrap was $12 and was pretty averageOverall RJ Grunts was alright, but over hyped and over priced.  After reading many posts, I was surprised more people didn't complain about their prices, but it is Lincoln Park."
"We just stopped in for drinks at the bar while waiting for friends to arrive at another restaurant, so maybe I didn't get the proper RJ Grunt's experience. The bar service was OK.  The bar is TINY (like six people can sit there) and the server was still kind of slow.  She didn't have much to do since all six of us weren't ordering drinks constantly, so I was a bit disappointed.  The beer is overpriced and the cocktails are even more expensive.  There was a list of non-traditional cocktail drinks, so that could be cool during dinner.  Definitely not a place to go if you're just looking for a quick drink in the neighborhood.  Just walk over to Lincoln and find one of a thousand bars."
"RJ Grunts is still really good! I was walking in Lincoln Park yesterday on a rare beautiful day in December and looked over and saw RJ Grunts.  Actually forgot about the spot until I saw it. Decided to have dinner because, I  remember oh so many moons ago of being there (at least 15 + years) that I enjoyed the atmosphere & food.Inside still the same trendy laid back 70ish style restaurant. Love the old photos everywhere that adorn the walls of folks you feel like you know.   Staff was friendly with smiles everywhere. I had a turkey burger with fries.  Delish Delish Delish!  A staple of Lincoln Park that still has it. #Love It"
"Kudos for being one of the few restaurants left with a nice, fresh salad bar with lots of choices, my vegetarian husband thanks you.  Unfortunately, I, the carnivore, write the reviews.  Spent $12 on an $8 burger; bun was dry and cold, pickles were the size of nickels, and shredded lettuce on a burger, uh, NO, this is not Taco Bell, thank you. Cottage fries were cold.  Photographs everywhere of pretty servers from RJ Grunts' past was kind of weird...I get the idea/history/recognition, but this little Musée de Waitress still seemed oddly exploitative.  Even more offensive to women was the current staff.  The hostess seemed to be wandering around the dining room with the blankest stare, as if she had just been hypnotized and was waiting for some Svengali to snap his fingers.  In this spirit of magic, our waitress was mostly disappeared (though the busboy seemed to be working hard and was very present). Weird atmosphere, weird service, overpriced. The first Lettuce Entertain You is certainly not their flagship.  Grunt."
"Came for the chicken wings only because I was craving some deep fried food.I got a takeaway for the BBQ and the Hot chicken wings. With all honesty, the description says ""onion rings"" served on the side. These aren't onion rings! They're like deep fried onion threads! The BBQ was OK but not as tender as I'd like - was SLIGHTLY dry for my taste. As for the hot chicken wings? I should've opted for the super hot, because I'm asian and I couldn't taste the spiciness anywhere. They even give you an whole uncut jalapeno on the side - what's up with that?? Even the jalapeno was spicier than the wings. I'm not coming back for the wings -- I'm not impressed."
"It should be no surprise that the original LEYE restaurant is still alive and kicking and serving great food. I had not been back to RJ Grunts in a few years and Erica had never been before. It's a staple of the lincoln park neighborhood and a wonderful example of a winning formula for success in the restaurant industry - serve simple but delicious food in a fun setting with good service at good value. That's what you want from Grunts and that's what you get.The place is small and charming, with a small wooden bar in the front and not a lot of tables/booths in the back. The large famous salad bar is front and center in dining area. Grunts' menu is simple American food with burgers, salad, wraps, wings, ribs and shakes. I was surprised/forgot how large the menu actually is given what is on it, but it's nice to have options for regulars or non-burger eaters. We were in hamburger mood so I went with the Yowza (peppercorn burger, spicy ketchup, pepper-jack, onions, lettuce, tomato, bacon) and Erica did her standard plain burger with lettuce and ketchup. Instead of a starter we both opted for the salad bar (only $6 with entree order) - one of the last few great salad bars I've been to in a while with plenty of options, soups, AND JELLO.My burger was good, though a little undercooked and unstable for my liking. But the flavors were really nice with the peppercorn and spicy ketchup providing a nice kick. They are large burgers and served with fries - definitely worth the $11 asking price. Even if the trend in dining is grass fed, organic, whatever (e.g. DMK deliciousness), sometimes a old fashion ground/sirloin burger with good toppings is just as appreciated.Lastly, what better way to end an all American meal than with a warm chocolate chip cookie smothered in ice cream and hot fudge?? (for only $3.5!) I know they have great shakes but this looked too good to pass up and it lived up to expectations.RJ Grunts remains a fun and tasty icon of Chicago restaurant lore. The food is simply good and consistent, which served as a foreshadow to the rest of the LEYE empire. Every once in a while (or more) it's nice to remember where it all started (and eat well too!)"
"Best restaurant in Lincoln Park! My husband and I used to live down the block and we ate here EVERY week! :) Our staple meal was the buffalo chicken nachos, buffalo chicken wraps & pitcher of Blue Moon. We hadn't been back in years, and upon recently traveling to Chicago, we decided to revisit our favorite restaurant! My husband and I are both vegetarians now.. so they made a ""veggie"" version of the buffalo chicken nachos/wraps - and it was delicious! I'd also like to give a shout out to our waiter, Sean, who surprised us with their decadent chocolate chip cookie/icecream dessert. Mmmmm! Thanks so much! We can't wait to return during our next trip to Chicago!"
"I came here for lunch on a rainy Monday. They had several things on the menu that sounded good, but I stuck with the cajun chicken sandwich with cottage fries.My food was good, but nothing spectacular. The chicken sandwich was pretty boring even with the cajun spices. Maybe a better bread would make the sandwich better. The cottage fries are just potato chips (real fries are $1 more). I wasn't a fan of the chips. They needed some herbs and spices. I only ate a few and didn't bother with the rest.It was too early to drink, but they have ""adult"" milkshakes with alcohol. Yummmm.I wouldn't come out my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area again I'd give it another try."
"While the food was good and the server was polite, the valet allowed someone to trade our brand new City Mini GT stroller for their dirty, old, sand filled, beat up model. As expensive as those strollers are, I am NOT happy!!!"
"I have been here twice now and both times were after looking at zoo lights in the freezing cold so needless to say I think this place is warm and cozy haha ! This coziness is also due to the fact that Grunt's is the most crowded restaurant I have ever been in, reminisent of commuting on the CTA durring peak rush, ick. I am not exaggerating at all, I saw a line form outside of the spinning door because once you get in the door and spin to the inside there is no where for you to get out of the way and stand, its actually kinda dangerous if you think about it but I guess that's the risk you take for one of Grunt's self proclaimed world famous burgers or a trip to their salad bar. We have always had reservations and I have a feeling it is impossible to get in if you do not so just do your self a favor and make one. Grunts seems to have been a Chicago staple for forever so apparently everyone thinks dealing with the crowd is worth it. The walls here are adorned with hundreds of photos of celebrities who have graced Grunts with their presence in the past and Grunt's itself describes its decor on its website as 'music and decor still firmly stuck in the 60's - 70's'. Grunts has a salad bar that is hands down one of the best you will see anywhere; they offer soups, fruit with an amazing cream cheese chocolate chip dip, loads of fresh veggies and plenty of pasta and potato salad options. Grunts also offers the a Temperature Soup Thermometer where you can add a soup of the day to your entree for the price of the temperature outside that day: example, it was 22 yesterday so your soup would be 22cents ! Can't beat that espeically since we are lucky enough to live in the frigid mid-west! On this trip to Grunts I decided to stand out from all the women I went with who ordered the salad bar and I joined the men in our group in opting for a burger and let me tell you it was well worth the wait and calories. I had the peppercorn burger and it was AMAZING. It was a peppercorn in crusted burger topped with blue cheese, friend onions, lettuce and tomato, and boy was it nice a sloppy, unfortunately though the bottom bun was soggy which is a huge burger no no but the taste was so fabulous I cant' really complain. The fries are thin and crispy and served with sharing in mind I assume since there are enough to feed a small country, though now that I am looking at the menu I seemed to have missed my scoop of creamy coleslaw, bummer, but lets be honest after eating the entire delicious burger I didn't really have room anyways! We valeted our car and I would recommend the same to anyone heading down this way since parking can be scarce in this area. Grunt's offers great food if your live in the area or are visiting the zoo for the day but it is out of the way if this is not the case and make sure to leave your personal bubble at home because you are going to be quite close to a lot of strangers while you dine."
"The salad bar at this restaurant is worth the drive and parking hassle.I love this place and visit it every chance I get.The walls are decorated with photos of waitresses throughout the years, and the view of the park outside is beautiful.Another iconic Chicago restaurant!"
"My VBM (very best mom) has been feeling blue lately so her second favorite child (me) decided to take her out to dinner in the hopes of cheering her up.I deliberately picked RJ Grunt's for the nostalgia factor. We used to come here when I was a little girl every time we went to LP Zoo.RJ Grunt's was the first LEYE restaurant concept and was in danger of closing years ago. Due to public outcry, petitions, and a lot of press, Rich Melman decided to keep it open. I'm pretty sure Melman wondered where all the sentimentality was when he was trying to keep the restaurant profitable and no one was eating there.It would appear that it was a good business plan to remain open. This place was hoppin' on a Monday night. Mom and I got there around 6:30 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. I was pleasantly surprised that it was not teeming with children. We got seats at the bar and ordered drinks. Woodpecker Cider for me, but Mom wanted to see a wine list. The bartender was very sweet and offered her several tastes of wine before choosing. She opted for a Pinot Gris, which at $10 a glass was pricey, but if you can't spoil your mom, who can you spoil?We were shown to our table and given menus. Mom was really enjoying looking around and remarked how nothing had changed at all at Grunt's. She said the last time she was here was when she was on a double date and didn't know the male half of the other couple was married, but he was on the date with another woman. Apparently his wife's parents walked in the restaurant and he spent the better part of the evening under the table. It was a funny story and the 70s soundtrack that played in the background only added to it.I ordered a French Dip Enigma and she had the portobello burger. Both came with cottage fries. My sandwich was ok; I should have gone with my first instinct and gotten a burger, but the cottage fries more than made up for the sandwich. Mom must have loved hers as she finished the entire thing and she never does that.We sat and reminisced for awhile longer and had a couple more drinks.I think I made her feel better, but I suspect Grunt's had a big hand in it.Great place for a date, to take your parents, or to go with friends. The menu is huge and reasonably priced and the kitsch factor is in full force."
Love this place. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. Get the California wrap! You won't regret it!
"Solid sandwich, salad bar place and we've been many times.  Nice beer selection, really good burgers, interesting 70s decor consisting of photos of past servers.  The ribs are good also.  The 70s music is a little too loud most times.  We went last night for NYE where all food items were half price - can't beat that!  Especially, when most places offer their hoity, toity set menus for twice the price that dinner out would normally cost.Hoping that people tipped last night based on what the full price ticket would have been vs. the half price cost.  The servers were really busting their tails - it was packed with people still waiting to be seated after 10:00 when we left."
Love the chicken fingers!!!
"I had the opportunity to dine with some friends at RJ Grunts.  I was pretty stoked to try it out as it is the original Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant.  The service was impeccable but I really didn't find anything special about the place in general.  The food was fine, the atmosphere fine...but it wasn't a place where I would hangout and socialize after a meal."
"Food:  Mediocre, at best.Fries in particular:  Terrible, at best.Salad bar:  looked decent but there was no bacon!  Server:  Interesting.Hosts:  Took a long time to be seated and we had reservations.Restaurant in general: Not worth me writing in paragraphs it was that blah.Hint:  don't sit at the bar or by the door in the winter...it's freezing."
One of my go to places in the neighborhood for good sandwiches at a decent price. I usually get the cajun chicken with cottage fries which are fresh made potato chips. They also have a decent craft draft beer selection which changes often. Many of the servers have been there for years and are quick and efficient. One problem is they pack too many people into the space.
"Great lunch spot if you're visiting the LP Zoo. Salad bar is fresh and fantastic and could easily be a meal all by itself. Good soup. Great burgers and chicken sandwiches. Service is friendly and prompt. Good selection of beer. This place is a warm and welcoming, family-oriented, neighborhood joint with good food. Highly recommend."
"My love for this place is not only because of the awesome food, great service and welcoming atmosphere... but RJ Grunts and I share a birthday.  Smile.  RJ has a few more years on me though... I think what I love most about this place is... their salad bar.  I could sit here and praise the freshness of the ingredients, the pasta salads, the different options.  But the REAL highlight of their salad bar is the SOUP.  I am a soup slut.  I'll do pretty much anything, pay any price or drive any distance for good soup.  Then, you throw in the ""all you can eat"" element... and I'm just... yours.  I will go there and just get the salad bar and polish off three or four cups of soup (and SOME salad) for a lunch.  They always have two soup choices and it's just... love.  Their sandwiches are good too.  I am not the biggest fan of the chips and no fries kinda thing they got going, but if I can eat four cups of soup, I don't give a crap about the lack of fries anyways.  MILKSHAKES.  Gotta get a milkshake.  My friend and I have lunched here and on our way out, we'll ask for a milkshake in two cups, to go.  Great for strolling around the area."
"I've never been to the actual RJ Grunts but Its one of my favorite places to order from when I'm at work (when I can afford the calories lol). I love the pepercorn burger with the spicy ketchup and chips (Those chips are insane!).When ever the office is ordering food, we always consider RJ's when in the burger mood.:)"
Great evening at RJ's - didn't even look at the menu - took my lead from the reviews and had temperature soup (delicious) and a burger - awesome with sweet potato fries.  The kids menu was really varied for most places and they had great things to keep the children and the adults entertained.  Waitress was excellent - very caring and concerned.  Will definitely go back.  One warning - siri thinks RJ's is on LIncoln not Lincoln Park W - got lost and had to call
I give it 5 stars for the patty melt. It was soo good! =)
Excellent burger.... Quesadilla was also perfectly done with all the necessary fixings up to par.  Well stocked salad bar was fresh with plenty of options.  Reservation through open table- glad I did it because lunch on Saturday was 45 min wait otherwise.  Recommended.
One of the best desserts I've ever had - get the Cookie Sequel!
"After a particularly unfortunate day, the hubs said screw it, let's go out to eat and try to enjoy a few minutes.  Not one to turn down eating out, I said sure.  My sweetheart gets gift cards to Lettuce joints from work all the time so we opted for RJ Grunts.I used to go to the other locations as a kid all the time which are now long gone.  I always liked going and fondly remember the miles-long salad bar.  It has been forever since I've been to RJ's, and never to this locale.It was pretty much as I remember it:  kitschy, strange and pretty decent food.  As we left, the hubs said he now knows where the idea for Applebee's and the like came from.We got seated right away, well, probably because it was Monday, though it was a booth next to the service entrance to the kitchen, next to the bar service well.  I didn't think we were that ugly or poorly dressed, but even though it wasn't the best seat in the house, it worked out fine as we were dour, not wanting to be around other people anyway.Food summary:  the french dip was tasty, the cottage fries were real good especially dipped in the Merkt's cheese sauce side order, hubs wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken wrap but he didn't hate it either.  My sloe gin fizz was a little heavy on the citrus.  And too ice heavy for such a small glass at $8.  Brownie with ice cream for dessert; brownie was too undercooked for my liking but the ice cream was good.  Big enough for 4 people to share, easy.Our server was nice and pleasant.  All in all, way better than cooking and cleaning up.  I'd go back.  Stupid long trek from Irving Park neighborhood and of course parking is hard.  More like 3.75 stars or so."
"Need a little comfort food in a comfortable type of place? Well look no further than RJ Grunts. Almost a Chicago institution- this original ""Lettuce Entertain You"" restaurant is still making it happen after all these years. And all the things you used to love about it are still there: salad bar, almost dive bar decor and the fabulous staff that keep it all together and make your visit special. I hadn't been to RJ Grunts in years but stopped in the other night to pick up take out. Why take out here you might ask when there are tons of places around that will deliver? Well it's because of their chicken pot pies. The ultimate comfort food. RJ Grunts Chicken pot pies are not the frozen things you might expect. Oh no- we're talking flaky pastry top and bottom with a thick chunky filling of peas, mushrooms, carrots, gravy and chicken. Nirvana. Here's a tip- if you order it to go- when you get home- crisp up the pastry pieces, line the bottom of a large bowl with one piece, pour over the filling and top with the other piece. I don't know if I've always been lucky but street parking is actually fairly easy around here.  Or if you are running in for takeout- you can leave your car in the valet area just north of the restuarant and run in.I don't know how I forgot about this place  It's a great place to go when you don't know what you want but you know you want a leisurely experience. It's filled with fun people (I even ran into two of my favorite Yelpers there on this visit- hey Erika and Michael!) good food, and good service. And on top of that? It's got some of the best comfort food around!"
"R.J.Grunts is the first Lettuce Entertain you restaurant.  My work friend loves the salad bar.  Our group of 6 ate dinner there on Wednesday night for her birthday.  3 people had the salad bar for dinner.  It includes soup, tuna noodle casserole, chips and salsa, etc.  They do a nice job of keeping the items fresh and stocked.  I ordered a wrap with southwestern seasoning (the name escapes me).  It was very good and very well seasoned.  I opted to have veggies instead of fries since my friends were having salad for dinner.  The fresh green beans and carrots were guilt free and delicious.  My friend had a burger and found a sticker in her fries.  It wasn't a big deal; she had already eaten the burger and wasn't upset.  She mentioned it to the waitress as a heads up, and the waitress comped her meal.  The waitress easily could have gotten away without comping the meal, but I was pleased that she did.As for ambiance, it is a bit cramped.  There isn't a ton of space and the restaurant was full.  The walls are decorated with pictures of famous people which make for something fun to look at.  For American food and cozy atmosphere, Grunt's works."
"Food was very good, We went on a Sunday so we had the option of ordering from the menu, opting for the Sunday Brunch Buffet and Salad Bar or both. Service was just OK. I blamed it on two things: one, the place was packed, full capacity, so I know each server had his or her hands full taking care of everyone. But then, two, the place is just crowded and with every table full, it's just hard to navigate.The way the tables were packed in there, the tight quarters, etc. detracted from the experience somewhat but the food was great."
"This place is the perfect combination of fun restaurant to enjoy dinner with a young charge, and seedy dive bar. Oh, it's not a bar-bar by any means, but there is a bar there, and you can order drinks. I'd say this is a GREAT place to take kids, without being overly cheesy and ""kid friendly"". It's just unpretentious, with solidly good food and service.The food is not exotic, but is delicious comfort-type food. The salad bar is great (but add salami to make it perfect!) and the cheddar-broccoli soup is surprisingly delicious. It's a good place to go when you're in a mood where you don't know what you want, but you know you just want something delicious and uncomplicated.I can sip a martini while chatting about whether we should share the Black Cow or the Orange Cow for dessert. After gorging myself on the many-ingredient salad bar. The BLTs looked great as well. Bliss.It was my first visit, so that Orange Cow (which tasted like baby aspirin!) was free. Our waiter was a really fun guy. The service here is great - really friendly."
"Like so many others have done during this time of year, we came here prior to going over to Zoo Lights.  Put our name in, quoted ~ an hour wait and trekked across the street to take in the lights and sounds of the season at LPZ.I'm giving this place a 4 spot even though I didn't really much care for my Tuna Trio, which was tuna salad sat atop three english muffins, each muffin was then topped with a different type of cheese. The english muffins were not very good so I just dug into the tuna.  The tuna was ok tasting but it was more a puree than chunk/flaked, which is the way I prefer.The main reasons for the high marks: the warm, inviting interior space, loved it. and the salad bar..equal love.  One of the guys in our group had the bbq bacon burger which was described as out of this world.  His missus had the buffalo chicken wrap, also lauded for its taste but also for its scoville index reached...read: SPICY!All said this is an authentic neighborhood spot that's been around nearly 40 years and its reputation sort of speaks for itself.  Glad I finally made it the RJ's after 15+ years living in Chicago.  [x] Will be back"
"Are you kidding me! I have been going here over the years since 1991,,,was looking at menu after the Xmas lights at the LP Zoo, and a CheeseBurger is $12.95??? Who are you kidding? Seriously, I had a bite of wifes, it was just a burger, nothing great...this place has succumbed to the mindless yuppie families in LP that dont look at prices, and just order, but that is highway robbery. $13 for a burger...give me a break, it better be the best one in Chicago...period."
"RJ Grunts was the perfect casual lunch spot for the family before a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo. Great burgers (best I've had in a long time) and wings.  My son raved about the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries and we all enjoyed the house made potato chips. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. No problem, the bartender let us try a couple of the local brews before we settled on a pint each and the kids could sit at the bar and have a soda.  Service was friendly and prompt. Would definitely return."
"Headed here with some of my favorite gals earlier this week.For once I decided to stay away from the salad bar because a trip up there always results in a zillion calories on my plate. Instead I opted for their veggie burger, while 2 of my girlfriends ordered turkey burgers.  And the 4th brave gal in the group couldn't pass up the salad bar.Their homemade veggie burger is delicious...and even more so after I added some guac to it (something special I asked the waitress for).  My friends gobbled up their turkey burgers as well.  I didn't get away without some salad bar love though cause my friend filled her plate high with their sinful chocolate chip cream cheese. We very sickeningly (is that a word?) ate spoonfuls of it until I gave it up for the ""happy bday"" cookie skillet our waitress brought out to the table.  Cookie skillet and chocolate chip cream cheese= not so healthy! Well, at least I got that veggie burger.All that yummy food for just $10/person. May just be the cheapest sit-down dinner I""ve had in Chicago..."
"My favorite restaurant in all of Chicago.  Nothing makes a Sunday better than a Temperature Soup, Old Hickory Chicken Sandwich and a walk across the street to the Lincoln Park Zoo. Other highlights:  side Mac & Cheese, California Wrap, Pulled Pork Sandwich, any burger, Salad Bar, Big Kid Milkshakes, Spiked Coffee."
"Went here with a buddy two weeks ago for a quick lunch and a beer and really enjoyed ourselves.  He ordered the Patty-Melt and I got the Better Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger following our waitress's advice and both were outstanding.  We also got the 312 Green Line beer which is extremely hard to find and a good start to a solid lunch.This is a great spot with a cool atmosphere and I highly suggest you try it for lunch if you have the time, but be prepared to spend about $10/meal and an extra $6 for the rare Green Line."
"Oddly enough the topic of discussion after getting seated was diabetes, and how my uncle just got diagnosed with it. Such a surreal moment. How did it affect us? ""CAN WE GET SOME ONION RINGS OVER HERE??""Not a good toilets to people ratio as far as the restroom is concerned, but the food is pretty good. We had onions rings for an appetizer, and they were pretty wonderful. A softer but flavorful batter, but still maintained a nice crispiness. I probably could have ate the whole order by myself, but I decided to be polite and not kill 'em. Fortunately for my family, I wasn't the one paying.I ordered the ""Green Chili Burger"" which featured a fried poblano pepper, topped with cheddar cheese and other normal burger fixings. It was quite good. I especially enjoyed the homestyle potato chips. The rest of my family ordered BLT's, and French onion soup. While I didn't have any of their food, I have to say everything they had looked wonderful. If we weren't pressed for time, I would have loved to try their milkshakes, which I guess are pretty renown there. I saw some kid at another table having one. I thought about punching him in the mouth and taking it from him. But it was a little too early in the day to get arrested over a milkshake. Pretty damn good eats here. Though parking is a pain, would definitely love to come back."
"To experience a cash-free society, someone would have two choices.  They could: a) travel deep into a remote jungle or up a remote mountain where the barter system is still in place or b) stay much closer to home and just go to the nearest Lettuce Entertain You restaurant.I mean, seriously, has anyone ever used cash at one of these establishments?  I'm starting to believe they pay their waitstaff in gift cards.Like so many before me, I had two of the little $25 green beauties burning a hole in my wallet.  Looking for a classy(er than fast food) restaurant, I dug them out.  When Mary T. told me she had never been to this LEYE restaurant by her place and upon finding out that it was the first location in the mighty (nearly) cashless empire, I had to try it.Walking in, it's easy to tell that it was the template for many restaurants that followed it.  But not LEYE restaurants.  More like Chili's, Applebee's, and, especially, T.G.I. Friday's.  It was as if before opening a kitschy restaurant full of old timey signs and flair, every chain restauranteur paid this place a visit and prayed at its shrine.But when considering another first - the first salad bar in Chicagoland - all cheesiness can be dismissed.  This is the real deal and huge.  As a carbitarian, my actual intake of the green stuff (though it must be said that they use high quality lettuce, not the cheap iceburg variety found at so many other places) was minimal.  But they offer enough side salads (including a crave-worthy potato salad), soups, and deserts to consider this a meal unto itself.  And at around $10 (er, a 10 dollar deduction from a gift card) for unlimited portions, it's almost a steal.In fact, I go so far as to wonder if they should even bother with the rest of the menu.  Well, they can keep the drink menu (which, while small, has a cider which is a bonus), I guess.  But while my veggie burger was excellent and there seemed to be a lot of entrees I want to try, everything else seems superfulous and a waste of money (er little plastic gift card) in comparison with the salad bar.Now I have to say the bringing of new plates for the salad bar is slow, but that's just a small concern.  They eventually do show up.Would I go back?  Without a doubt.  I might even *gasp* use real money there!  The salad bar is just that good."
"The salad bar was nice and I enjoyed my gum ball head beer. The burger I got was just ok! It wasn't worth the $12 I paid. The toppings weren't fresh looking and the bun was hard. I had there brunch on a previous visit and it was nice. My son loved the wings, he had buffalo. The kids meals were a little over priced at $7 bucks since my kids tend to waste"
"At this place I had the single most horrible service ever.  I understand busy on a Friday.  I see that it's been around for years.  This was my first and also my last time going.  The food was actually good and the salad bar looked amazing.  It was really crowded and hard to finally get to our table because the seats were so close together and I actually felt bad having to squeeze my way through rubbing against people that were eating.Our waitress, an older woman was horrible.  She was curt to all of us taking our order.  Food came quickly and we ate pretty quick also and I thought it was good.    We did ask for to go containers and the woman placed them on the table.  I will admit that there was quite a bit of talking going on because there were friends I had not seen in a while and we only get together twice a year.Our ""friendly"" waitress came up and with her bare hands, she took my other half of my patty melt and put in in the container and then dumped my fries in on top and closed the container.  I looked at her with my mouth open not believing that anyone could be like that.  Even when the person who goes to this place often tried to engage her in conversation, she was nasty with him.Needless to say this was my first impression and my last.  I will never go to this place again nor will I suggest it to anyone that will be on that area."
"I finally tried RJ's and enjoyed the food but don't feel it's worth the hassle of parking and the potentially long wait. Grilled cheese and homemade chips- Really tasty, but some of the chips were undercooked and the tomato was mealy. Salad Bar- Looked great, but I didn't want to spend $12. Most of the menu has really fair prices.Meh. Could have been worse but could have been better. Get more vegetarian sandwich options! Veggie burgers don't count anymore!"
"Only a 3.0 on food.  The salad bar was pretty good, but my Buffalo Chicken Sandwich could have came from Applebee's.  I realize that it's supposed to be covered in wing sauce.  But putting it on a normal hamburger bun is a bad idea.  It has disintergrated by the time it reach our table.  Homemade chips are a good idea too, but mine were way over-fried or looked like they were at the bottom of the pile.  I give that it's crowded and popular, but the host accidentally marked the wife, baby and myself down as an eight-top, thus making our 20 minute wait, almost an hour.  However, in a pleasing turn of events, the manager took our info with the promise to send gift certificates, and our service was spot-on and friendly.  5 stars for the staff and service. If I go back, I think I need to do a little more investigation of the menu.  Maybe try a burger."
"I have been coming to Grunts for almost 40 years, when the Salad Bar was originally around 5 dollars... Though I still love the restaurant, and all that it is has continued to be, I was totally taken back when I got my bill yesterday. Two salad bars for $15 dollars each!!! My friend had one cup of soup and a few greens. I had a couple cups of soup and one plate of salad. What was once reasonably priced is now quite expensive. I will still go there, but the original aura of Grunts along with the waitresses of the past are now gone..."
"If you're looking for classic American food (i.e. burgers, grilled cheese, club sandwiches) done well, RJ Grunts is a good place to go.  It's very no frills, but the execution is spot on and the ingredients are of good quality.  I have eaten here twice (once in the restaurant and another for takeout) and enjoyed the experience both times.The salad bar is especially delicious.  It's a little bit on the pricey side.  (I wish they would just up their entree prices a little and include it at no additional cost.)  However, it does offer a great range of stuff including a fantastic cream cheese frosting that's laced with chocolate chips and sinful for spreading on fruit.I think the one downside is that this place can be a bit of a zoo on nights and weekends.  Normally I don't mind a wait, but it becomes a problem if you are going to pick up takeout.  It is handled so you have to pick it up at the bar rather than at a hostess stand.  This meant I had to wade through a crowd of people and then deal with the fact that there was only one bartender trying to deal with a crowd of people.  This meant that I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my food.  This wouldn't have been such a big deal, except that it was sitting out and clearly getting cold.  I don't mind waiting a little bit but it seems like they could stand to have a better takeout system.All in all though the food is very good quality and perfect for when you're craving classic American fare."
"I've eaten here a couple times with my family, and both times were great experiences.The good:The food is great and there are a lot of unique options to choose from.  There is even a salad bar that has some tasty choices.  The food is nothing like any other restaurant you might find.The waiting staff is very nice, they do a great job and are there when you need them.The bad:It can be really hard to find a parking spot near the restaurant.  However, there is valet parking available.There is not a lot of space in this place.  All of the tables are close together, with very little room to walk in between them.  It amazes me how the waiting staff can carry food to tables and trip over somebody/something and drop the food everywhere.The good things far overshadow the bad, which is why I recommend this restaurant to all my friends."
"Behold RJ's wall of fame.  Decades of waitresses are immortalized in photos that somehow all look like they're from the 70s, just like the rest of the decor in the restaurant.  It's a time machine life-sized diorama of disco days and wood paneled everything.  R.J. Grunts has out-of-this-world burgers and a decent draft list, along with surprisingly friendly service.  Three times, with separate circles of friends, I've been here for bachelor parties and the waitstaff is always accommodating.  It's a must-try Chicago landmark and a good spot to take visitors."
"Food:  4Service:  3Atmosphere:  3Value:  5I tend to shy away from LEY restaurants because they're a bit too ""commercialized"" for me.  The only problem is that, every time I go, no matter where I go, I like the food.  Kudos to the Mellmans for putting out such a great product across various food genres and price points.  As for RJ Grunts, I hadn't been there in at least two years but when our friends suggested it for an easy, Tuesday night dinner, it sounded like a good spot.  Now I see why ""The Original"" is still grunting along at a solid pace.A big draw is obviously the salad bar, so my wife and I tried to concoct the perfect scheme whereby she got the salad bar, we split a few things, and saved some money (no we did not attempt to split the salad bar; there are some frugality levels even I won't stoop to).  I'm a sucker for a good plate of nachos so when I found out we could substitute veggie chili for treif chili that choice was easy.  Throw in a grilled cheese and homemade chips and that, my friends, is a meal (it's really two meals, and enough to make you easily sick, but I do it for my fans; you're welcome)The food all came lightning-quick  (as opposed to Deleece-see my review) and looked even better than their menu described.  The nachos were plentiful, and the ""stuff"": chips ratio was spot-on.  Crispy chips, melty cheese, smooth guac, mildy spicy salsa, rich chili--all in one bite!  As for the grilled cheese, it was equally impressive.  2 slices of cheddar, 2 slices of swiss on texas-toast style bread.  The outside was golden brown and the inside was creamy and delicious. Oh, and the homemade chips are worth mentioning, as I dare say they were better than the ones at Bangers and Lace (see my review).  They may be a side dish but they could have easily been the star.  They were crispy and salty, with just a hint of potato-licious chew.  You know that 10 lb bag of potatoes you see at the grocery all the time but never buy because you don't think you'll eat them all?  I think that's what they use for one serving.Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone.  It's low key, has a huge menu, and priced-right.  If quantity and quality were to meet at an intersection, you can bet RJ Grunts would be on the corner.  Thankfully, Lincoln Park West and Dickens actually do meet at an intersection, and RJ Grunts IS on the corner!  Not much commercialization needed here-its cozy charm and great location will draw you in, and the consistently tasty food will have you coming back.  [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]"
"R.J. Grunts has been one of my favorite restaurants for more years than I care to remember. Their food is always wonderful. The service and ambiance never change, always great. I love their salad bar, especially the chocolate chip cream cheese. Last week I took my cousin to see the Lincoln Park Zoo lights. It was a terrible, wet, snowy night. We wanted to go across the street to Grunts to eat afterwards, but I know that during the zoo lights, Grunts is more of a zoo than the zoo! There are wall to wall people waiting to get in, and with good reason. I called the manager and explained that my cousin had been quite ill, finished with her chemotherapy but very thin. She could not wait a long time for dinner. The manager was so nice! She took my name and we got right in. She came over to make sure everything was fine. She really went above and beyond! I hope that R.J. Grunts stays in business forever! They will always be at the top of my list."
"Had a great time here this weekend, I loved our no nonsense, witty server. Got the buffalo chicken wrap, which was good, if not a little soggy, but the taste and flavor was there.  What I really enjoyed was the salad bar, full of options for any palette. Our server was nice enough to leave extra plates at the table for return trips to the salad bar.  My dinner mate got the burger which he said was great, a nice testament to what they are known for.Overall it was a nice, relaxing atmosphere, maybe a little pricey, but a nice experience and was exactly what I needed."
"2.5 stars. Went before hitting ZooLights and it was insanely crowded. Waited it out in the bar with the 4yo and some Goose XMAS ale. Then we were seated at this crazy table in the middle of the restaurant that was inches away from 3 other tables. It was like communal eating only worse.I got hot wings which were OK. Wife had burger that was also OK. Child had kids chicken fingers that were a basked of fries and 2 little chix fingers for like $6.All-in-all, I wouldn't ever come back here voluntarily."
"It was a good experience, but didn't knock my socks off.  Food was good, but not awesome.  Service was decent, but not awesome.  Might be back if I'm in the area, but not a place that I'll go out of my way to go to again."
"RJ Grunts: the establishment that launched a thousand restaurants!  Okay -- maybe the Lettuce Entertain You empire isn't a thousand strong, but living in Chicago, it sure seems that way sometimes!  RJ Melman started this restaurant in the 70s, and its clear that that's where he wants it to stay.  From the ""all 70s all the time"" music choices to the aesthetic of the menu to the framed pictures on the walls of flared, oversized collars and bell bottoms, this place dishes disco-era in spades.  They claim to have invented the salad bar (which I'm not 100% sure about, but I'll take it at face value), and they do it well.  Soups are great for cold winter days.  BBQ brisket is a delicious heart clogger.  The wings are so so.  They feel awfully heavy on the flour (similar to Hooters wings), and sort of get soggy/flakey on you.  Good if you're into that type of wing (and I know plenty of wing-nuts who are).  Its just not my complete favorite.  Friendly staff, and a pretty sweet location.  After you're done with that meal, walk it off in amazing Lincoln Park!"
"BEST salad bar!!!!!Good, spicy sangria. Nice staff. Cool ambiance."
Such a fun restaurant! Service is amazing and chicken fingers are yummy!
It is what it is!Big greasy portions! Well-worn retro vibe! That damn salad bar!RJ Grunts is generally crowded and the wait can be an hour or more on a busy night - so it's best to reserve through Open Table and whisk past the throngs in the doorway when you arrive.Good Tasty Stuff! Laid Back! Been around so long for a reason!Enjoy!
"RJ Grunts you have never let me or most likely anyone down. It seems like every time I have had been at RJ's I  have heard Santana's ""Black Magic Women."" Which is cool because that is back when Santana didn't make songs with overrated musicians.The salad bar is by far the best one I have ever experienced. One time at Ruby Tuesdays I saw a women sneeze right into the garbanzo beans. GROSS!I tried both the cream of spinach and the mushroom barley and they were really tasty.I also had their buffalo wings which I prob would skip and just continue with their amazing chicken tenders. Also, their burgers are awesome.5 Stars for the salad bar and the great service with a smile!"
I'll give a four stars because the food was good. I wouldn't say it's the best burger joint in the city. I think the sweet potato fries are mediocre.
"We went to RJ Grunt's for Sunday morning brunch reservation at 11 AM with a party of six, four adults, two toddlers (that's two two-year-olds!) and it was awesome!!  When we arrived, they already had a table set up with two chairs and a high chair in between on each side.  Although the space was a little tight, it wasn't as bad as I had expected when I read all the reviews.  The food was pretty tasty! I enjoyed the salad bar, the enchilada soup, and the breakfast offerings.  The waitress forgot to bring me my sweet potato fries...but I never even checked to see if she charged me for them.  I had a $100 LEY gift card so wasn't paying much attention to the details.  :)  I was too stuffed to think about anything else.  Their fried potatoes from the breakfast bar was really yummy and so were the waffles.  They had three different kinds of eggs, one pan of just egg whites for the health conscious.  The bacon was very fatty but delicious.  The sausages weren't to my liking....it had a strange herb ingredient that I wasn't quite used to for a breakfast sausage.  The salad and the ranch dressing was great!!  The only thing that could make it better would be to add jalapenos to the salad bar.  The banana peppers were a decent substitute but not as much of a kick to it as I would have liked!The great thing about this place, despite the bit of circling we had to do for the parking, is that right across the street there's this great playground where we let our toddlers run off some of their steam.  It was a great brunch date with friends.  The staff was friendly, they gave crayons and coloring sheets, and we had a lot of fun!"
"I've only been to RJ Grunts a couple of times, but both times it was delish!  The burgers are great, and wow is all I can say about the salad bar!"
"Went to RJ Grunts tonight. I live a bock away and have been going there for years for some of the best burgers in town. They have half off burgers after 10pm, which is great. I called to order a burger today after 10pm for take out and asked about the discount, after specifying clearly that my order was take out. They said yes, that the discount applies. However, when arrived, they refused to give me the discount, even after I explained the call I just had when I ordered. I was then told the discount is for ""dine in"" only. I didn't know that, but that's fine. Honestly I don't care how much the burgers cost. I go there because the food is excellent. But why tell me it is half off on the phone and then present me with a bill for a full price burger upon arrival? Who cares about the extra $6.00 I spent on a great meal. It's the principle that matters, and I am a dedicated customer who recommends this place to everyone. If you make a mistake, own up."
LOVE this place! My go to is the hickory bacon burger and it is always SO GOOD! They also have such a good salad bar that I should probably know more about but I always just stick to the burgers!
"RJ Grunt's has been a favorite of our family for years. Not only is the food great but the service is too. Dorrie is our favorite server but all of them are efficient and personable. We've been coming here for over 15 years since before our kids were born and Dorrie has literally watched our kids grow up.  Even though we moved to the south side and don't make it here as often as we used to, we still manage to get here several times a year.My most recent experience with Grunt's is what prompted my review. Our family came here the weekend before Valentine's Day.  My husband forgot his wallet at home and my credit card was declined (turns out there were fraudulent charges made and I had to get a new card).  I felt terrible because we weren't able to pay the bill but the entire staff was so nice. They kept telling us not to worry about it.  Fast forward to today - I received my new credit card and came in to settle up on the bill. Once again everyone was so nice and professional. I've always loved this place and love it even more now. Thank you RJ Grunt's!!PS - this place does get very crowded weekends and evenings so be prepared to wait for a table. And check out the ""temperature soup"" - a cup of their daily soups is only the price of the outside temperature (with purchase of entree).  Soup for 99 cents or 32 cents or less cannot be beat."
"Not only is there food and service amazing, but their staff goes above and beyond. There is also something magical in their mustard.  Specifically, one of their managers, Ron, stepped in to help with a unique request to help a friend of mine (and I live in CA, so getting to the restaurant is not an easy task for me) get some RJ Grunts awesome-ness and his willingness to help was fantastic! I can't wait until my next visit!"
"The boyfriend and I were given a couple hundred dollars worth of Lettuce Entertain You Gift cards and didn't feel like going anywhere fancy, so we decided to try this place seeing as it was a couple blocks from our apartment.We went on a Sunday night (bad idea) and the place was jam-packed with entitled suburban yuppy types. A woman in a fur coat wanted to get through and because we were packed like sardines in the (tiny) waiting area started yelling at me to move. I told her that I was trying to- and she gave me a sarcastic 'oh, really?' Ugh. I wish I'd had a glass of red wine in hand to pour on her ratty dead-animal coat.The hostess told us it'd be an hour wait, which was fine, since the football game was on television at the bar. We waited maybe twenty-five minutes and were seated in a (small) booth near the back.Our waitress was nice enough (and pretty cute) but the service was slow (they were busy, so I understand). Boyfriend ordered nachos as an appetizer for himself (I can't eat dairy) and a barbecue bacon cheddar burger. I got a veggie burger (no cheese) with the salad bar.The nachos, according to the boyfriend, were good, and he enjoyed his burger (he's pretty picky about his burgers, so this is a good sign). My veggie burger had good flavor, but was crumbly and dry. I also wasn't fond of the potato chips that came with it- they were cold and somewhat soggy. The (2-tablespoon) side of coleslaw was more like a sample, but flavorless, anyway.The salad bar was nice enough, but being used to Whole Foods salad bar, definitely left something to be desired. A lot of the stuff on it was very basic and there were no crunchy things (like croutons, sunflower seeds, nuts, et cetera) so I felt like I was missing a key element in my salad. The French dressing also tasted watered down. I would not pay $11 for this salad bar- I felt lousy paying $6 for the salad bar as my 'side'.My drinks were refilled pretty promptly and the server was nice enough, but it wasn't the greatest dining experience. The tab came to around $50 with drinks, which isn't so bad, I suppose. I wouldn't return, it just wasn't exceptional enough to brave the obnoxious clientele, cramped space, and wait time."
Ate at R.J Grunts for the first time while visiting Chicago this past weekend. Great experience. Our server (I believe her name was Amanda) was so welcoming and friendly. Recommended some great choices and even offered us a free cookie sundae (amazing!) at the end of our meal. Our burgers were delicious.. I had one of the specials that included Gorgonzola and pear.. probably the best burger I've ever had. I hope to one day come back :)
"Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the food. We got the BLT and the California wrap. If you plan to stop here, then just stick to the basics. They are supposedly known for burgers, so if I ever get back here, then that is what I'll order. What salvaged this review were 2 things.1. Grapefruit juice - Fresh squeezed. And thus delicious. 2. Free desert - Our waitress asked if we had ever been to the restaurant and we said no. At the end of our meal, a guy named ""Ron"" stopped by our table with a large cookie sundae with homemade chocolate fudge. It was delicious and you gotta give it up for a place that does cool stuff like that. My only question...Does RJ stand for Ron { }? If so, then that's pretty awesome."
Another great lunch at one of our favorites!! Rickey H.  the GM is awesome as well.  Staff great and food delcious.  Hubby had the French Onion Soup and burger.I  had the temperature soup so since it was 17 degrees out the lentil soup was $.17.  Onion rings super.
"When did this place turn into Chuck E Cheese? Too bad - used to be really good. Today - if you are more than 45"" tall, don't bother."
"Was disappointed with RJs after reading such good reviews.. but I'll give it a break as so many people can't be wrong, maybe I ordered the wrong food!When we walked in we were barely noticed by the hostess' and not greeted in friendly manner. we noticed the youngish one (probably 19 or 20) did not smile once at anyone she obviously hates her job and would have preferred to be elsewhere. Our server was great, friendly and informative. Was excited for the main course after starting with delicious chicken wings. I ordered a wrap which was very bland, I taught the dressing would have been in the wrap but nothing so it was a let down... fries were ok kinda soggy.. wish i got a burger like my gf who enjoyed her juicy looking burger!The shakes are lovely too."
"Walked down to RJ Grunts planning to get take-out, when I arrived the hostess directed me to the bartender. After waiting for 15-20 minutes or so to get the bartenders attention (the bar was busy but not packed), I inquired about the fish tacos that are their menu online but not in the store. Nastily she informed me they are on longer on the menu, I then looked over the menu thinking I would order something different. After a few more snotty remarks from the bartender when I asked about other items, she then disappeared. I then decided just to leave without any take-out, and having waited a good amount time just trying to place my order. RJ Grunts should not advertise doing take-out, if they don't want to do it. I am not sure if the staff is supposed to be rude, but it was a very disappointing experience. I will not be returning."
"It seems like people are reviewing their memories from days past. Well, as someone who wasn't around in the 1970s, I can only review this place on its merits today. We picked this place because it has been a while since we spent a day at the zoo, and I had a LEYE gift card from Christmas still. A ""Yowza"" burger with sweet potato French fries sets you back $12.50, $5 Blue Moons and Coronas? I think $17+ before tax and tip is asking a bit much for a burger and a beer. The decor is okay, too. The music is a bit much to take... we were treated to the 5 minute version of the Laverne & Shirley. Not my cup of tea."
"went here..on a date...lol..not much of a date atmosphere though...great food and service..address was a bit hard to find..confused it with lincoln ave which is not that far away...6 drinks, 2 burgers and one salad trip bar bill was $100 so an idea of the prices.."
"My fiance and I have wanted to try RJ Grunts for a while. We passed by it every day on the bus going to work. We decided that we wanted to finally make our way over there, but before going we had a look at their website. In three different areas on the website there were links to make a reservation. Rather than doing this (as it was a Sunday afternoon) we decided to call. The gentleman that answered seemed amused by our asking if we needed a reservation and invited us to come as there was no wait. Upon arriving about 10 minutes later, we were greeted by a sea of people and a one hour wait time. I explained to the hostess that we had just called, not trying to move ahead in line but to find out why we were blatantly lied to - her response: a shrug of her shoulders and a smug grin.This review has nothing to do with the food, wait staff, cleanliness etc, I'm a firm believer in first impressions and this is just bad business."
Best burger I've ever had!  My boyfriend and I went here for lunch.  We both got burgers that basically melted in your mouth.  I got the Grubburger and he got the Peppercorn burger and we were both beyond happy with our meals.  I like my burgers medium rare and this place actually delivered.  My boyfriend also got a chocolate shake and loved it.  When we got there the wait was supposed to be 20 minutes but we were seated in less than 10. The service was quick and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!!
"MMMMMMM is the best ""word"" to describe our meal!!!  Thank you RJ's for a delicious introduction to your famous restaurant.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed each part of our meal from the chips and salsa and guacamole to the fresh, well-stocked salad bar, to the special desert at the end (BTW, the ice cream is to die for!!).  We felt right at home with our folksy waitress (sorry, we didn't get your name).  It's been a long time since we've felt so welcomed at a restaurant in downtown.  She took time to chat with us about the menu and about us.  Thank you!  We look forward to coming to Sunday brunch in a few weeks."
"I was so excited to meet a girlfriend for lunch here as RJ Grunts is known for their salad bar, and we're attempting clean eating (on a weekend, natch!). It was a busy Sat. and we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. Meanwhile, my expectations are elevating and the growls of my stomach are growing louder. We're sat at the smallest table I've ever seen in the back. Maneuvering to the salad bar proves difficult even for my rail-thin friend. The salad bar isn't quite what I expected-- yes, it's fresh but all the fixins' are very basic. Only one type of cheese, for example. And only one low-fat dressing. And reaching the stuff in the back? Practically an obstacle course if your arms aren't 6 feet long. Extra points for the chocolate-chip cream cheese spread though I really wasn't sure of its purpose-- maybe to top the fruit? I also ordered grilled chicken (which was not only a meager portion but overdone) for my salad which set me back an extra $2 in addition to the already pricey salad bar cost of $10.95. Way too much for way too basic. As I was eating my plain Jane salad I enviously scoured other better-looking choices as the server squeezed past our table. Hmm... I'm thinking that if I'm ever to return I'll give the regular menu a try."
Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. The sweet potato fries are excellent as well! Fantastic service. Delicious looking salad bar. A definite go if you're craving an amazing burger!
"My friend and I were hungry on a Monday night. We just finished work and decided to eat at a place where I have never been before. Considering we have visited many LEYE restaurants... why not try the very first?So we parked on Stockton and walked less than a block west.I'm use to the nice looking restaurants. Since this is the first... it looks very vintage and it's not bad at all. Table cloths with glazed wooden chairs and benches; it's a very homey environment. Portraits all over the walls of the Grunt Chicks?Greeted by a pleasant hostess and server. Menus with comic strips and humor.I unfortunately ate two whoppers before I came.... what a drag.. So i ordered their chili and hot buffalo wings. Chili is pretty good, but I'm use to more beef chunks as oppose to equal distribution of meat in each spoon. The chili tasted pretty good. The wings were pretty standard; just fried wings with dipping sauce. Chocolate milk shake was very good.My friend ordered a burger.. and I thought of stealing it because he said the burger was real good and I was salivating how good the burger looked. I also salivated how good the salad bar looked.  It looks small, but there are a lot of pretty good options. Typical salad bars will have unripe cantaloupe, honeydew, and watermelon; this is the total opposite. Everything looked fresh and good. But I only ""Seen."" I want to go back to get a salad, get a burger, and drink soup when it's below 0 degrees!!"
"Never had a bad burger here.  Service is always good, never great, thus only a 4.  Oh, and the chips, never get the chips.  They are always soggy.  The burgers are always on point, never disappoints."
"Pretty darn good bar food.  Probably the best chicken tenders and ranch dressing I've had anywhere in recent memory... definitely fresh and not frozen.  The seating is a little awkward and tight when the place is busy, and on my first visit here last week, the service was so-so, but overall, it's a spot I'll be trying again."
"Great classic American burgers.  I had the Yowza burger.  Cooked just the way I wanted.  Burgers run for about $10.  Definitely tastes and feels like a $10 restaurant burger should.  They also have a few beers on tap, which is a plus.  We had the onion ring appetizer which actually came on a ring, and more importantly were very good.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I liked the atmosphere of a college-aged, yet family friendly, burger and bar joint.  It felt cozy to be here on a cold winter evening."
"Aimlessly strolling, S and I spotted this cute little joint and decided to give it a try. Walking in was a little cramped but cozy. I really liked the decor that gives it a ""homey"" vibe as well as the music. Our waitress was extremely polite and helpful guiding us through the menu. She told us her favorite dishes and recommended we try their burgers since they are, ""delicious"". S ordered the ""Patty Melt"" with cottage fries and a Ginger-Ale. I ordered ""The Works Burger"" with cottage fries and a cherry Coke! [Mmm!  A burger and coke is my comfort food.] I'm not going to lie; my burger was really really good! Juicy, cheesy and BIG! The cottage fries-Which are thinly sliced potato slices fried, are NOM-TASTIC! S said her patty was ""scrumptious"" and she also loved the cottage fries. Brownie points to our waitress for being so kind, brownie points for a homey place to eat lunch and brownie points to those cottage fries I liked so much! RJ Grunts is a fun homey place for lunch guys! =]"
"I really enjoy going to RJ Grunts after a stroll through the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory.The have a great soup/salad bar that is a must for any newcomer.I happened to go on their 40th anniversary and this place was a madhouse.Seating took a bit but it is usually quite quick.Burgers were $1.5 (any burger).The chocolate malts are yummy and should be shared.The homemade potato chips are super. Not too greasy, not too dry.A Carafe of water is on every table.Servers check on you frequently even when they are super busy.I am a fan and will definitely be back.Bike parking on street."
"I was there recently with a group friends and children. One of the kids is a new born and the other 2 yrs. So the fact that they put the 2yr old on the end of the table with her back to the next table not so good. She was reaching for things from the other table and the people didn't seem to mind, actually the guy was interacting with her more than the woman he was with so I felt bad for her. We would have moved the high chair but with the space given no adult was fitting there.The food was wonderful as always. Love the Salad bar! The Hard cider was so good I could have drank it all night, but I had to drive. Our server was very friendly and understandable with the needs of Children. However I do not remember her name.:("
"The small size of the restaurant makes this feel like an intimate dining experience, yet they can cater to groups of 6-12 really well.  My favorite part is that you can get real burgers, not the nasty pre-packed patty kind, but real, hand-packed fresh beef kind.  in the mood for a milkshake or other decadent beverage, try the oreo or peanut butter milkshake.  We'll definitely do a repeat visit here for post-flag football brunch."
"It breaks my heart seeing that RJ Grunts doesn't have a 5 star rating! I love this place. You are guaranteed a good time if you go, I sincerely mean that.The vibe is great, very '70s. They pretty much play great classic rock/pop songs which is such a unique thing to do. I love the menu and discovering the little drawings they have on the front. My parents got a kick out of the fact that I found Calvin and Hobbes when they've been going here for years and did not.I don't know what they put in that buffet but it is so damn good words fail me.Patty melt is always a safe bet in other places (at least in my mind...how can you go wrong with beef, onions, and cheese?) but here it is cooked to perfection.Amazing drink selection! I always thought it was cool that you could mix alcohol into your shake.The service is really unbeatable here. The servers are so friendly, they make you feel like you've been friends for years and you're just hanging out and having a good time.If you've never been, please go. A true Chicago staple."
"Not sure I get all the hype about the salad bar--based on what I'd read I imagined a huge selection like you might find at a Texas de Brazil or Chart House or similar--in reality its a somewhat pedestrian selection of greens and veggies perhaps 10 feet in length. Nevertheless, as a burger joint this place does a pretty nice job. Had the turkey burger and sweet potato fries and both were above average. Also, our waitress was fantastic and even comped our dessert--a yummy cookie-cake creation with vanilla ice cream. The location right across from the Park & Zoo is another big perk. There aren't a ton of sit-down choices nearby, so if you're hungry after a long day out this one would be a solid choice."
"A neighborhood gem.  It is noisy and crowded. Don't go if you have a crowd phobia, but the ""comfort food"" served equals the best.  One of the 1st Lettuce Entertain You restaurants.  When the company wanted to change the concept, the customers rose up to protest and the company backed down.  It obviously listens to the wishes of its customers."
The food was tasty and the prices were reasonable.
"As long as you call ahead for a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, you shouldn't have a problem getting in. They have the best salad bar, and the brunch on the weekends is awesome. Their burgers are huge and amazing, and they have a pretty decent selection of beers at the bar. Love the vintage decor and 70's music always on! Their staff is laid back and super nice, they've never messed up my order and our family has been coming back for years. Try one of their shakes!"
"This place is always packed! The food was good, but not worth the wait for us."
"I like this place.  It's walking distance from home, the food's good, and even though the wait times are a bit long on weekends, it's pretty good stuff.  There are plenty of choices on the menu (burgers to veggie burgers to salad bar).  And even though there's some time spent waiting, there's a full bar to pass the time away (on sunday mornings they do make a great bloody mary, so go ahead, drink up the night before).There is one downside, this place is cramped.  When I go here, there seem to be more tables than should be allowed, and I always seem to have my elbows out in the way of people walking past (best if you can get a booth here, just an FYI)."
"My wife and i hit RJ Grunts for lunch while visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo.  Yeah, it's cramped and crowded, like other reviewers complain, but it's a fun place with atmosphere that isn't a sterile chain.  we were on a quick overnight from St. Louis, and looked up places to enjoy for our meals.  RJ Grunts stood out as a must do.  It was a good experience.Got the salad with a burger & fries - they do a nice little deal by charging only about 1/2 price for the salad if you get a different item with it.  Salad bar is good.  Not great, but good.  Similar to Ruby Tuesday's salad bar.Burger special was the Star burger.  Man it was good!  I thought it was worth the hype.  Thick beefsteak tomato that has been marinated for 24 hours, and apparently warmed for serving.  Burger itself seems to be extra finely ground, for a higher quality texture.  Bacon on top was thick, seemed center cut, and just salty enough.  Got chips with my burger.  They were fresh from the fryer, and kind of al dente.  Crispy on the outside, but hot and still chewy in the middle.Dessert was free for us a first time visitors.  Did I just give away one of their secrets?  Oh, well.  It was the cookie & ice cream dessert.  And yes, it is something that you have to get, no matter how full you are.Good time, good food, good place."
"Typical American fare. I don't really understand why people rave about the salad bar here. Maybe I'm coming at the wrong time? I've eaten at far nicer, far bigger salad bars than the one here. Did I not say the secret word? Should I have tapped on walls for a revolving doorway to salad bar nirvana?I had a burger here that was cooked just to my liking and tasted pretty darn good. I didn't like being seated between a large wood column and the kitchen/staff corridor, but the place is bumpin' and beggars can't be choosers.Back to the salad bar for a minute, please? Yes, well, it looked really messy as well. I know it's hard to keep a salad bar clean but it just didn't look appetizing at all.Will I come back? Yes. Will I seek out a salad bar? No. There's just a ton of other choices on the menu that look great and probably taste awesome too."
"This place used to be one of my favorite burger places, but I feel as if the burgers have gotten smaller throughout the years.  Chicken is chicken, so I will always stick with the Peppercorn burger.  Whenever I go the salad bar is a must, but for carry out the burger gets a little dry.  I have been there about 8 times and feel like everytime is a little more disappointing.  There are better burgers elsewhere in the city."
"I have been going to this hamburger and salad bar place for the better part of two decades. It's a ""feel-good"" restaurant if you long for the 1970s and all of its corny music and fashion.The Gruntburger is my favorite, although people have stuffed themselves at the very large salad bar, which is an adventure on it own."
Cozy atmosphere with slow staff that are neither great nor horrifically terrible. Bloodys are very boring but the mix is good if you aren't into spicy. French dip is fantastic with thinly sliced roast beef on terrific garlic bread and the au jus is tasteful but not over powering. The cottage fries are worth getting.
"Live right by RJ Grunts and I go there WAY too much! Everything we get is delicious. HIGHLY recommend- Buffalo Chicken Nachos, BBQ Burger, Chicken Tenders, AND...the Ice cream Cookie. I'm not a dessert person but I am now!"
"My God, can they pack this place any tighter?! Good food but purses, elbos and diaper bags to my head through our whole meal! Food is quick and tasty but just too many tables on top of each other."
Get the Peppercorn BurgerGo with regular fries not cottage fries
"I love the cheesy '70s music.  I love the cheesecake shots on the wall.  And I love the Gruntburger --  no cheese, please.  This tasty hunk of chargrilled ground beef is the next best thing to an outdoor barbecue.  A nicely toasted bun (very important) and those yummy cottage fries round out the plate and make it one of my favorite burgers in the city.  I'm not a huge fan of the salad bar, but it is worth noting that R.J. Grunts claims that they originated the concept.  The milkshakes are to die for and the servers are beyond friendly and efficient.Yes, there might be children. It's across the street from the Zoo, for Pete's sake.  Go late at night if you can't take the drooling, whiny critters.  But remember, you were once a drooling, whiny critter too."
"We were at the zoo and wandered over for lunch.  We arrived just a few minutes after they opened and were immediately seated.  We are one of those infamous ""People with baby and stroller (insert scary organ music)"" people.  We parked our stroller up by the bar and had a high chair.  The service was perfect, we ordered our food and I was at the salad bar with no lines of people.  It always feels good to be one of the first people to dig into a fresh salad bar.  I love this salad bar.  No, it is not 10 miles long with exotic foods from across the seas, but it is fresh and delicious.  The tuna salad and lemon potato salad are my favorites.  Then you have all your fresh veggies and toppings.  Lots of fresh fruit, the infamous chocolate chip cream cheese, jello, etc.  My son is 1 year old and it was fun to give him tastings of the various items.  Big hits-feta cheese and the balsamic mushrooms!  And the soup.  The Cream of Mushroom soup was the best soup I have ever had.  I basically filled up on bowls of the soup and had no room for my sandwich.  But that's cool because I just ate the left overs a minute ago!Our food was quick which is good when you are eating with a baby.  They have small windows of happy time in high chairs so that was a big plus. Patty Melt.  Warning-the medium rare at RJ Grunts is extremely rare.  Like, they shot one of the cows from the zoo, chopped it up and broiled it for 30 seconds before putting it on the table.  I love me some medium rare but I did have to send it back to be cooked a bit more.  I would say medium is a good bet.My husband had some kind of burger.  I don't remember what because I was happy with my soup and salad bar.No fries but the chip things were much better than I remember them being.  They also heat up nicely in the toaster oven.  We were just finishing up when the place really picked up for the lunch crowd.  The space is small so I suggest avoiding the big rush times.  A little early or a little late and the place is comfortable.  To the parents-they are kid friendly with chairs, booster seats and crayons etc, but the bathrooms are small and have no changing tables."
"I came here with gift certificates so beware of bias. I also paid the same amount for 1/2 the amount of food the day before at Joe's, so I'm feeling good about RJ Grunts.The veggie burger was nice and crispy on the outside, the cottage fries were yum, and the fries were yum AND the cheese sauce is awesome!My husband's burger was a bit under done, and he wished it wasn't half the the size of the bun - but dug the meaty burger selection.I want to try a shake, the mac n cheese, the salad bar, the portabella burger - so I'll be back."
"4/30/2012 Edit:  Okay bumping this up to a 4, because of a good beer selection (3 Floyds Gumballhead on tap, etc.) and creative, tasty burgers that actually hit the spot unlike 90% of the joints in the city.I'm more critical of burgers than anything else, probably because it's so easy to be such.  A good burger has to be well thought out, because getting too cute with one is like putting streamers on a Harley.This place has good burgers with great flavors that still feel like sin after you ate them.  Still not in the same league as the Kuma's and the Flub-a-dub-chub's of the world, but it gets the job done which I cannot say about any other joint in Lincoln Park.For the sake of comparison, it doesn't get as cute or creative as DMK, and therefore it is a little better.  And can somebody tell me how Duke's is even in business?-----Original Review: I'd say my overall experience there has been about a 3.49 thus far.  I've only been there 3 times, so my rating is subject to change.  And if it does, it'll jump up to a 4.I've had 2 weekday dinners there and 1 weekend brunch. One weekday dinner was a party of 2, and the wait was less than 15 minutes.  The other dinner was solo at the bar and the service was immediate.  There was no wait for our breakfast party of 3.Pros:  1) They have my favorite grilled cheese sandwich to date -- their grilled cheese deluxe.  It has both a thick, gooey slice of cheddar and a thick, gooey slice of swiss cheese, and is accented with tomato and bacon as well.  It's cooked with just the right amount of butter -- enough so that you can taste it and give it a perfect toasty crunch that comes commensurate with a good GCS, but not so much that you feel guilty eating it.2) While it's nothing fancy, the salad bar is solid.  There are multiple choices as base greens, a wide variety of fresh fruit, and some tasty stand alone items (the brussel sprouts are great as is their chocolate chip cream cheese).3) Dinner prices are reasonable.  For instance, due to the fact that the salad bar drops from 11 bucks and some change to 6 and some change if you order it with a sandwich, you can actually get the grilled cheese deluxe with the salad bar for virtually the same price as the salad bar alone.  Which I would recommend doing!!Cons:1)  The brunch buffet is overpriced.  All of the breakfast items that are added to the salad bar are mediocre.2) The brussel sprouts were warm and excellent one time I went there but cold and unappetizing another time.  This wasn't cool, because I was really craving them (probably the first time I'd ever craved brussel sprouts) only to be dissapointed.Anyway, I'll definitely be back a few more times for various reasons (grilled cheese cravings, burger experimentation, etc.).  Probably not for breakfast/brunch though."
"This is the first lettuce entertain you restaurant. It didn't remind me of a typical LEY restaurant but it sure was crowded! I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and there was over a half hour wait. Seriously!? My party and I went to the bar to grab a beer while we waiting. RJ's has very little waiting room so people sat their asses down at the bar and they were not drinking anything. WTF? How is this acceptable? A party was called to be seated and we stole their seat at the bar. This place is kind of a vintage time warp. There is a big TV over the bar, but the TV is from 1982. I haven't seen an ""old school"" TV in a bar in a long time. There is also a wall of ladies from the 70s and 80s. We asked our waitress and she said those are waitresses that used to work at RJ Grunts. That was kind of a neat touch.RJ Grunts is known for their amazing salad bar. Since it is very small and crowded in this restaurant, I obtained form the salad bar. I wish I would have got up and at least taken a look at it.  I settled on the pulled pork and it was pretty tasty! RJ Grunts serves ""cottage fries"" with their sandwiches and they are very good! The other 2 people in my party had hamburgers and they really liked them. The service is very friendly here and the food is pretty decent. I will probably make it back one day to try that salad bar. It looks simply amazing! If you do come here, expect a wait and the place will be filled with kids and strollers... just saying."
One of our favorites!  Has an awesome salad bar.  Really enjoy the Green Chille Burger and the Chicken sandwich that is similar to an Italian Beef.  Big portions so be mindful when getting salad bar AND a full sandwich!
"As the millionth review for this Chicago institution, I'll simply comment on the takeout!Typically with takeout you get a diluted version of the food.  Likely crammed into a container, soggy, and cold.  But not at RJ Grunts!  They do a fantastic takeout and while you don't have access to the salad bar (sadness!) you can order anything else on the menu.  It's always more fun to dine in, but I would suggest takeout from RJ's when you aren't in the mood for a loud environment!"
"It's just okay.Had a veggie patty, wasn't as heinous as some reviews have made it out to be, but it certainly wasn't craveable. I won't be getting off the 22 bus early to grab dinner, let's just say that."
"Table for 8 nestled in the back corner. A little cramped but cozy. The restaurant probably couldn't seat much more than 10 grouped together as it's rather small inside. I enjoy the decor, particularly picking out the fantastic 90's senior portraits and I'm a big fan of the banana (hammock?) painting. Service was decent, our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overworked. Took a bit to be seated despite having reservations. No biggie though. As for the food....not as delicious as I had anticipated, sadly. I had the hickory chicken sandwich and their homemade chips. I quite liked the chips but some were a bit chewy and some were too greasy. My sandwich was loaded with toppings (fried onions, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, bacon and cheese) and was messy but yummy. Was it as amazing as I had hoped? No but it was good. I heard their fries were terrible, but they are known for their homemade cottage fries (chips) so maybe that's to be expected. I'm very torn between a 3 and a 4 star rating....so consider this a 3.5. Will I willingly make another trip there? No, probably not but if I'm at the zoo and need a place to pop in I may do so for a shake, which sounded good. Oh, and if anyone has any skills and wishes to paint me a giant banana hammock picture, hook me up!"
"Don't try the cookie dessert! I should've known better because it wasn't served in a skillet, which usually guarantees that it's freshly baked. However, this cookie was SO hard and definitely seemed like they warmed it up in the microwave. Some other not so good things: I told our server I'd like the salad bar with my burger, so I wait and wait and wait and she doesn't bring my plate/bowl so I can go get my salad and soup! Finally, I think she remembers and just brings it over and doesn't say sorry she forgot or anything. So I decide to just cancel it altogether. Good thing, cause our food came out 5 minutes later. I just like to enjoy my salad with enough time before my food comes out, that's all. And I know I know I used to be a server too, and things get busy and you forget, but apologies are nice. The burger was pretty good, nice and juicy. The special cottage fries aren't anything great, just really crispy potatoes. All in all I don't think I'll be comin back."
"I love these kinds of places with milkshakes and salad bars.  We had a chocolate on chocolate shake to split.  That salad bar is said to have originated right here too.  Our waiter was extremely enthusiastic and went over and beyond in his job.One great thing about this place is the soup.  The price correlates with the weather.  I asked him what about last week when it was -6 degrees.  He said they wouldn't pay me to eat, unless I complain enough. Haha. I guess I wasn't original though because it is clearly printed on the menu.  The burges was great, they have shoe string fries which were great.  And the overall atmosphere is nice and cozy, down to earth, normal place.I would give a minus 1 star to the host who broke up our group into two adjacent tables.  She didn't even try to sit us together.  I mean 7 people isn't that large of a group. I won't do that though because RJ Grunts is the first Lettuce Entertain you, a landmark almost, and she is replaceable and probably won't be there for too long.Check it out. And I love the music playing too!"
Way over cooked burger. Big salad bar but over priced.
"Best salad bar in the city.  Great service.  For people who complain about waiting, they take reservations on Open Table.  I have always been seated within 10 minutes.  Their burgers are delicious.  This was by far the best deal I got during Restaurant Week.  I wish I went here more when I lived a block away."
"Solid Lettuce Entertain You location. The food is not spectacular, but everything is good. The service is really great! Cool for a group or a quick lunch. Good salad bar, only if you are really hungry, $15 for all you can eat. For me, $15 for a salad bar is just way too much."
"I just received a message from the manager. I really appreciate positive responses from owners /managers, it really shows to me that they are willing to put effort into making their establishment better or at least to acknowledge their patrons. RJ Grunts has an upstanding Manager that took my criticism with class and even offered his services if needed in the future. Thank you sir! Extra Star!!"
"rj grunts is most well known for their burgers. first minus for vegans.but okay, they've got a veggie chili and a veggie burger. neither vegan. second minus for vegans.according to our server, ""yeah... we're not the best restaurant for vegans."" at least she was honest... or so i thought.rj grunts has an awesome, huge salad bar. so that's what this vegan had.  my selections included spinach, cucumber, tofu chunks (yum!), craisins, black olives... a chickpea salad and a couscous salad with balsamic vinegar.what i liked about my dinner at rj grunts is that i got to put exactly what i wanted on my plate and didn't have to annoy my server with substitutions. wins for all. the ingredients were fresh & tasty ... and i was full after just one big salad. great stuff! so at first glance, rj grunts isn't the ideal restaurant for vegans ... but a quick trip to the salad bar proves otherwise. i can't wait to head back."
"R.J. Grunt's might be considered the Lettuce Entertain You parent restaurant since it's been around for about 40 years. Hadn't been there in a while, and it's the 1970s/80s throwback deli with nice salad bar. It was crowded and we were told we'd have to wait about 20 minutes, but we were seated much more quickly. My tuna salad sandwich on white bread was delicious and huge, so I finished it the next day. Also, I was able to replace fries with a heaping helping of pretty good slaw."
"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years- often after trips to Lincoln Park Zoo, as it's conveniently located across the street. This is the first Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, and it is one of the very best.It's a bit of a tight squeeze with all the tables, but very cozy, with a nice bar, huge salad bar full of fresh veggies, and walls covered with pictures of past waitresses. They have a great menu- lots of good options. The past couple times I've been there I've had their California wrap which is excellent. If you can, save room to split a milkshake. You really can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu, and the service is great. This is the perfect lunch spot."
"What more can really be written about such an iconic restaurant?  Not much, but...Simple confirmation that you can go with kids, without dealing with the many members on here that bitch about kids (they probably know to avoid it);You can get a really good burger; You have the option to explore their historic salad bar (which, has more of a reputation rather than being anything exceptional).Basically, go for a good burger."
Found this place on Yelp. My daughter and I were visiting from LA and went to the Lincoln Park Zoo.  Great food and service.
"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the entire city. I first started going here at a kid when my family lived in Lincoln Park and hadn't been back for several years, but now that I live in the area again, I go on a regular basis.I've tried many of the entrees, but the club sandwich is easily one of the best -- I really like clubs and get them frequently at restaurants and their club is usually made with real turkey meat (i.e. not processed) which is rarity in town. The pulled pork sandwich is fabulous, and the burgers are great too. You really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu.The salad bar is awesome -- great selection of veggies, fruit, and the usual stuff you find on a salad bar, as well as a couple of soup choices to go along with the salad. Also, the chocolate chip cream cheese is incredible, and goes really well with the fruit. And if you order an entree with the salad bar, the salad bar is something like half price, a great idea if you're really hungry.And for dessert, if somehow you've gotten to this point and still have room, the Oreo milkshakes are incredible, and if you go in the fall, they often will have a pumpkin pie milkshake that I've never had anywhere else in town, and it's delicious!"
Great cozy atmosphere. The servers were really nice and the food was awesome. The burgers were on point and the salad bar was a nice addition to my dinner. The server comp'd some drinks because it took too long. We all agreed that we felt welcomed and had a great time.
"The service here is ridiculously rude. The host was a complete jerk, and even though the place was empty, they tried to stuff 5 chairs at the end of our large party's table (instead of adding another table to it).  When we asked to add another 2-person table to the end of ours, they had to clear it by the owner, who simply removed all the chairs, didn't add a table, and walked away!  Hahaha.  Did I mention the place was empty?!  Oh, and the brunch was way overpriced.  Don't waste your time or money here unless you feel like being offended by rude staff and throwing money away."
"Eh.  As a vegetarian, don't bother.  I've already detailed the extremely over-hyped salad bar & now I'm onto the vegetarian burger.Boasted as homemade, it most definitely was.  Problem is, it tasted like someone mushed together a bunch of refried beans into a patty, slapped it on a frying pan, & dubbed it ""veggie burger.""  Gross.The ""fries"" (really just soggy potato chips) were, well, really just soggy potato chips.I so very badly wanted this to be good, but it so very badly wasn't."
"We went here for a celebration.  Thankfully, we made reservations otherwise there would definitely not be enough room for our party.  It is a good celebration or a low-key event for a fun get-together, just note a few things...(1) it is Lincoln Park, so valet or leave extra time for parking, (2) the location is small, and (3) it is dimly lit with kitchy ambiance (very retro).The waitress was very friendly.  She made sure we regularly had coffee and enough plates for the brunch to continue flowing!  They had bloody mary options, but I longed for mimosas (not their fault as I knew this heading into our gathering, maybe just a suggestion for future options).  The salad bar and brunch buffet was yummy, but smaller than it seemed in the photos and placed in an akward spot.  More room to get through the restaurant to get to the buffet and more room to accomodate a line would be helpful.As for the food, the praline bread pudding french toast is to die for and requires multiple helpings!  The egg options were great.  The potatoes were nice and crispy.  I am not a vege gal and therefore not the best judge of this fare, but there were a variety of options available.  I almost missed the chocolate chip cream cheese as it was next to the salad and the items could be better labelled, but thankfully one of our guests pointed it out and I devoured it! I knew mini-bagels were on the menu from the website, but as they were not out we had to ask the waitress.  Once she knew we wanted them, she did a great job of bringing extra baskets for the gang :)Everyone in the party had the buffet and were delightfully stuffed upon leaving.  No opinions on other food options as that would be for the next trip....The waitress was very attentive and brought a dessert cup of ice cream with fudge, whipped cream, and a candle.  It was TOO much after brunch, but it made me smile and I shared.  It was also a FREEBIE which is a nice treat these days ;)"
"If I wanted to be cramped, I'd take the Brown Line north from Merchandise Mart at 5:15pm.If I wanted to see lots of kids and families running around, I'd go to LP zoo.  While there, I would get Dippin' Dots because those things are just awesome.If I wanted bar food, I'd go to a umm ... what are those bar like things that serve bar food called again?  If I want all 3, I go to RJ Grunts, but not that often ..."
"Okay...I'm a little obsessed.  How often is too often to come here in a given month?  This place is absolutely perfect for those lazy nights of not wanting to cook, but still wanting to do that silly healthy eating thing.  Of the thousands of times I've now been here, I have only once not ordered the salad bar.  How could I pass it up?  Edamame?  Chick peas?  Zucchini?  Fresh soups?  Cream cheese infused with chocolate chips???  (okay, that's not healthy, I know)...awesome.  The fiance typically gets a delicious looking sandwich with amazing chips...I always secretly hope he orders them so I can sneak one or two or five.  On the days when we're really splurging (look, I had a salad, all right??), the cookie ice cream desserts are heaven.  A half order is perfect for two...or one if you don't feel like sharing.  Totally acceptable."
"Buffalo chicken nachos are great as well as the pulled pork Sammi.  Fun experience and always great service.  Lettuce always seems to get it right.  Salad bar obvious, service, food and price are great for area.  Try it out.  I have about 10 times in 10 years"
"R.J. Grunts was the first salad bar concept in Chicago and even today it can't be beat. Located right in Lincoln Park this is a great place to visit after walking around the Lincoln Park Zoo or even if your just in the area.Each time you walk through the doors you are greeted by the friendly waitstaff. If you go for lunch you can normally get a table right away but sometimes it gets rather busy for dinner so keep that in mind when planning your night. I love their salad bar and soup combo. If you are a fan of French Onion soup with a thick layer of bubbling cheese on top this is the place to go! Even when it is hot out, I will always love the soup/salad combination. I love being able to choose my own veggies to go on salads and all the fruit is always fresh and delicious (and of course healthy!)They also have great burgers and fries. Every time I have gone there the food has always amazed me and the atmosphere is always lively. I remember going there as a little kid with my parents and always having such a good time at R.J. Grunts. It is a very family friendly place to go."
"I don't know how I didn't review RJ Grunts before, but I love this place, big fan of salad bars, and the food to order is great too.  Just high quality bar food, nothing fancy, but everyhting is made with care.  The buffalo chicken nachos are normally the app we get to go with the salad bar and it's a favorite everytime.  The chocolate chip cream cheese is like crack on a salad bar.  So many good choices on the salad bar with top notch produce just make for the perfect meal.  The only downside here is that sometimes it's a long wait, to be expected at such a great place."
"Great food, terrible music.  Am I the youngest person in the restaurant?I've ordered delivery from RJ Grunts on several occasions, and their food is very good.  However, after deciding to check out the place in person, I have my reservations about ever going back.  I will definitely still continue to order delivery from them though because their food itself is at least 4 stars!Likes:  Food is great overall, and their creations are definitely unique.  The menu is diverse and comically written.  I very much like their chips, which are made in house, especially when they are well-salted.  I'm also a fan of their tuna melt, which offers 3 small tuna sandwiches on English muffins, each with a different type of cheese melted over the top.Dislikes:  By far the biggest issue that they have is their music.  They play really bad 70s rock/pop NONSTOP, every waking second that they are open.  I asked the bartender if they always do that, and she replied, ""Welcome to my world...""  I kept waiting for waiting for a song not recorded 35 years ago to play, but it was in vain.  It's not disco at least, but it wasn't good 70s music either.  Usually I don't care much what music is being played, but this was just so bad.  On top of that, as I looked around the establishment, I realized that I was perhaps one of only a handful of people under the age of 35 (out of probably 70 people).  As for the food, after reading about their shakes on Yelp, I was expecting a bit more, though they are not bad.  The onion rings were generic, which is really the only item that I've not enjoyed there.If you love great food, this is a terrific place.  Beware though that if you dine in, you'd better be over 35 if you wanna keep your sanity."
"DELICIOUS burgers!  That's not the only reason for 4 stars though.  1 - Love the atmosphere.  Casual/cozy sort of place in the middle of Lincoln Park; it was crowded but not annoyingly so.  We waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday night at 7pm.2 - Friendly staff.  Bartender said he could make a French martini and then (even though he said he was out of cognac which I think was his way of saying chambord...) had to make a cosmo; and didn't charge us for a drink because he felt bad.  Host/wait staff prompt and not overbearing.3 - Menu is great.  I had a cheezeburger with bbq sauce, fried onions, etc, and some soup to start.  Salad bar is fantastic for those of us who don't feel the need to consume a ginormous 1500-calorie meal in a matter of moments (that wasn't me), and also includes something called chocolate chip frosting which was unexpected!4 - I don't know, the music was really fun.  I think they played that one song that I like a lot and I seem to recall dancing a bit as I devoured my burger.Great place!"
"A must visit for all. Great food, enviroment and staff. The salad/fruit bar is the best in town and parking can be found pretty easy. One for your bucker list."
"Two words: NACHO NIRVANA.That alone will keep  me coming back here.  A gigantic pile of nachos with cheese, pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, lettuce, and probably some other stuff.   I don't even want to think about how absolutely unhealthy that thing is, but it's so delicious that it doesn't matter.The rest of the food is pretty good, too.  I love the chicken fingers -- they've got a real homemade quality that you don't really see in most restaurants.  And the cottage fries are great.  The burgers I've had have been really good, too.  And portion sizes are huge -- even without devouring the nacho appetizer, I'm pretty sure I'd have leftovers anyway.I've never gotten the salad bar or brunch buffet, but both look pretty fabulous.  And someday I'll save room for dessert...Prices are average, service has always been pretty good for me.  The place is a little crowded/cramped, but not enough for me to care about it."
"I love this place! You can't go wrong with a salad bar and hot wings to boot! The music gets on my nerves, but we tolerate it. Also nearby Starbucks, Park, Zoo and Fro-Yo make for a fun filled afternoon!Only downside small, cramped bathrooms. Small place overall."
"Before you go, make a reservation! This place is excellent, the food, the service, the whole 9 yards, but you DO NOT want to go and wait by the bar for a table. It gets crowded and space is limited if there is a long wait. Once you're seated though, it's all gravy! The California Wrap, Buffalo Fingers, the salad bar, and the cheese and broccoli soup are amazing! Don't ask for french fries...they don't have any! The chips are good and they get better each time I go. If you can't find parking quickly, I think valet is worth it! YUM YUM!!"
"I live down the street from this restaurant and it is a great place to grab dinner or a quick drink. The food is always good, the staff is super awesome and the prices are really reasonable. The menu is stuffed with tons of options and the hardest part is figuring out what to order."
"Come here for the all-you-can-eat salad bar, which is fresh, varied and delicious. Stay for the onion rings, served stacked on a stick like a ring-toss game -- my dining companion and I agreed that they were the best onion rings we've had in years. Finish it off with one of their delicious ice cream sundaes, we got one with a chocolate chip cookie that was still warm. On top of it, the place is inexpensive, the service was great, and their hand-drawn menu is charming. Just try it."
"RJ Grunts' is near and dear to me for a few reasons (visiting since I was little, parents old stomping grounds, first ""lettuce"" restaurant, etc), but I won't say I am biased. After all, it is the food that keeps me coming back.And yes, jerks that may know me, I am a seasoned professional cook. I cook for a living and for recreation. I STILL think a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant of a very casual persuasion is GREAT. 'Cuz it IS!BUT, WHY is it GREAT?*The onion rings are huge, properly battered, perfectly cooked, served with a simple homemade dipping sauce.*The salad bar is fantastic. It's worth getting all by itself. It's well kept, well-chilled, which is huge for me, and has a nice selection. An actual chef and kitchen staff reside there, and it shows. The dressings are HOUSE made.*The soups are delicious, and again, house made.*The menu items are not wildly adventurous, but they are classic, and hearty. Do something simply, and do it right, I say, and people will pay attention. *The milk shake was absolutely magnificent. I want one right now.*The decor is fun, nostalgic, slightly kitschy, and cool. *The 70's and 80's music is a perfect addition to this place. You never realize how much the music in a restaurant CAN effect your experience until you go to a place like this. (Or a place that is totally the opposite.)Go to this place with friends, sit by the window, and get onion rings and salad for SURE. Get a milkshake, too. Stay long enough to let your food settle in completely, and get a 2nd trip to the salad bar.Yay, RJ Grunts'. You are lovely."
"Recently came back here for my sister, mom's and my annual RJ Grunts and zoo lights trip. We did the salad and soup bar and had some seasonal beer on tap. When we first got there we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table, we didn't know what to try from tap so the bartender gave us a sample of something he thought we would like. He was right, shortly after waiting we were sat and our server was super friendly and knowledgeable. Never have a bad experience here, besides always hitting my head on the salad bar sneeze guard! But that is probably just my own ditziness."
"Love this place. I have been going to this joint since i was a kid and have some of my fondest restaurant-going memories there. All their food is pretty darn good and the atmosphere is super relaxed accompanied by some really good music. They are popular for their burgers and salad bar. Their burgers are super hearty and they don't slack on the homemade potato chips on the side (fries are extra) but you can get a good burger in a bunch of places in the city. The salad bar on the other hand does not parallel with many others. They have tons of fresh ingredients and antipastos as well as 2 soups and this one dangerously delicious sweet cream chocolate ship dip. For desert, you have to give their cookie/ brownie a shot. It is one of the most decadent yet satisfying deserts i have had. Their bar is great and carries Three Floydds which should be enough said. As for the service... 5 stars (out of one). That's right. I know its a serious statement but I have not had a single rotten experience there in the 18 years I have been eating here. In case i didn't drive this point home: Go to RJ Grunts for dinner tonight.. you know.. if you can beat the rush."
"Still full from my meal last night... after reading reviews, I must say that I was expecting the salad bar to be even Bigger than it was, but then I think about all the toppings I put onto my plate of lettuce, and realize that it was in fact, large. I was putting things in my salad that don't even fit together, I got a little excited... edamame, garbanzo, sprouts, pineapple, wasabi peas, mushrooms, cous cous, black bean and corn salsa, croutons, sunflower seeds, just a lot of everything. Salad bar also comes with soup.  Unfortunately I went back for seconds for both... and then my burger came.Got the green chiliburger... called green because of the tomatillo sauce, and it's a wonderful burger!  The ""fries"" are like thick potato chips, good. Loved the experience, the pictures on the wall, and not to mention I think they stole my iPod because we listen to the same playlists... embarrassing??? Definitely going back, the Nachos are calling my name.Oh yeah, don't count on finding parking. Valet is 8 bucks."
Went here for dinner last night. A Chicago classic! They have a special burger of the day which you simply must try. I had a burger with caramelized pear and sweet potatoe fries! Friendly fast service with a casual atmosphere i was totally in a food coma afterwards. Thursday is half priced wine night!
"Lettuce Entertain You just never disappoints.I ordered the burger and it is on a par with the better steakhouse burgers...and actually better than the burger at Gibson's.  The only minor flaw is that the buns are not up to the task of containing what seems to be around a half pound patty -- the bottom of the bun was simply not up to the task of holding the burger securely, even when cutting it in half.  For a burger that good, invest in some premium, hearty buns!  Also, the cottage fries were soggy.  But minor complaints.  One of the best burgers I've had in a very long time!"
"Yummy!  First off they have such delicious burgers!!!  My favorite is the Grunt Burger with Blue Cheese.  If you're really hungry you can add the salad bar on to your entree for an extra five or six dollars.  The salad bar is SO good!  They have fresh fruits and veggies.  It even has one of my favorites, which some of you will be grossed out by, chopped liver.  This place has an eclectic feel to it.  Parking is difficult and there might be a line, but it is worth the wait."
"I recently moved extremely near to RJ Grunts so I've done a couple of carry out orders. My girlfriend and I tried the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and California wrap most recently. The wrap was decent but nothing outstanding, but the pulled pork was amazing! Served on a toasted challah roll and cooked extremely tender. Order with the cottage fries and you've made the right choice. The first time we ordered I went with the buffalo chicken wrap (which was excellent) and veggies. The veggies were not great - cooked carrots and peas. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken fingers but was disappointed to find they were not already drenched in the buffalo sauce. The result was a dry, not so flavorful meal. Service for pick-ups is quick and only takes about 15 minutes for them to complete the order. I give it a 4 because if you order the right thing the food is excellent and not too pricey."
Salad bar was delicious and the wrap I had was good too. The atmosphere was fun and it was a great place to eat!
"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I love the music, food and beer selection. Oh and let us not forget the salad bar!!! Great place to go after a day at the zoo. Use valet parking and expect a wait. The restaurant is small and popular."
"Good food, cool place, great location."
"Whoo-hoo!  Today's service and food was awesome!  We arrived a little after 7pm and were seated immediately!  Serviced rocked the house as they gave us water and brought us food at the right pace.  I ordered the chicken fingers and the wife ordered a buffalo wrap.  We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer.  Total was about $35 including gratuity.  They had a good flow of customers throughout the evening.  I don't think we saw any empty tables, and there wasn't a wait at all for tables."
"I had eaten here once before a couple years ago and remembered liking it.  When I found a LEYE gift card in my desk drawer with some money still left on it, I suggested to Jessica R that we come here for our long overdue lunch date.We were seated pretty much right away in a booth across from the bar.  Our server was fine (just fine - I remember having awesome service the last time I was here), the drinks were pretty good, but the food...  was just eh.We both ordered burgers, and the server mentioned they came with cottage fries.  I didn't know what those were, but I remembered liking the shoestring-like fries the last time, so I went with it.The food came out in a reasonable amount of time for the lunch rush, and we both dug in.  The burger was pretty good, but the ""cottage fries"" were more like homemade potato chips.  I did not love them.  Some of them were soft and tasted like fries, while most of them were a tad overcooked and were just... gross.While our server was just fine, we were seated across from the ""soda jerk"" and the bar well, so other servers were constantly back and forth.  When a couple of them started discussing the details of a TV show I watch that had aired the previous night but I hadn't yet watched, I covered my ears and started saying ""LA LA LA LA LA LA LA!!!""  One of them found this amusing and started telling me made up things about the show.  It was good fun, and it reminded me that their servers are generally pretty awesome.This experience + my previous experience = 3 stars.  I wish it could have been more...  Maybe some day, but honestly I'm not going out of my way to rush back here anytime soon."
"I came here with my mom as a walk down memory lane for her.  She used to come here with work friends in the 70's for lunch and has always remembered it fondly.  She said that it looked exactly the same as she remembered, and they were playing music from the 70's too (on purpose?  not sure).  That was fun for me to imagine my mom here when she was my age...I had the salad bar, which was awesome.  Everything was fresh and the prepared side salads were very good.  I also had the french onion soup which was huge and very good (perfect for a winter dinner).  My mom had pulled pork, which was also delicious.  I live close by and I will definitely come back when I want to grab a casual dinner."
"I love this place for many reasons. The first one being the fact that it's super close to my apartment, the second one being that the atmosphere is fun and warm, and the food is totally great! My parents used to come here back in the day and there's just a friendly vibe in this restaurant that you don't get very often. Their menu is really fun, there are little cartoonish people drawn all over it and fun descriptions of the food. Random items adorn the walls of the dining room and their salad bar is the bomb. Anything you want is right there. They have a tiny little bar right when you walk in to the right. If you can snag a seat, it's nice to just people watch. Grunts can get pretty packed on the weekends, especially in the summertime being right next to the zoo. There are parents and baby strollers galore. I on the other hand, prefer dining during the week to avoid the crowds and tourists. It's then that you will come across the neighborhood folk (more my style). Try their Chili, I think it's pretty amazing. Everyone has their opinion on what makes good Chili, but Grunt's has their up to par!  Their Cajun Chicken Sandwich makes my mouth water and their burgers are pretty darn amazing. I usually leave this place busting the buttons off my pants, but it was time well spent. The staff is generally very friendly and animated. I've never had a bad time, and will continue coming back."
"Better Bacon Cheddar Burger - bacon was good, meat was a tad under-seasoned, bun was a little stale.Fries - A little tough, how do you even do that?Strawberry Malt - I wanted malt, and I got malt. So much malt there was a tablespoon of unmixed malt powder caked onto the side of the cup."
"They have a alcoholic chocolate milkshakes that is popular, but I had Three Floyds Gumballhead which is always a treat.The burgers were talked up a lot by my friends so I had high expectations. And considering the fact that it was the birthplace of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, I expected more. Sweet Potatoe fries were pretty good and you get a large pickle.The inside is vintage with cool decorations. Worth going to once, probably not again."
"Oh RJ Grunts. I love you.Went here again a few weeks ago and tried something different. No - I did not try the salad bar. Being raised in a Greek household, my concept of salad is really different from most Americans. I am a minimalist when it comes to salads: cucumber, tomato, onion, lettuce, MAYBE some cheese. I like avocado occasionally also. And cabbage. I digress.. the point is salad bars are not that appealing to me and it is nothing against RJ grunts famed salad bar - I just love other things on the menu much much more.So this time, I broke away from my burger craze, and chose to order the Santa Fe wrap. Another one of my obsessions besides sushi = wraps. If there is a wrap on the menu, i'm ordering it. I was NOT disappointed with the santa fe wrap - in fact I think I actually fell in love with it right then and there.  It was the perfect combination of flavor and spice - and did i mention it has guacamole in it? Yes, I will be giving my RJ Grunt burger craze a rest and will be ordering the Santa Fe AGAIN the next time I go there. Love."
"Aaamaaazing burgers, nachos, onion rings. LOVE it! And fun music for an upbeat atmosphere. Some times there's a wait -- totally worth it."
"Run don't walk to R.J. Grunts.  This is one of my all-time favorite brunch spots in the city, and the fact that it's in the heart of my favorite Chicago neighborhood, Lincoln Park West, makes the experience that much more enjoyable.  R.J. Grunt has been in Lincoln Park for years and it's no wonder the why the restaurant is a success, the food is fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and the waitstaff is some of the best I've had.Now I understand that their traditional menu and salad bar is what really wow's people, and even though I have been there several times I have never ordered off of their traditional menu, I've only had their brunch (which includes their salad bar).  Stunning- I know.The brunch is my favorite because it offeres variety.  The homemade waffles, pecan-french-toast and western style eggs are to-die-for!  The flavors compliment each other beautifully and when it comes to the sweet breakfast offerings, you don't need syrup- I know, it's shocking but it's true.  You cannot go wrong with this brunch bar!  The salad bar is on a completely different level than any other salad bars I've ever been too.  If you've read my reviews, you know I love a good salad and you also know that I love to choose what goes into my salad, so obviously, RJ's is one of my favorites because of the large salad bar.  The dressings are great, the offerings of fresh fruit, veggies and organic spinach is out-of-this-world!  I am tempted to go there right now!  I honestly cannot say enough good about RJ's, but I will....The staff is super sweet and extremely attentive.  I've never had a bad experience here.  And the decor and atmosphere is so much fun!  I love the old photos and Chicago memorabilia.  Can we also talk about how the restaurant is across the street from Lincoln Park Zoo?  It's a great place to go to on a Sunday and then head across the street for a pleasant stroll in the zoo.  With that being said- please leave the kids at home- or bypass RJ's and just head to the zoo.  Brunch is great, but it's not a place for kids, and honestly, there's nothing more annoying than having parents try to have kids running around a fun place to knocking into chairs with oversized strollers.  Just leave the kids with grandma and grandpa during brunch- thanks!  Anyway- sorry about the child-tangent- moving on. I really love R.J.'s and I really hope you go to Lincoln Park West to check it out, it's so much fun and the perfect place for brunch and/or lunch.  Cheers and have some salad for me when you're there!"
"Service has been good the few times I've been here for lunch/dinner. As for the food though, it's hardly what you'd expect from Lettuce Entertain You's flagship restaurant. It was good but no better than what you'd find in a typical TGIFriday's. Will be coming back just because it's close by."
"We came here again with our usual friends. Our friends Bruce and Karen are fanatical RJ Grunts followers, and every time we meet with them for dinner, they of course want to eat at RJ Grunts. I should say Bruce wants to eat at RJ Grunts. It is almost a cult for him.I think what stands out for me is the awesome service. The wait staff is so friendly and attentive, and the food comes very quickly. Kudos to the staff.The food is excellent, I always have a burger. Had the green chili burger this time.But of course this is one sick overcrowded restaurant. I walk from the salad bar praying that I will not bump into someone and lose my salad on somebody's head. And the restrooms are International Space Station - sized. That's all just part of the RJ Grunts experience."
"This was my favorite restaurant for perhaps the first 15-20 years of my life.  I am not kidding when I say that I practically grew up here; some of my earliest memories were of my mother bringing me to Grunts while she had a three-hour curriculum planning lunch.  I love the restaurant for sentimental reasons and because the Gruntburger (medium rare, of course) with rare cottage fries (so they're still floppy and oily in the center) is just so darn good!  As I grew into my 30s, sometimes I'd start having the peppercorn burger, which is a Gruntburger slathered in peppercorns, but fundamentally the song remained the same.It's tight, the bathrooms are tighter, yes - but that's part of the dimmed lights, 70s music, dark wood, retro gal servers (some of whom I've had for over 30 years!) that are just part of the ambiance and, for me, the insanely good and comforting memories.Only recently have I started doing the salad bar (I must be getting old!) but it's an amazing bar - two soups, tons of things to put on a salad, absolutely awesome.  Not highbrow; just good eats.Come on, folks.  This is what started it all - the very first Lettuce Entertain You gig.  They tried to close it and Chicago fought back (attaboy, Chicago!).  It's a landmark, an icon.  If you haven't ever been, you gotta go.  If you have, you need to go back.  I wait for the day when my doctors clear me to have a Gruntburger again.(It was so hard for me not to give this 5 stars purely for sentimental reasons... but it's awesome common food, not highbrow, and I have to be realistic.  At least a little.)"
"I wanted to give this 5 stars!!! It's such a cool space and the location is amazing right on the park, but maybe those two factors are what keeps people coming back, cause the food was very average. Buffalo style nachos to begin with were meh and then I got a wrap which was even more meh. No fries which was kind of a bummer as well, so I'm sorry RJ's, but you are classic in looks and feel, but not in food. I still might come back and give you a shot for dinner..."
"I went here with a friend a few weeks ago, as we were wandering around looking for food and couldn't find any.I got the burger. It was surprisingly good, which is saying something considering the restaurants in the area. It's not necessarily worth the trip we took, but if you're in the area you can do a lot worse."
"I'll admit it... my friends and I are addicted to GrubHub. Seriously, this place is perfect for takeout/delivery. MNF... no big deal... they'll slop together some of their awesome nachos, and make a few other apps... and all get fed a massive amount of heart attack inducing fried goodness. Props to the kitchen for accommodating my friend's ""EVERYTHING ON THE SIDE I'M THE PICKIEST EATER EVAR"" disposition. R.J. Grunt's isn't gourmet. It's good. The entrees are large enough to last a small person like me two full meals, the prices reasonable... and the chips... OH YUM. Order in, or go out. It might be a little packed during game time, but hey, there is something to be said about inhaling nachos in fuzzy slippers while praying the Bears don't embarrass themselves too too badly."
"I have passed this place hundreds of times in my life. Every single time i say to myself that I really want to try this place. Well I finally did try it and it did not disappoint me. Everyone here was really friendly, i was thoroughly impressed with the service we received from everyone that we came in contact with. they did a great job of taking care of us. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly and since it was our first visit there, the manager came by to welcome us and the place sprung for a free dessert! I was thinking about trying out their legendary salad bar and we had to walk right by it to get to our table. Everything looked appealing and fresh and clean but nothing really seemed to grab me. I am sure I would have received my moneys worth but I was really craving medium rare, dead animal on a bun so I decided to order a burger, a patty melt to be exact. It was very good indeed. I really liked the thin sliced fried potatoes that they served. It was something different than your usual fries. I had a taste of Lara's BBQ pork and it was amazing. So with all this going on and on about how great this place was, i am willing to bet you are asking: ""Why only four stars?"" Well I really felt cramped here. The place is on the smaller side ,and the tables are VERY close together. The place was about 3/4 of the way full and I felt my claustrophobia starting to kick in big time. I will have to come back on a weekday to avoid this but I will be back."
"AMAZING.Seriously.  First time there tonight.  Pretty decent menu, nothing too out of the ordinary.  The California Chicken Wrap was phenomenal.  No - best wrap I have ever had. You WILL love it.   The portions were quite large - I was expecting something much smaller.  I am actually taking the other half of my meal it to lunch tomorrow at work (NOTE:  this is important for people who like to save money while still enjoying the finer life of eating out all the time, or are just too lazy to pack their own lunch for work ;).  One of the best parts of the dining experience was our waitress, Shana (it's pronounced Shay-na).  I can't remember the last time we had such a friendly waitress - she even steered me away from my first meal choice towards the wrap, which, I cannot say enough, was ridiculously YUM.  We actually tipped 40% - I definitely recommend her as a waitress.I was so pleased I wish I could give it eleventy billion stars.  However, yelp.com allows 5.  So, 5 will have to do."
"My husband and I went here for a casual date night tonight and had a great experience. Our server was so sweet, I wish I had gotten her name.  We both had the salad bar which was good but nothing special except for the chocolate chip cream cheese. It was totally addictive. At the end of our meal our server brought us a complimentary cookie sundae because it was our first time there. So nice! The cookie was warm and delicious but, unfortunately, we couldn't finish it because we were so full. We will definitely be back!"
"Funny thing was I heard great things about their food, but that prob got them a two.The atmosphere of this place is what made me enjoy it.  From the pictures on the walls to the hilarious menu captions we really enjoyed eating here. Hell I guess its your usually Clark/Lincoln Park Restaurant:  They don't need good food to get people in the door so they don't care.  Darn it all to heck!!"
"yes, yes, yes, just yes. great wings, onion rings, burgers, milkshakes... and SUCH a cozy place. love the 70s decor and music. weekend brunch is great too! not the cheapest for a burger place but overall worth it."
"I have been patron of RJ grunts for over 30 years and unfortunately it has turned into nothing but an outrageously expensive burger joint.  Seems they have found their niche to be zoo visitors as the place is pretty quiet after 8:00 p.m.  Also tells me that the locals know what a racquet they have going -- $15 for a salad bar that is 3 foot by 6 foot?  Come on!  It was just ok, nothing all that special, and as fresh as you would expect any salad bar to be.  Service just ok, food is ok, burgers are the best choice.  There are many better restaurant  choices - save your money."
"My husband and I went to RJ Grunt's for my birthday.  We selected this place based on the many 5-star reviews and we weren't disappointed with the food.  Glad we made reservations since we went on a Saturday night.  The food was fantastic.  We each had a hamburger and each of us loved it.  It was cooked just as we ordered and was juicy and delicious.  The only downside was that we felt rushed.  Even before my husband was finished nibbling on his fries, someone came and tried to take his plate...same for his beer.  All of the staff were very nice, but the wait staff seemed like they wanted us to hurry along so they could get the table ready for the next party.  We didn't appreciate that at all.  We asked the waitress to take our picture, as we explained it was my 62nd birthday.  She was in a hurry so gave the camera to the hostess.  Knowing that it was my birthday, she never offered to bring me a little ice cream sundae like I saw others receive.  Again, she seemed to want to hurry us out.  I didn't go there just to get a freebie, but that seems to be what is done and it is a nice touch that is appreciated.  Don't know if we will return to RJ Grunt's.  There are so many good places in the Chicago area that serve delicious food and have a more relaxed atmosphere."
"The burgers are pretty good. I mainly come here for the bloody margaritas and breakfast brunch, as it's a quick block from my place. The story and inside are neat. It's the first LEYE and salad bar. The menu is pretty standard American which can be a bit boring. Every time I get my tab I feel like I'm paying about $5 more than it's worth. Kind of like CVS if you don't have the CVS card."
"Did brunch this past Sunday:Positives:You get the full salad bar with the buffet for $12French Toast in the buffet is the most amazing thing I've ever tastedCute Mini bagelsEven though the breakfast buffet looks small, there's really everything you'd ever want offered thereFresh fruit includes raspberries, strawberries, and pineappleNegativesThe cup of coffee was actually an extra $2.50 and probably cost 2 cents to make.... semi-irritating when usually buffets include beverages.Overall, pretty good option for brunch.  The servers are friendly and helpful."
"My son loves Grunts. Due to its close proximity to the Lincoln Park Zoo, we often try to work in dining there after a zoo outing.   Grunts has a Family friendly atmosphere, the kids meals aren't fancy but my kid enjoys them.  Overall Grunts has decent food. We often get the salad bar along with a burger. It seems like we go overboard but salad bar is delicious and tough not to get a burger with their signature chips.  Only downside is going on a weekend can result in a 30 min wait for a table, and prices aren't cheap, but I think overall it's worth it.   Parking can be tough, I haven't used the valet, instead opting to walk a few blocks if necessary."
"""Meh. I've experienced better"". Yelp says it perfectly. Met a friend here for a quick dinner before heading over to Park West for a show. I don't give RJ Grunts 2 stars because it's bad, but rather because there is really nothing special about it. I had heard great things about the salad bar -- and it was huge -- but not that fresh. Also, the chili apparently won awards years ago, but again, I've had much better.I would try it again because of the huge menu, and because the menu is funny to read and the decor is amusing. But I'd be weary..."
"It's never easy to find a place where everyone in my family will eat. Sister's a vegetarian, mom can't stand the smell of garlic (so no Italian), dad is cheap and won't go anywhere fancy, and me, well...I'll eat just about anything. So when I moved into my new apartment down the street my parents were pleased to see that I lived so close to RJ Grunt's. THE ORIGINAL LETTUCE ENTERTAIN YOU they screamed! Apparently they had come here yeeeears ago when they were dating in the city.The menu is huge and they have just about everything under the sun. I have yet to try these nachos that everyone seems to be raving about but I have been very satsified with my chicken fingers and California chicken wrap. My mom always sticks with the Mr.Chicken sandwich. My sister (the fish eating vegetarian) enjoyed the fish tacos, but not the corn tortillas. They've got Blue Moon on tap which always keeps me happy and the service is pretty good. It gets crowded in there since it's a small place and the tiny women's bathroom has one stall and enough standing room for 2 other people. Yikes!"
"Though it's a bit outdated decor-wise, in this sort of 70s Ruby Tuesday's kind of way, the food is quite good.  I was especially impressed with the homemade veggie burger.  Most places serve me a gardenburger with their own toppings, and I don't complain, but I have to give credit to RJ Grunt's for serving me something that would take me a few hours to make at home.  My husband loved his burger, and was really pleased that they were willing to serve a burger medium-rare.  Also, delicious sweet potato fries."
"I love this place. Me and a friend go here all the time and are obsessed with the chili nachos and chicken fingers. The best thing of all is the desert, if your going to order anything from this place make sure you save room for the cookie sunday or the cookie sequel. It will be by far the best $5 dessert you will ever have, guaranteed. Other than the food, the service is always attentive, and you can't not love the tacky 70's decor that hasn't been changed or probably dusted in years."
"I've been there twice now, an the burgers are fantastic.  The ""cottage fries"" are more like thick cut kettle potato chip, but still great.  Nice atmosphere but a little crowded inside.See if you can figure out all the framed pictures of women from the 1970's is about...  :)"
Dont get me wrong... I'm not a complete hater. But I think the rating description fits RJ Grunts well (Meh. I've experienced better). If you have a Lettuce Entertain You gift card and you would like some comfort food instead of heading to one of their many swanky restaurants.... this is good option.We went for an early lunch as a group of 8. We experienced no wait (we had a reservation) but by the time we left there was a long line. The salad bar was good (as expected from the creator's of it!). Everyone at our table enjoyed their food but I think it's safe to say that none of us are dying to get back there.
"My husband and I had one of those LEYE gift certificates for $25 that you get free when you buy $100 at the holidays, and we just came across again when we were deciding where to have dinner a couple weekends ago.  We were going to be near RJ Grunts doing a few errands and thought we'd give it a shot. Everyone raves about the salad bar.  Me, I'm not bothering with a salad at a place known for bugers.  I thought my bacon cheeseburger was great (sizeable, too- I left about 1/3)!  My husband got the Tuna  Melt.  Oh, shoot....Lent.....yeah, too late.  Already ordered the burger :)  He enjoyed his meal, but the highlight was the milkshake at the end.  Mmmm.  The waiter split it in two glasses, much to my hubby's dismay :)  Definitely try a shake!  Small bar area, but you can get a drink while you wait for a table.  $8 valet."
"Someone gave me a gift certificate to a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant for my birthday and we decided on this joint.My friend hyped up the salad bar so that is what I ordered.  Eh, it was okay.  I thought it was a bit crowded and messy and really I can think of a few other places with more crave-worthy bars.  As far as atmosphere:  Crowded and too many kids.  I cannot stand those little snot-nosed brats, especially when I am having dinner.  So maybe this was a bad choice for us..but what did I know?  Too kitschy for me."
I had the Chicken Teri sandwich. It was very flavorful and a pretty nice size. I don't like the cottage fries (homemade potato chips) so I get the fries instead. Quick order for pickup
My friend found a bug in her water and they covered our entire bill and gave us free dessert. That was pretty amazing. Otherwise the bartender was kinda rude.
"It was crowded and noisy, but that can be good when you have kids with you like we did. Food was good, but a little pricey for what you get. I guess you are paying for the Lincoln Park location. Parking was a hastle, but that is what you get living in the city."
"Think twice before you enter into what I would deem a ""Hell on Earth"".  While the food is OK, this place is swamped on the weekends with Lincoln Park couples and their kids.  I have a two year old that goes out with us everywhere so I understand what it is like to eat with kids, but it seems as though all the parents just ignore their kids once they enter the door.  Service was fine and the food came quite quickly, but there are better places to get a sandwich in the city where you do not have to fight through what looks like a 24/7 elementary school field trip.  Also make ensure that you make a reservation or you will be waiting for a table."
"The fun decore couldnt make up for the average food, and the horrible wait we experienced.  Had a reservation for 8 people on a Saturday night, arrived about 20 minutes early for a 9:00 res and werent seated until 9:35.  After seeing our painfully hungy/angry faces the hostess offered to get a couple of apps started before we sat down free of charge... bought them an extra star."
"This place was awesome. I joined yelp just to rave. I live in Chicago, and tho this place probably used to be a tourist trap, its all locals now. The food was EXCELLENT. Huge portions, amazing vegetarian nachos, the salad bar had sooo many delicious and unusual things on it. We ate like pigs and git a free birthday dessert, and our bill was only 65 dollars for three of us. Great for locals or locals with out of town guests. Fun place, good music, great service."
"Alrighty, update time!  Upon writing my first review of RJ Grunts, I received a very nice private message from the manager thanking me for my honest opinion.  She also asked me to please come back and give them another try - I thought this was a wonderfully straightforward way to address my lukewarm reaction to my first visit and I'm a huge fan of people who act with integrity so of course I went back to RJ Grunts for another go.And I'm glad I did.  I get the gist of the place now.  RJ Grunts is a neighborhood establishment that has been serving Lincoln Park residents and visitors alike for decades.The first time I visited, I'd stopped in for the weekend brunch buffet and wasn't thrilled.  This time, I arrived a little later.  This time, I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and my dining companion (my 13 year old) ordered the salad bar and a bowl of chili.   This time, we were very, very pleased with our food choices.  The chili was spicy and flavourful (of course I had a bite!).  My chicken sandwich (if you've read my reviews, you know how I am about chicken sandwiches.... it's all or nothing, baby) was DELICIOUS.  While the cottage fries really aren't my thing, I see how they're probably popular with many patrons.  I just happen to prefer my fried potatoes ultra-crisp and salty (we can probably blame the place with the golden arches for this addiction).  The salad bar was........................the salad bar.  I still think it's okay but not great.  However, that said, you know, having worked in the hospitality industry for many years, I've lost count of the people I've served who've asked for food substitutions in order to replace their fancy-foodie menu item with something a little more basic.  To that end, RJ Grunts' salad bar probably holds great appeal for those guests who prefer their foods a little less spicy than I do.  And that's okay.  Oh.  I have to mention one thing about the salad bar:  whatever is in that cream cheese and chocolate chip thing is deadly to my waistline.  That stuff is seriously good in a very bad way!To sum up my review, let me say this:  I wish there was a greater variance in the star ratings.  I wouldn't quite give them a 5 star rating but my return visit was *noticeably* better than my first.  While RJ Grunts is not the go-to place for the latest and greatest trends in haute cuisine, it IS a friendly, cozy place that you can feel comfortable bringing your entire family to for a good, solid meal!"
"The Grunt burger and big cookie dessert are unbelievable! You know a burger is good when you don't need ketchup and it taste great a day later! Also, it was cooked to perfection which is so rare at restaurants! Good job RJ Grunts!!"
"Fun, loud, bold place, good good and good service, near eardrum splitting volume though.  Considered a local classic, enormous menu, plenty of choices."
"LoVE IT! Nice salad bar, great burgers and exquisite onion soup. A bit of waiting required on weekends. Perfect place for guests and a walk on the park and the Lincoln Park Zoo. Valet available."
"RJ Grunts is one of those places that I think about when I have a craving for a great burger. I recently went with my dad. He told me he wanted a great burger, so I immediately thought of RJ Grunts and Kuma's. I never tried Kuma's...its on my ""to eat list"" so I decided to take him to RJ Grunts.Let me just say the burgers are so good. They are juicy, not dry at all which is a A+ in my book. I know that the cottage fries are really hot in the yelp world, but my favorite is that sweet potato fries. They are crispy and delicious!  My drink of choice to wash it down is a low fat vanilla peanut butter shake..O i know what your thinking...I sound like one of those people at McDonalds that orders a Big Mac then get a diet coke...well I kinda was one of those people. Knowing that the shake was made with low fat ice cream helps me sleep better at night.   Now to the eating part...My dad always has something to say about the food he eats and he usually says how he can make it better, or they should have added a certain spice that would make it taste better. I was crossing my fingers hoping that he would like it as much as I do. I knew if he didn't I would have to hear about how he could make it better, which would make me feel like I wasn't as good of a food critic as I think that I am. I knew I had prove to my biggest critic that I could choose a great restaurant. I spent 5 mins talking my dad into getting the sweet potato fries over the other fries and when he finally agreed and food came to the table he looked at it and didn't say anything. I knew if he would just try it then his world would change forever. After about 5 seconds of staring he took 3 fried and ate them....silence...now this is weird my dad is not a quiet person so when he didn't say a word I figured he was trying to compose himself. Then he took a bite of the ""Better Bacon Burger"". I said ""Dad how is it?"", but no answer...""Dad how do you like your food? He lifts his head up with his eyes completely shut while he chews. ""Dad"" after about 15 seconds of silence he finally open his eyes and says ""O my goodness, that burger and fries is so good I cant even talk"".  He then took a sip of the peanut butter shake and sat back in his chair and said ""Wow that hit the spot we need to come here again"".My dad's expression was priceless and I was so happy to share that moment with good company and good food...good times!"
"I am generally supportive of R. J. Grunt's, but a late visit last night did not work. This restaurant advertises late hours, and I've visited the restaurant during them. Yet it was not the case last night, when we were told the restaurant was closed, and it was not even 11:30 p.m. Some sites list the closing at midnight, others at 2:00 a.m., but whatever it is, I felt as though I caught R. J. Grunt's at the _wrong_ time. So, after a performance, it's off my list of places to visit. I'll just stay at the opera house -- at least Lyric Opera of Chicago stays open after performances. So far...."
"RJ Grunts is becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  I order the same thing every time I come in, ribs and chicken wings.  I'm not sure what they put in their bbq sauce, but it's sweet and tangy.  It always hits the spot and I only order things on the menu that use it.  I have never had their salad bar, because there's not time to eat greens when their ribs are fall off the bone tender and their wings are crispy and big.  Also, I always order the cup of soup that is priced at the outside temp.  Each on if their soups are great - tomato is the best.  If you like dessert, the cookie sundae thing looks great.  I'm always too full from meat and beer after a meal. Their prices are reasonable for the food quality and portions.  Be ready to wait in line any weekend. Finally, if you happen to come here on a Sunday, get the bloody marry.  They have specials on it all day and it's damn good.  Bring your buddies, grandma, friend, whoever - this place is for everyone."
"Had dinner for the second time at RJ Grunts.  It is located by the Lincoln Park Zoo.  They have a bar area, great, upbeat music playing and cool pictures all over their walls.  At first I thought they were pics of famous movie stars, but they are of servers who've worked there in the past.  My favorite things were the mac and cheese, nachos and famous milkshakes.  Yum!  Next time, I will try their salad bar."
"I have ordered lunch and dinner from here and it wasn't bad, but the best thing about this place is the brunch buffet.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, sausage, mini waffles, bread pudding.  I absolutely love it.  If you have the means, I highly recommend it.  It is so choice.However, the 70s theme gets old quick, and the place is just plastered with old pictures of young women, which kinda creeps me out."
"i love lettuce entertain you restaurants - but this was a little sub par in comparison to what i'm used to for them.  salad bar was good but nothing extraordinary.  everything was fresh and good - just nothing that made me think ""i HAVE to come back.""  i also tried the nachos which were pretty tasty.  my hubby liked his burger.service was good, parking was a nightmare.  if i ever come back, i'm taking a bus."
"This is a spot we have been several times before but on our last trip we were thoroughly impressed with the service! Our server Sean couldn't have been friendlier. The food was great! Outstanding beer selection. A fun, casual ambience. Highly recommended!"
"Hmm, very mixed reviews for RJ Grunts. I happen to really like it. I love their blue cheese peppercorn something burger, good potato-slice-chip something fries, I love that I can order a root beer float without getting a strange look. I've never done the salad bar, because in general salad bars and buffets bring back bad memories of school field trips with lunch stops at Old Country Buffet (why, Neuqua Valley, WHY?!). And I don't understand why salad bars always have Jell-O, it doesn't go with salad. I'm off on a tangent, lets re-group.I've never had bad service at Grunts, and the burgers are good, and so are the milkshakes. Thats all."
"Since going to this small restaurant in 1976, it has always been great.  Great salad bar that has been so all these years.  When most restaurants are always trying to reinvent itself, Rich Melman knows not to mess with a great thing.    Yes it is a small place and it can get crowded at times, but you have to know that, especially on a Sunday at noon for brunch.  Valet Parking is great.  These must be the children of the orignal waitstaff......because the staff is still great and very into their servicing the guest"
"Salad bar amazing.  And for all you ranch dressing lovers, you will be in heaven with theirs (homemade).  You will not be disappointed....promise."
"I can't review RJ Grunts very objectively. As a teen I came here too often with my grandparents in the 1970's; it's about smack in the middle of where each of them lived. Plus, I worked for LEYE for three years in the 1980's, and Rich Melman was on a few occassions such a gentleman and helpful mentor to me that I couldn't possibly be truly objective. And, I called ahead, said I was a former LEYE employee coming in with a kid and would much appreciate being seated promptly when I arrived. The hostess said of course in the warmest way, took my name, and assured me no waiting. We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night, checked in and we were seated within three minutes, even though it was jam packed, and I heard the hostess tell other folks with reservations that they were running about 20 minutes behind. So, there are two stars right there.However, one thing for sure about which I can be objective, Grunts has elevated the notion of slinging slop to an art and science. No matter how good the food is, and it's pretty good for a LEYE shop, which for its lower end joints has elevated the combination of great thematics and average food to an art and science, the food comes at you way too fast. Maybe that's because I was in on a Saturday night, but in any event, it sure was rushed in there.Honestly, having found an ancient but unexpired and decent sized RJ Grunts gift card in an old wallet (LEYE gift cards never expire), I brought one of the kids here with me with the intention of sampling a little bit more than I would usually buy or even want to eat. We'd both had long, tiring days, and I was more interested in a liesurely meal than it turned out to be. What was I thinking? I should have known better.Yes, we were seated quickly, but the rest of the pace killed what was there to enjoy: the historic salad bar (which includes chopped liver); the seventies music (if that sort of nostalgia turns you on), the walls laden with photos of all the plain Jane waitresses that have ever worked there, the Fritz That's It poster above the men's room urinal, and a menu with enough fun choices that it makes me want to sit and eat all night.For $5.25 you can add the salad bar to any menu item. So, we picked that along with a pork sandwich and a hickory burger, both of which were delicious. What bugged me, however, was that no sooner had we put the last salad bar morsel in our mouths, than the waitress showed up with our dinners and at the same time asked: ""so I assume you don't want another plate for the salad bar?"" Well, no, not if you present that sort of choice, I guess not. The truth was, there was more on the salad bar we would have enjoyed sampling, but having our entrees thrown at us like that left us little option.No complaints about the food, but the rush act was the buzz kill, and it took the wind out of my sails for some of their marvelous and quite indulgent desserts.But still, the nostalgia, the effort to seat us immediately, and the surprisingly and consistently good food over all these years yields a four star review (I could never give Grunts 5 stars with the parking nightmare over there, which is a main reason I've rarely ventured over here in years).Lesson learned: go for lunch on a weekday and not on a Saturday night if you don't want a rushed madhouse."
"There are so many reasons why this place has established itself as a Chicago must-see.- The decor. All over the place are photos of all the old waitresses that have worked for RJ.- The music. Classic rock and motown, what can't you love?- The bar. Right there in the front while you wait for room, and now all milkshakes can include liquor.- The salad bar. Sure it's not the cleanest you've ever seen, but a good selection and a great price make it a good deal.- The temperature soup. You pay a penny a degree, so in these Chicago winters you could get a cup of soup for 20 cents!- The cinnamon milkshake. Need I say more?Go here and visit before LEYE shuts it down."
"Great to see a neighborhood place still doing well, serving good food and providing friendly service without breaking the bank... thank you!!"
"RJ Grunts ROCKS! This place is always crowded, but has a great home-y feel to it! I've been there many times (I can't recall) and have always tried something different. The salad bar is ginormous, and is a vegetarian's dream some true. You come to RJ Grunts for beer and burgers mainly. Their chili is also great, and their temperature soups are a great deal! I love their bufflo-style anything!"
Yummy.  The only word I can say.  Very crowded on a Sunday and of course no one in my party thought to make a reservation since there was 5 of us and a baby.  We waited about 45 minutes and got a decent table in the back.  I had one of the best burgers I have had in a while.  Sweet potato fries were delicious as well.
Every time I've been here (and tried to get a table here) it has been ridiculous packed. Even when we've made a reservation we've had to wait for a little bit. If you go during the week its not as bad.I enjoy their burgers and homeade chips but the salad bar is pretty darn good. They have some more unique items like chopped liver (mmm) that you don't find on every buffet so its a bit more unique. Like all salad bars it can get messy especially since everything is very compact in this space and you have to sometimes reach across 3 other bins of food to get to your selection. If you're a hygiene-freak don't eat at this salad bar. I had the chili on my most recent visit because it was cold outside and I wanted something warm to go with my salad...pretty good. The portion was huge too. I'd never gotten the cookie sundae but I do recommend it after I had it last night - chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and hot fudge or a cinnamon cookie with ice cream and caramel. Yum. The half portion is plenty for 2.
"Whenever I see, hear, or think about RJ Grunts, I say ""ARR JAY GRUUUUUNTS"" in a deep raspy constipated voice while making a painful face like I'm taking a large poo.Despite that downfall, this place is great. Super tasty bar food and nachos that will make your stomach scream for more! Really small bar area is not fit for many people but a good area to have a beer before you are seated. I'm definitely going back to this place!Love it,Silky"
"This place has a huge salad bar and killer brunch!  Fruit, veggies, eggs, french toast, soup...they have it all.  You'll leave stuffed and satisfied.  Good coffee, too!"
"Geographically, this is kind of my kitchen.  My personal kitchen.  And has been for a long time.  I appreciate the humor in someone thinking this is like a chain because it is what launched the legend that is Lettuce Entertain You. I've never had a bad meal here, and I've had hundreds.  I usually get a server or a ""Grunts Girl"" I know from being here so often so service is usually good although when they get overrun by those who don't get it (can you say Zoolights?) its hit or miss.Love the California Wrap, the burgers, the dainty little wings with the onion strings buried beneath.  Oh and ""Temp. Soup"" on a bitter cold day, served in seconds.  Salad bar is more nostalgia than anything but still holds its own.  Hippie motif despite not being hip anymore is a defiance I have to say I love.  Real milkshakes, great draft beer and family friendly give this place pluses.  The minus one star is for sure because I've been coming here for ummm like 20 years and the hostesses change so often, its a crapshoot and have to rely on the kickass old school waitresses to sneak me to a side table.  And the stroller brigade blocking the entire enterance.  They need stroller valet service.  And I'm not kidding or letting you have my idea LEYE............"
Great munch out food. The burgers and nachos were delicious. The location is kind of tucked away near the LP zoo.
"We stopped by this place after a visit to Lincoln Park Zoo. Felt transported to another era. Ordered a strawberry milkshake and turkey club sandwich. Milkshake was incredible, and the sandwich was delicious. Dining companion had a Oreo cookie milkshake and a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and was satisfied with both. Was a little pricey but the ambiance and food quality made it worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"The burgers are good, and the place should be kid friendly, but it's pretty tight in there, so it was a bit rough for me and my little family to manuevuer last weekend for lunch.  Also, they have a kids' menu, but no burgers on it,  which is what my little guy loves, so I had to order for him off the regular adult menu.  No big deal, but when I got flack from the waitress for giving my 1 year old a bite of cottage cheese off of my salad plate (""no salad sharing"" says the menu!), I think my eyes literally rolled out of my head.  Idiot waitress nonwithstanding, this place is okay."
"This place had some amazing burgers, and the fries were fantastic! I sat at the bar for dinner after a festival in Lincoln Park.  The bartender started telling us how we should of gotten their chips, and when we were all bummed out, he brought some out for us to try. Now thats satisfying the customer. I will definitely be back because this place was awesome, but then again, which lettuce entertain you restaurant isnt?"
"My wife and I reserved two tables through Open Table on the night of our wedding to get together with out of town friends. Twice the amount of people showed up and the staff at RJ Grunts did an AMAZING job at accommodating. Everyone was seated in a reasonable amount of time for a Saturday night. Upon hearing we had just gotten married, my wife was even presented with a complimentary dessert. Thank you RJ Grunts, we'll be back!"
"The sweet chocolate chip cream cheese sends the first ever salad bar in Chicago over the top!  After trying just about everything laid out on the salad bar, I chose to dive into the Gruntburger.  The fried onions and special cheese sauce on this burger turned my stomach into a bottomless pit of pure happiness.  I highly recommend rj grunts if you are looking to chow down a great burger.  Their burger efforts easily crack my top 5 list for best burgers in both cook and dupage counties."
"I haven't been here for a million years before heading in again this weekend.  I should've expected that on the first nice day of the year, there was a 45-minute wait for a 2-person table.  I didn't remember the bar area being that small.  Everyone waiting for a table after coming out of the zoo was packed in like sardines; there was almost nowhere to go if your table got called!  The atmosphere is how I remember, with lots of pictures on the walls (old waitresses? female guests?), and classic rock buzzing around.  When we were seated, the waitress came to grab our soda orders.  She was relatively short when we only ordered soda instead of a shake or beer. We waited awhile to get our food order in, but our orders came out relatively quickly (given the amount of people in the restaurant).I'm sad to say that the watiress didn't come back at all until about 45 minutes after our food came.  Once we got our check, though, we were able to get out quickly.I don't remember the salad bar being that expensive, but it did look yummy.  I'd love to come back when I have more time to hang around, and not right at 5 on a Saturday!"
"I love this little restaurant. I try to go there in October because they have an amazing pumpkin milkshake (seasonal). It's tight in there and you're damn near sitting next to everyone in the restaurant, but the staff is friendly and the food is good. I usually get the buffalo chicken nachos...they are 'd-lish'. Also, the vintage tuna sandwich is huge but the tuna can use a little mustard..but it's good. They also have a great salad bar and the prices are decent!  Street parking is hard but they have valet for about $9 I think."
The Gruntburger is the most amazing burger I've had in a while. I have to come back to try different things so I can give them a proper rating and review but I had to put this up because people MUST try it!
"RJ Grunt's had been on our list of places to try for awhile, so my husband and I went a couple times in the past few weeks, once with friends after the zoo, and once with out-of-town visitors who were hoping to eat something light before a chocolate tour the next day.We all had great food each time. The menu is pretty standard for a bar & grille type place, but there are a lot of choices and everything everyone ordered was good. I loved the salad bar, the burgers were delicious and huge, the shakes are really good, and it's an all-around fun place. Check it out!P.S. I haven't been, but I've heard their Sunday brunch is also really good--I'll probably head back there to sample that."
Love the food! Love the location.  4 stars only because I feel if I want to share something off my plate because I ordered the salad bar I am an adult I should be able to.
"Been here twice....once in a good mood and once in a bad mood. The bad mood was due to Chicago Pizza Oven and Grinder having a 'two-hour' wait. What bs!Anyways, this place is good for a meal before or after the zoo. Random comment yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place is what I mean. Assuming that is the reason there are always so many kids in this place. I wouldn't bring a date here. It's good food and will get the job done if you are looking for a casual meal. Not a hot spot for a night out though."
"A little overrated in my opinion. It has cute decor and so-so food, but is in a great location. I recommend making reservations if you go Friday/Saturday night because the place is usually overflowing with people."
"Listen up fellow vegetarians, if you're looking for awesome, well executed veggie dishes, then RJ's is for you!  Their tasty veggie burger made my ""carrot"" stand on end, it was that good!!!  So if you're looking to chow down on some delicious veg head grub, grab your fellow herbivores and get down here pronto!!!!"
"The food was tasty and appropriately priced given the location.  The service was poor.  We had to ask what the special beer and entrees were.  When questioned about the beer special, she was unaware of the type of beer and the cost.  We then had to ask another server for dessert menus which we then ordered with her.  it was an overall bad experience and i don't think i will return."
"This is my all-time favorite Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and probably my all-time favorite restaurant period if I ignore my commitment phobia. I am biased, being a Lettuce Entertain You kid, but I'm cool with that. It was the first restaurant LEYE ever opened and has almost closed at least twice, but the legions of screaming fans, threats of flooding due to too many tears shed, and the soft spot that Rich Melman has in his heart for his first creation, has, thankfully, kept Grunts open.The food is the traditional American burgers and sandwiches, which come with thick cut chips instead of fries, and which are delicious.  Grunt's' real claim to fame though, are the malts and shakes, and the salad bar.  If you're a chocolate malt person, Grunt's is the place to be.  The best part is they give you the metal cup to re-fill your glass.The Grunt's salad bar is unrivaled in, I'm pretty sure, any dimension, and was, I've been told, the first salad bar ever in Chicago.  It is always brimming with fresh fruit and vegetables and several awesome salad dressings, and I always hit it up when I'm at the restaurant even though I know it will cause me to be forced to bring half my giant burger home.What else makes Grunt's so great? It being a creation of and for the children of the sixties. There's always great 60s and 70s rock playing (some of the dishes are named after 60s icons, too), and tie-dye shirts, psychedelic art, and pictures of all the waitresses that have worked there cover the walls. Some people aren't into the time-warp feel, but they can go to Panera. Give me my quirky hippie burger joint any day.Perfect place to stop for lunch or dinner after a day at Lincoln Park Zoo."
"I accidentally stumbled upon this place on the way back from the Zoo, and had a great experience.  The waitstaff and the 70s retro atmosphere were both very nice.  I ordered the Teri Chicken sandwich with tomato, lettuce and sauteed onions on it, and it was one of the best chicken sandwiches Ive ever had.  The freshly fried potato crisps were delicious, and I would imagine healthier than frozen fries from a bag.  Although its a little pricey, I would recommend getting a mlikshake, in one of the big range of flavors available in ice cream or low fat yogurt softserve.  Either way it gets you about 2.5 glasses from the big metal mixer, so you get your moneys worth of shake for sure."
"Well, after being abused at Kuma's, with poor service and cold hamburgers, i boycotted any burger place in the city..However,  a friend likes RJ Grunts, and we decided to go for lunch.  I had the cheeseburger, which was delicious and my friend had the hickory bacon cheddar cheese burger with bbq sauce.  She enjoyed hers as much as I did mine.  We went early, got seated right away and the babies did not bother us...I love the stroller parking in front of the restaurant.  I remember when Grunts first opened, the salad bar concept was new to the restaurant industry, now the salad bar seems small, but still has alot of goodies on it and the food is just as good.as it was back then.The wait staff was friendly and helpful...just opposite of Kumas and the food was warm..and delicious."
"Still 5 stars!!  Went here for the Sunday Brunch after my sister-in-law and cousin-in-law ran in the Shamrock Shuffle and even with a group of 10 people in this tiny place, it was AWESOME!  The brunch items were SO good...my favorites were the Chicken Sausages, some kind of Denver-type scramble and the Bread Pudding french toast casserole.  OMG!  I could eat here everyday!  I also ordered the 8 Buffalo wings and added the brunch to that...and let me tell you...the wings here are amazing!  They are really meaty and the sauce is a sweet/spicy sauce, really different from anywhere else I've been and I LOVE it!  I will DEFINITELY be back here for the Sunday Brunch again!  And I highly recommend reservations, like I had, cause it seems to get pretty crowded around lunch time on Sundays!  Mmmmm...seriously...I can't wait to go back!"
"I can't give RJ Grunts any less than 5 stars because I love it so much.  You too can love it, if you remember to bring your Purell*... (do you see where I'm going with this?)  First I need to kvetch briefly on the fact that this place gets packed and you can wait forever for a table.  In addition, be prepared for some loud (albeit awesome) music and screaming tots everywhere (not so awesome).  It might be in your best interest to visit Grunts during off-peak hours, or later in the evening.  And STAY AWAY during Zoo Lights: it's a mob scene.  Grunts is so dated, its like a time warp to a TGI Fridays circa 1978 (and I don't even know if that's possible).  It's pretty dark in there, but you know what is pretty?  All the pictures of the former waitresses adorning the walls.But the main event is the food: the burgers are seriously awesome and they come with homemade chips.  Personally, I really love that salad bar.*  Fight your way up there, lean away from the sneeze guard, and go for it.  Be sure to top off your salad with some tuna noodle casserole.  And for your sweet tooth, there's this scrumptious chocolate chip cream cheese ""stuff"".  And jello.  I like to get a scoop of each."
The best burger we've found !All other burgers are measured against RJ Grunts!  None have surpassed it yet.Great French Onion Soup and ChiliI never need a menu when I go now!  I know what I'll have long before I go through the door.Great salad bar too.A family favorite
I went to RJ Grunts for the first time because I had a major craving for a burger! The wait was 30 minutes at 8pm on a Sat. When we were finally seated we had the smallest table ever squished up against a wall. We were next to an 8 year old birthday party which was quite noisy. Then we were surrounded by people eating from the salad bar... which looked pretty blah to me... and overpriced. That's all fine and dandy but every time people walked past me the slammed into me or my chair which got really annoying really fast. The food took a while to come out and we only saw our waitress when we ordered and when we got our food. I think she hid in the kitchen most of the time. The burgers were good. Thick and juicy but at the same time greasy and difficult to eat when the bun got soggy. The grease even leaked through my napkin and stained my new dress :(. Then we were going to get dessert but it took forever for me to snag the waitress (I had to wave her down and she ignored the first couple attempts) so I figured I would cut my losses and just get the check. Also the bathroom situation needs to be reevaluated. It is one stall and there was always a line. Not somewhere I want to go back to.
"There is a small obsession with salad bars. Walking in, I was reminded of Eugene, Oregon, or the seventies, or my grandma's basement, or a bunch of hippies, or all of the above. The design and decor is stained wood, cramped spaces, and black and white photos of previous servers on the walls. While the salad bar was not crazy with all these options and flavors and exotic things, it was a super satisfying experience. You do get to try an assortment of items. From pasta and potato salads, to multiple veggies for your big salad, to soups and fruit, and my favorite, the chocolate chip cream cheese. It sounds weird, and it looks like a globby mess. But it tastes exactly like a rich rich piece of cheesecake that has gotten soft. The raspberries were the freshest I've tasted all season, and the watermelon was juicy and ripe."
I love this place it has always been consistent. You are guaranteed a great meal at every visit. My favorite thing is there salad bar. Everything is incredibly fresh and delicious. Second to that I enjoy their burgers. Yum!
"Great food, great atmosphere. This was one of our favorite dining experiences in Chicago. Food was fantastic!! the burgers were amazing. salad bar was so fresh! we are here after a long morning at the Lincoln Park Zoo...it was a great place to hang out, relax and enjoy some food. Highly recommend this place"
The location is majestic near lake michigan and the coffee shake and salad bar is fresh and an plentiful.  The boy and used our lettuce entertain you book here a gift from his mom and ate heartily here.  The potato chip fries and french onion soup we ordered with burgers once.  When we came back we or dered pulled bbq and the salad bar.
"Great salad barFunny menu (if you have the patience to read it all)Good foodFun musicAn ""A"" in my book!"
"We used to live down the street from this place, and I still wish I'd have gone there more.  Great atmosphere here; small restaurant/bar with lots of random stuff of the walls that they've accumulated over the past few decades. Probably one of the best selection of burgers I've ever seen, and I've liked every one I've ever had.  This place gets packed on the weekends.  Honestly, I'd recommend a weeknight to try and sneak in here.  Get the Gruntburger.  Sure, it'll shave a week off your life to eat it.  But really, what were you going to do with that extra week in your 90's?"
"I got introduced to RJ Grunts when I fell into a bunch of LEYE gift cards, and now I happily spend my own cash there.  It is a perfect place to take a crowd (although be sure to place a reservation in advance), as they have everything one could ask for, including their well known salad bar.  The Cajun Chicken Sandwich and Hickory Bacon Cheeseburger are my favorites (in conjunction with the salad bar of course, need to at least pretend to be healthy).  They also offer some delicious booze-infused milkshakes, either off the menu or of your own creation.  One server made her ""speciality shake"" for a friend of mine once, it was so good that I ask for it every time I return....problem being I have no idea what's in it and resort to pointing out the specific server and hoping she continues to remember it). My only complaint is the menu, it is a real world example of how fonts should NOT be used."
"Due to its desperately touristy vibe, I wasn't entirely looking forward to this restaurant. My family was in town from France and I wanted to take them somewhere ""American"" (i.e. burgers, buffalo wings, copious amounts of food) while visiting Lincoln Park and R.J. Grunts seemed to fit the bill. But damn, do I love that salad bar! It's certainly not exotic, classic ingredients and fresh fruit, but they give you lots of options. You can order it alone for $12 bucks, with an appetizer for $8, or with a meal for $7, and it's all you can eat no matter what. PLUS, they have two soups with the salad bar which are also all you can eat. NEAT! Everyone ordered a meal and the salad bar, but I was content with the bar.I can't personally vouch for the rest of the menu, but my father-in-law loved the ribs. The service was pretty attentive and the prices are low/fair.All in all, I'll probably be back for the salad bar...with family and friends on holiday or without."
"I can't imagine having to come here to go to work everyday. I mean if I had to listen to Carley Simon and look at pictures of women from the 70s, it's the looney bin for me. With that said...The food is not bad. I enjoyed their French onion soup. It had very good flavor and wasn't condensed canned salty either!Next, I enjoyed the peppercorn burger with homemade thick cut potato chips. Yum, although they did under cook my burger. I asked for medium rare and I got tartar. Still had good flavor. The Christmas ale was a nice compliment.It did hit the spot. The atmosphere is quite chaotic. I guess it could be a fun spot for groups"
"The food wasn't bad....The salad bar was, well, just a salad bar. It isn't often that I am critical of an atmosphere but here I was. The restaurant was crowded, everyone appeared hear what you were saying, and it just wasn't comfortable. I'd go back, but on a day/night when there is no wait...."
Two words:  buff nach.  Do it!
I put them on my 'poop list' after an encounter with badly burned bacon.RJ eventually redeemed himself.This place has great food... honestly.
"I've been coming here since the early 80's with my parents. It's still as fun and delicious. They have great drinks, awesome burgers, wraps, soups & salads. Oh and that salad bar...well, they were the first that I can remember. Anyway, another great example of a small place that executes well towards their customers. I bring all my friends who visit from out of state or the country. Can't beat the food and drinks at this place. Continued success to you guys!!!"
We were recommended this place when we just moved here and didn't know where to go for dinner.  We waited about 30 min. the 1st time and after that I learned that they will be more than happy to take reservations and so they're programmed into the phone.I love their burgers and wraps.  Their menu takes forever to process but it's cute.  It is cramped but cozy.  I'm not one for salad bars but I do know I dispise the people going to it while I'm trying to get to the tiny bathroom.  It's a favorite for a reason.  When we were chatted up by the waitress who asked us if we'd been there before she apparently tol the manager and he brought us a free desert and talked for awhile.  It was amazing.  I couldn't eat the desert hardly but did so since they were all so nice.  The bar helps out the wait though...it's cramped but people are nice enough to scoot over a bit and bartenders are aware of people trying to oder while they wait for their table.
"Picked this place after a long night of drinking (a little hungover) and was not disappointed.  Had just the plain cheeseburger (although they had a lot of specialty ones that I look forward to trying) and nachos.  Both are awesome!  The homeade chips are also amazing.  It was a Sunday, so there was a brunch bar going on that looked good and seemed like a good deal.  The waitress was incredibly sweet and took great care of our table.  And then there are the shakes.  Soooo many flavors.  And they'll make whatever you want, any combination.  Had an oreo/banana/caramel and it was the best shake I've ever had.  Really.  The best.  Try it.  If you like those things."
"If you are looking for a fancy dinner...don't go here.  But if you are looking for comfort food, a casual night or just some really delicious milkshakes, salad bar and desserts...then this is the place for you.It's salad bar is quite extensive with fresh fruit selections, 2 soups, and yummy chocolate chip cream cheese (w/graham crackers).  Service isn't the best....but the food makes up for it.  It's a good place if you are starving b/c the portions are usually huge.  I highly recommend it, and also recommend just getting the salad bar which is guaranteed to fill you up!!"
"I used to come here with my Dad in the mid 1980s, so when we moved back to Chicago in August I was a little nervous about going back to Grunt's.  I really liked the place when I was a teenager, and I feared that it wouldn't be as good as I had remembered it.  Well, we finally bit the bullet and went on a Sunday night - and I am really glad we did.  We have been back four or five times in the last three months, and it has become our default choice for a quick bite to eat in the Clark/Armitage neighborhood.My wife and I have tried a number of different items on the menu, and we have liked - or even loved - everything we have tried.  My wife loves the burgers at Grunt's.  Her only complaint is that the buns aren't very substantial.  The meat and the toppings are great, though.  I have tried the burgers, the chicken sandwiches,  the grilled cheese with tomato, and the buffalo chicken wrap.  I liked the wrap the least of the group, but I would order everything again.  The homemade chips are great, and the fries are tasty, too.  We always get the salad bar.  We love it.  As others have mentioned in their reviews it can be awkward and cramped near the salad bar, but that's part of the charm of the place for me.  While the salad bar items can get jumbled together when they get really busy, I am always impressed with the assortment of fresh veggies and fruit that they make available.  The beer list is quite solid for a neighborhood burger joint, and they will have ""special"" beers on tap on a rotating basis.  (Recently they had Delirium Tremens on tap (at $9 a glass!), which is a real treat if you like Belgian beers.)All in all this is a great neighborhood ""joint""."
"Even though our server was as skilled as a toadstool I am still giving this place 4 stars.  I really loved the food and the giant second trimester sized tum tum I developed only goes to prove it.  After finally becoming accustomed to the ADD inducing menu, our group started with the nachos.  They were delicious and satisfying but surprisingly by no means a complete gut bomb.  I also tried the french onion soup, and a grilled cheese deluxe (with tomato and bacon) which was so intense I couldn't finish it.  That doesn't mean I didn't want dessert though.  The chocolate chip cookie sundae was so good I probably should have uncaged my inner toddler and eaten that for dinner instead.  I'll definitely be back to try the chilli and the salad bar, and the mac and cheese, and the burgers, and, and, and............"
"I wanted to only give it 4 stars on principle.. it's a chain, there's nothing particularly original about it, etc, etc. However, I enjoyed the food THAT much. The burger was very tasty. Honestly the best burger I've had in Chicago. I asked for it to be cooked medium, and it came out perfectly. I was quite impressed. Side of homemade delicious chips.. check.I have to dedicate a paragraph to the incredible shakes. My combo of oreo, caramel and bananas was to die for.. you  must have a shake here. Oh, and service was awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.. I'll definitely be back!"
"Mmmm...burgers. I came here for the first time, and considered the salad bar, but looking at it I decided it just looked ok. Instead, I decided to go all out for the hickory bacon burger.... beef, bacon, cheese, fried onions, and bbq sauce. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. It felt like a rock in my stomach afterwards but it was sooooo gooooood."
"I really enjoy R.J. Grunt's. I've been coming here ever since I was really little, and it brings back good memories for me (a main reason I keep coming back).First of all, the atmosphere. It looks like it's in a 70s time warp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kitchy, if you will. I've always liked looking at the walls covered with framed photos of some of the original waitstaff. And the music is all oldies, which just happens to be my favorite genre. So major points there.On to the food. I usually get the temperature soup and the Gruntburger. Temperature soup for the sheer novelty of it (you pay the temperature of the lake, in cents, for a bowl of the soup du jour), and the Gruntburger for DELICIOUSNESS. It is by far the best bleu cheese burger I have eaten in the city of Chicago. The balance between dressing and actual cheese is perfect, and the onion strings complement the burger. I would eat this for lunch every day if I wasn't concerned that I would have a heart attack and die from it. Also, their burgers are served with cottage fries. I like them enough, but they're not the reason that I come here. I've had a few of the desserts, and they're all pretty good. Huge, so share them.Service. Eh. It varies a lot. I've had a few terrrrrrrible experiences here with waitstaff. However, it hasn't stopped me from coming back, so I guess that says something about how much I like it here.A final note: I have heard that their salad bar is really good. I just hate salad so I wouldn't know."
"It was okay, but not as good as everyone has said. The salad bar wasn't good at all! Their strawberry shake and fries were the only really good things I ate."
I enjoyed the 70's decor. The Music and the interior will make you want to do the hustle while you wait for some good food. I got a Mushroom and swiss burger it came with really tasty homemade chips. I really liked the burger because you can order the temperature and it came out medium well. Also the waiter told another table that they invented the salad bar. I dont think i quite believe that. There must have been restaurants before 1971 that put lettuce and fixings out for people to pick themselves. Besides that it was a great find! Try this place for lunch if your in the area.
"I went to RJ Grunt's last Sunday hoping to land a spot for a late brunch. Unfortunately, a little too late, as while we were waiting the brunch buffet was taken down. Persistent, my date and I stuck around for lunch, she having been there before and raving about the burger she ordered on her last visit. We started our meal with Chips, Salsa & Guacamole and really enjoyed the light starter. We also ordered a milkshake each (mine was chocolate-banana, hers was strawberry-banana) and the entire time all I could think of was Daniel Plainfield telling that kid in ""There Will Be Blood"" that he was going to drink his milkshake. Thank you, Daniel Day-Lewis. For entrees we each had a burger, she had the Bacon Burger (which she loved) served with homemade chips. I had the Works burger which was also really good, but I subbed in Mexican rice as a side. The rice was pretty much bad-- dry, lacking flavor and just sub-par to be honest. The sides, in general, were lacking as far as selection goes and was the only real flaw I found in the entire meal. Not a bad place and if you want to get your name on the list early and come back, I am sure the brunch is fantastic, too. I would definitely go back-- I did enjoy my meal and the atmosphere-- but was not good enough to make me want to frequent the place. (What can I say? I like side dishes.)"
"My boyfriend and I just went there last night and I now LOVE RJ Grunts!  We went on a random Tuesday, so it wasn't that crowded. Our waitress asked if it was our first time there and it was, but we really didn't think anything of it.  The tower of onion rings is an excellent appetizer and plenty for two people.  We both really enjoyed our entrees (the buffalo sauce isn't too spicy, so that was great).  My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer and they were really helpful about cleaning up and offered him a new beer at no cost.  Right before we got the bill, another waiter brought by a free brownie/cookie sundae since it was our first time!  We got the bill and they comp'd both the sundae and the spilled beer.  It was an excellent dinner and I'd definitely go back."
"Great location, Decent food, poor service.  It was mid day and lots of empty tables.  The waitress was short with us.  Burgers, homemade chips, sweet potato fries and Sante Fe wrap had excellent flavor.  Skip the quesadilla appetizer:  Limp like the ones i make on the fly in microwave at home.  Close walk from Lincoln Park Zoo."
"LOVE this place! They have great sandwiches, and i hear the salad bar is excellent, though I've never tried it. Their milkshakes really are the best I've ever had. And I love that they price their soup based on the day's temperature. RJ Grunts is great and I always jump at the chance to go!"
"I see what you're trying to do. Don't think you're fooling ANYONE. you're trying to distract people - with your charming menu, authentic atmosphere and incredible service.you're trying to distract people - with your delicious food & ridiculous salad bar. THERE IS NO MR. RJ GRUNTS IS THERE?!?!you are so not gonna get away with this one..."
"I realize that the salad bar is where it's at and that the burgers are supposed to be great at RJ Grunts, but for some reason, I've passed them up for fried stuff both times I've eaten there.  Fish and chips are good, but nothing special.  I liked that they switched out the 'chips' for veggies last time around.  I mean, I couldn't eat both fries AND the tower of onion rings!  Mmm, the onion rings were definitely yummy.  And my favorite part of the meal?  The raspberry shake!  Get it!!  RJ Grunts has so many shake flavors to choose from, but I think I'll keep getting raspberry until I have a lactard moment and realize I shouldn't have shakes at all.As silly as the decor is, I think the space is comfortable when it's not *too* crowded and loud.  It's a fun place to hang with friends, especially if all of you are skilled at singing along with the oldies soundtrack.  Good friends, fun music, great onion rings and a sick raspberry shake a tasty meal make.  Say that three times fast."
"The salad bar is overrated. Pricey too, at least during dinner time (~$11). Despite that knock, I am glad it exists as it's a much healthier option than most restaurants nowadays. You can choose from iceburg lettuce, mixed baby greens and another type of green (romaine possibly? I can't remember). There is also hype around their cream cheese & chocolate chip dip concoction. It is tasty and probably the most original part of the salad bar. There are also various fruits like pineapple, apples, melons, grapefruit, etc. The ranch dressing I put on my plate didn't taste much like anything. I'm more impressed with the salad bar at Fogo De Chao. My dining buddies had the burger that is supposed to be very good as well. They both liked it although it wasn't anything spectacular. They both did not like the chips that are included. They are thinly sliced fried potatoes. It doesn't seem like there is much salt on them if any. The milkshakes are very good and will cost you around $4. We tried the coffee, strawberry and raspberry milkshakes. You can even combine flavors from the list. Very close quarters in this place. Your elbows and chairs will get bumped constantly. Parking blows in this neighborhood as well."
"Love RJ grunts.. I had gone here many times when I lived in LP and had their burger and soups, and salad bar.. all of them to die for!! The best part though is the butternut squash soup that is served seasonally. So I went there only for the soup!! They did not serve it! I could not believe it!! so the waitress went and got the manager who said to go back there in a few hours and that he would arrange something about it.. so of course I went back!! I wanted the damn soup... I asked the hostess for the manager and I waited 5-10 mins and I got 2 bowls of yummy, delicious soup!! FOR FREE!! I could not believe it.. that's good management for you.. restaurant owners take note:)  I wish they were located closer to me..."
"First let me thank yelpers Amanda W. and Rob L. for suggesting this restaurant. I really enjoy the quirkyness that is RJ Grunts. It's a pretty funny place. I do, however, feel that it's way too cramped in there. I was luck y when I went because I got one of the two seater booths which are off to the side. The bad part was the fact that it was right by the kitchen so there was a constant flow of traffic which was kind of annoying. The food was pretty good. I actually had a difficult time deciding what to order because everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the pattymelt with chips and a lemonade. Everything was really good! The server was pretty nice too except she kept referring to us as ""girls"" You know saying stuff like, ""You girls doing okay?"" Yuck. I'm more than positive that I was older than her. There was no wait which was especially nice for a saturday early evening. I would definitely like to try this place again. The menu was very enticing...in fact I already have some ideas of what I'm going to order.Oh and by the way I did take a peek at the infamous salad bar. Eh. There were no eggs. A salad bar with no eggs? boo."
My favorite place in Chicago thus far. AWESOME
"RJ's is like an indie Applebees meets Cheeseburgers in Paradise. The place has charm, but the food wasn't anything spectacular. The salad bar looked most excellent, but who wants to pay $10.95 for a salad? Not me, sorry. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to be entertained at dinner, but I think it's more of a one time thing rather than becoming a regular staple in my life."
"The salad bar was pretty nice, but I've had better salads and for the same price you can have it made for you.  The cream cheese dish was extremely rich but worth trying at least once.  The poppy seed dressing was the best I've had so far.  The burgers are huge too.  Literally can fill up two people."
"I have been going to RJ Grunts for 30+ years and eat there as often as I can.  The range of food satisfies everybody from vegetarians to meat eaters and the salad bar is to die for!  The location is superb, valet parking is available and the wall hangings are legendary.  Ron, the manager of the Mothership makes you feel very welcome....It is a flashback to the 70's, it is exactly the way I remember it.  Come here to experience the legendary Lettuce flagship and stay for the food, music and good service.  Peace, love and soul!"
"Grunts was a Chicago staple for me and my family in the '80s, so this review is tempered with nostalgia.  I've only been there two or three times in the last 10 years, but it still brings back memories, even if they have eliminated a few favorites from the menu (remember Indian fry bread sandwiches?).My girlfriend and I went last Sunday before a trip to the zoo. Parking is usually a nightmare (when the place was threatening to close the first time, part of the reason was they felt the lack of parking was hurting business), and we expected a wait, but we found a spot right away and were seated within two minutes.The place hadn't changed, right down to the trippy concert poster int he men's room. The menu was a little different, however -- I used to always come here for a burger, but my vegetarian girlfriend and my own increasing moral qualms about eating flesh prompted me to get the veggie burger, which I don't think they had last time. I got it made like a Grunt Burger, with fried onions and bleu cheese -- a good combo. Sadly, they no longer serve the Gourmet Burger, which featured a mushroom wine reduction sauce that I loved.The girlfriend got a portabello sandwich, which oddly tasted like a Whopper (a good thing). I like the homemade chips, but the portion of cole slaw is ludicrously small.  Chocolate malt for dessert, of course -- one easily feeds two. Oh, and we each had the temperature soup. Can't beat it for .52!Overall, it's probably nothing too special if you aren't going there to bask in childhood memories, but the food is good enough and the prices are decent -- our meal, soup, and malt came to less than $25."
"I really really really like this restaurant.  I only gave it four stars because of a few minor issues.  One is size, it can be very cramped inside here.  Another has to do with the up charge for getting chicken or any sort of meat for your salad from the salad bar.  It is the only salad bar that I know of that does that.  While I am sure there are others, it definitely does not seem to be the standard.  The food is always top notch, and the salad bar is always fresh."
"Despite RJ Grunts being a Chicago legend, I'd never been here until this past weekend, and now I can safely say that I haven't been missing anything.  It's average.  Very, very average.  The food?  Average.  The salad bar?  Average.  The atmosphere?  Average.  The menu is fun, in a 70s kitsch sort of way, and our server was very polite and prompt.As for the chocolate chips in cream cheese that everyone was raving about, it tasted exactly like...chocolate chips in cream cheese.  It was not the ethereal experience I was hoping for.Both my husband and I felt a little unwell after eating here.  Not sick to our stomachs but just...blah.  We both had the Buffalo Nachos and the Cookie Bowl, so maybe it was one of those things.If I'm in the neighborhood and I'm with someone who's craving a burger, I'd try RJ Grunts again."
I've been to RJ Grunts off & on through out the years.  You can always count on having a decent meal.  Their burgers are pretty good & it is priced fairly.  I've never been there when it's not crowded & the service can be slow.
"The drink menu attracted us to go inside.  It's a mix of family place (like an upscale Sizzler) and a sports bar...sounds weird, I know.  It must be popular because it was packed.We were taken to the booth near the back...so we walked by the famous salad bar and it did look good and very tempting.It was snack time so we got the chili (just ok) and the extra spicy buffalo wings (raw slices of jalapeno pepper sprinkled on top of the wings - huh???).  The root beer float (black cow) was pretty good, as was my cold one.The best part about the place was the music - it was rocking with some 70's music!The worst part is one tiny little stall for a restaurant that size."
"Solid burgers....ok for kids, salad bar looks pretty darn good, but haven't done it yet."
"All I can say is try the Peppercorn Burger.  Their milkshakes are great as well.Best hamburger in Chicago, in my experience (from about 30 or so popular burger joints)Great location as well...."
Best salad bar in the city hands down! Parking sucks but they do have valet!
"Had lunch at Grunts today with my mom. Been here many times over the years as it always has been a special place for my family and I. It's a great place to go right after you go to the zoo or are just in the neighborhood. They hands down have the best milkshakes in the city and are one of the few places that actually listen when you tell them to make it ""thick""! (chocolate peanut butter shake today).  I had the regular cheeseburger (cheddar) which was excellent and my mom had the mushroom cheese burger which of course she couldn't finish (but brought home). If your in neighborhood, check out Grunts."
"I am a huge fan of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, so I was excited to try this place. . It is pretty quaint and modest, so I felt comfy right away...which was good since I was on a hot date with Jo W.   I ordered a cheese burger, and although it was quite pleasant, it wasn't too memorable.  I was pretty disappointed in the soggy, warm chips they served instead of fries.  The service was on par, but nothing amazing.  The manager, however, was great.  He made sure to make a table visit, and even got me a fresh beer.  Overall, my experience was A-OK...I shall return."
"Holy Moly!!I love a place where my caricature is on the menu!!  (wink wink--Hi RJ!!)  RJ Grunts is one of my fall-back restaurants when I don't know where else to go.  Here's why:1. decent salad bar that takes you back to salad bar's roots (pun!)  It's not the salad bar you'll find at Fogo de Chao, but it's seriously good. (be sure to try the weird cream cheese & chocolate chip dessert thingy--soooo good. and I love the tuna salad--but don't mix the 2 together--yucky!)2. great wings--the extra hot are really spicy3. temperature soup! (cost of the soup is the temperature of the lake--a great deal these days!)4. yummy burgers5. fun drinks6. milk shakes7. Rockin' 70s tunesMy main con to this place is how crowded the tables are, and the small bar area."
"My mom and I went here for lunch our first day in the city. RJ Grunts is conveniently located right near the LP Zoo and Conservatory. We immediately loved the charm, it is small but gives a feel from the 70s. The two of us split a chicken sandwich and both got the salad bar. The salad bar was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of soup, but I loved the creamed tomato one. It seems they have 2 soups a day, which varies. The salad bar had many options, including some nice fruit and sweet cream cheese to finish off the meal. Our sandwich was also good, although we were full from the salad bar. The cottage fries were really a mix of kettle chips and potatoes. The staff was very attentive and friendly, offering advice on what to do/see while in Chicago. Overall, a great place to get a taste of local Chicago restaurants. Definitely recommend for lunch!"
"This place has AMAZING ribs!!! They literally fall off the bone and have a wonderful flavor.  They are not too saucy either.  We recently had a big dinner there with all the family who were in town for my brother's wedding and everybody found something they loved, from the kids to the grandparents.  I would defiantly recommend this place.  I'll be visiting again"
"after an afternoon of riding my bike, laying out by the lake, what I wanted more than anything was a big hefty salad... and what better place than RJ Grunts.. They have the best salad bar combo that is to die for.  It's a great restaurant with casual atmosphere and always a good time.BTW if you love chicken wings... try them.. i'd vouch for them."
"In Chicago, this is the place for burgers.  Just make sure you come hungry.  The chicken wings are to die for.  Never quite made it to the salad bar but it looks fantastic."
"I agree that the place is very 70s cheesy with the decor and the music.  What bothered me the most was how crowded the seating was, really hard to get up and out of tables for trips to the infamous salad bar.  I had the salad bar with the california wrap - grilled instead of fried chicken. Salad bar was nothing amazing to me.  I could make myself a better salad at whole foods.  But it was close and did the trick for a healthier dinner than the pizza I was contemplating.  The cream of mushroom soup tasted greasy so I only had a few bites.  I did get filled up on fruit and veggies (fruit is mostly melons, some berries, and pineapple).  I did enjoy that they made brussel sprouts in a form I found edible.  California wrap was standard chicken, avocado, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, some flying lizard ranch (standard ranch, nothing flying or lizardy about this one).  It reheated well the next day.  The homemade chips were decent.  For a $20 meal I wouldn't bother coming back.  I know they are known for their burgers and shakes so perhaps I would have walked away with a better taste in my mouth if I had gone down the less healthy road.  Waitress was nice, but I rarely saw her.  I filled my own refills from the water pitcher on the table, busser ran out my food.  I had to ask for a box though I was sitting there for a while clearly done with my main meal untouched.  Then she brings a box for the food and I needed to ask for a bag for it.  Small details.  I wouldn't suggest this place for groups.  Lots of kids, probably due to close proximity to the zoo."
"The original Lettuce Entertain You eatery, RJ Grunts serves up fantastic grub in a pleasant, fun enviroment.  The decor is warm, with random pictures and photo realistic paintings covering the walls and dark wood tables being highlighted by soft yellow light.  The food is very American, anchoring the menu is their burgers and salad bar (they claim to be the first to ever put in a salad bar) with a wide assortment of other offerings for every taste.  Besides the wonderful food (burgers cooked to order, amazing cole slaw and cottage fries), the drinks are great.  Be sure to order one of their malts, they are incredibly good, well sized, and offered in a variety of flavors.Bottom line, this is a great place to eat lunch or dinner after a day in Lincoln Park, either at the beach, the zoo, or just walking around.  Go with frriends, family, or whoever."
"R.J. Grunts, as the first Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, is an icon.  (if you don't know the company, it is 99% likely you have been to one of their restaurants.)  it started in the 70's and the place looks like it.  wood tables and booths that are all carved up, totally 70's menus and pictures on the wall ... i can't add much to the other reviews - yes the salad bar is awesome, but beyond what you'd think of a salad bar since a lot of the items are not healthy at all.  it is good though!  they have excellent burgers, chicken sandwiches, and specialty sandwiches.  if you have parents or others who are visiting from out of town, this place is great since it is kind of kitschy/nostalgic while not being cutesy,  the food is good, and the location (next to Lincoln park and Lincoln park zoo) is great.  i wouldn't  really go here with my in-town friends, though."
"I've lived in LP for 3 years and I've driven past RJ's for that long also. Never been, always wanted. Today was the day...dropped in for lunch and found the place was bustling and full of energy which was a pleasant surprise. A little pocket of good food and good service. Wish I would have dropped in sooner but will definitely be heading back...soon!"
"I want to love RJ Grunts. I used to love RJ Grunts. But I used to be 18 years old.My problem with Grunts is that I have memories of what it used to be, and while it's fine for what it is, it's not what it was. Huh? The salad bar used to be something special, but now it's more pedestrian. Fewer prepared salads, more of the same fixings you'd find at any salad bar. One of the things that made this salad bar famous was the fact that, when the restaurant opened, it was the only salad bar in town. Now it's fine, but nothing special.The menu used to be more varied as well. I had a friend who came here regularly for the fried chicken. I was a fan of the cheezy chicken (chix breast and fettuccine in a cheesy cream sauce -- yum). Both are gone, along with the rest of the entrees. Now Grunts serves ""bar food"" -- burgers, club-type sandwiches, a lot of chicken sandwiches, nachos and wings. Which is fine if you're in the mood for that sort of thing, but I'm rarely in the mood for that sort of thing.When I go to Grunts, I order the onion soup, the Gruntburger, and a peanut butter chocolate shake. This is indeed a meal worth the trip. Grunts' onion soup continues to be some of the best in the city. The Gruntburger is a big-ass burger with fried onions and blue cheese. And the shakes are terrific.A bit of trivia: Grunts was the first restaurant in the Lettuce Entertain You chain, before there was a Lettuce Entertain You chain. A few years back (late 90s), Lettuce decided to close Grunts -- as they've closed a number of their early restaurants -- because it was losing money. When word got out, tons of old regulars came out of the woodwork and raised a hue and cry about the decision. Rich Melman -- Mr. Lettuce -- decided to keep the place open, and started putting in hours at Grunts himself to turn the place around. (I imagine this is when many of my old favorites bit the dust.) This is the sort of thing that warms my crusty old cockles, and makes me want Grunts to succeed, even if it's not ""my place"" any more."
"I thought RJ Grunts was a fine meal.  It wasn't anything to sing about in the streets, but it was fine.  The atmosphere is what you go to RJ Grunts for.  The original Lettuce Entertain You locale, it has a certain pizazz that you can't put your finger on.  Part high class establishment, part dive bar you went to in college.  I couldn't pinpoint what I liked about RJ Grunts.I ordered one of their burgers b/c that's what everyone raves about.  I wasn't all that impressed.  I've had better burgers.  But it wasn't so bad that I would've sent it back.  The GF loved her meal.  She ordered whatever the special of the day was.  This particular day it happened to be a chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  She loved it.  I remember eating some of hers and thinking that it reminded me of Grandma's house.As brought to my attention (I had forgotten), we did enjoy the cookie skillet dessert.  This was a little piece of heaven. Definitely grab one of these on your visit!"
"Food was pretty tasty, but I was disappointed with the service.  Granted, I went on a Friday, but when your waiter disappears and you assume he went on break that's not a good sign.They have a big salad bar, which seems to be popular and their claim to fame.  The waiter made the assertion that they ""invented"" the salad bar, which sounds ridiculous to me.  A lot of customers took advantage, but I was not among them (salad bars don't seem entirely sanitary to me.)A bonus for me is that this place is literally a block away from me.  Considering the big convenience points, I might go back, but for others I wouldn't go out of my way.  Good sandwiches and burgers."
"We came here late on a Thursday and sat right down.  We started of the dinner with their buffalo Nachos... pretty boring looking but damn tasey and just takes a little work to get it all mixed up right.  I order a Peanut Butter/Chocolate malt also tasty maybe a little heavy on the peanut butter side.  For dinner I got the Hickory BBQ Bacon Burger.  Huge, but NOT good.  The meat tasted like it was a frozen patty that had thawed and was mushy.  The BBQ Sauce was mild and boring, the bacon not freshly cook and dry.  My girlfriend had the salad bar, it wasn't bad.  I'm not sure either why people rave about it, it's definitely not your traditional salad bar, it has more unique choices which I appreciated but still not impressive.For dessert we did get they're special cookie and ice treat.  It was very delicious but it was too much after we had gotten so much food already."
"asked for the gluten free menu, the waitress was so helpful, she went through everything i could have on the menu. ended up getn the works burger with gluten free bun. it was fab! have to say i really enjoyed the meal and the staff were lovely. would def go back"
"I'm not here to bash Grunts, but I don't get what all the fuss is about. I agree with the reviewers have said that his place is just average. It's fairly priced and the food is decent, but I would not say to go out of your way to try Grunts. The famous salad bar is definitely smaller than I expected and underwhelming. However, I will praise the milkshakes and desserts - they're fantastic and endulgent.I also agree with other reviewers that the restaurant is too cramped. About 5-6 of the 20 or so tables need to be removed to make this place comfortable."
"I think this place is nice. I mean, yeah, there are usually children here and the place can be crowded and it is, as one yelper put it, kitschy, but it's not a bad place for reasonable food, a decent salad bar and I happen to think the kitschyness is kinda cute. It's an upbeat kinda place with a coziness to it. The lights are dimmed and there are old pictures everywhere. They play classic rock usually and a mix of 80s. I liked it. The first time I went was with my boyfriend. It was an afternoon and I was hungover. I mean, death hungover. I got a burger and a coke. I think the coke was really what had the magical healing powers (being loaded with sugar - I was probably in desperate need of sugar as I pretty much expelled all of my stomach contents the night before) but that burger! I couldn't handle the cheese so I just kinda scraped it off, but delish! I chowed down about half of it. That was as much as a girl can handle. There chip/fries are yummy too. I like to dip 'em in ketchup. The 2nd time I went I got the Thanksgiving on a bun. Turkey, mashed potato (I think), stuffing a tiny bit of cranberry sauce and gravey. Oh my oh my. How I wish I could have that thing everyday. I don't think Thanksgiving on a bun is always available, and now that it's nearly Christmas it's probably gone, but definately worth going to Grunt's for.Anyway (geez this is long) there always seems to be a wait. Tons of people waiting for this place. My boyfriend and I have happened to go twice and there was no wait, so if there's no wait and you're hungry, and around the area you should give this place a chance."
"YUM YUM YUM. I love the food and atmosphere of RJ Grunts. They are know for their salad bar - the 1st salad bar in Chicago and it's delicious! I've eaten it many times and even got it to-go (they charge you less and give you a huge container). Everything is super fresh and my personal favorite is the chocolate chip whipped cream and it goes really well with the strawberries and pineapples.  Great appetizers - the Onion Ring Stack is a must - beer batter thick onion rings. The buffalo wings are really good too, Beware - if you ask for spicy, you're gonna get it. Your mouth will be on fire. :-)All the burgers are fantastic and you get a choice of fries or veggies. I personally like the veggies option. My favorite is the The Yowza! It's got spicy chipotle ketchup, pepperjack cheese & bacon. Super delicious. Dessert: try one of their hand-made shakes or my fav is the cookie bowl: huge chocolate chip cookie served with vanilla ice cream. Sounds plain, but it hits the spot. I promise!"
Not my first choice for a burger but good enough if you're near the Lincoln Zoo.
"I was definitely grunting after my trip to RJ Grunts last night.  I was SO FULL.  Something about an all you can eat salad bar makes me feel like I am in a professional eating contest.  I literally had to stop mid-plate and tell myself to SLOW DOWN because the salad bar wasn't going anywhere.The salad bar was good - not as much variety as I had hoped but high quality ingredients and good dressings made it a winner in my book.  I also ordered the French Onion Soup which was HUGE but really, really good.  The service was top notch and the decor very money.  I am going back (but I am not wearing a belt)."
"Great food! Great Atmosphere!  We love to go and get the salad bar and a burger.  Very family friendly place to dine, especially if your visiting the zoo across the street."
"Made my first trip to RJ Grunts last night.  My sandwich was tasty (just a classic BLT) and quite messy.  I enjoyed gawking at the salad bar (even if it isn't the kind of thing I would enjoy).  And the appetizer we tried, a cheese quesadilla, tasted good even if it wasn't anything to rave about.However, I am not the biggest fan of the atmosphere here.  It's crowded.  Loud.  Sure, fun to people watch.  But also a little annoying - I was forced to worry that the kid a foot or less behind me was going to spray my shirt with ketchup and chicken nugget (repeated banging of his dirty fork on his plate was just about ready to dislodge any food onto my back).  Sure, this was bad luck for seating placement.  But I can imagine it happens A LOT.And the water tasted bad.  I always drink water at restaurants...and here, not good.I would go back, I'd like to try a burger there.  But this is not going to be a ""go-to"" place for me."
"RJ Grunts does everything it needs to do to succeed:. Tourists are catered to nicely here. Cheese and bacon are slathered on nearly almost all options, so those without discriminating cholesterol results are happy. With that being said, it's just not my type of place. Most times I have visitors come to Chicago they always have a restaurant recommended by someone's first cousin's brother's friend who wants to say where we should go eat - as though I am not informed enough to make a decision. You can see how I ended up at RJ Grunts. I found it difficult to find some sort of healthy selection (I'm a germaphobe so you won't catch me within sneezing distance of a salad bar). Whether or not my fish tacos were ""healthy"" is to be determined, but they didn't make me feel all that guilty fortunately. I guess at this point I'm just talking to talk since it doesn't matter what I think - RJ Grunts was busy on a Sunday night; clearly they have no problem getting people in their revolving door."
"I can't say enough good things about this place!  Fun atmosphere, great service, FABULOUS food.  The menu was fun to read.  The salad bar was upscale.  The price is right.  The neighborhood is cool.  It's the complete package!On top of it all, our server happened to ask if it was our first time at the restaurant, and apparently when we said it was he went back and told one of the managers to hook us up.  When the manager came to deliver our check, he also brought us an ice cream sundae with a warm cookie and hot fudge sauce, on the house!  Words cannot describe how good that cookie was.  I heart RJ Grunts."
"I was really unimpressed.  For only serving burgers and other burger-type sandwiches, it was really expensive.  I got the salad bar and it was ok, but you had to pay extra to get meat in your salad and Ruby Tuesday's salad bar is 100 times better, not to mention cheaper.The inside of the place was straight out of the 70s.  I don't think they have redecorated since they first opened.  I really don't understand the appeal or why they are getting such high reviews.  I won't be returning to R.J. Unhhs anytime soon."
"I've gone to RJ Grunts quite a few times.  They have an AWESOME veggie burger...one of the best in the city.  I'm not a fan of their ""homemade chips"" and would prefer some fries (which they don't offer).  If they could get the side item right, I would probably go more often.  For now, I will go to Dunlay's on Clark."
"A Hamburger/Salad Bar combo doesn't get much better than this!  Since we live in the neighborhood, this is our I-don't-feel-like-cooking-or-dressing-up-to-go-­out-some-place-upscale-but-want-a-good-meal  restaurant.  I always order the salad bar and, about 90 percent of the time, a Works burger to accompany it.  On a message board next to the display of scrumptious vegetables, Grunt's informs its customers that many of the items have been purchased at Lincoln Park's Green City Market, of which I am a faithful customer.  The quantity and quality of the salad bar fixings puts most others to shame.   The typical composition of my Mount Vegetable includes mixed greens at the base, topped with corn, peas, shredded carrots, cucumbers, chickpeas,  tofu, grape/cherry tomatoes, thinly-sliced red onion, dried cranberries, balsamic vinaigrette and croutons.  At the base, I add two off my absolute favorite elements - the balsamic mushrooms (which they warn are not the psychedelic kind - debatable - they are really good!) and the marinated beets.  The salad bar also boasts a variety of in-season fruits, and many other salad fixings such as black olives and edamame.You may also partake of two varieties of soup if you are so inclined.Since I am kind of a health nut, I reserve my hamburger indulgences for Grunts.  They have a wide variety of burger with different fixings, but I typically always order a Works burger which comes with lettuce, tomato, red onion, cheese and mayo (I sub mustard for the mayo).  While I sometimes find it annoying the the bottom half of the bun gets a little soggy, my annoyance is short-lived as the sogginess simply provides even more physical evidence of the wonderful juiciness of these burgers.  (The fact that I'm a ketchup nut probably doesn't help keep the bun safe from moisture!)  The homemade chips (in the American sense, not the British one) are good - though I wish Grunt's still served fries.In addition to my usual salad/burger combo, I have had the tuna melt trio, the chili, and the ""scoop of tuna"" that one can add to a salad bar order for about 4-5 dollars.  My husband has branched out a little more, but neither one of us have had anything at Grunt's that we haven't enjoyed.The beer list is pretty decent.  The Robert the Bruce Scottish Ale and the Delerium Tremens are two of my personal faves.The atmosphere is pretty cool - it's kind of dark, the booths are wooden and have kind of a retro feel.  (I guess the whole restaurant has sort of a retro feel - apparently it has remained virtually unchanged since it opened.)  The passage of time is in part marked by the black-and-white photos of waitresses (past and present) that line the walls.In summary, I love this place.  It's a great option anytime you want a guaranteed quality meal and a jeans and t-shirt evening."
"I've been here a few times, and none of them were good experiences. I've been for brunch (not a good idea) and dinner. We had a lettuce entertain you gift card which is one of the reasons we went back. Every time we come here the wait is forever, the service is terrible and the food is ""meh"". And if you are super lucky to get seated right by the salad bar/brunch bar you will never ever want to eat from it. I people watch, and watching those people has grossed me out."
"I've always liked Lettuce Entertain You restaurants so when I finally made it here, I wasn't disappointed. The salad bar has a wide variety of things to choose from. That would have been totally enough for me, but we also split an entree, which was also good. While we were waiting to be seated the bartender concocted a really delicious drink for me too. My only complaint was the seating was a bit crowded and finding parking there is nearly impossible. Otherwise a great establishment."
Went there on Labor Day around 4 pm and there was 1/2 hour wait. I was determined to try the salad bar since many were raving about it. It was just A-OK. Grunts do not typically have extra clean plates at the salad bar so you have to ask your server each time for a clean plate. (I guess they need to earn their tip somehow) I think the salad bar at Ruby Tuesday's in Lincolnwood Town Center Mall is a better value and cheaper too.
i enjoyed this place and i will definitely be back again.
"A safe bet when you're starving and don't want to completely kill your diet- that salad bar (the original, according to their menu).  I am fully aware in my ""old"" age that I'm a gal with a hearty appetite.  Typically on visits to RJ's, usually after a long day out, or night, or one after a workout, I arrive sure that I won't miss the salad bar but feeling that I need something more like a sandwich, burger, etc. I'm always wrong and walk out with a large doggie bag of that ""something extra"". That salad bar is awesome! Loads of fresh veggies, balsamic mushrooms, fresh fruit (including berries), delish potato and tuna salads, a couple crowd pleasing soups and you're set. Not to take anything away from their sandwiches- hearty fare with several options on how you like your chicken cooked. Comes with homemade chips (I usually avoid but like theirs for done reason) but you can substitue for fries. Full bar, lots of beers to choose from as well as shakes and malts. That and I have to say I really dig ghe 70's chill vibe. Campy decor and one of the best music play lists. Try not to sing along with your mouth full!"
"Ehh. It may be the first lettuce entertain you restaurant, but is not the best tasting. pretty standard burgers, nothing special. dated salad bar with old boring choices. good milkshakes. love the temperature soup (i.e. if if its 20 degrees outside, the soup is 20 cents). standard bloody marys."
"Best burgers in the city in my opinion.  They have a huge selection of menu items, including several variations on your standard burger.  The food is fantastic, the burgers are cooked to order, and use real hamburger, no frozen patties or anything.I give it a 5 star even though they don't have fries, which is a minor disappointment for me, but the burgers are worth it.  They have Take out as well, but I don't live near enough to make it worth it.Decor is interesting as the walls are covered in pictures of current and former waitresses.  It can be a bit cramped actually, but I've never had that much issue with it actually."
"Well i ordered wrong when I went here. I got a chicken wrap and while it was fine, i was so bummed I didn't order the pork sandwich that my BF got. I hate when we order the same thing so i changed my mind ....and after taking one bite i immediately regretted it! The salad bar was cool, I didn't order it but it looks fun. We went there about 3 weeks ago and I'm still thinking about the pork sandwich. I guess that means I'll have to go back ...but probably on a night when its less packed -- the tables are so close together, so rather than feeling like i was sitting at a table of 2, i felt like it was a table of 8 and there were many strangers who were in my bubble."
"RJ Grunt's is a fantastic restaurant! I absolutely love their salad bar! Their sandwiches are fantastic - burgers are wonderful.You might think the salad bar is a bit pricey, by itself or as a meal. However, you really can go up as many times as you like, and the staff is really good about re-filling the items. The soups at the salad bar are fantastic. They have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, unmatched by any other salad bar I've ever had! In addition, this salad bar offers other salads (string bean, potato) and a few desserts. Enjoy and fill up!The wait can be very long, the bar and small restaurant can be very crowded, and parking (if you don't use valet) is sparse. However, if you take the Clark Street bus and/or go on an off-time (or make reservations!), you will be good to go!"
"It seems like lately I've been racking up a slew of bad reviews, thank goodness RJ Grunts will bring me out of my rut!  RJ Grunts is what TGI Friday's dreams about becoming, but simply could never be.  The burgers are divine, that goes with out saying.  What I'm in love with is the salad bar.  Yeah, it is a little pricey, but when you take into account all the pasta and potato salads, and fresh fruit, soups, and loads of different toppings for your salad its totally worth it!  I guarantee anyone can stuff themselves silly and be completely satisfied on that salad bar alone."
Let's address the salad bar. You are better off going to a Sweet Tomato. If you are only going for that don't bother.  The dinning room is a fire hazard way too cramped. I get the fact that it's a Chicago experience but it didn't meet expectations. The food was blah and parking sucks.
"I used to go to RJ Grunts on dates during high school in the 1970's. It's a little weird to walk into a place that has the EXACT same stuff on the wall that was there 30 years ago. The place is locked in time. (except one thing: I remember that they used to have a big bowl of black caviar in the salad bar. That's gone.) This is an ok place for a burger but most of the time it is crowded, and slow-staffed. The food is nothing big and the salad bar is ""So What?"" and the decor could use a good pressure washing. The location is a plus and the R. Crumb inspired art menu is a feature. I'd say the biggest thing RJ has going is nostalgia."
"Great service, tasty food, and a mighty nice Bloody Mary.  Our reservations through OpenTable were a life saver.  We walked into a packed Saturday brunch at 12 noon and were shown immediately to our seat despite a long line of others waiting to be sat.  The music is loud there but that proved to be nice because nobody could hear our children!"
"Mmm, buffalo chicken nachos or sandwich. Good stuff."
All I can say is that my friend Ellen waits tables there and a sweeter person God never made.
"Went here to try another LEY place in Chicago, since I love burgers and it was their first concept place.A Saturday night wait for 2 was 45 minutes, consistent with what other yelpers have reported. Started with the salad bar, since it's their other claim to fame. As others have mentioned, they have a few odd items on there (choc chip cream cheese, chicken liver spread etc) but nothing that really makes it stand out in my mind -- perhaps places like Sweet Tomatoes have spoiled me. That'd be okay, I was able to make a pretty convincing pre-dinner salad and I liked the lemon potato salad, but the price is too high for just okay. Went with a Gruntburger for my entree. Now, I love a cheesy burger and I love blue cheese with red meat (yum) but I didn't love this burger. There was a lot of blue cheese on it, and you couldn't taste much else (the flavor of the onion strings was completely drowned out). I usually try to avoid faulting places for my food preferences, but I don't think I ordered incorrectly, I think the execution was just poorly done. The burger was cooked exactly as ordered (medium rare) and the bun was a great fit, which means that there is some burger knowledge in the kitchen, which makes the overall outcome that much more disappointing.My girlfriend got the chicken wings. These had perhaps the best batter I've had on chicken wings in a while which gave each bite a nice crunch. Yet the wings were pretty small compared to what a good filling wing should be, so once again - good start but not enough."
"Love the onion ring tower, the salad bar, the music, and the blue cheese burger. Delicious."
Good service and great food is what we got at RJ Grunts.  My burger was the best I've had in Chicago next to Kuma's.
"Watch out for the salad bar!!  While it houses delicious food, the last time I went there, my date walked full on into the salad bar corner, which is covered with a golf ball.  It is just at forehead level and kind of creeps up on you when you walk around the corner.   Just walk slowly or you will end up with a golf ball sized (with indentations) bump on your forehead. (ask J)"
"Went to this place last night with friends, and none of us were very impressed.  Here is our list of grievances:1.  Has this place been redecorated (or cleaned) since the 70s?  While taking in the surroundings after we were seated, I noticed crayon scribbles on the stucco walls.  Nice.2.  Our waitress, although she was nice I guess, had no skills.   She took our order, delivered our food, and brought the bill.  Those are the only times we saw her.  Forget refills- that apparently was not an option.3.  I ordered buffalo chicken strips.  Absolutely disgusting.  Dis-gust-ing.  The homemade chips were good, but due to the fact that they piled my buffalo strips on top of them and poured their sucky buffalo sauce all over the entire plate, I couldn't enjoy many of the homemade chips that were below the chicken.  4.  Apparently they don't serve french fries anymore.  Who the hell doesn't serve french fries?  And, even better, when my friend asked the aforementioned waitress if we could order a side of fries, she informed us that they no longer serve fries, but she could ""totally bring a side of vegetables"".  What is she implying?  No french fries for you fat-ass, but I'll bring you some broccoli!5.  Tip:  If you order a water, ask for a normal sized glass.  Otherwise, you'll be drinking out of a glass that is so small it might as well be a sippy cup.Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I definitely don't see what all the fuss is about.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again."
"One of the best burgers we've ever had so far - the bread an the (medium well) patty almost melt in your mouth. The hot buffalo chicken wings were also well made. The highlight of the lunch were the chocolate and orange shakes. One piece of advice is that the portions were large - with 2 shakes, chicken wings and 2 burgers between the two of us, we were stuffed!! (not to mention we had to take half the burgers to go)"
"This place is pretty good with a good-sized menu and a lot of shakes.  Get there early because it gets packed quickly.  Oh, and try the Buffalo Chicken Nachos!  A glass of the Alpha King Pale Ale goes nicely with them."
"I have to admit I haven't dined here for at least 20 years!  We decided to walk over one chilly evening and nothing has changed.  It was very full with young families and there was food on the floor everywhere - but we managed to make our way to the salad bar and I enjoyed a thoroughly fresh and yummy soup & salad and split the chicken wrap with my husband.  Very, very tasty.  Not a place to go for a romantic dinner or to have a quiet conversation, but it is a good, solid place offering good value in a great neighborhood.  No wonder it has lasted all these years!"
Just went here with my girlfriend. We ordered a lot of food (we had a gift certificate) and it was all very good. Our waitress was named Christy (or Christie) and she was really nice. We'll be back.
Damn you RJ Grunts and your infectious disco muzak!! It's been almost two months and I still can't get the SOS Band out of my head....
Always the very best hamburger and great onion soup.  Nice salad bar too.  Help is always great......
"Pros:  Cozy neighborhood burger tavern.  Been there since the early 70s.  Fair beer selection, decent burgers.Cons: Someone said in their review that the walls need a good pressure washing. Right on!  The decor has been the same since the 70s and you leave smelling like stale, fried grease. Ugh.  The burgers, which they claim as a specialty, are decent but not great.  Just a fair place and a nice one to duck into in the neighborhood."
"My friend suggested RJ Grunts because she heard great things about the salad bar and she had a coupon...so when in doubt go to the place with a coupon. We were seated right away (7ish on a Monday).  Our waitress was cute and perky. We both decided on the salad bar. Pretty yummy. Everything was fresh, especially the fruit. The one negative with the salad bar is that it was difficult to reach the items in the back. My dining companion had to stick her head underneath the little glass thingie, which we decided could not possibly be sanitary. Anyway, I'll have to update when I get something other than the salad bar. Overall it's a solid restaurant with a good salad bar and quirky menus. I'll leave the 4th (possibly 5th?) star for when I eat something other than the salad bar."
"Went here tonight after seeing many good reviews and a few not so good reviews on here....decided to try it anyway! We didn't have a reservation but got seated in about 10 minutes....good start. We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos for an appetizer and I looooooved them. The buffalo sauce wasn't too spicy, but still had a lot of flavor and their ranch dressing is amazing. I got the Gruntburger (onion strings and blue cheese) and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the Yowzaburger (pepper jack cheese, lettuce, bacon, and spicy ketchup) and said it wasn't as spicy as he thought it was going to be, but the flavor was still good. The cottage fries (which are like homemade potato chips) were great! No ketchup needed :) We asked about the free ice cream and cookie for your first visit after reading a review on here about it and they were more than willing to include us on the deal! It was a delicious cookie with ice cream and hot fudge....can't go wrong with that! The only downside was the screaming kids at the tables surrounding....but overall a great meal and we are planning on taking any visiting friends there!"
"This is just a standard place; nothing special but nothing bad either. I am not sure what people are saying that this is the best salad bar in the city - its a basic salad bar with a couple more items.  I mean, put some lettuce on a plate with some cheese and croutons and cover it in ranch.  That's good - but nearly every other salad bar offers the same thing.  The cookie ice cream dessert thing is pretty solid though."
"The food is satisfying and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere fun and inviting.  The main reason I'm writing a review in the first place, however, is to spread the word about cookie in a bowl.  Pure genius!  I can't believe I didn't invent it myself.  And the cookie is warm, ever so warm, inside the ice cream.  Even non-sweet-toothed friends have sung the dessert's praises many times over.  So go forth in good cheer ye dessert hunter.  Eat your sandwich or wrap and enjoy.  Then order cookie in a bowl and be raptured, or at least really, really happy in a deliciously superficial way."
"What struck me most about RJ Grunts was the high rating it has on yelp when it's nothing more than a marginally nicer Chilis. Do people in Lincoln Park have poor taste? I don't know.You're basically going to get greasy bar food. Your meal can easily serve two to three people. Yes, this is why Chicagoans are fat. The Buffalo ""Turbo"" Nachos were good. The one redeeming point was the restaurant's soundtrack--lots of feel good oldies favorites."
"one time i drove by RJ's with a car full of softball team members and i exclaimed ""i have never been to RJ Grunts actually."" everyone was so confused. what? a chicago staple...that i have never even tried...this is not a staple in my book. the food was worse and greasier than Max & Erma's (in Michigan or Ohio), family style, dirty plates, glasses and bowls and a really nasty salad bar. i was actually excited about the salad bar and then i walked up and was scared - thank god their were chic peas...but everything else, including some white jello mold from the 70s scared the crap out of me! it didn't look clean and i wasn't coming back for seconds. the grilled cheese i ordered was so greasy, my hung-over ass couldn't even stomach the whole thing. the one + about the food was the homemade chips or fries they give you with your sandwiches and burgers, those were bomb. apparently the burgers are suppose to be good, but i didn't hear a rave review from my bud who ordered a turkey one.dirty, too greasy and just not my thang...sorry RJ...grunt, grunt...ahhh"
"My fiance had a gift card to a lettuce entertain you restaurant, so we decided to try RJ Grunts because of its laid back atmosphere. We really enjoyed it. I tried the salad bar and I'm so glad I did. The soup they had that day was Cheddar Beer soup and it was sooo cheesy and yummy. I went up for 2nds and 3rds ( I was also letting my fiance eat it too, oops!) The waitress was so nice and knew it was our first time there so she gave us a complimentary cookie and ice cream dessert. It was SO delicious. It is a warm gooey chocolate chip cookie that is warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with hot fudge. I am salivating as I write this. Needless to say, we've been back and we always splurge and get the cookie!!"
