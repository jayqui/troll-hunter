Five Star Bar
"This is by far my favorite local bar. They have an ever changing beer selection including 3 floyds gumball head! The have a Monday night slider special that you can't beat. The staff is friendly and fun and the rocker vibe is great. My boyfriend loves the hot chicken wings and fish tacos, I love the kitchen sink salad (with friend chickpeas) and they're orzo Mac and cheese. If you're looking for a fun place to have a good meal and a few beers, this is the best place in Noble Square."
"Best..wings..ever! Now at 50cents a pop on Wednesdays, they're still worth it. I love em because they remain crunchy even after they're tossed in the buffalo sauce, not that microwaved soggy crap. The place itself seems to have died down crowd wise over the years, I guess the craze is over. Still a good spot to catch a game & grab a bite."
Wait staff awesome - food DISGUSTING! Come here for drinks; if you're hungry go anywhere else for food.
"My fault, should have updated this review to 10 stars a long time ago!  This is the place to go for the best turkey burgers in Chicago.  I actually dream about the turkey burger.  And it's dog-friendly too!  Our great dane loves hanging out on the patio.  Friendly wait staff, very accommodating and helpful.  We go here quite a bit, since we don't keep food in the house.  So yummy--- could eat here every day!"
"Not as crowded as it used to be. The wings are now $.50 on Wednesday. They do have craft beer on draft and the domestics in cans as well. The order came pretty quickly because they weren't busy. I still felt like the server was trying to kick us out of our table though as the night progressed. Oh well, I'll still be back to munch on some wangs!!!"
"It was a gorgeous day perfect for outdoor eating and trying a new spot, and Five Star Bar was the lucky winner for my Saturday lunch. I wanted to sit in the sun, but my boyfriend and I compromised on a table inside right next to outside. The doors were all open so it felt like we were eating in a covered outside eating area. Our table was also conveniently located to the all the chalkboard menus listing all the Specials. My eyes gravitated to the Frozen Mule and the Open Faced Pork Belly BLT. I had been debating on Moscow Mules and Vodka Gimlets and typically choose the latter and kept telling myself that the next time I'd get a Mule and this was the perfect treat in a frozen cocktail version, nonetheless! The buffalo wings were the standard and pretty good. I like mine a bit spicier, but maybe I can request that next time. The Pork Belly BLT was unique and it was tasty but I have mixed feelings on this as I wasn't sure if they gave me a bundle of their Romaine lettuce by mistake. I almost thought that they just forgot to break a few stalks off. I just accepted as it was. I was tempted to go to the back area just to see check out the stripper pole that was mentioned by other reviews and take a spin on it for shits and giggles, but then shot that idea down as I didn't want to get judged for it. I probably would also need quite a bit more liquid courage before I got to that point. What was extremely impressive to me was our waitress. I think she was the only one and had such a positive attitude and she was so on top of everything. The drinks got refilled and she gave me a head's up when the machine for my frozen drink would take a few minutes. As busy as she was she checked up on us and was super sweet. Prices are reasonable. What a great neighborhood bar."
One of the best burgers around! Great neighborhood bar with outdoor seating and pool table. Daily specials and $7 burgers on Sundays!
"This is what a bar should be.  Good draught beer selection.  Fantastic burgers and great daily specials.  Rail whiskey is Old Crow, a delicious bourbon than isn't easy to find in Chicago. Neighborhood vibes and beautiful bartenders, what more could ask for?"
"Great neighborhood bourbon bar with a diverse menu. And it totally made me laugh that they carded me, but the server said they card everyone. Darn.I had a lovely old fashioned and a veggie burger. And both were really tasty. The table shared the curry poutine fries (and I of course immediately texted Canadian Jennifer to tell her). My friends had the French dip, the panzanella salad (after lamenting the removal of the amazing veggie chili) and the a special steak dish. Everyone liked their food...except for salad which was kind of boring.Our server was great and the atmosphere is inviting. Plus TVs if you need to watch sports etc. And my old fashioned was only $9."
"5 Star Bar, 5 star review and 5 year GiGi!!  Excellent and perky was Gi Gi - service was A1.  Can't beat $2.50 Lone Stars sitting in the sun and those $1.50 gringolandia tacos that remind me of Jack in the Box. Just the right amount of grease and crunch.  I'll be going back from some more...Groovy curved bar - but I like being outside after this winter."
This bar is literally down the street from me. The drinks are good and fairly priced. Their daily specials are pretty good. I like the vibe of the bar being a mix between a hole in the wall and a classier bar. The food is decent but nothing go back for. But because of its location I'll be there again.
I come here at least once a week. The food is good (for bar food) and I love the tacos on Tuesday and Thursdays. The music is always on point. It's a great place to watch a game or meet for happy hour. Service can vary as there does seem to be a high turnover with servers- some are awesome and and some are not so great.
"One of my favorite spots in Chicago! Hate that wing night has gotten so pricy but hell they are worth it at full price (best in the city and I know my wings, ask for them well done ) so why not just go on Sundays and get the deal on the burger instead?! The beer-mosa, GREAT music and very friendly tatted staff make my end to the weekend so much easier to deal with. Did I mention the yummy pulled pork nachos that can feed a small army....."
"Went in Sunday 9/17Sat at the bar and there was such a strange odor, it honestly was difficult to eat and drink,  I guess they had free iced margaritas looked like a group was there for that,  legit kids running around the bar. It was ok"
"Came here with friends after a climbing session to grab a bite to eat. A very solid establishment with a large beer selection, tasty appetizers and entrees all normally priced for this area of Chicago. It's casual, it's open late, it's average-to-loud noise level with TVs throughout, and their food is pretty good. When I was there, their decor included naked barbie dolls hanging by strings off the lamps above. Edgy, but a little weird. I think the place would have been just good without.I liked their poutine fries - but it's a strong, soft cheese - so if that's not your thing, pick something else. That's down my alley so I liked it, but some of the others that tried it - not so much. I'm not normally in this neighborhood so I generally wouldn't frequent this place, but if it was suggested again, I'd be down to go back. Their beer selection is solid."
"I went to Five Star on Saturday night with friends and was pretty surprised they had 5 Rabbit's 5 Lizard on draft and for just $6 for a glass. I saw this as a great deal and drank a couple. My friends had never had anything from 5 Rabbit before so I explained a bit about the brewery to them and I think they appreciated it a bit more. :) 5 Rabbit is my absolute favorite brewery in the whole wide world.Five Star has a pretty good mix of craft brews and domestic usuals.I've been to Five Star a few times before and always enjoyed the chill atmosphere however never have been big on their super loud music choices. It's still a pretty fair mix of hipsters, bros, yuppies, etc. Our server was great and we had a lovely time guzzling down brews."
"Super rad joint. Definitely a neighborhood spot, but they certainly welcomed my n00b ass into the mix. The fried pickles were homemade and on point (with the normal pinkish hot mayo dipping sauce, but on the hotter side) and the brand new vegetarian poutine was unlike any poutine I've had in Canada. But that's ok because it was still delicious with it's smokey BBQ fake meat and dense cheese.I will definitely come back. Not only for the great food, but for the fantastic beer selection and service!"
"Good food and good drinks. Usually they play good music and always have the game on. Love coming here in the summer on my motorcycle - there's always bike parking (that you can see from the bar), which is nice to make sure some skinny jeans wearing, overly emotional hipster jackass doesn't sit on your bike and have his picture taken to upload to instagram."
"Five Star used to be 5 stars in my book. Awesome music, great service, amazing food. My husband and I used to go here at least once a week for food and drinks, but rarely go anymore at all. What has changed is the once kick ass menu has been drastically altered, and many of our old favorites are long gone with nothing intriguing in their place. No more samurai or mushroom swiss burgers, no more shrimp po boy. The once fantastic chopped salad has been replaced by the lame kitchen sink salad, an imposter that is impossible to eat without a knife as it's basically a bunch of whole lettuce leaves and a grilled, never cut all the way through chicken breast. Not sure what prompted the menu change, but needless to say it was a bad move! Please bring back the good stuff so we actually want to come back to our old fave neighborhood spot!"
Hands down the best wings in west town. Chill Vibe. Good music. Streamlined menu. Creative brunch specials and creative bartenders.
"Edgy with a great and I do mean GREAT selection of spirits.  Did not have food only drinks, because we had a reservation somewhere else in the neighborhood but would definitely come back.'you've got to come with a group and get one of the booths in the back with the stripper pole!!!"
"Stopped in Five Star Bar while apartment hunting on a Sunday afternoon. The Yelp reviews were pretty good, and there were a lot of cute dogs sitting outside while their owners ate. I am a bit of a cute dog stalker and like to be as close to them as possible at all times. I walked in with a friend to a half-empty restaurant and none of the staff acknowledged us for what seemed like a few minutes. Two bartenders chatted in a corner while looking at us, a waitress walked back and forth in front of us, and a busboy made eye contact with me and kept walking. They were not busy and they definitely saw us, so I was definitely annoyed. I almost left. Then the waitress told us to seat ourselves. Oh, ok. It would've been pretty cool if someone had told us that when they first spotted us.Service remained pretty meh for the rest of the meal. Their menu is standard bar food, perhaps a bit elevated. I had a cocktail that they had on tap-- blood orange something. It was sour and refreshing on a hot day, but I wish they would've served it with a slice of blood orange instead of a regular one. It's the little things... we started with the chips, guacamole, and pico de gallo. The chips were just how I like them-- thin, crispy, warm, and salty. Mmmmm. The guac was great as well, with a lot of lime and big chunks of jalapeno. My friend and I both ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. This sandwich was huge! The chicken breast was legit-- huge, and clearly freshly deep fried and dredged. As a buffalo sauce connoisseur, I thought their buffalo sauce was average. It needed a lot more tang to stand up to the heftiness of the chicken.Overall, fine neighborhood place for bar eats and drinks."
"at times some of the best music, at times some of the worst."
"Chill, casual bar with great specials. No frills, leave your ego at the door-type place. Nothing spectacular about it, but also nothing all that awful about it either. I enjoy coming in for the hot chicken wing specials - I have yet to find a nearby special that awesome! The beer selection is pretty dope and they have tons and tons of booze available if that's your poison. Also, I appreciate that they are a ""rock bar"" and usually have solid tunes on in the background. Only knock I have is that all their whiskey prices are for a shot! If you were going to charge me $2 extra for neat or on the rocks, why didn't you inform me before you poured? Deceiving business practices = not cool, guys. Come for the beer and wings!"
"Second time here.  We followed our friends that were participating in the Chiditerod.  Crowded, loud, interesting decor (ex. color bust of Elvis' head), somewhat awful music choices at times (Sir Mix-A-Lot's ""Baby Got Back"" is lame, frat party fodder), good cocktails (Sazeracs and Old-Fashioneds especially), and lots of greasy, highly indulgent food options (poutine, pulled pork nachos, fried pickles, etc.).  Large bar spans the majority of the room, with seating around its perimeter.  Booths line the bar's walls, and high-top tables are interspersed along the windows that front Chicago Avenue.  I've been back and I'd come back."
Good specials and a lot of beer on tap. The service is more miss than hit. It's within walking distance of our place and the tacos are satisfying. The bathroom has nudie pics on the wall which is neat I guess.
"Great place to come for a casual bite to eat with cheap beers.  I think they have food and drink specials 5 days a week (Sun-Thur) and you can stretch out your nightly budget.The crowd is pretty neat -- bikers to hipsters, to your suits after work.  Food is above average for a bar and again, is decently priced.Come here if you want to hang and have less care for the rest of the night."
"Men's Bathroom art, semi private room w/ stripper pole, rock music, and  waitress/staff made for a great 1st experience. Even the bouncer was nice."
"Live right down the street and absolutely love this place. I was new to the block and didn't know where to go get some food so I walked in and immediately fell in love. Been here 5 times in the past month. Burgers are perfectly cooked, fried pickles are amazing, pulled pork nachos = yum. Best of all, service is great too. Perfect neighborhood joint."
"If you're in the neighborhood or want to try a new spot in the city, Five Star is a solid, casual spot to grab a unique cocktail on tap or a snack a la one of their yummy, late night satisfying grilled cheeses. They have ample indoor and some outdoor patio seating. Seems good for groups. If barhopping, Lush wine bar is not far away (though not open super late)."
"I live next to the bar and come here often. They have a great beer selection and the food is pretty good.  I guess just regular bar food, tasty and greasy, nothing too special."
Best wings in the city and the staff is great! Cool vibe too. Go on a Wednesday for cheap wings and $2.50 beer. Awesome midweek pick me up.
"it's nice that this place was open after we were done eating at Habana Libre close by, perfect spot to keep the night going after a great dinner, and this place had a good crowd, not that we were concerned since we were a party of about 20 ourselves haha.great music, good open space, strong drinks, good wings and other bar snacks. all around your average bar. except for the stripper pole in the back room. kudos, Five Star Bar. you can always tell the female patrons that frequent that place often cuz they absolutely flock to that damn stripper pole. and they're actually not too bad at it either which is nicer to see than a completely hammered girl with no rhythm whatsoever nearly kill herself ""woo""-ing and then quickly falling off it haha.-civilities."
"Good beer selection and pretty good food for a bar. They usually have a movie on and the atmosphere is loud, I'd recommended Five Star for a group."
"I'm here practically every Wednesday for the wings special. The wings are really good but what I love the most are the fried pickles, seriously the best fried pickles in town! Five star has quickly become one of my favorite places :)"
Food is good.  It's a hipsters paradise in there.  Beer selection is good.  Decor is awesome.
Wednesday night's wing special hit the spot with $2 Tecates. Hip hop and soul music on the speakers. Good vibes.
Everything on the menu is fantastic! Great place for bar burgers and drinks. Outdoor seating or indoors with the doors open is nice.
The food here isn't bad but it's not that great either. Certainly nothing to go out of your way for but since I live close I go here quite often when I want something other than tacos . The service here has always been pretty good. The stripper pole and naked picture in the bathroom are pretty tacky. This place is full of hipsters who I generally find annoying but maybe not as much as 'bros' . This place also fancies itself as a sort of biker bar....think Wild Hogs
"Not quite Five Stars but maybe Four Star Bar?My friend recently moved to the West Town/Noble Square area so we have hit this place up a couple of times.  Not as hipster as Wicker Park but it is within walking distance so you still get a little of that vibe.  It has an older feel to it with the art drawn pin up girls, old leather booths and a stripper pole in the back room.  I've only had the bud light here and a couple PBRs. The food we ordered once was the nacho appetizer and it was good.  Five Star is enough stars to start your night off but I wouldn't hang out here all night."
"It's my neighborhood bar and I take every chance I get to eat and drink there. Beer is great and if I am not mistaken, they had zombie dust at some point which is... just plain awesome! I usually get a burger but not afraid at all of anything on the menu because they know what they are doing back there."
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE; such a disappointment because it's walking distance from my buddy's place.Walked in there on Sunday night (one of very few places open on Memorial Sunday) with 2 friends at midnight and almost immediately the bartender gave my buddy attitude because he asked what beers were on the menu (""Really?!"" was her response and then tossed a drink menu his way).  After being there 90 min I ordered 10 Jameson/Bailey shots and 1 Vodka Redbull (my buddy got the 1st round with cash) and when I got the tab I saw I was charged for 2 VRBs, 10 Jameson shots, & 4 BAILEY SHOTS (who takes Bailey on their own) so I called her over and pointed it out to her. I thought I was pretty calm about it (wasn't upset about it YET) but she acted like I was yelling at her. She conferenced with her fellow bartender before taking the Bailey shots off (not the extra RBV), came back to me and put new bill in front of me and said, ""Really guys, really?!"" like I just pulled a fast one on HER?!?!I couldn't believe it, I was overcharged by $25 after being there 90 minutes and she was the one giving attitude? Wow, I felt so insulted I got up and walked out. I hope someone from management reads this and signs this woman up for a class in Customer Service.  I write honest reviews on Yelp but try to stay away from anything too negative, giving the places the benefit of the doubt that one negative experience might not be indicative of the establishment but this went way beyond what was called off.I won't ever be going back to this place.  Sorry for such negativity guys but hoping I can save someone else from this bartenders scorn that is obviously being deflected from some other event in her life."
Surprisingly good food. Duck Reuben is off the chain! Hope they keep that on the menu.
"Been here for the food and not the bar scene. My husband loves the wings. First visit we ordered carry-out. They were awesome. Returned and sat outdoors. Ordered a margarita that I didn't love. Resorted to a beer. But once again, the wings were amazing."
"Friday is pop punk night! This place is pretty decent. We always go with a large group of friends, so we normally have a good time. I've never eaten here, but the drinks are pretty much the same as any other bar. I come to Five Star for the atmosphere and the music. Pretty neat hipster hangout."
"Five Star is an interesting bar. There is this 'Rock Hollywood' vibe going on there that makes me want a shot whenever I arrive. From 6-10 it's outside seating and kind of bar-loungy... then, all of a sudden you look around and its a big ol' mingly singles date spot. Great music and quick service to top it off. Mon - $1 BurgersTues - $1.50 TacosWed - $.37 Wings!Thurs - $2.50 PBR'sFri - $7 Burgers and $5 Miller and Jamo Shot!!I recommend this place for hanging with the guys & looking to have a good time."
"This is an average bar. Nothing too special was going on. I think I saw a pool table? That's cool if you're into pool. As a person who doesn't need much from a bar to have a good time, I still didn't feel that this bar was doing much for me. They have beer served at most places, I had a Lagunitas. I've heard the food is good but I was there after midnight so it was just for drinks. I will say that I appreciated that the music was not so loud that I couldn't chat with my friends."
"Happened upon this little gem after dinner on a Saturday night. Great vibe and fun music... Just a fun time, check it out!"
"I'll admit, I like the look of Five Star.....but I'm not a big fan of the crowd.  Well, I guess that depends on the day.  A few friends and I wanted wings and beer and this place came to mind.  Upon walking in we ran into a few people we knew, which worked out nice because they were hanging by the bar and ended up getting us bar seats.  I'm definitely a bar gal.  It's easier to get a drink and I don't have to reach over people to get something.  This...is a nice bar.However, when the weather is nice, you definitely feel as though you're hovering over people for their seat, even when you're trying not to.  I like enjoying my food, so in turn, I like letting people enjoy theirs, which is why the tables aren't as enjoyable.While I'm a fan of the decor, I thought the food was just average.  The servers, on the other hand, have always been great!  Attentive and pleasant, can't knock that."
"This is a good example of subjective starring. Is Five Star objectively a four (or five, hah) star joint? Probably not. But this is my review, so the averages be damned.Five Star is now our the go-to neighborhood-ish joint for a quick dinner of good bar food. We've been on a quest to find the best chicken wings in the city, and the ones at Five Star rank right up there. They're large but not huge, spicy but not overwhelmingly so, and they come with a generous amount of blue cheese if you ask nicely.We generally split the wings and something else - the grilled veggie sandwich (good), the veggie nachos (kind of wet), or the Sunday burger special ($7 for any of the burgers + fries). This almost always works out to be just the right amount of food, particularly because we tend to come here when we're ::starving:: after a long run or a long day of driving.The beer list is good, but the mixed drinks are pricey. Service is pretty good, and the servers' uniform seems to be straight from the wardrobe department of Roseanne. I can't decide if the decor is supposed to be macabre or risque or what. There's a private-ish room that appears to have a stripper pole? that I've never seen in use.Good stuff, you guys."
"Five Star is around the corner from my place. Great bear & whiskey selection. They've got the old Pontiac Cafe sign. There's a stripper pole in the back room. What else could you want?Don't come here if you're looking for a sports bar. They've got a few TVs, but this isn't a place for sports junkies. Food is pretty good. Our table smelled the wings from the table next to us and had to order them. Wing sauce was pretty dang good and the wings weren't small. Good size."
I love this place! I live in the neighborhood and this is my go to spot for a casual night. They have a great beer selection. Live DJ on Saturdays. Food is good too. Fish tacos are my favorite...along with fries & ranch (the ranch is bomb.com).
"When it first opened this place was slammin, the wings are still great and so is the rest of the good for the most part. Prices have gone up on all the food, even the specials. Service is hit or miss with this place, you have to come early especially on Wednesdays or else you'll be standing around with your dick in your hand waiting for a table of hipsters that have been drinking the same ""Tecate"" for an hour! I don't like they you have to scrounge and fight for seating. They should have a list and seat people according to the order they arrived in, that's part really sucks. Over all good not great."
"Good drinks . I came here on a Saturday night and besides that one girl on a strip pole for 60 seconds, no one was dancing at all.  With all that open space, this bar could be way better."
"I went in and waited and waited for a long time for a table..  You have to get your own table since no one will seat you. I felt like I was stalking people and staring them down to hurry up and leave so I can eat. We ordered wings, which were very tasty and crispy. I did ask for a second beer and the waitress forgot about us. She then came back after fifteen minutes and didn't say anything for the delay. I couldn't hear my friend since the music was incredibly loud. The DJ was good and played music for everyones taste."
"Cute spot.  I have passed this bar for years, and we finally came in twice last night.  Yep.  Twice.  Before and After our dinner at Mexique.  The drinks and service were fine.  I liked the vinyl on the walls and high ceilings.  Also, the floor to ceiling windows at the front are a huge plus.  The food looked quite good, so we will be back!"
Great neighborhood place! Great beer selection and food to match. Nothing beats a place lit by red lights!
"Good for drinking not so good for eating. Beyond their corn dog specials , their food has never wowed me. I used to go for 25 cent wing night until it because 37 cent wing night. No the extra pennies wasn't the deal breaker but the place gets so crowded on Wednesday for their dry wings that come with your choice of Jewel osco brand BBQ sauce or Costco brand Buffalo sauce. Their beer selection, however, is worth a visit. They have rotating drafts that normally include a decent cider, some two brothers favorites and something from Bells. Sitting at the bar gets you the best service and two or three beer samples. Come for the beer, but leave before you get hungry."
"I've been a fan every time! Great staff, friendly and attentive. Every day deals on food and drinks. Huge array of beers and cocktails. Great food for a hungry gal after work. Tv galore for your sports fix and good music. Yum. Check it out."
"A fun place to watch the game, grab beers with friends and they have great food specials, like $5 wings on Wednesday and one of the BEST veggie burgers I've had- it has vegan chili sauce, jalapenos and is a black bean burger. The salad has a delicious garlic dressing option, which is also homemade style and has yummy chunks of garlic."
"Pretty standard bar, in a hip location. We had free shots from pretty girls, so that was   a plus for all involved.I would probably skip the eats and head next door to FLO after the libations (whether that be at 9 PM or 9 AM is your call)."
"Monika is one of the best tender of bars ever! She is very knowledgeable of all the whiskeys and beers on draft and can always make a great recommendation if you are interested in trying something new. Not only beautiful, she has an incredible personality as well. 5* is a great spot!"
"excellent djs some nights - I've sat at the bar with soundhound open a few times to catch all the cool tunes they play. there's a back room with a stripper pole, cheap whiskey, an excellent beer selection on draft and in bottle, and sufficiently sloppy bar fare. it's a wonderful example of an upscale dive with good service even when it's busy. don't miss the tot-chos: tater tots with nacho toppings!"
5 star bar looks like your typical bar from the outside but they have really cool events on their calendar.  There's also decent bar food and a larger backroom in the back with a pool table and walls covered in local art.  Big props for supporting the local artist community.I got to sample some of the food offerings and was pleasantly surprised to have been given pigs in a blanket (mini ones).  The sausages weren't wrapped in pancakes (the way I love them) but they were wrapped in biscuit dough and that was good enough to keep me smiling.  The tap list is decent (not great) but the vibe of the place is pretty casual and I didn't feel like I was the uncool kid.  Staff was friendly and patrons were nice normal people.
"I went here on a Sunday after work for the burger special. I ended up getting the breakfast burrito which, like Jesus, was just alright. I had 3-4 sazerac shots depending on who you ask and probably could have saved money by just ordering a whole sazerac. I do not regret the decision. It should be noted that even though our server (Sancha?) appeared to have the entire restaurant as her section I never once felt felt neglected. I will be back someday."
"Food was great, service was however awful. Truth be told I've been waiting to write this review and give them another chance. But frankly the service was so bad, I can't bring my self to go back. Our waitress acted like she hated us and completely ignored us. We ordered our food and a round of drinks, we finished our first beers by the time we received our food then wanted to order another round and a glass of water so then we waited and waited and waited...    and  ... .   waited  ...  and finally after 40mins flagged down a different waiters. Our waitress reluctantly gave us our drinks and refused to make eye contact with us. We didn't see her again until we received the bill with a gracious smile...  WTF?! Mind you this was during west town art walk so we went in early for diner to beet the rush.... well that didn't matter. Had the place been busy I would had been more understanding, but clearly she hated us."
"Solid neighborhood biker bar. They have decent specials on weeknights (dollar sliders Mondays), but it's more about the beer selection here. More options than you would expect for a neighborhood joint and not very pricey."
Thursday specials are worth a trip to West Town from the South Loop. $2.50 PBR on draft & some other food specials.Service has always been good.
"I really enjoyed this place.  Very sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  I think that it's a great spot to hit up for just a drink, or maybe even food.  It was really tasty.  We had the chicken tortilla soup, great flavors, a little spicy and tasted super delicious and fresh.  The bbq burger--cooked perfectly, french fries were super tasty too.  And the cobb salad--yum! This salad was sooo good, it did not even need salad dressing. Ingredients were fresh and delicious.  Definitely a great spot to check out if you haven't already."
"Food: great. Beer list: great. Service: occasionally slow, but I'm usually not waiting long for anything. TVs: great for game days when the boyfriend wants to catch the last few minutes, and all I want is a beer. Ambience: naked Barbie dolls tied above the bar, handgun outlines on lampshades, wide open glass doors in the front. Taco night: fabulous. Wing night: crowded. Volume: loud. Takeout: twelve minutes. Sold: yes."
"I really struggled to pick a star rating. Sure, I've been to better bars/restaurants than this, but at the same time I cannot give Five Star less than three because of the great service we received while here.We had what could be described as perfect timing as we snagged the last remaining table. One of the managers was quick to find us some chairs, as our table's companions had been pilfered by an ever-expanding group of St. Patrick's Day revelers. Our sever was incredible--quick to arrive, apologetic for taking a bit longer to bring drinks, and friendly even though we ordered little more than a few drinks per person and a few appetizers. Another server got us to stay by turning on the IU-VCU tournament game and our server tolerated our exasperated blasts of emotion and ultimately, our loud and raucous celebration with patience and good humor.The wings my dining companions destroyed looked delicious, and my corn dog was a hit, but the fries were the best of the three -- perfectly cooked and seasoned and a welcome complement to 3 Floyd's Gumball Head beer!I'm sure this place could be cool another time than St. Patrick's Day, but there's too much self-indulgent 80's rock atmosphere here for me. Lots of naked/semi-naked photos in the bathrooms and creepy artwork above the bar with that theme. The music was mostly older, which was appreciated. I'd probably visit again if I were back in this part of Chicago, but I'd hope to avoid it on Day of the Leprechaun."
"I was originally going to go to the Beauty Bar for the Prince/Michael Jackson Experience this Saturday, but there was a line down the block and I don't do lines.So I popped in to this bar to meet some friends who weren't waiting either and it was a nice surprise, ended up almost closing the bar down.I drank draft PBR all night and that was 3 bucks a pop and right up my budgeted alley. The music was good. Mostly older stuff, which I like and I had a good time dancing.There was some kind of strip club room in the back with a whole bunch of drunk lame girls trying to be sexy and dancing. That was about the only lame thing about this bar. But it's kind of a private room off the back so it doesn't really mess up the flow of the bar.Bathroom was clean.I would definitely come back."
"Five stars for Five Star. It is what it is - a bar - but it's become our go-to Saturday place in the neighborhood. The waitstaff are all friendly, the burgers (BBQ, ""Yuck"" and Turkey especially) are killer, and the bartenders have been known to dole out whisky shots to repeat customers. It's comfortable, has great food (pulled pork nachos, buffalo chicken sandwich, and fish tacos, i'm looking at you) and great music. Not too crowded (except on wednesdays for 37-cent wing nights, which should be avoided) and a great tap and whisky list."
"Went here after work for the Wednesday .25 wings and they were pretty damn good!   My friends and I ordered 40 wings, but only managed to eat 30.  Still for .25, they were worth it.   I still look forward to Sundays for the $6 burger special-this one is my fave!"
"Went here for pre-dinner drinks on a snowy night.  Overall good service and good atmosphere.  Ordered the hummus platter which was very basic and solid.  They had an interesting beer list. I went with the Three Floyd's Jinxproof.  Not disappointed at all, very good crisp flavor.  Also had a Two Brothers Take Two, which was a little darker and may have been slightly better than the Jinxproof.  Five Star also offers four types of single shot cocktails. I had an old fashioned which tasted more like a manhattan, and then ordered the boulevardier that tasted exactly like the old fashioned.  Go figure.It's a fun spot and good option for the area."
"Stopped in for some Dragon's Milk and the Guey burger, a juicy well-seasoned patty adorned with guac, tortilla strips, jalapenos, jack cheese and a little salsa verde. This burger was wickedly good, almost Kuma's Corner good. Wow. This is definitely worth another visit."
Get the fish tacos. :-)
"I had a chance to eat and drink at Five Star Bar this past week.  A friend recommended it as a place for some going away drinks and food.  I don't venture out of my north side  stomping grounds very often... but this place is a reason to explore other neighborhoods more frequently. Our server was Gigi and she was nothing short of excellent.  We had the Schlitz beer special...then switched to the good ole standby of PBR.  Two of my friends ordered the fish tacos, I ordered the BBQ Burger...and my other friend the Turkey Burger.  It was devoured very quick... and everyone was very happy with their food.  Yum.  Two awesome things:  the french fries are hand cut... and their turkey burger patties  are made in house.I'll defiantly be back!!"
"We only stayed for a few beers but the bar is decent in size, although we hit it early, it wasn't too crowded when we got there.The door men have a bit of an ego though, so guys, be prepared to deal with them and their arrogant nature (have more than one form of ID)"
"Probably the best burger in the city.The wings are also great. Their chopped salad is AWESOME. The nachos will do.The drinks are awesome, the theme events are fun, the servers are attentive...5 Stars."
"So my brother & his girlfriend told me about this place & said it was one of the best deals for wings & beer.  As sweet as the staff was, I would NEVER want to back there!  The fact that anyone can steal tables because there's no reservations or order of who came in earlier practiced, most people can wait over an hour or more (while we were there, we waited 1 hour & 18 minutes while others that came in before us had just gotten seated when we were leaving the joint!).  Honestly, the wings didn't wow me; I've had better wings for less trouble at other places.  If I ever have to go back, I will eat before going!"
"Have been here many times. Such a great atmosphere. During the summer, the doors are open and there is outdoor seating. The food is very good here. The California Burrito is always delicious. They always have a great rotating beer selection on tap. The DJ is playing Rock n Roll and they show all the Chicago sports and one of the few bars to show Bears games with sound. Service is good and attentive."
service is okay.. they dont come by as often as they shouldwings are pretty good and cheese fries too pretty good deals too.
Bomb barbecue beef nachos.  Overall tasty bar food and a nice laid back setting.  Great little spot.
"I've been coming to this bar for years, and I've never had any issues with the food, or service. It's an amazing place to visit with friends after a long work day, or frequent late on a Friday night. The place is always buzzing with interesting characters. There's a punk rock/vintage rock and roll theme to Five Star as well, which I really appreciate.The menu is pretty typical of any bar which serves food, and consists of burgers, melts, fries, etc. However, the Five Star Burger is probably their best option. In my opinon, it rivals anything Kuma's would serve, and it also has a fried egg on it, which is the icing on the cake. The servers are always friendly, attentive and laid back. They also have drink specials most nights, which won't break the wallet too much. For added recreation, there's a pool table in the back which is always a good time after a few beers. Oh, and if you've totally lost all sense of inhibition, you can slither up and down their stripper pole. YES! There's a stripper pole (in a separate room toward the back of the bar). I've always had an amazing time here, whether it was for food, or drunken shenanigans with my friends. Five Star will not let you down!"
"The thing about Five star bar that gets us coming back is location.  They are located very close to our place, so getting drunk and walking back home becomes an easy thing to do.  They are your typical bar, with many specials and extensive liquor selection.  They are always packed for happy hours, and on game days too.  Staff has always been nice to us, i have no complains. Last time I was undecided if I wanted to try a new kind of beer and the bartender gave me a generous taste cup to make my decision easier.  Food is ""ok"".  I remember having chicken wings and they were pretty darn good.  They were also on some sort of special, if I'm not mistaken they were about 0.50$ for 6 of them. they have a room with a stripper pole if you are into getting drunk and looking ridiculous.  But no, I haven't seen any professional strippers inside that room.Music is standard, not a place to go dancing, more like a lounging vibe.Stop by and check it out for a happy hour sometime!"
"I really like the staff here and generally the other customers--and usually, the food! Delicious hummus and fries. Good beer selection. Solid music.BUT--I'm sad to say they recently changed their veggie burger to now being a frozen-ish black bean burger. I like homemade black bean burgers a lot but whatever kind they've bought is just terrible. I used to go there all the time for their old veggie burger that actually had veggies in it--it was one of my favorites in the city!--but now I am going to have to think twice about going there. I hope they consider switching the burger back. I know a few other people who already miss the old veggie burger too--why change what isn't broken, to make it worse than it was before?"
The food is good and the service if fine. The place is a little pricy but you know that going in. The burgers are cooked just right (I have not had an overcooked one here) and it is a great place to have a burgers and a few beers. The place is a bit loud to have a conversation. It would get 5 starts if I could talk to a date there.
"This place exudes pure class. I am always greeted with a giant bear hug from the door guy who usually engages me in a stimulating conversation about existentialism while I mill over my perfectly made bourbon in a glass. The bartender on Sunday nights, pretty brunette with tattoos and a badass T-Rex shirt is the best! Her infectious energy and delightful sassy demeanor make for my favorite kind of bartender. I saw some other patrons giving her a hard time for charging them for their drinks. I would have probably had them kicked out but I lack the type of grace and compassion that the Dalai Lama and employees at Five Star share. The other guy that helps behind the bar when it gets busy, I think he's the manager, is quite friendly and I like the way he talks. He should be on the radio. They just got a great new chef and the menu has matured to more than just bar food. My advice: go to Five Star on Sunday nights (or any night), challenge me at pool (you will lose), and don't drink Jameson/Bailey's shots unless you transport yourself to Wrigleyville circa 2002."
"Have only been here once but they have some of the best wings around, so this review is for them. Go get them!"
"very friendly staff that does a great job with service.  daily specials are a plus and on the rare occasion, you may find that they have zombiedust brew by three floyds.  stop in there during the summer when the front windows are open and you get to hear some nice sounds from the motorcycles outside.  pool table in the attached room."
I got a regular cheeseburger with avocado and it was great! This is my new spot to go to when i'm craving a burger.
"I rarely venture outside of my area, but I was hungry prior to a Hawks game and my friend suggested we go.  I should have known that a friend who is 320lbs would know some good bar food!  It was Sunday and they had $6 burger night.  There were a lot of great options, but can you ever beat a patty melt?  The food took a while to come out, but the waitress was super friendly and the bar owner/manager came over to chat for a while.  Once the food came out I was even more impressed.  It was served on a unique metal place and the plate was loaded with fries.  They were AWESOME!  The burger was very good too, but it was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium, but got closer to well).  Still it was really good!  I want to come back here and give the wings a try!"
"I've been going here for years as my neighborhood bar. Always liked it. But I was SUPER impressed when I emaile them on a Thursday asking if I could make some sort of reservations for Saturday for my birthday party group of 25+. And it was St. Patrick's Day weekend. I fully expected them to say ""Yeah, um, we're gonna be full, go scratch"" but instead the owner called me, was super nice, and reserved the fancy stripper pole room for us (OMG GIRLS ON STRIPPER POLES LOOK AT ME WEEEE!) and also said he'd send around a round of shots to get the party started. Excellent service, nice people, fun place."
"Definitely a hipster/yuppie scene here, but I won't hold that against them.Met a couple of friends here on a Sunday night, and even though it was on the early side, this place was hot and happening. And loud.We snagged a booth in the back and ordered some drinks. I was happy to see that my newly-discovered favorite cider was on the menu, Scumpy's, but not so happy that I paid only $7 for it a couple of days ago at another restaurant, and at Five Star, they wanted $10 for the same size. It's probably still a fair price; I'll assume that I was undercharged at the other place.I was amidst in a sea of sweets that my friends brought in, so we figured we'd order some noshes before diving in to the cookies and cupcakes. We shared an order of chips and guac, as well as an order of hand-cut fries.The chips and guac also came with pico de gallo, and the serving was huge. The guac was well-flavored and the chips were warm, which was a nice touch.I haven't met too many fries that I didn't like and Five Star's were no exception. Priced at $3, this is the way to go if you want something mildly greasy to soak up the booze.Service was good; music was hit or miss (mostly hit), and the food was definitely better than average.It's three stars for Five Star."
"We ate a quick and early dinner here on a Saturday before heading to a show at the United Center. It was early, so we had our pick of tables. When we left, the place was getting really busy. Our waitress was really nice and friendly, and she kept making sure we had everything we wanted without being intrusive.The food was surprisingly tasty for it being a bar. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was good, with just a bit of kick. They loaded my plate with fries too. A friend had the kick ass mac & cheese and really liked it too. We went with the drink specials, which were pretty standard for a Saturday night - a $5 beer and $6 peach apple hard cider.It's a nice place. We'll be back again."
"Great staff, great deal on Wednesdays.  Like the Terminator. I'll be back"
"Behold - another bar that serves my favorite beer, La Fin du Monde! And, I was able to enhance the experience by sitting on the patio with a front-seat view of Chicago Ave's hustle and bustle... Sunday night bliss.Inside, there's something for everyone. Pool table, stripper pole, and a DJ spinning music from multiple genres. If you're hungry, Five Star has an extensive menu and also offers a nice selection of signature drinks. Like whisky? Well, you're in luck because the list is long and distinguished.My only real gripe is that service was consistently super slow. It took 15 minutes before a server greeted us, and another 10 just to get our beers. But it was all smooth sailing once I put that La Fin du Monde in my hand. Interesting mix of people and the bar always seems to be full and lively. I'll certainly be back for more good times!"
This review is for their carryout food not the actual bar...Best burgers..best fries..best ranch..all around best bar food.
Boyfriend's roommate's annoying gf was over so we needed some place to escape and watch Da Bears. The was a group of fans watching the game and ordering a couple of the daily specials ($3 mimosas and a $6 breakfast burrito to share) was a great way to have a cheap snack. Will be back to try burgers and nice draft selection.
"This place is beautifully decorated! Every inch of it is has something to admire. From it's French Baroque inspired elements (leather tufted sofas, damask-patterned wallpaper, a purple wall with arty stencils, and over-sized mirrors) to its vintage rock-and-roll flair (adored with rock band posters, 'rock and roll' iconic symbols stenciled on the ceilings; and a private room in the back with faux-tattooed walls and a stripper pole) this place is simply stunning. And there's something for everyone be it hanging in the lounge area kicking back a few or shooting a few rounds on the pool table.This spot specializes in bourbons (stocking 30 American varieties) and a cocktail menu (featuring 14 bourbon-based drinks). Plus there's 16 beers on tap and a fully-stocked bar. The DJs weekly spin indie rock, punk, reggae, rockabilly, and metal. The staff is nice and friendly.I just have to try their food now!"
"I am so disappointed for never posting a review!I have been here by my estimate over 50 times in the past few years (no I don't work here)By far my favorite bar in the city for lots of reasons.The staff has always been super friendly, as well as the manager. (If its still Todd)Lindsay and Natalie are awesome too!The burgers are the best in town (sorry Kuma's, I love you too though) I've actually tried almost half the food items off the menu and the tacos where the only thing I wasn't a fan of but what can you expect at a Whiskey bar.Good music and atmosphere.Great drink list.Lots of comfortable booths.Yes the servers can be a little slow and do like to socialize. Food comes out fast so I can't complain.The only thing is warn against is Wed wing night. Place gets packed!!!Expect to hover over a table and dive in as soon as they leave. There is no host so it's every man for him/herself."
"Ahhhh, love this little rock star place!Un-pretentious, cool space, slightly weak drinks (minus a star), and need I say it....A STRIPPER POLE!  It reminds me of a place that PINK would love to frequent."
"Cool interior that's bigger than it looks from the outside.  Sort of ""skuzzy posh"" if I had to pigeonhole it.  The stripper pole and black leather definitely helps.Friendly waitstaff, who took time out of her night to explain how to pierce your chest with studs.  (The secret, it turns out, is in dermal anchors... who knew?! :)The cheeseburger I had there was insanely delicious in a grease-is-good sort of way.  Also, the rest of the menu sounded incredible.  PBR talls for cheap.  Great spot to combo with some drinks at the Chipp Inn nearby."
"We came here for drinks - and after reading the reviews, I feel compelled to return for a meal.  In regard to a neighborhood bar -  good crowd, very pleased to see the selection on tap (Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA), and the prices were reasonable.  Several reasons to return!"
"I generally judge a bar based on the quality of its french fries. And this bar has 2 star french fries. The waitresses ignored us when we first went in, so we went up to the bar and got a lot better service from the bartender. The music was awful. All the early 90s grunge rock crap I used to listen to when I was in high school. Same ol same ol and immemorable type of bar. Stayed long enough to finish half the order of french fries and a beer. Overall, the place was starting to giving me a headache. I'd probably go back if I happened to be walking down the street. Its good for a corner bar but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"Five Star had 5 Sexy Stars from this B right up until the very end. Damn... so close. I hosted my retirement party here a few weeks back when I saw that Five Star will reserve party rooms for free. Sadly, the rooms were all booked up for the night of my party but the super awesome guy on the phone had a spot reserved up from for my party of 15-20 ... that turned out to be 35-40 in and out. Our server was a super smokin' blonde chica who was in the know about their food and beer list... which is quite impressive.  The BF and I got some fries , a Caesar salad, and a veggie wrap- which were all pretty darn good. To start on the alky bevs, I got ole reliable, Gumball head, and worked my way through some other faves, including Allagash White,  5 Star Pale Ale (brewed by Two Bros Brewery, word up, homies!), Left Hand Sawtooth, Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA, and LOTS more Allagash white until I knew I'd be tragically hung over the next day. I was super impressed with our server's ability to keep all the bar tabs separate and she was always there when my beer got low. Ooh- and they don't skimp on the pours. They fill that shizz right up to the brim of the pint- Score! There's also a pool table and stripper pole in the private back rooms to ensure you have a good time or a nasty night- whichever you'd prefer. Yeah, I know which one you dirty birds are into. Anyway, they had me at 5 stars until the BF and I were getting ready to leave. The Bf had already paid our tab as the little hot headed hottie of a server ran up and angrily grabbed the BFs arm and jerked him back.Server:  Excuse me, was there something wrong with my service?BF: Uhm, what?Server: My service? Was there something wrong with it? You didn't tip me. ***pointing to line through tip area on cc receipt with deadly scowl on face***BF: ***Pulls back the CC reciept  a little more and reveals $25 cash (because I'm a server and I trained the BF that getting cash tips that don't have to be claimed for taxes on charge cards is the tops)*** It's right there, I left right behind the signed receipt, it's 25%.Server: Oh, hehe, Thnx! So... the BF was pretty embarrassed since she basically accosted him in front of our friends. I mean, I'm a server and I could totally understand her frustration if someone had stiffed her, but the money wasn't even hiding... it was behind the receipt but easily visible since the receipt is only half the size of a bill. I would just recommend she does her homework and looks at everything in the booklet before she accosts the next guy... because my man ain't no stiff."
"hmm..I think 3 star bar is a more likely name for this place.The wings were ok, crunchy like I like them but the ""hot wing sauce"" wasn't very good and the fries were all like the remaining scraps that you usually find in the bottom of your bag once you're done eating.Our waitress was pretty attentive but I kind of felt like our being there was ruining her life in some way and i'm not sure patrons want to feel like that. I understand that people have bad days so whatever. Kudos for having ""hotpants"" listed as the server name on our bill, I giggled.After work crowd is pretty low key and someone even dragged in a couple of kids at one point. They have a nice beer selection but the prices for some are a bit much. I'm not crazy about this place but  might go back if I was with a fun crowd, though I might not eat."
"1st time customer, & last time customer! My girlfriend an I stopped in on Friday night after work, it was not crowded yet. The bartender was horrible!   She never asked us if we wanted another drink, any good bartender would have noticed that our glasses were empty.   We ask to speak to the manager and he was just as bad, he kept walking pass us until I got his attention.  I had to explain to him that we were there for two hours, ordered food, which we received.. but we never got to order another drink.  He had nothing to say, not even I'm sorry.  The bartender was doing shots with the customers, which I don't agree on..but that's your policy.  She also needs to know more about your menu, she could not answer questions I had about your food.   I will never go back to this bar nor would I suggest your bar to anyone!!"
"Met up with a friend at Five Star and had an impossible time talking with the crappy Thursday night DJ playing with his knobs. Raising and lowering the volume during the song, taking the midrange in and out. Is this DJ'ing, especially when it's just Bryan Adam's ""Cuts Like a Knife"" and other bad 80's hits? It was horrible to have to shout over and even the waitress was having a hard time hearing our drink orders and getting them correct. Still, Five Star is a good option for groups of friends to meet up to have a good time. The stripper pole appeases the Wicker Park hipsters and service was good. I'll be back with a group, maybe after a few drinks. But never for an encore with ""DJ"" Thursday on the Wheels of Steel."
A good bar to have a birthday party or other stuff. However having a replay of wrestlemania 5 on a Sunday night when I prefer ESPN highlights is not cool. Aside from that the bar looks good and is located in a cool urban spot. Good drink specials also make this a place worth drinking. Just have some live sports shows and highlights on a Sunday night.
"This is a solid neighborhood bar.  I have been coming here since it opened...never a regular, but everytime I go I always have good service and quality food/drink.  Sure my pint glass was a little sticky and there was toilet paper all over the floor of the bathroom last time I went, but other than that it's pretty clean, service is good, and the place is well-kept.  Kind of an artsy hipster tattooed vibe inside, but no snobbery of any sort, and this 35 year old attorney with several hidden tattoos and a prepster husband did not feel out of place or unwelcome.  If you're a douchebag and/or work in investment banking, you probably shouldn't go here.  One item I love: they have Daisy Cutter on tap, which so happens to be one of my new fave beers."
"Great music, great service, great specials, great beer."
"As a steady 4 year regular Wednesday patron to this bar, I have to admit that recently I have been let down with this place.  At $0.25, these wings were a steal and amazing, when they increased their price to $0.37, they were good.  Now that they have jumped the current price of $0.43, they are hardly worth the trip out there.  As a consumer, I would expect if you are going to raise the price of the wings, they not come out looking like the chicken had an eating disorder and, if at all possible, please make them a little hotter than room temperature (nobody likes cold wings).  It's a shame that my regular group and I will need to find a new location for our Wednesday tradition because the service and people at Five Star is great, but the wings have gone from great to terrible."
"How does it take a waitress 17 minutes to get a beer?  She finally comes by again and my husband tells her nicely that we've been waiting for a beer for over 10 minutes.  She smiles and says ""ok"" and STILL asks another three tables if they needed anything (and surprise, surprise, they did!).  I had to go get his beer while I clearly saw her yapping away at the bar with her friend!  Even when she saw me go get the beer at the bar, she kept yapping!  No ""sorry about that"" or anything!  It seemed like she just didn't want to serve!  If you go today guys, avoid the chick with the hat! Very rude and unprofessional.  You're a waitress, act like it...and that tip? That was all my husbands kindness because you did NOT deserve it.  Good service is a HUGE part of a good restaurant/bar.  I hope you aren't as rude the rest of the night."
"My friend picked Five Star Bar for his birthday and I had only stepped foot in this bar for a brief moment of time so I was excited to give it another shot. Inside the bar was dim/dark and TVs were showing some of the UFC fights on Spike. My friend had the pool table area reserved so we stood and sat around back there. A server came by and took orders and was good about keeping things straight so nothing would get mixed up.I drank Stella Artois because that is one of my favorite beers. The darkness of the bar kind of takes away from the atmosphere and it seems like all of the walls and floors are all black. If it's going to be all black may as well turn on the blacklights or something. There was room for the party but once the pool table started getting packed with random people taking their pool too seriously it really was a clustermuck and I stopped having a good time. The burger was very good and I liked it the best, however being too crowded unnecessarily with people acting rude to each other is not an ideal way to pass a Saturday night."
"I am guessing calling it ""Three Star"" probably wouldn't be a good sell, but that is what it gets from me.  Pros: -back room with a stripper pole, worth watching your friends (male and female) get silly on.         -good music         -an extensive whisky listcons:--that good music was way too loud and so made it hard to have a conversation           -my Old Fashioned was undrinkable, just a terrible waste of bourbon."
"I accidentally crashed a party here a few days ago, featuring some lovely ladies I know.Pretty nice sized bar, but the attraction was the back room with the stripper pole! I decided to give a breif AW show on the pole (couldn't give too much) and if I had been drunk enough it could have been fun times! The music was pretty loud to where I had to lean into a person to hear what they were saying.Only had a beer, but their menu was pretty cool. I tried the fries and they were pretty much made the way I don't like them, too crispy-like. Will be back and 4 of them from the AW! By the way, they have an outside patio that I am very intersted in!"
"I can't give Five Star Bar 5 stars, but it is definitely a solid 4-star place.The food here is great. They have some great beers, including Gumballhead and La Fin du Monde!The music is usually pretty good... oh and there is a stripper pole in the back if you're so inclined.It's really close to where I live, so that rocks (for me). I also ran into some very lovely ladies there, including... well, I won't name names, but they rhyme with Rett D. and Yelena Z.... hehe. I think they think I was stalking them, especially since a creepy guy showed up that was absolutely stalking them. All I can say is that I'm the only one of that group of 5 people that lives around the corner, so... you do the math on who was stalking whom."
"Went here the other night for dinner before hitting Beauty Bar just down the street. It was past the usual dinner hour & we got a trio of barstools as a group was leaving. I'm not huge on bars full of TV's generally, but whatever -- it is what it is & I can't knock 'em for it.Beneath that, they've got two towers full of great taps, no shortage of bottles, and more whiskey than my liver would know what to do with. I defaulted to the standard ""Five Star"" burger, and was beyond impressed, considering I was expecting some standard forgettable pub grub fare. The bacon & egg topped awesomeness was flanked by an offensively large pile of fries (bit much, but beats the alternative, right?). The bartender dude looked straight out of Slayer, but was totally personable, and the other girl behind the bar that wasn't waiting on us checked up every time she waked past & one of our glasses was nearing its end.They've got a DJ at the far end of the room playing straightforward rock & roll that went flawlessly with the beer-burger-fries meal, the ceiling's paint job, and the tattooed girls waiting tables. A shot of rotgut whiskey appeared with our check & paired pretty well with the above & the wince of pain it caused as well. All & all, I think I got out of the place for $25 for a meal, two beers & a shot. Five stars indeed."
I've reviewed before and I gave it 5 stars before... But let me just say Sunday $5 jameson shot & highlife paired with the $7 burger special is a hangover cure!
"I really didn't see what all the hype about this place is about.Ended up here with a b-day party because it was close to the Performing Arts Center after an amazing show of ""Bye Bye Liver.""We all fit snugly into the back room, which was perfect. However, the waitress and the bar staff could have been a bit more helpful and a little less on the jaded side. The music got better only around 12:30. Before that, it consisted mainly of lesser-known early 80's New Wave songs. Mind you, I'm not some music snob or someone who can't have a good time without Bon Jovi blasting, but some of those song selections the DJ put on (yes, a DJ) had many of us saying ""what the f**k.""Like it's been mentioned before, is it a rocker bar? Yuppie ""Irish"" place? The pseudo-dive bar decor was pretty obvious as well. I still had a good time regardless."
"I like the food and the beer at Five Star. It's where I discovered Delirium Tremens, which began my long descent into Belgian beers. The service is good, the bartenders are friendly. The food is pretty decent for bar food, and they run food and drink specials almost every day of the week, like $1 tacos or $.17 wings, paired with cheap beer. It's hard to go wrong.The music is loud and heavy-ish, the men's restroom is lined with photos of scantily clad ladies, and there is a stripper pole in the back room. If you are easily offended, perhaps Five Star is not your style."
"Had a great timeI'm too mainstream to get good service, it's cool, that's what I expected.Love the decor.Stripper poleOK crowd3 stars for locationYou can meet some pretty cool people here, we met some Top Chef contestants, and some mayjah Chi town foodiesNot the place to go if you want to meet younger male hotties though the door guy was lovely!"
"3.5 stars. Dropped in for drinks and a bite prior to a house party in West Town. Patio charm - check. Solid craft brews on tap - check. Laid-back atmosphere - check. Adult bar versions of childhood favorites (chicken tenders, corn dogs, etc.) - check. Was impressed with the bourbon and whiskey selection, so I attempted to order a Sidecar. The bartender would not/ could not make a Sidecar (say what?!), so each had a whiskey sour with the Hudson Single Malt. Our server came by prior to my friend ordering a 2nd drink to advise us that the bartender informed her that our drink was $20. Sheesh! We would've drank it straight had we known the whiskey was so superior. She opted for a Jim Beam Whiskey Sour - still tasty, but, boy, what a difference! Although we enjoyed our food, $9 for 3 large grilled chicken tenders and fries and $7 for a corn dog and fries is a little much. Luckily, Delirium got me through the end of my meal. A pleasant experience, but no one likes to get surprised with a huge bill. Put some prices on your hard liquor selections. West Town is an up-and-coming neighborhood, but it's still gentrifying. Don't try to gouge us on prices, just yet."
"Lived just steps from Five Star when I first moved to Chicago.  Really enjoyed drinking here during the day.  Has great specials and a good beer list.  The decor is different and unique, but also refreshing... if that makes sense.  Crowd  gets very eclectic later at night."
"For those of you who remember Men on Film... ""Hated it!""This place is vile.  The servers are pretentious.  Most of the patrons are douche-bags.If you are looking for a fight with a bunch of meat-heads over one of the ""classy babes"" working the stripper pole in the back, this is your place. I do not care how good the beer list is, it is not worth the constant drama."
This place is a blast. Love hanging here. Super cool looking place and great selection of whiskey and beer. Wings are pretty damn good too.
"I met a friend here when I got off from work and we had a few drinks together.It was relatively empty and seemed like a pretty easygoing place. A DJ started setting up as we were leaving.The drinks were strong and relatively large, which was nice. The prices weren't outrageous. My friends ordered a snack before I came, they seemed to like it OK enough. It's amazing how much this stretch of land has changed in the past 5-6 years. I lived right across the street from this place about 6 years ago and it's like night and day. I'd go back, if I was in the area. This is a nice bar in a changing neighborhood."
"Five Star probably doesn't need another review, but I thought I would add my ""five stars"" to the list.I moved to the area recently from Humboldt Park and the place has rapidly become my home away from home (if you take work out of the mix that is).The food is good.  The service is great.  I felt right at home the first time I went in, and continue to like it more and more.They have a pretty extensive drink list, but I can't really comment on it because I rarely drink and mostly just go there to grab dinner, have a few non-alcoholic beverages, and hang.There's a cool mix of people generally-speaking, but as others have pointed out, it can be overrun by douchebags on the weekends.  If you're looking for a more strictly hipster scene, this ain't it.Oh, and one more thing...over the next several weeks, they're screening several John Carpenter films on Tuesday nights at 8:30.  Sweet."
"I went to this place for the first time a couple nights ago and was a little hesitant.  Wanting to go to Five Star (without any knowledge that they were related), I was expecting to be disappointed.  NOTE: if you are in Noble Square and you have a good group of people, go here! The drinks were good-they offered the standard (blue moon, 312, etc.) and some from local vendors- which was a great aspect to have at a bar.  Oh, and the music is great...what a rare thing to find at a bar! Seriously, go to this place once & have a beer- you will not be upset."
The daily special board on Friday night was as follows:Todays special: Your Mom.  - Market PriceThat was pretty awesome.
"The food here isn't bad for a bar. The place is always packed, no matter the day of the week. I especially like the Wednesday and Thursday specials. Wednesday they have $2.50 Tecates and $.25 wings. Thursdays is $3.50 PBR and $1.50 corn dogs. The corn dogs are so yummy!A lot of the appetizers are good as well. Some of the drinks are a little pricey, but it's a fun bar to hang out at with friends. I can't wait for the weather to get warmer for their outdoor seating!"
"2-second recap of 5 Star Bar:Patrons: Cool, nice mix of laid back peopleEntertainment: 1 pool tableDrinks: Standard bar drinks (go for the beer instead)Plus: Outdoor seating and dog bowl Cabs when leaving: Non-existent (prepare to wait 20-30min and wrestle the other people for the lone cab)If I lived near here, I'm sure that I would stop by and check out their food.  But I don't so you'll just have to read the other reviews for that :)"
"This place is a nice, big space, complete with a stripper pole in the back room. This place is sort of confusing. It has a few TV screens for sports-viewing, but it also has that stripper pole and some weird kitschy decorative items along its walls. Confusion about all of that aside, this place has $6 burger specials on Sundays and I came here for a going-away party. I ordered the Verde burger, and it was pretty good aside from the half-melted cheese. They also had Bell's Oberon on tap, and that was decently priced at $5. I don't really imagine myself hanging out here on a regular basis, but it's a decent place to grab a bite to eat."
"How appropriate, five glorious stars for Five Star Bar!! Hip-Hip-Hooray!Actually, I usually find it hard to give anywhere five stars when I've only been there once and you never know, an update may be in the Five Star future, but for now I'm sticking to my guns. I had such a fantastic time here last night when I got a case of the ""just one mores"" after the Elite event at West Loop Studio. Not having much of a bearing in West Town, I was fortunate my in-the-know friend Angie knew just the kind of place to take me... Five Star delivered with awesome rock music, nudie pics, grungy boys with tattoos, a fabu drink list (think Basil Hayden's bourbon) and tasty eats. What more could a girl ask for? They also boast a smallish back party room complete with sailor theme and a stripper pole. Heeey-O!!!!! Don't think we won't be back to work that puppy up and down... you know Mama's got skilllzzzz. Overall for a Thursday night, this place rocked my Casbah. I will be back, it's a promise. Let's just hope an update won't be necessary as Five Stars for Five Star just sounds right."
"I began going to Five Star because I lived two blocks away, and although I have relocated to an apartment much less convenient for Five Star visits, I still drop in every couple of weeks.  The music is always good, and something interesting is always playing on the TVs.  The food is pretty decent, I'd call it a step above the typical list of fried crap that is usually available in bars.  The service is great, the bartenders are attentive and fun, and they have drink/food specials every night of the week.Oh, and there's a stripper pole in the room behind the DJ booth.  Chances are, if you're there when I'm there, I'll be on it looking spastic and yelling a lot."
"I don't get it. I keep hearing about this place and if I had noticed the photo with the girl and the stripper pole I would have probably known to stay away.And are yuppie frat boys now infiltrating every neighborhood in the city? I wasn't expecting all the post golf outing and college sports talk and high fives I encountered here for this area.It's way too loud inside and makes conversation almost impossible...Unless you are a screaming frat boy talking about the chick you banged last night then I suppose that would make it easier to understand.Decent beers, food was OK (typical bar food), tons of people were ordering wings if that says anything and the food came out really fast and the service was far better than what I was expecting for as busy as it was. I would consider going there again to sit on the outdoor porch but I would rather sit naked on a porcupine than hang out inside this place again....But I also imagine waiting for a seat to open up on the patio would be like waiting until you win the lottery to pay your bills.I don't recall seeing a DJ."
Great low key bar with a huge variety of scotch & whiskies!
"I had a drink here tonight. Yup, it's a bar, there's bar tenders and tables and beer and nachos and TVs and shots and all that.If you're looking to have a drink and hang out...done. This place will provide that, but it's not the kind of place you wanna make memories at, in my opinion anyway.That being said, get yourself a drink, kick back and just relax because this place will be A-OK for that kind of thing.If you're looking for personality in your bar or patio setting, you might wanna look a bit deeper. OVERALL: I'm glad it's there, but it is not for me."
"I came for the food and booze.  They had $1.50 corn dogs all night.  Comes with this great mild mustard sauce.  Delicious.  Had six.  The $3.50 PBR goes down very well with these artery cloggers.  Being from LA, I only eat them with lemonade when in Santa Monica at that hotdog on a stick shack.  Then tried a bit of the friend's pulled pork sandwich (politically correct term for Sloppy Joe).  Whatever you choose to name this dish, it's good!  With 160 reviews, there are no photos of food.  I'll put a stop to that.  Above average service.  Nice open view.  Not too loud.  Didn't see anyone pole dancing in the back room.  Maybe next time.  I guess everyone's busy eating corndogs..."
"Nice bar with some scattered sports screens for watching games. No nba league pass here, so only major games on."
Great neighborhood bar. I go there more often than I'd like to admit.The veggie burger and fries is really good! No fake meat patty. The fries are so good with just the right amount of salt.Good beer and whiskey selection. But if you are looking for $3 pints this probably isn't your place. It's not expensive but not crazy cheap either. Every mixed drink I've gotten was really good - no skimping on the good part :) AtmosphereGood music - not the normal playlist. Just good rock jams.  The service is really friendly. It's always a crowd pleaser when I take friends there for the first time. There is a pool table in the back and a room with a stripper pole. Sounds gross but it's all in good fun.Side note:Initially I was mad when I saw this place come to the neighborhood but totally misjudged it. I like the mixed crowd this place can draw. Keeps it from being a typical scene bar.
We'be been coming here for years and love it! Especially wing Wednesday but I have to say lately I've been disappointed to watch the price of wings continue to go up. When we started coming five years ago the wings were $.25 and now they're up to $.43. Disappointing because soon we won't keep coming if the trend continues. Overall good food and service but unfortunate raising prices.
"I don't hate this place, but I haven't been here enough to love it yet.  It has great potential to be loved because I love the decor (pin-up girls and skulls are decoupaged to the walls, they have a stripper pole in the back room, and Polaroids of girls trying to be strippers on the stripper pole posted above the urinals) and layout, but it keeps falling short.I visited 5 Star again late Saturday afternoon on my way home from West Fest.  The roommate and I were one of six tables and we all had chosen to sit either outside or at the high tops near the open floor to ceiling doors by the bar.  I ordered the Kentucky Lemonade (wasn't horrible, but not as freshening as I thought it was going to be) and the Pulled Pork Sandwich per our waitress' suggestion.  She said it was her favorite sandwich on the menu.  The pork was good, but I've had better.  I asked for more BBQ sauce on the side to enhance the taste.  The fries were HORRID!  But, I looked around at the other two tables with fries and it looked like it was just my order that was really bad.  In short, my fries were so crispy they were hard and had no taste.  Sad.  The roommate ordered the three mini sandwiches (choice of burger, pulled pork, or sloppy joe).  She had the burgers and sloppy joe and loved it all. I had a bite of the sloppy joe and it was very tasty.  The menu lists your typical bar food (deep fried apps, burgers, sandwiches, etc.), but all items are reasonably priced and they have EXCELLENT specials running Mon-Thurs.  I would be willing to go back."
"Very first review of anywhere, but I find myself in Five Star quite often. Today I tried their food for the first time. I ordered the Verde burger with extra green chillies and I have to say, this is very close to the best burger my taste buds have had the pleasure of experiencing! Couple that with a good beer selection, a HUGE bourbon and whiskey list, and reasonable prices (plus Delirium Tremens on tap), and you've got a great bar! Come in, get a burger, listen to punk rock, and enjoy!"
"PROS-Patrons: Mixed CrowdFood: WINGS GET 5 STARS alone***** (Better than wingstop and BBWW)Beer: Great selection of craft beerBar Drinks: Awesome bartenders that never fail on portion of liquor WED. SPECIALS ON TECATE AND WINGS- AWESOME!CONS- Small place, have to get there early to get a seat or to get the back room. Only one pool table, which is utilized as an eating table when it gets too crowded. Hard to find parking."
I love the atmosphere of this place from the outdoor seating to the stripper pole in the pseudo VIP room. I've been going here for about 5 years now and the food is always fresh and tasty...they always have specials and they have a great beer selection. This place is def worth a try
"Have you ever had one of those moments where the thought of ""Is this really happening?"" crosses your mind?I had that thought a few times on Saturday night when I was attending my friends birthday celebrations at Five Star. We were in the room with the stripper pole, utilizing the table for drink support only, when a group of random girls none of us knew came in and sat down. We thought they just didn't realize we all knew each other, but then one girl (who's dressed like a naughty geometry teacher) says she's a stripper instructor and wants to show her friends how it's done.... Ummm what??She definitely showed us all how it was done.... She was swinging around the pole, upside down from her ankles. Cue ""Is this really happening?"" thoughts now... But WAIT, there's more!! She's swinging upside down around the pole, removes her shirt and throws it to her friends. What the what?! Keep in mind this is all in front of a room full of strangers. Someone's got a hefty pair of balls under their pencil skirt....Anyhoo, in other news our waitress was sweet and attentive, the bathrooms were clean and our tab was only $30 bucks at the end of this wild and crazy night. I can't say I won't give Five Star another chance.P.S. The naughty geometry/stripping instructor came back for a second round too... Did that really happen?? Oh yeah it did, there's photographic evidence."
"I'd like to think that I don't have a drinking problem.  But I've been to Five Star Bar on three occasions now, and I've been nearly or completely blacked out each time.  What this means is that this is an entirely preemptive review.  I don't remember enough about Five Star to give an honest to goodness rating.  With that said, I give it three stars for my three trips there and an extra star for not having been forcibly removed on any of those visits.  I'll be back for a reasonably sober judgment at some point.  But would the owners even want me to see it in such a state?  Blacked out or not, I'm pretty sure it wasn't actually a five-star bar."
"I really like this place. They have a great booze selection, the prices are extremely reasonable and every staff member I've ever encountered has been incredibly sweet. The DJ is always playing good music, too. I've never tried the food (I didn't realize they had such an extensive menu) but I think I will make it a point to eat something next time I'm in. The only con I can think of is that it can get very crowded on the weekends, but really what bar doesn't?"
"So, I'll just start out by saying that my boyfriend tells me this of the men's bathroom at Five Star:""There are tits on one wall, and motorcycles on the other.""...I mean, need I say more?Oh, I suppose I will.  Five Star has $6 burgers (and not some whimpy lame burgers, these are gladiator-sized burgers!) on Sundays that are really, REALLY good.  Their ""stoner fries"" are incredible, and they have a great booze and beer selection.  They play great music (New York Dolls?  Yes please.), and for the bro in all of us, have sports playing on flat-screen TVs above the bar.  There's a pool table in back, and plenty of seating to go around.  Five Star also hosts motorcycle nights quite often in the summer, themed by the type of bike--for example, there's a British and Mods night (Triumphs and scooters?), a Japanese night, etc.  I plan to attend a few of these.The bartenders aren't cunts with fake tits, either, which I've learned to appreciate.  I really love this place.  Five stars for Five Star."
"I enjoyed this bar, came her on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. Unfortunately a Blackhawks playoff game was this same night so by the time I got to Five Star, I had already been at another bar for a few hours. The place was crowded but I liked the crowd and the bartenders.  I will definitely visit again and have a better review next time around."
"I stopped here last night after the hawks game to grab a burger! It was amazing!!! I got the 5 star burger, which was  burger with cheddar, bacon, and a fried egg on a pretzel bun. I must say, this burger is up there with Kuma's. The burger is huge, and they give you a ton of fries! YUM! can't wait to go back!"
"I just wasn't impressed by the prices. We ordered 4 draft beers and the total was $36. That's a little outrageous. The atmosphere was nice - dark, quaint, and not too loud. There is ample seating, but the bar gets crowded and it's hard to move around comfortably once they've reached capacity. I suppose you could say the same for many bars."
"Good for drinking. Food is pretty sub-standard. The menu sounds good, but they just don't deliver on the quality."
"The definition of ""trying too hard.""  A friend of mine used to live around the corner and this was our local option for drinks.  I've never tried the food but the beer and whiskey menu is pretty great.  Never had a complaint about the brew options.  But it's so loud.  I always leave a little hoarse from straining to have a conversation.  And before you all think I'm a fifty year old man, let me add that I don't always go at like 11pm on a Saturday.  This is like 8pm on Tuesday and the like, when the place is mostly empty.  Why does it need to be that loud?  It prevents the place from being a joint where I can go for a beer and a conversation.And then there's a little room in the back with a stripper pole.  Granted, it was fun.  But really, Five Star?  Is that bringing in the locals?  If so, turn the music down and introduce me to one."
"this place has its moments.no its not the best food, drink prices can be cheaper, though selection is good enough to let your throat get well lubed.the music is on the mo betta side than the sucky played out and the servers are good people.yeah, add this review to the list of my suky words and thoughts, so sorry you had to waste 13 seconds to read this.;p"
"This bar has a cool vibe but is somewhat small. We came in around 12:30 and tried to squeeze 7 people into a booth... so they let us have the back room which was really nice (and the server awkwardly tried to tell us he wasn't telling us to use it just because there's a stripper pole). The pricing here is pretty good (at least, on liquor... I didn't get the chance to eat here as the kitchen was closed), but our server really sucked. My friends all ordered a specific kind of whiskey (and coke). The server instead gave them non-alcoholic lime juice which apparently has a similar name? I don't know if she was new or what, but she was quite huffy about it when my friends pointed out the difference. I just think she should have maybe asked first since it's a bar and the majority of people do come there to drink?Nonetheless. I had a great time and the back room is really nice. And yes, there was some pole dancing going on."
"Always a great bar with great ambiance, good staff and an excellent selection of beers and other libations."
"Just my kind of place.  An upscale rock and roll bar where I don't feel like an asshole because I am not sleeved.  Take a shot of bourbon with a Miller High Life back - and no worries because you won't get any  ""my band is better than your band"" attitude at this place.  Hot chicks with tattoos make nice nice with the average white folk.  So you can feel safe in that Patagonia jacket of yours.  And you're also totally welcomed in your skinny rock pants and your 80s revival haircut too.I ran into Casey Affleck and his wife (meadow tyler?) one night.  But mostly, I just run into my other aging, rock and roll friends who now have ""real"" jobs too.Oh, and they also have fairly good bar food.Good pointsCheap bourbon, hot chicks with tattoos, album side CDs played, Guns and Roses videos played too, stripper pole, clean bathrooms, great DJsBad pointsWeekends can be a little TOO normal.  Weekdays are better.  2 O'clock license, this place would be great if they had a 4 o'clock"
"Did someone say stripper pole? Gotta love a bar that allows its patrons to make a complete ass of themselves on a stripper pole. Sometimes there are some lovely amateurs working it(clothed of course). While other times you have my jackass friends and I looking like idiots. The pole aside, service is good and decent crowd. Good brews and love $1 mini sammie night on Mondays."
"This place is really good for a bachelorette party.  And that's what I am basing my review on.  My friend had dinner at Flo and then we walked the 5 steps over to Five Star Bar.  We had the back room to ourselves, which was nice since there was a good size group of us ladies.  As we walk over, lo and behold, a pole.  Perfect!  The bride had taken pole dancing classes at Flirty Girl Fitness so she showed us some moves.  The pole did move which was some what dangerous.  At some point of the night, she did get a monster bruise.  Poor girl!The server we had was really on top of things and even offered free shots a couple of times.  Great service.  As for the rest of the bar, I didn't really venture out past our room so I can't comment too much on that.  Overall, this place was a lot of fun.  It was awesome that we had the room to ourselves, even if we did have male crashers, and that we had the pole to entertain all of us!  As I write this review, I notice I am promoting other businesses as well.  Go there too!"
"They have a Wednesday wing special. They are pretty decent, nothing to write home about. In fact, they are quite forgettable but when you are underemployed and craving some wings, they'll do the trick.And they usually have a decent selection of beers, which I can never argue with.Still not digging the luxe rock n roll thing, but not a bad place (on an off-night)."
"Definitely a staple in my bag of tricks for a night out. The concept is great: old school tattoo flash wallpaper; stripper pole in the back room ( I highly recommend renting out if you have a large group of people going); good food and large portions (specifically the cheese fries and the chicken fingers). They have a fairly large beer list as well as cider ( which earns points with me).Cons: On weekends the yuppies tend to infiltrate the space and the music grows progressively louder as the night wears on until it is impossible to carry on a conversation ( its a bar not a club, no need to crank it up so loud)."
"*Yelpettes on a stripper pole*That should be reason enough for you to check out Five Star.Plenty of seating for your larger groups:  around the bar, at tables on the side, and 'round the stripper pole in the semi-private room in the back.In the interest of full disclosure, I came here after a BYOB dinner down the street at which I had an entire bottle of wine to myself.  Let's just say I was in too jolly a mood to notice things like the breadth of their beer selection (I can tell you they had Guinness, however, so I was a happy girl).  My sights were set on the stripper pole, libations be damned."
Had a hard time deciding the star rating for this place.  Came a little later on a Saturday night and it was a sparse crowd.  Drink were a little over priced.  Pretty regular/unmemorable place.  Maybe a three star.  I might check it out again some other time.  Beer list not really that great.
"Most important lesson of the weekend: Apartment hunting makes Amanda C. cranky.  This sort of crankiness can only be solved by patience from the apartment-hunting assistant and cold beer.  Preferably drank whilst seated on a patio.Lo and behold, we found the solution to my nearly tear-induced frustration: Five Star Bar!  Hoo-Ray!  Not only do you have patio-seating on Chicago Avenue (great for people-watching), you also have lots of cold, delicious brews on tap.  Talk about a solution!I enjoyed a Bells Oberon (hello, summer, I know you're a-coming!) and we shared some stoner fries (basically, your average fatty-mcfatty nachos with fries instead of chips...yessss) and mini-sandwiches with pulled pork.  YUM.  We had way too much food, but just the right amount of beer.So, kids, we learned an important lesson: Feed Amanda C., give her a cold beer and some peeps to look at, and she'll be a much more pleasant girl.  (Oh, and if you could find her the perfect one bedroom with no bugs, without her having to look for it, she would be positively delightful to be around.)"
We are Bourbon drinkers and heard about this from another bartender downtown.  LT was behind the bar and we explained what we usually like.  Tried some new bourbons that we will probably would not have normally.  Since we are from California won't come back each time we are in the city but definitely would come back again.  A little out of the way by CTA but you can easily take a cab.
Fast and good service and some of the best fries I've had in a long time (served with aoili). The corn dog was very good as well. Vienna beef perfectly fried in some tasty batter. Next time I want to try the mini burgers...
"I'll give this place three stars for my food but my friends food looked like it deserved four or maybe even five. I had the caesar salad which had way... too much dressing but it came we like 10 huge fresh grilled shrimp which were amazing. One friend got the pulled pork which came with fried pickles, one a burger with a fried egg and one had a grilled cheese and soup which looked amazing and according to my friend tasted amazing. The service was also great. Honestly one of the best waitresses I have ever had. So attentive and nice. Only negative is they had a very strange movie playing in the background. Had a lot of gore which was not very appetizing while eating. I will be back for sure if I want something really fattening or a lot of grilled shrimp."
"Ok, yes, this isn't my ""scene"" but I'm up for doing new things. Hell, it was a new year's resolution of mine: broaden your horizons Doris, get out of the comfort zone! And I did, I did!!The waitress who served us was really nice and full of tattoos. And I loved the rock music they had playing (although I prefer 80s cheese metal!!!!)The patrons were a bit of a mixed group; some uptight yuppies who kinda looked like us... and ok fine I get it; I will leave the Gucci purse at home next time I am here.Oh and does anyone know the Tommy Lee wannabe?"
"Five stars for Five Star! Har har har.No, but really. I lived directly across the street from this place for a month last summer when I was crashing with friends. Needless to say, we frequented this place quite a lot.The staff: adorable/hot/cute/sweet/nice. The food: really awesome. The burgers are delicious. I went last week and got the spin dip and the grilled cheese and soup with a friend. Both...amazing.Plus the traditional tattoo art everywhere? SWOON. Nice patio outside plus the HUGE windows open up. Plus a pool table in the back...TVs that show sports to weird obscure movies. I love this place, I really do."
"I thoroughly enjoy Five Star.  Good beer prices, a whiskey selection that only Delilah's has rivaled in my experience, good daily specials, occassional free shots.  They put crack in the sauce that goes on their chicken wings.  The music selection is better than your standard fair.I have come to this bar on a number of occassions with wildly variant groups of people and always had a good time and received, at the very least, adequate service.If you happen in and see my friend Dre, say, ""Hello, Dre!"""
"Five Star is the best, i saw it on Chicago's Best and I have been like 4 times. I love the food specials. The waitstaff are super friendly and I seem to always find parking, withut having to drive around for hours. I have never had a bad experience. If you want cheap, but good eats, this is the place for you!"
I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that the only reason I remembered ever being in this bar before was because of the stripper pole room.  The only other thing that I remember is that they make a really yummy basil and bourbon drink.
"This place is cool for all types... you get girls in heels, skinny jeans, betty page look alikes, tats and khackis....drinks are reasonable- always have specials-front tables are cool-- and $5 burger and fries all day Sunday is rad."
"Recently I went to Five Star three times within a two week period and I can say I did everything that one could do at Five Star and it's a consistent experience to say the least.You'll find what you're looking to drink (or something comparable that's cheaper,) you can pay with a credit card with NO minimum amount (which I always love,) and I had a more than pleasant experience with the staff on two of those occasions (shout-out to Gigi.)In the end, Five Star gets a three star because I don't feel like it's the spot to go to with a big group. On one of these nights, I had a group and we reserved the back room with the stripper pole for free. We had fun taking turns, but the wait staff were visibly annoyed that they had to deal with a group, period. At least wait for us to start breaking shit or passing out on the floor before you give us attitude! Then, the music is blasting with no floor to dance on so you're stuck with shouting conversations over a big crowd trying to yell over you, all of which is being drowned out by music that I guess keeps the DJ from having to listen to us morons."
"I really enjoyed Five Star. Hell, after 17 giant plastic cups of red wine at Old St. Pat's Block Party, what didn't I enjoy?No, really, I mean, even if I hadn't peed all over myself in a port-o-potty earlier that night I probably would still love Five Star. It's a super fun atmosphere. I love the area and the giant front windows that open as doors are perfect in summer.I drunk ate a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delish. Then, I came back this week to eat it sober. Still delish! The menu isn't huge, but it's great bar food. And it's one of those good bars that enters you in a raffle for pitchfork tickets for every 312 you drink. Love shit like that!I'll be bach!"
"It was a Thursday night.   Hustled across the street from Butterfly for a few beers before meeting with the group at Thursday hot spot Cans (yea, I said ""hot spot"")Friendly staff.  $3.50 PBR pints and $5 312 pints.  Nothing out the ordinary.  The crowd was very tame and it was fairly empty.  In fact it seemed eerily tame for spot that has a private room with a pole in it.  But I dig it.  Cool decor and comfy booths.I counted 9 bald men over the course of an hour and half in this place.  Just my observation for the night."
"I don't remember the last time I ate here but I really enjoy this place. I went to play pool by my lonesome last night and the cute guy waiter helped me on my game! It was awesome, I love that. Made me feel fine about being at the bar playing pool by myself!"
"I miss the hungarian hot wienersomethings they had years ago.. does anyone know what I'm talking about? Anyhow this has been and will remain a ritual stomp. If you're into being regular, this is the place to hang. I was there with a ""first timer"" buddy of mine about a week ago and caught KISS Phantom in the Park.. and a little Psycho Circus on the PA.. very nice! I look forward to catching some old school Priest and Maiden concerts on the tv there from time to time..."
"Came here one evening with my friend Gabe and Donny. They played a bizarre movie. They played portishead and radiohead while i was there. Had woodchuck cider, any place that had woodchuck cider, I am a fan of. Towards the end of the evening they gave everyone a round of shots as a thank you for stopping in. There's a pole in back. I'd go back."
"It is true Five Star bar is actually a 3 star bar in disguise.  Even on weekdays when the after work crowd rolls in the music is too loud to have a conversation where you're not shouting.  However, the weekday specials are a great reason to get a cheap brew and some wings to go with it, just go with someone you like shouting at!  I also agree with other reviewers that some of the drink prices are a little up there for Noble Square/West Town. I've eaten there twice, the veggie burger was mushy and meh.   My grilled cheese was okay.   In sum, I never suggest this place to my friends when we are going to meet up somewhere, but I don't protest when they do suggest it."
"Five Star Bar serves my favorite chicken strips in the city.  They also have great beer and whiskey options and daily food and drink deals.  Bartenders and staff are always helpful and ready with an Old Crow shot, whether you need it or not. . . I like this bar."
I moved away quite a while ago but I am really disgusted that a place like this is in my old neighborhood. Popped collar stripe shirt meatheads infest the place. Sports on way too many screens. Dumb girls drunkenly attempting the stripper pole. Echhhh.  This is where the general population of Chicago is headed. I miss the bar in the back of Rothschild's.
"I have been here several times and I always enjoy it. Never have I had a better time at Five Star than I did last night!!! My friends and I came to check out the free burlesque performance by Michelle La'mour and the Chicago Starlets. Amazing! All the performances were great. Who doesn't love pretty ladies shaking their goodies?(tastefully)   Our waitress was so good. She kept our glasses full, brought us several rounds of shots on the house, and even brought us waters without having to ask.  We ended our night on the stripper pole. Obviously inspired by the wonderful Starlettes. Five Star, bring these ladies back!"
"I went here when they first opened up as it's a block away.  When it first opened up it was one of the only bars in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised.  When it's nice out they open up the windows in the front to let a breeze in.Wednesday nights they have 25cent wing night, and surprisingly, the wings are REALLY GOOD.    Like really really good.  And they are huge and wonderfully seasoned.  And wash it down with a $2 can of Tecate (though now it's $2.50/can).  Bad things about wing night - it's virtually impossible to get a seat if you go during peak dinner time.  My bf and I had to sit at the bar right by the server area so I kept getting bumped.  Service was S-L-O-W - both our waitress coming to check on us and the food.  Food took 4EVAH to come out.  As much as I want to go back for wing night, I don't want to have to go at 5pm just to get a seat.However, each and every time I go here, I like it less and less, to the point when I hear Five Star, I say ""PASS - I'll just go home.""  Why?  Hmmm....Clientele - there's just something weird about the mix of people here, it makes me uncomfortable....  Whenever I walk in, I really see a sausage fest, which isn't a bad thing, but the guys are... different.  I feel looked-down upon because I'm a little pretty looking, and everyone here tries really hard to be a ""rocker""Bartenders & Wait Staff - they're a little scary - got to admit it.  Stuff on TV - They're always playing something weird on the TVs here.  One time it was Clockwork Orange, other times it's like those 1950s black and white filmes with the girls with black hair that tie each other up.  I can't enjoy myself while watching stuff like that - gives me the creeps.Music / DJ - The music in here is just G*d awful.  I can't believe how anyone can sit here for any amount of time and enjoy the music.  We were sitting in the back room one time (the one with the stripper pole) and we requested a song from the DJ and he was like ""naw man, that's not rock music!""  Oh the DJ, don't get me started on the DJ.  He's just a coked out mess.  And he's rude, not even a friendly cokehead.  He asked my friend if she wanted to go to his car and have sex with him.  WTF?Needless to say, we haven't been back since, but at least it's a funny reason why."
"Five Star is the perfect spot to grab drinks with friends and people watch. I love their bartenders - all incredibly friendly and uber brew smart. Their food is pretty good - I love the Sid & Nancy! Huge bonus for the outdoor seating in the summer, the stripper pole in back (I swear, I've never been on it!) and the great, realaxed, punk atmosphere!"
"I guess it's only proper to give Five Star 5 stars, right? The lovely Angie guided our group to this spot after her poker night once we decided not to let the night end there. Good strong drinks with a stocked bar (complete with my beloved Sailor Jerry), good music, friendly bartenders, a fun and diverse crowd all greet you upon entering Five Star. We easily scored a table big enough for 10 on a Friday night, allowing maximum people-watching by the front door. You'll have to venture back a bit to find the infamous stripper pole but it usually proves entertaining once the alcohol begins to flow. Five Star is the kind of bar you can wander into wearing jeans and chucks, and as that's basically my uniform that's just perfect for me. So save me a stool, pour me a Sailor Jerry and Coke and I'll be back."
"I stopped by Five Star the other night after a softball game... $8 for a shot and a beer, AWESOME! The bar tender was nice ~ although she didn't ask us if we wanted another round ~ we had to ask her for it... The bar wasn't crowded so I kinda expected her to at least ask us. No biggie... Would I go back, ummm yeah. :)"
"MisfitsRamonesIron MaidenElvis - segues into......the Fifties...     and thenJonathon RichmanRun-DMCThe topless bartendress with pasties pours me another Makers. Five Star, I'm really starting to like you."
"[+] Plus: Huge beer selection, Amazing music selections, Interesting mix of people (including all those tattooed crews that I love), Decent food, Outdoor seating, Several flat screens featuring a basketball game or 70's porn, Male staff who wears an anchor/sailboat sweater, Rockabilly female staff.[-] Minus: Stripper pole (it's silly and trashy - you're better than that Five Star), Food is only decent, Small population of yuppies/douchebags.All in all, I really enjoy this bar.  Not only for it's proximity to my apartment, the relatively cool crowd and the enormous selection of beers but also because the music is so crazy good.See you soon Five Star!"
"Went here with the guys last Saturday and had a good time. Let's go with the good first:- It has that sports bar feel, but the ambience is totally different. What I mean by this is that the sports bar staples are there )such as hd flatscreens, pool table, and bar tables), but there are some interesting stuff on the wall like old concert posters and just naked pictures of women in the men's washroom.- At least during the night I went, the music was very eclectic. The music ranged from indie 80s music to some classic 90s hip hop. I enjoyed this very much.- The atmosphere to me was very diverse, and the people seem to genuinely enjoy being at this place. The crowd was very mixed with young hipsters, skaters, the ""older"" crowd, and insert your group here. It was definitely eclectic.- The service is very good even on a busy night like last Saturday. The waitresses got the drink orders right and even had the chance to ask us if we wanted another round.The bad?Honestly it was a little too loud, but really what can I expect from a sports bar? It wasn't as bad as going to a club or something. Finally if you don't like crowds, then you should check out another place especially since it seems like this place is crowded on the weekend.Basic Bar + Interesting Decor + Good Service = A Great Time"
"usually come to this spot for cheap wings and cheap beer.  Wings a bit spicy but are delish and fries are generous.  Brought a whole group here once and we were lucky to get the back room with the pole. lots of fun.  Other than wings and beer I can't comment on much else, but honestly, what else do you want to eat at a bar? Wings and fries are staples in bar food.  ;-)"
"five star has what i think are the best wings in Chicago. come in on Wednesday for wing night (and $2 tecates), and expect to battle for a table between 5.30 and 10.00.. as they do not take names or reservations, expect to wait and if you dont elbow in for a table it will be taken by the more frugal. wings are easily good enough to pay full price on any other night and much more relaxed. i have tried some of their other foods and was impressed.. also has a nice selection of burgersbeer selection is spot on, lots of good drafts and a slew of bottle beers.. five star is owned by the same owners as big star (wicker park), and they seem to have good relationships with craft brewers because they are constantly bringing in good brews. five star has really good music as well, patio isnt bad in the summer either."
"Neighborhood bar with a stripper pole ?  Hells yeah!Besides the stripper pole in the back room (which you can reserve), its a pretty standard bar.  They have daily specials - on Wednesday its $0.23 wings (used to be just 10 cents).  I went on a thursday and had a $1.50 corn dog  - not bad - and a ginormous pile of fries.  Holy crap it was huge. And PBR specials .. but also have tasty beers on tap like goose island and mad hatter.  Don't forget the friendly and hot staff.  Mmm-hmm."
"Decent food, atmosphere derivative of the Sunset Strip, ok beer selection, but one major issue.This place is so obviously trying to be ""rock and roll,"" with the stripper pole and all the old concert posters.  However, DJ's are the MOST UN-ROCK thing in this f*cking world!!!!!!  DJ's are for Randolph street dance clubs, not ""rock and roll"" bars.And guitar hero Sundays?  Give me a break.  This place is the most grossly homogenized bullshit version of a rock and roll bar I've ever seen.  It feels like the Disney World version of the Whiskey a Go Go.Wanna really be rock and roll?  Two words.  Live music.  Go to the places Chicago's *real* guitar heros call home.  Cobra and Double Door.  And the Hideout... and the Abbey... and the Empty Bottle... even Estelle's.Wanna be trendy and suck ass?  Get some crappy ""classic"" tattoos, watch your ugly, pasty Starbucks employee friends play whore on the stripper pole, and watch American rock and roll get replaced by a no- talent idiot hitting play on a CD player at 5 star.This place is everything that's wrong with the Chicago music scene."
"2 stars only b/c our server was one of the friendliest I've ever had.  My fiance could've filled a 5 gallon fish tank with the amount of water he kept asking for.The beer selection was nice but the mixed drinks options were slim to none - they offered us flavored vodka mixed with pop or you could have lemonade with vodka in it.  Fancy....The worst part: the people who were there (not us, of course..hahaha).  But seriously, the crowd  was so rude.  My group literally got booty-bumped from our waist up (even on the head!) at least 5 times.  Why couldn't you just say ""excuse me, can I get through?""  And since we were next to a corner pocket of the pool table, it was worse - the players wouldn't even ask me to move for a second - I would only know to move over b/c the pool stick was hitting my shoulder or once again, I got a butt on the back of my head.RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The service is TERRIBLE.  We had to wave down the bartender to get any drinks at all and as well as menu.  Once we finally managed to get a menu, about 15-20 minutes later, the bartender came, didn't ask if we wanted anything, and just took the menu! Wow! Never seen anything like it before.  I had to wave her down again, distract her from picking at her nails or something, to get the food and after all that  the food was average at best."
"Great buffalo wings, crunchy chicken tenders, a Hendrick's gin & tonic and Sex Pistols playing in the background.  This is summer in Chicago."
I showed up on a Saturday to see Michelle L'Amour and her Starlets perform and it was packed! The atmosphere & music (Ting Tings come to mind) were great and of course the lovely ladies were amazing!!The drinks were strong and reasonably priced. They had a good whiskey selection and nice drink specials. The staff was busy but friendly. I'll be back.
the stripper pole makes me want to vomit on so many levels.but i love the beer selection and the actual layout of the bar.a good place to come to on a weeknight.
"Great Bar and Staff...Live in the neighborhood and have been coming here for about 2 years now.  Personally, Sunday is my favorite day cause it's a little slow, but that means the pool table is open and I can take full advantage of the $5 Highlife + Shot of Jameson special....Takes Sunday Funday to a whole new level...  Yes, there is a stripper pole in the back that I've seen in use several times.  THE FOOD IS AWESOME!!!  Love their French Fries, especially w/the Cheese Sauce... And for all you vegetarians there is a superb over-sized Veggie Burger....Wed-Sat is very busy in the evenings....One other thing that I really like is that they usually have games on all the TV's but they always have one or two tv's on Snowboarding or Surfing or Skateboarding....Definitely come to 5 Star..."
"Sure it's a little yuppie. Sure it's a little glam. But there is something about Five Star that keeps this little bohemian coming back. It may be the mere steps it takes me to get there, but I like to believe it is the excellent drink selection and energetic atmosphere.My whiskey drinking pals love this joint. They've got everything from Kentucky bourbons to the finer Scotch imports. Personally, I opt for the Sailor Jerry rum or a cold draft. The beer selection is great, and so is the food. They take typical bar food and kick it up a notch by preparing it well and slapping a catchy name on it (i.e. the Syd & Nancy).Nightly specials help sweeten the deal by offering $2 beer (usually trendy selections like Tecate or PBR) and rib-sticking grub like $1 corn dogs or mini sandwiches. Typically drinks range from $5 to $12+ and menu items are $8-10.Ending there my rating would be 4/5 because of the price, but I must go on to say this joint hosted my bridal shower. I had a great time in the stripper pole room, opening gifts and sipping drinks with 15 of my favorite girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon. An edgy place like Five Star deserves 5 stars for making a girlie event like that totally memorable."
Cool locationCool staffNice patioStripper pole!
"3.5 Stars.Yelp needs to let us go half-sies, because this place is right between a three and a four star.  I read a review questioning the stripper pole.  Boo!The stripper pole makes five star rise in the ratings.  I was there on a Saturday night and saw two girls getting busy on the pole.  For a lonely drunken single like myself, seeing one girl hide her hand up the skirt of another girl rocks.  The waitstaff and bartendresses are great looking and fun.  A couple Sunday's ago after Kanye at Lolla we came to Five Star and had a blast.  They had this douchebag DJ that was jamming regardless of the lack of company.  My calf was sore the next day from pounding on the floor to the beat so hard.  The few Sunday night patrons were undoubtebly annoyed by our drunken enthusiasm, but fuck them.  We had five people, two hours and a $165 tab, but we drank like we'd been walking through the Sahara for days.I've noticed the daily specials, good for Old Style and whatever they need to get rid of.  One night I was there and they had a burlesque show.  There were girls making out who no doubt hated my penis, but I still enjoyed the show.  It gets packed on the weekend and I like it.  Never tried the food, but if you're a dipshit like me you should have fun."
"I recently went here with a couple old friends.At first I wasn't too impressed. The place seemed to have an abundance of hipsters and it was pretty tightly packed. The overall looks and vibe of the place were pretty good though. If I were to review at that moment it would have been a 3.After making my way to the bar I was pleasantly surprised to find they had two of my favorite beers on tap: Gumballhead and Two Hearted.Ok 5 star you've now made it to 4 stars.After sitting at the bar for a bit we managed to snag a booth and the night got much better.Our server was pretty awesome. Attentive, fun, and she even brought us a free round of shots.These are all great things, however it still would have left as a 4.What knocked Five Star Bar into the 5 star rating was the music.For awhile it was hit and miss but the hits were excellent hits (enough to where my battleship was sunk). Myself and my friends all have varying eclectic tastes so we're a hard group to please.However at one point they played a song by the Murder City Devils that none of us had heard in public. After the song was over I went over to the DJ and thanked him for being awesome. He then introduced himself to me and asked if we wanted to hear anything else.Shortly there after I got one of my favorite songs in the world, Epic Problem by Fugazi.Thank you mister DJ whose name I've now forgotten (I blame this on the free shots miss waitress).To top it off its like after that the guy had my tables card and just kept playing great stuff all night long. I'm sure it was easy to tell how much we liked a song judging from the amount of singing and air drumming coming from our now very alive table.We had planned on hitting some other bars but we were having such a great time we stayed at Five Star for the whole night.I will happily be coming here again, and soon.(I didn't eat so no comment there, also who cares about the stripper pole folks? its free entertainment!)"
"Wings and Tecates on Wednesday are great. Hard to get a table at times, but that's my only complaint. Dope spot."
"Oh, 5 star.. I'm so conflicted.  When it's quiet or happy hour, I wanna give you 5 stars.  but then the weekends come. As do the yuppies that clog this place like a douchebag explosion.So, I'll focus on the weekdays. Nicole and Rachel are great, and are quick to pick up names/orders. $2.50 can specials, but trust me.. go for the 5Star Pale ale, brewed for them by 2 Brothers Brewery. Only whiskey selection that beats theirs is Delilahs."
"Came back Saturday for some of the food. We shared 3 appetizers and one of us had the Tomato soup and grilled cheese. The cheese in the sandwich was still cold and un-melted, and they kindly remade it for her, but shesh, it's sad to see a place mess up such a basic thing. I really loved the chicken tenders, and would highly recommend them as a meal, even though they were listed as a starter (if my memory is right). The chicken was juicy, crunchy, and very much identifiable as a pounded chicken breast. The three mini sloppy joe's were o-k. I was a little grossed out by the ""cheese"" on the nachos. It was that orange stuff you'd get at 7-11 that (i think) comes in a can, so it tasted fake as hell. To be fair, I'm going to recognize that this place just isn't my scene. Like the cheese on my nachos, i think it's incredibly fake."
"bow chicka bow chicka bow wow wow.  (that scene from 41yr old virgin, as Andy takes his shirt off for the crazy chick- hilarious). Some how this place reminds me of the scene, and I have know idea why.  Maybe its the stripper pole in the back room?  This place is awesome for people watching.  I love watching people test their tricks on the pole.  The bartenders are pretty good looking, as are the patrons.  They have a pretty mixed crowd. I love any place that has a Lagunitas IPA on tap.  The decor is interesting and perfect lighting for a good night.  This place is just right.  No need to change a thing!  I can't wait to come back for the summer mo's with windows open to the sidewalks.  Good music to dance to or just bob your head."
"I miss Chicago Bars and FIVE STAR is on the top of my list.I've celebrated everything from Halloween, Bridal Showers, NYE, engagements, or just a good old night out at FIVE STAR. Drinks are stiff and service is great.A warning, once you do a few spins on the Stripper Pole you will wake up in the morning with a mega bruise on the inside of your thighs and sore arms.Damn I wish I could put this bar in my pocket and take it everywhere."
"I have never figured out what kind of crowd this bar is trying to attract. I love the foxy rockabilly-esque waitresses, but this place seems to be full of overweight middle aged men whenever I go by. There's no dance floor, yet the music is always far too loud to carry on a conversation. Communication is impossible, and you can't compensate by grinding the evening away.Their food is mediocre and overpriced for what it is.I do love the Betty Page films that are sometimes playing on the t.v.s. The decor is stellar. Drink prices are average to high. Don't take a date here unless you're sitting outside and don't expect much from your dinner."
"I am back and forth with this place. I've been here probably 4 or 5 times total. The first two times were great. We sat at the bar and got wings on their wing night (Wednesday, I believe). However, the last two times have been complete busts and that makes me mad, because I like the location and the menu and the beer, but ugh. Bad service is a deal-breaker for me.About two weeks ago, we went there after work, so probably about 6:30 or so. It was a Tuesday night and it wasn't too crowded. We grabbed a table up front in clear view of the bartender/waitress. We made eye contact. Then we sat there. For about 10 minutes, with no one so much as telling us they'd be right with us, or even to give us a damn menu.So, we left.Tonight, we came here again, because I figured I might as well give them another chance. Bleh. This time, we DID get waited on when we walked in, but after that the waitress seemed to disappear. I saw her. She was at one end of the bar. Reading. Yes, she was reading. I turned around and looked directly at her and FINALLY she looks up, comes over, and asks us if we want anything. Mind you, it had been at least 10 minutes since our table had been cleared, so of course we wanted the effing bill.Not cool. Sorry, Five Star. Get some new wait staff and maybe I'll be back."
4 stars for 5 star. I went here to have a few pints on a beautiful Chicago spring day. Based on this I feel you should try it on pleasant Chicago days. On this day 5 Star was great for watching the people and day go by.It has an extensive beer list. Our server felt it was the best beer list in Chicago. (I know better and clearly she doesn't get out much :-)) The beer list is impressive even though a bit pricey. My teammates ordered the food and I took nibbles from their plates so I can't and won't judge them on this. I hope to return because the staff were friendly and generally it was a fantastic experience.Oh yes. They have a stripper pole in the bar that seems to be a highlight of the bar.
I've been coming to 5 Star since 2007 and I just love it.  Its my favorite neighborhood bar.  Its such a chill atmosphere and its never ridiculously crowded.   The food is great.  I especially love their fries.  The wait staff and bartenders are always really nice.  I have as much fun coming here on a Thursday night as I do on a Saturday night.
"First trip to Five Star yesterday afternoon.  I'm torn on this review because the bar is cool, drink selection great, and the food was good.  BUT the service was horrible. Sat at the bar and tattooed female bartender provided no service unless we flagged her down and specifically asked her. She wasn't surly - just ambivalent.  She never checked on us even though bar was pretty empty - but she did spend plenty of time texting and chatting with other employees"
"another place i avoided cause of a stupid crowd but if you can get past that or get in early this place is aweet. $5 beer and a shot. served on sat by awesome bartender, mentos. ask for her. funny cute blond. stripper pole in back room. cool. vintage porn on the walls in the mens room. padded leather wall at the booths and lots of light. fun artwork, and the old pontiac sign.!go there. now. hi mentos."
"I am sure a lot of people are familiar with this West Town spot. So I will be short and direct. It is a great place for a mid-week drinks or even a dinner/snacks. The food menu is good - good burgers, amazing nacho fries(very recommended!), good wings. Love the beer list and other drinks are real good too. Had a gin tonic (not complicated, I know, but still very easy to screw it up) last time I was there and I want to say- one of the best in the neighborhood. They know how to mix it right! Plus weeknights staff knows the drink list and tried it all - they are real good to recommend you whatever your heart desires, just tell them what are you in a taste for!I am not a fan of weekend nights there. Seems like a different crowd comes in and the place kind of looses it's authenticity. Lastly - lazy Sunday afternoon seems to be not the best time to go for a beer to Five Stars. Unfortunately staff is slow and not that friendly. Though as I mention before - drinks menu is great, so if you are willing to trait a  somber-tired-bored looking staff for a good few beers - that is your place."
"Great music.Great service staff.Fun decor.Good food.Don't mind the mix of multiple flat screen sports junky-meets-old school tattoo parlor ambiance.Clean bathrooms.Stripper pole invites drunken stupidity.Layout is a bit awkward, crowded.Hate the douchbag clientele trying to ""buy cool"" by frequenting a bar touting it.If friends want to meet there, fine (except NOT on a Friday or Saturday night). If I never go there again, also fine.The place means well...."
"On Wednesday 13 cent wing night, ask for the wings extra spicy. They add some kind of chili paste to the buffalo sauce that adds some nice heat. Definitely above average wings."
"This place is awesome. Great bar food, tons of whiskey, great specials. There's also a pool table and a back room with a stripper pole, the best part of which is watching drunk people fall off of it. They also always have weird funny old kung fu movies or bettie page videos on."
"Hipster central. Had a great time, but I def felt like my hair was not quite angular or teased enough, which is how I tend to feel in hipster settings. Nevermind that though, the bar was hopping, the beer was cold and well priced , the music was singable and I had a blast.  Too bad it's in noble square or I'd go again."
I love Five Star more than dingleberry muffins and soft rock sensuality.
"So I live literally a block away from this place, and for some reason kept myself from visiting for about two months.  Don't get me wrong, it looked pretty cool from the outside.  I mean, a huge glowing neon sign?  How can you GET much cooler.But seriously, I eventually heard that on Wednesday nights they have ten cent buffalo wings, so armed with the knowledge that I could get at least twenty sub par quality buffalo wings for about two dollars, I ventured in for the first time.I was pleasently surprised.  The buffalo wings were really, really good.  And my friend who is a vegetarian ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which was similarly very delicious.  And I didn't even know this whole time that they even served food.  I just thought it was an uber-trendy bar.  So I had a few beers and a few wings and was happy.Until I got the bill.I was a little surprised at the cost of beers there.  I mean, don't get me wrong, the prices weren't exorbitant, but they were surprising, especially from a place offering ten cent wings.  But, I suppose that's how they get you.All in all, I will be returning to this place, especially since it's down the street, but I will be watching what I order drink wise (though they do have a two dollar tecate special.  REDEMPTION.)"
"I went out Saturday to four different bars and this was the last of the night. Out of the four, I liked five star bar the most because it seemed the least pretentious, had good doormen and attentive bartenders  (tight black tee shirts and nice bods).  People seemed really nice and chatty.   The drink prices were just fine, but again, I'm used to paying LA prices for cocktails so this place seemed pretty reasonable. I love the signage and decor and the crowd was pretty diverse and easy going. I'd definitely hang there again."
"I have only been here early on the weekends and on weekday evenings, so I can not speak to the Friday/Saturday night crowd. I like 5 Star for:- It's relaxed atmosphere- The good music they play- Extensive selection of GOOD BEER (I am a fan of any bar that has this)- Good food- Decent weekday deals- The layout, which is conducive to a chill evening with friends"
"Five Star isn't like all the other bars. You walk in and you don't see one kind of patron you see a diverse group of people have a good time. The staff is friendly and helpful. Finally a place were the waitstaff doesn't mine asking you how you are doing. The food is good bar food and the price isn't bad. My only issue with Five Star is the music can get too loud for you to talk to someone but that only seems to happen in the evenings. Another awesome thing about this place in the summer its a nice place for a weekend lunch and cocktail. The decor is different in a good way. You have posters, dolls, and stickers. Its just a fun place to go and hang out."
"I like the 5 Star, really I do. They have one of the best selections of bourbon, scotch, and rye in Chicago. In fact, I think they are one of a handful of bars in Chicago that actually carry rye. The bartenders here are all top notch. Great people, very friendly and always quick to offer you a free shot..... Which brings us to what they do wrong. Old Crow. I hate Old Crow. There is a reason why Old Crow cost all of about 9 dollars a bottle. Why 5 Star? Why do you want to be known as the Old Crow bar? I've actually refused free shots. It's crap and they shouldn't have their staff push it. Drink prices- insanely high. When the hell did Makers Mark command an 8 dollar price tag? Food- average at best, although I do enjoy the chips and salsa. Mini-burgers are good, as is the spinach salad and pigs in a blanket. Stay away from the gyros; until I see the big spit revolving and the Kronos Central poster somewhere I'm not ordering a gyro here ever again. Music is always pretty good- Thursday night is by far the best night in my opinion.  I can hear the smiths, cure, depeche mode, and new order all in the same night. How can you beat that? The crowd is pretty diverse, yuppies, rockers, and the softball jocks that stumble over from the park. Dcor- the 5 Star gets an A plus for that. The owners did a beautiful job on the build out. The stripper pole room seems like it was an afterthought and is kind of out of place. Bottom line- I would come here more often if the drinks were cheaper and the staff didn't try to drown me with Old Crow."
"After reading reviews from fellow Yelpers, I thought that Five Star would be a great place to start a very long night on the town. It wasn't! At 7PM on a Sat. night, this was not the place to be...I would guess that the stripper pole would beckon the late-night crowd. The beer selection is probably their prime boasting ground. Aside from that, the menu is very lackluster (even for bar food) and the service really isn't too cordial. Overall, a bit of a disappointment."
"Never thought I'd find myself having a great time in a new yuppie-ish looking bar sitting in a room with a fucking stripper pole.  But alas, I was having a blast here.Maybe the $2 High Life pints clouded my judgment somewhat, but I thought this place was really great, especially being with some fun friends.  It was awesome getting to make fun the Lincoln Station crowd without getting our asses kicked.  It's kind of strange -- I think they don't put as much testosterone in the water on this side of the river or something.  The Thursday DJ was incredible.  He even busted out some Op Ivy!  Now that's something everyone can enjoy.  If you have a good group together, just take over the stripper pole room and have a good time.  (Probably wise to stay away on the weekend... too many lost bros and trixies wondering where the hell Halsted and Armitage is.)"
"How can you beat 25 cent pigs in a blanket?!  You can't.I get so tired of trendy bars with crappy beer selections... Five Star stretches, especially their bottle selection, and achieves one of the best selections I've seen in Chicago at a bar that is not ""eclectic beer-centered."" (ie: Map Room)The pulled pork didn't blow me away, but the fries are great.  How can you knock a place with awesome fries?"
"I've been here 3 times and now and have come to the conclusion that this place is one of the portals to hell that's ruining the neighborhood. Terrible service at the tables, high priced drinks (or at least the garbage wine I had was $$$) and the cliche' Urban Outfitters decor all make this place an unsavory hangout. I'd rather settle in over at the Rothchild Liquors bar. At least there isn't a shortage of personality there."
"Meh. I went here last weekend before the smoking ban went into effect, so hopefully within the next few weeks after the stench settles it will be better. That was my biggest complaint.There was plenty of room to sit even though there were a lot of people at the bar, the staff was friendly, my martinis were strong, but there was nothing really different or special about this bar that made it stand out to me. Overall, it's decent but underwhelming. I'll probably come back again though, because it's right down the street from my house."
"I've found this place is a choking bore. Consistently.There's just nothing going on, the well drinks are $7, and they play cock rock videos all night long. Ironically? Maybe. It's hard to tell with all the strutting and preening, but it's still no excuse. The decor is bland but struggling- somewhere between Hot Topic and Vegas- complete with pole/party room, which remained unoccupied for much of Saturday evening.Overall, the female bartenders tend to be friendly and attentive, and not just to my male companions. One star for that."
"I went in there with a couple friends on a sunday night and the bartender was pretty bombed.  It was hard to get a beer even though the place was pretty empty.  When we first came in I bought the bartender a shot and she bragged that this was her 14th.  14th shot!  Good god lady!  It's your job to be sober so I can get drunk!  I complained to the manager at the end of the night but he accused me of yelling so he walked away and was a dick.  The music was so loud you just kind of have to yell the whole time anyways.  In short, the food is bar food, the manager is a douche, and you probably aren't tatted up enough to get quick service.  Go to cleos and get better service and better drinks."
"STRIPPER POLE (that spins!)The crowd sucks, the food sucks, the music sucks, the service sucks, the beer options suck, the prices suck.STRIPPER POLE (that spins!)The people who yell at you for using the stripper pole (because you're blocking their view of the Cubs game, even though the cubs are down 0-7) suck.    The DJ who doesn't have any decent music and says ""maybe Antrhax?"" when you request Journey sucks.STRIPPER POLE (that spins!)The only redeeming quality of this bar is $2 tecate cans (still overpriced I'd say) tuesdays, and the opportunity to bring all your sweaty dirty friends here and slowly edge the yuppies out of the back room so that your drunk asses can all take turns spinning on the pole and leaving scuff marks on the ceiling with your skater/bike shoes."
"Since Melanie V. gave me a shoutout, I'll give her one, too!I came here with MELANIE V. on a Friday night (totally spur of the moment; we actually tried going elsewhere first) and had a great dining experience. It wasn't crowded when we got there, which was good. We found a table instantly. Our waitress was friendly and came back to check up on us frequently.And now, the main event:I had a burger with bbq sauce and bacon...cheese and the usual 'burger veggies'...and it was de-licious. Cookied perfectly, arranged perfectly, and tasted perfect to boot. The fries were also very good. I tasted Melanie's 'asian' dressing and it was really good! You could really taste the sesame flavor, and I can imagine what a different experience her salad was compared to other salads with basic dressings (french, italtian, etc.).It started to get crowded just as we were leaving, and seemed like it would be a happening joint in the late hours of the evening. I'll def. have to come check it out at a later hour next time.Melanie V. -- You up for it? Heh heh."
"Great atmosphere and beer selection, but the DJ was horrible!!!!  The music he was selecting was okay, but his transitions were abrupt and lazy.  It really killed the mood!  We ending up leaving to go elsewhere."
