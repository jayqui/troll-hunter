Kitchen 17
"What an awesome, unassuming restaurant! I went on a Sunday for lunch and we were able to grab a table immediately. The restaurant is small, and doesn't seat many, but the food is outstanding. Coffee and water are complimentary. I didn't see any cream or sugar sitting out, though.I checked the menu beforehand and was armed and ready when it came time to place my order, which you do at the counter. I got the California ""burger"" and for an extra $2, got a side of the nachos. DAT CHEEZ SAUCE THO. I couldn't believe that it was vegan! The nachos were so warm and comforting and even had kale on top. Perf. The burger was large and also had kale on top. The avocado underneath the party was perfection. Checkout was quick and via iPad. I'll definitely return! Judging by the reviews, it seems that I simply must try the deep dish pizza!Check their hours though - I have tried to go here once in the past and was met with a ""closed"" sign."
"I literally live two doors down from this place, and have wanted to try it since I saw pics of the food on a vegan food blog/tumblr before I even moved to Chicago! I've been a pescetarian/sometimes veg for the past few years, and I don't hide the fact that I love a lot of ""fake meat"" type products. My husband, however, is a diehard carnivore and would rather cut off his arm than accompany me to a vegan place. Anyway, one night last week, he wanted sausages for dinner so I decided to get takeaway from Kitchen 17. I called in my order for a bbq cheddar ""burger"" and mac & cheese. The person I spoke to on the phone said it would be half an hour, so half an hour later I trooped down to pick up my food. The inside was a cute little cafe, and I paid via debit card on one of those ipad card reader things. The chef came out with my food right as I got there, which was awesome, it was almost too hot to eat when I first got home. Everyone was very sweet, they offered to wrap up my burger since it was almost too large to fit in the styrofoam container. The burger was so good! The grilled shallots really made it, although I was disappointed to see shredded fake cheese on top instead of the cheddar sauce that had been described on the menu. Even better: I made my husband try a bite and HE LIKED IT. I was so shocked. We wound up sharing it because he liked it so much. He even said that we would have to go there again and try different things on the menu. The flavor of the burger was so good, really fresh and delicious. The taste was also not unlike meat, which is probably why he liked it so much. The mac and cheese was.. well, vegan tasting, haha. Not really like cheese, but if you know that going in, you might still dig it. It had a nice umami miso-type flavor, though, and was really yummy in its own right. And for $9 total, it was really quite a lot of food. I was full after half of the burger and half of the mac and cheese. I will definitely be coming back here, with my carnivorous husband in tow."
"After a weekend filled with a humidity & the sweltering heat advisory, I felt the need for a cold, refreshing super salad, it happens. So after reading the stellar reviews here & knowing Kitchen 17 was close by I called in a to-go order, for what else, a salad. I was told this was a cold salad with kale, brussel sprouts etc. & the description was true, but I was expecting something more. For some, a salad can be boring, for someone with a passion for food, health & creativity... a well made vegan salad can be epic.I should have noticed the word salad wasn't high lighted many times in reviews but I wanted to give it a shot, especially when this place has been compared to Chicago Diner & Native Foods, which are phenomenal vegan options. Anyway, this review is purely based on one experience and one menu item I've tried or more like ordered, picked up and got home and didn't eat. It wasn't a freshly made epic salad. The salad was basically part of a pre-packaged kale (kale, carrot, red cabbage), 2 shaved brussel sprouts, half dice/sliced tomato, canned/jarred roasted red pepper, pitted kalamata olives, a few slices of kalamata olive and a creamy dill dressing, which was on the salad.Normally salad dressings are on the side when you're getting a to-go salad so it doesn't make the salad slimey. And I get it, maybe not this time because it was kale but kale doesn't break down unless something acidic is added, which it wasn't, in which case, the kale was dense and chewy. Maybe the dressing was chef prepared, don't know, don't care. I could have picked all the ingredients up and spent less than I did on the one, lazy vegan salad.For those who love it, great, keep going. Not trying to sway you from the business, this is just my honest review of my experience. Other than that...it didn't seem like the cleanest place I've gone to, especially with the front & alley door being open on such a hot day... but maybe that's excusable since it was 30 minutes before closing, who knows."
"For vegan food that doesn't taste vegan you can't beat this. My husband - a major meat-eater - raves about this place still. The menu changes randomly when the chef/owner wants to switch it up, so keep that in mind if you check out the menu online or like something below.Loaded Nachos - to die for! Made with nachos topped with crispy kale and black beans, taco meat and nacho cheese the two of us ate this right up. Ideally you should probably share this with 3 or 4 people if you're also going to be getting main meals.Gyro - to die for! (I know I also said the nachos were but this is out of this world!) Being a vegetarian for 8 years now I miss the concept of a good gyro. The seitan is grilled perfectly and the tomato/cucumber medley with the flatbread... honestly DO THIS!There are also vegan baked goods so we took home a blueberry cupcake and you never would have known it was vegan.Overall this place can't be missed. It's super small though (fits 15 people tight) and they don't do reservations, however they do carry-out so if it's too crowded to sit you can place your order and take it with you. It might not be the cleanest place but it's because the chef is so busy creating delicious new menu items.Simply put - GO!"
"Vegan comfort food at its finest, with ingenious preparation, combinations and textures. Everything's yummy and some things are off the charts delicious. I cannot get enough of Chef Don's tomato/marinara sauce. It's the absolute best, could eat it alone with a spoon (and have). So anything with that on it is a must. The pizzas are all incredible, the fast food burger is so satisfying it should be illegal. And don't miss the peanut butter cake if he's baked some. Really anything at this place involving Chef Don's homemade sauces and/or dough or batter is addictive!"
"WOW! just wow! we had the Philly Cheestake, the Fast Food Burger and a chocolate cupcake and I have no pictures to share because once we took a but we could not stop! sooooooooo good."
This place is awesome. If you need a break from the rut of routine vegan and you want true home cooked meal or truly amazing deep dish pizza without compromise or rockin cookies this place is for you. The Greek salad with homemade vegan feta cheese is truly amazing.  The staff is so nice and kind. It's just a gem of a place in the crazy city.
We came here one more time and enjoyed a delicious meal. Crab cake sandwich and the Greek burger. We had a cinnamon roll as dessert. I do now understand the freshness of the concept and that he runs out of products because he cooks with homemade items that himself prepares. We will be back for more vegan / vegetarian food.
The place is very welcoming and has a home cooked vibe. It has a rotating selection of vegan options. I had the Molé braised tofu tacos and they were amazing! We also tried the gyros and nachos which were really great as well. The consensus was that the Gyros were the best. Would recommend for anyone to try when in Chicago.
"I so wanted to like this place.  It gives me no joy to give a less than excellent review for Kitchen 17, but I'm going to be honest.  The front window was dirty, and in such a small space with such a big window, it cast a dingy look to the entire place.  Music was way too loud, causing the people at other tables to have to yell to be heard. The service was friendly, but inattentive; I sat down for over ten minutes before being told my order would be taken at the cash register, 7 feet away.   My sandwich was just okay, barely.  The hummus was quite tasteless.   There is nothing one would call decor.   An odor of burning oil hung in the air much of the time.  If this place wasn't dedicated vegan, I would have given it one star, not two.  There is a note on the wall indicating that one should not think of this place as a restaurant so much as the owner's kitchen.  My experience was that it certainly didn't pass muster as a restaurant."
"I finally got over here this past weekend.  I have been wanting to try this place forever.  One of my employees gave me a restaurant.com certificate for this place at Christmastime.  Even though they are no longer on their site, the owner allowed us to use our coupon which I really appreciated.  Now, on to the food....We each ordered burgers.  I loved that they are homemade.  I could get a gross store bought vegan burger any time.  These burgers were simply delicious and different than any I have ever had.  The toppings and sauces were great.  I had one with grilled  onions, Teese cheese and avocado.  Wow, was that great.  My boyfriend had one with buffalo sauce.  It was so tasty, but I liked mine more!  WOO HOO!  I also got a side of the ""chicken"" and dumpling soup and my boyfriend got a side salad.  They were just awesome.  For dessert we got a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie,.  If you like fudgy rich brownies, those are for you!  I will definitely be back and am looking forward to Deep Dish Wednesdays...."
Everything I've ever had here has been awesome! Their deep dish pizzas are amazing!!!
"Kitchen 17 never ceases to delight. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff are polite, friendly, and quick. Plus it is byob so enjoy a tasty alcoholic libation with your excellent vegan meal. Pro tip: try (and probably fail) to save room for dessert because it is always amazing. But even if you don't have room, get the dessert to go because their baked treats are wonderful; especially the German chocolate cake. What are you doing still reading this review? Go to Kitchen 17 now!"
"Umm they have vegan deep dish...need I say more?Deep dish is a special on Wednesdays starting at 5pm and good golly is it delicious. My boyfriend and I have been on the hunt for the best vegan pizza in Chicago and this place has made the list for sure. We also got the spinach artichoke dip, and that was freaking awesome too."
"Awesome food! I am not vegan, came with a friend and loved all of it. Must visit for anyone hanging out in Lakeview."
Yummy food and the dude who runs the place is super nice.
This review is just for the cookie.. The cookie was kind of dry & top of that $4.5 .. Way too overpriced
"Awesome food, and great service! The owner Don is a great guy and you can tell he really loves what he does. This place is the definition of mom and pop. Don even will make special order carob chocolate desserts if you give him 24 hour notice. The food is fantastic. We are looking forward to comming back to try even more of the menu."
"I'm in the south loop and if I had the time I would, daily, make the trek to this place- it's that's good. Everything I've had from this place has been amazing (things I remember fondly: hummus with pita, Greek buffalo burger, spaghetti bolognese, BBQ cheddar burger, strawberry cheesecake, california burger, but honestly everything is pretty damn good). What kitchen 17 has, besides delicious vegan goodies that rival the taste, texture and conscious of any meat eater, is a wonderful Chef/owner and its super rad attitude. As it is stated inside the restaurant, this place is outside of matrix. It's not your typical restaurant, it's truly an engaging and personal experience. Imagine you're sharing your time and space with an amazing vegan cook who is also your host inside his kitchen. This is what kitchen 17 is trying to deliver. Leave any assumptions and presumptions of what a traditional restaurant should be like or feel like. Engage in either light banter or be bold and open up and have interesting and real discussions. Above all, have fun and enjoy eating."
"Adore Kitchen 17! Vegan comfort food made by a super passionate guy! Whether you eat animal products or not, go check try it, I know omnivores that crave the burgers from Kitchen 17. Greek burger, Buffalo burger, Chicken & dumplings soup, all of it is inredible. Here's a hint though, skip the desserts. I've tried them every time I go and I've never had one that I cared for. Still 5 stars though because of the food!"
"Checked out randomly while looking for a new and interesting place to eat.  Not like anywhere else on this strip: it was pretty much a one man show, very boisterous funny talkative guy making the food, ringing up, cleaning (a bit of food strewn about)...the instant effect was to feel like you were in a fun person's living room waiting for them to whip something good up in the kitchen.  The wraps and hummus were quite filling, took a little longer to get than the average place but it didn't seem terrible since the place is so likable.  Closed a little early since they ran out of food!   Great neighborhood place"
"Fresh & flavorful American classics reinvented into Vegan delights!I brought my parents here over the weekend - neither are vegan - and wow were they impressed. We shared the pepperoni pizza, jerk chicken sandwich and meatball sub. All were superb. My dad, who loves a good meatball sub, actually said it was the best he's ever had. Impressive!!"
"I'm really surprised that no one has commented on the cleanliness of Kitchen 17 yet. I have eaten here a few times over the past year & while the food is very tasty, if not incredibly unhealthy, I was extremely disappointed by the lack of attention to keeping this place clean at my latest visit for my friends birthday. There were old splatter marks and mess all over the cooler behind the counter, dust and crumbs everywhere, there were dirty dishes left out on the table behind us for our entire stay of about an hour, and the kitchen from what I could see did not look clean in the slightest. Additionally, the owner was covered in food smears and spills and whatnot, and I know he cooks all the food himself,  but it suggests to me that he wipes his hands all over his apron which idk, that kind of grosses me out. Another thing that really rubbed me the wrong way is that we were greeted upon walking in, and looked at the menu for about ten minutes, finally decided what we wanted to order & the owner came by and said he was out of half of the things on the menu.... That's understandable, but why on Earth would that not be the FIRST thing we are told upon coming in and browsing the menu? The owner is super nice but extremely talkative and very loud. It would be nice to have a more quiet intimate dining experience as this is a very small and intimate establishment. It is off putting to hear someone talking about politics and music loudly while I'm trying to have a quiet conversation with my party. All in all, the food is really yummy and I do feel slightly guilty leaving this review because I genuinely want Kitchen 17 to succeed, but all the yummy food in the world won't get me to eat at an establishment where there is no attention to cleanliness regardless of having a busy day or not. The place is super tiny and there is no excuse to not wipe down a cooler, clean the dirty dishes off the table, or sweep once an hour or so. If a clean restaurant is not your #1 priority in dining out, the cheese fries are the bomb, the deserts are always incredible, and the gyro is outstanding. I will still be back eventually, but hope that the owner takes these comments to heart & it will be cleaner next time."
"We have ordered: Gyro sandwichGreek buffalo chicken sandwichPhilly cheesesteak pizzaTaco pizzaChili cheese burgerPizza burgerCheesecakeEverything has been utterly vegan fabulous. Mind blowing food. Our meat-eating family stared in admiration while eating their greasy burgers from 5 Guys down the way. If the owner, who is awesome, wrote a cookbook, he could make some serious dough. Pun intended!? But for real, share how to make that cheesecake. Do cooking classes & let me get in on the action!!! Maybe its better I don't know... LOLExcited to order more from this local gem & to come back for the very anticipated Sunday brunch starting this week!"
"Listen up... Kitchen 17 is flippin' delicious. I've been here a bunch of times and I've never gotten something that wasn't amazing. The Buffalo Greek Burger, deep dish pizza on Wednesdays, Pot Roast Stew, nachos, chicken tacos with mole. Not to mention free coffee to go with the desserts which are some of the best, if not the best, desserts in the city... vegan or not. Plus, it's a local business run by someone who is very passionate about food and cooking, always changing and bettering his recipes and coming up with new, amazing, creations. Go in have some amazing (vegan) food and put your money into a community restaurant- it's a win, win, win."
My friend and I were hesitant to try this place because we're both meat eaters and the menu was full Vegan. That being said- after our first time we've dined here three times in the last two weeks. Yeah- that good.The BBQ chicken sandwich and Gyro were our favorite dishes on the menu. The BBQ sandwich leaves the best taste in your mouth- flavorful and hearty. The gyro? An unbelievable combination of vegan and Mediterranean food. Definitely recommend getting it with the hummus on the side.The best thing on their menu is hidden: it's the homemade Ranch dressing. Seriously- dip everything in it you won't be disappointed.We've ordered both the chocolate chip cookie and pumpkin pie for dessert- sweet and scrumptious.The atmosphere is very casual and you can bring a bottle of wine or beer to accompany dinner. The owner is also the head chef and he's happy to make you whatever you'd like- he wants you to feel comfortable and leave happy.Would dine here everyday if I could!
"Great vegan place! They offer menu items that I haven't seen else where...including PIZZA! It was surprisingly very good! You wouldn't know that everything on it was vegan. But who am I kidding, I'd take a greasy, cheesy pizza anyday.I plan to come back and try other items.It's very small inside. It also seems like they're very passionate about no meat."
"One of the best vegan restaurants I have ever been too. Food was great, not fancy but plain good vegan food. The chef/owner is a very nice guy. I will definitely come back, if I can."
The owner Don is so down to earth and friendly that he will make you want to come back every day! I had the best salad of my life. The loaded veggie and added buffalo chicken. It was UNREAL. I will be back once a week for it. Thanks Don!
"Psst... all the raving reviews your reading about Kitchen 17 are absolutely true.  The vegan food here is delicious! It was a mission to get here (1 hr drive) and parking in the Lakeview community isn't easy, but I was on a mission.  This place makes a delicious deep dish vegan pizza, it might be the only place in the city that does.  I know because I finally able to get one on my first time here this past week (yay). I got the deep dish ""meat"" pizza for the family and let me tell you that everything on it was good from the sauce that tasted amazing to the cheese &sausage/pepperoni didn't even taste vegan. I also ordered a thin crust pizza and I can't honestly tell you which one I liked better because they were both that great.  One of my relatives (whose a hardcore carnivore) ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and was impressed at how flavorful and close it was to the real thing.  We also ordered the nachos.... by far my favorite and my family. ... I almost had to fork fight to get in on those nachos.  The tortilla chips came loaded with black beans,  ground ""meat"",  vegan cheese,  and kale. Now I'm a kale in my smoothie and salad type of girl,  so the thought of kale on nachos didn't sound appetizing to me but am I glad I decided to try because all the flavors came together prefect (I'm actually drooling thinking about those nachos).  We ended our meal by trying all the desserts.  The chocolate oatmeal cookie was my little picky eaters favorite.  My dad loved the chocolate chip/pb tart.  My mom and bro loved the coffee strudel muffin.  The restaurant itself is really small,  hopefully,  the owner will open a second location (hint, hint on the Northwest side please ;-) ). He is also a pleasant person and you can tell he loves what he does and it's made fresh in front of  you. On a side note,  once he's out. ... he's out. And the food takes time to prepare and come to your table,  we waited an hour but it was a packed house.    I will definitely be back soon."
"I've eaten here several times. Each time I've tried a different dish based on the chef's recommendations and each time I am blown away by the pride and passion that comes out in the food. Don is an excellent chef, in love with what he does and excited to share the delicious results. Try Kitchen 17 whether you're vegan or not. Seriously."
"Kitchen 17 is one of those restaurants where you can bring your meat-lover friends and trick them into thinking it's regular food and they wouldn't know the difference! Although the quote on the wall might give it away: ""Could you look an animal in the eyes and say to it, 'My appetite is more important than your suffering'?"" - Moby. Shoot, I'm not vegan, but that quote may have just converted me. That and Kitchen 17.It's tiny in here, so it's best to go with a really small group. I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich which came with a small, and I mean TINY, side salad. It's okay that the salad was small, though. It was a simple kale salad, but what made it spectacular was the homemade ranch dressing that came on the side. The ranch dressing was slightly spicy and gave the salad a nice kick! Parmesan chicken was good too, but I just want to eat spoonfuls of that ranch dressing.If you're interested in trying vegan food, give this place a try."
"Kitchen 17 is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Everything is vegan. Everything is wonderful. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday, which is when they serve their deep dish, and it was the best vegan pizza I have ever had. It was certainly worth the understandable wait. We also had nachos and they were very flavourful. We took a cheesecake home with us and that was incredibly delicious as well. I kind of wanted everything on the menu, but I controlled myself. I can't wait to go back."
"This place is truly amazing. Great addition to the city for plant-based eaters. The owner is so nice and the coffee is complimentary -- is this real life?I wouldn't say this is the healthiest vegan restaurant in Chicago, but you can definitely find yummy vegan comfort food that tastes like the real thing (BBQ 'chicken' pizza, gyros, burgers, etc). Also, you HAVE to try one of his chocolate chip cookies. Best cookie I've ever eaten, vegan or otherwise!"
"A vegan pizza lovers dream come true! His deep dish pizza is delicious. The only disappointing thing is they are only available on Wednesdays. He has gotten into the stomachs of Chicago vegans and created the vegan equivalents of what we loved before we made that compassionate choice. Nachos, Mac and cheese, chocolate chip cookies, burgers, sundaes. Chef Don is very involved with his customers and is always asking for feedback. He has a table set up out front where you can see him mixing up some of his delicious dishes. It's a small, cozy place with a very welcoming atmosphere.  Take your non-vegan friends to show them how good vegan food can be. It's not a vegan comfort food place. It's a comfort food place that just happens to be vegan."
"NOT your average restaurant, vegan or not.  If you're uptight, this is not the place to go, there are many idiosyncrasies that can be quite frustrating that I will not list here.  BUT, if you love generous portions of home cooked vegan dishes at a very reasonable $8 or under, this is the only place in town!  I particularly liked the Rosemary burger and nachos, both served with the super-lettuce, kale.   Be sure to read the manifesto posted on the wall, it sums up the owners attitude to a tee.  The chef/owner is 'the dude', and keeps what looks to be a custom guitar hanging on the back wall for what I'm guessing are after closing jam sessions.  Some tasteful classic rock was playing during our meal. There's no table service, and expect to hear some people yelling at the chef in the kitchen from the front of the small dining room.  As I said, not your average Chicago establishment."
"I had high hopes for this place given the great reviews, but wasn't too impressed. I ordered a couple items to-go for my first order earlier this month:- chips and guacamole ($4): this was comprised of chips, guacamole, and regular salsa. First, it did not come with sour cream, as advertised on their online menu. Second, it came with WAY more chips than available dip (there would have been way too many chips even if I had gotten the advertised sour cream). Reframed, there was way too little dip for the amount of chips! Third, guac was a little brown - it clearly was not that fresh. Fourth, the salsa just ok & a little more watery than I prefer. It didn't taste very fresh. Fifth, and lastly, the chips were either a little stale or a little too thick, or both. I definitely would never order this again.- buffalo wing wrap ($6): this was quite good and very flavorful. A little too spicy for me, but I'm a wimp. I kind of expected the fake meat to be heated up rather than cold, so I think I'd request that next time.The guy who rang me up at the counter was very friendly. I thought it was a little odd that he asked me if I wanted a bag since the food came in 2 separate boxes and it was just starting to rain outside, but props to him for being environmentally conscious. On the other hand, both boxes were made of styrofoam :/One final detail -- when I got home and saw the Square receipt in my email inbox, I noticed I was charged for a beverage tax. First, I did not know that Chicago had a beverage tax. But, more importantly, I did not order a beverage! It's only 1%, so it's really nothing, but I still found it surprising & rude on principle. Be more careful or fix your system!Although my appetizer was total crap, I still would go back consider my main entree was good and the other reviews are great."
"Best meatless burger I have ever had. Cozy, friendly, awesome atmosphere and service!"
Greek buffalo sandwich . GO FOR IT .BTW I'm a non vegetarian . and coming from one this dish was absolutely awesome . full of flavor working together to make it really good.  Nice cafe feel to it with a lot of nice people when we visited . very friendly owner and the main guy there . good job with the place . Hope to return soon and try out a lot more . First vegan place I've said I'll go back to. :P
"Best vegan place in Chicago. Even my sister, who is always at best suspicious of vegan food and meat substitutes like seitan, really raved about the food here when visiting (especially the hummus and Meatball Sub).We love Don the owner - he is at least 50% of why else we love this place other than the food. He provides free coffee (!), good advice, and is a joy to talk with.The sandwiches, pizzas, entrees, everything is great but save room for dessert! His choc chip cookies is now the only one in the city I'll have! But he has great cupcakes, coffee cake, and many, many others, always changing. It's small, which I love, but be prepared - only 5 or less in your party. And it's BYOB. If you don't like this place, you are nuts or your taste buds may be damaged, so seek help immediately!"
"First off, I'm not vegan, but do appreciate good vegan & vegetarian cooking when it's around.I met a few friends here rather late one night, not long before closing. Don was tired from the day's work, but invited us to stay, gave us samples of coffee cake while we waited (""the slices are too small to sell""), and prepared some very good wraps for us. It was just the right amount of food, and delicious."
"Great place! Flavorful, affordable, and an awesome addition to the list of other awesome vegan restaurants in Chicago. I don't live in Lakeview, but I will try to go here instead of Native Foods when I'm in the neighborhood!"
"I would give this place zero stars, if I could... I called in an order about an hour prior to wanting to pick up, and the person on the phone said it'd take about 45 minutes, to make a pizza that they had none of the ingredients for... Then on top of that they didn't take down my name, or number. Then when I got there they said that their oven was way too packed for my order but the pizza was ready, just not in the oven and it would be another forty minutes to bake a vegan pizza. There was literally no one there. So, in retrospect, they probably should have asked for a number to keep me updated on something like that, right? Also, I asked for spinach on my pizza, mushrooms, onions and green peppers and the person that I spoke with said they had NONE of these ingredients, however serve salads and sandwiches? This was the worst experience ever, without even trying their food. It sucked because I was really excited, but when I walked in the person helping me said so matter-of-factly that they didn't have room in the oven for my pizza, which was incredibly rude. Sucks, I was hoping to try deep-dish from here some day. I suppose now I'll just wait for the owner of this establishment to try and discredit what I say on this review like he always seems to do, and then say ""I'd love to remedy the situation..."" and leave it at that without offering a way to do so."
"We had the Buffalo Burger, the California Burger, a brownie and an amazing chocolate chip cookie. All incredible as owner makes everything himself. Best Vegan burger I have EVER had..and the desserts were divine..chocolate chip cookies better than Toll House non-vegan. Can't say enoughAbout the food and the flavor!  Definitely go there!"
"The guy who own this place is awesome!  He is super passionate about his food and only trusts himself to cook, which I love! Because I have food allergies I'm always worried about cross contamination when eating out.  He calmed my nervesMy wife and I went there with another couple and here's what we got.  A gyro salad that made special for us because my wife and friends wanted to try the gyro.  I didn't eat because I'm gluten free.  They said it was awesome!  For dinner I had the Mediterranean salad with falafel.  The salad had high quality ingredients, and the best artichokes I've ever had but the dressing was just okay.  My wife and friends got the buffalo burger & they said it was awesome.  Among the 4 of us I'm the only one who is vegan & gluten free and everyone loved there food.  So even if your not vegan this place can be amazing!  The prices were cheap, the food was organic, high quality, great service, owner passionate, and great tasting food.  The only negative of this place is the ventilation was horrible, my eyes were burning the whole time I was there.  However that won't stop me from going back.60% of the menu was vegan & gluten free, rarely do I get that many options!  I highly suggest and we will return."
"Came here a coupe months ago with a few people.  I got the Rosemary burger and it was pretty good.  The ambiance here is nothing special, so perhaps getting the food To-Go is a good option, especially if you live in the area. I was hoping they had wheat bread/ wheat buns, but that was not an option.  Overall, the flavors are good and there are quite a few options.  After reading some other reviews here, I would come again to see what else there is to eat."
"I just recently became vegan and so my mother and I were researching recipes and places to eat. She told me about 'Kitchen 17' I was excited to try it out.   When I walked in, I was surprised by the small space and setup of the place but with a mother who owns a restaurant herself, I know that it's not always easy to afford the finest space and furniture especially with a type of food that most people don't choose.   I looked at the menu and was surprised to see some great options. There were nachos, sandwiches, deserts, and more! I was eager to try the Caprese sandwich. I absolutely loved it and was surprised at how much I enjoyed the eggless bread. I had to try one of the deserts as well so I got a brownie. Which was also amazing.   One thing that really made me LOVE the place was the owner. He seemed to know almost everyone that walked in and he seemed super kind and passionate about his work. He was communicating with everyone in the cafe and making everyone smile.   I will absolutely be coming back here. This place is amazing and if you want to become vegan or if you're just a stubborn person that needs convincing that vegans can have amazing food, I definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to come back."
"DELICIOUS! My roommate and I went to Kitchen 17 during the middle of a snow storm as it was the only restaurant open. We both had the burgers and they were out of this world. She had the buffalo cheddar and I the greek. The burgers came with a side kale salad and a fantastic dill/ranch dressing. Don, the owner, is amazing but he definitely needs to get the other two cashiers/servers up to pace. They did not know a thing about the menu."
"I went here based on a vegan blogger's recommendation. Despite everyone else in the restaurant raving about how good their food was, I was pretty disappointed with the taco pizza. It seemed like it was made in a rush and just wasn't anything to get excited about. It was sloppy-- didn't have much cheese and was doused in hot sauce. It didn't live up to the hype at all. I'd have been much happier with making my own pizza at home.But the two people working were very welcoming and perhaps just overworked that night. Or maybe I chose the one ""meh"" thing on the menu?"
"Went here for the first time tonight with my wife and daughter for my birthday. We're always looking out for vegan places we haven't tried out yet. It was an excellent experience. I knew going in, based on previous reviews, that Kitchen 17 would be a small place and table busing would likely be minimal. That did not deter me. What encouraged me was noticing how the owner Don would personally respond to mediocre or negative Yelp reviews with an apology and with humility. I like that. We had the nachos (black beans, fake cheese and meat & kale) and the deep dish pizza (seitan sausage/pepperoni with black olives) and it was all very flavorful and delicious. I get the impression this is one of those restaurants that people aren't use to. There's a menu, yes, but ultimately it's whatever Don has available that day. So, essentially it really is like you're sitting in his kitchen and seeing what he's made that day. I like that too. It reminds me of how I used to hang out in my Sicilian grandmother's kitchen and wait for her to tell me what she's cooked up. What elevated my Kitchen 17 experience was Don's attitude though. The dude never stood still and was cooking up a storm behind the counter, trying to keep up with all the deep dish orders (apparently it's a thing on Wednesday nights), but the best part was how accommodating and full of life he was. Sure he looked sweaty and borderline exasperated but he obviously clearly loves what he's doing. Respect elevated. After a while the place was packed, with customer's standing around - either waiting for a table to open up or waiting for their preorder to come. That's a testament to the reputation this place has rightfully earned. To up my experience even more, I struck up a conversation with a regular named Danny as I was waiting to pay (and as he was waiting for his preorder) and when he heard me mention to Don that it was my birthday, Danny bought me a vegan cupcake to take home! Thanks, Danny! Needless to say, I'm spreading the word about Kitchen 17 and definitely coming back! Thanks again Don!"
Great homemade BBQ sauce! I also loved the Swedish meatballs. I wish I lived next door.
Food is good here. They have plenty of options. However the place is small and it can get really crowded if all the tables are full.
"This place is wonderful!!!!! Great for vegans and people looking to branch out of meals revolving around meat. Very casual cafe. If anyone chooses to eat at Native Foods instead of Kitchen 17 - you are a fool!I've been here twice. Everything is well-seasoned and incredibly flavorful. The chef/owner is extremely personable and willing to explain the menu. I was waiting for my carryout order and overheard a couple asking about the menu, it was clear they were new to the idea of vegan food, and the chef was giving them the rundown.The best way to approaching meatless cooking is not to try and recreate the feeling of meat, but to use vegetarian cooking to really highlight and bring out the flavor of the vegetables being used. So, the burgers are not supposed to ""feel"" like a burger, but taste delicious on its own - this is exactly what the chef told the curious couple about the menu.Ask about the California burger - it's not on the online menu and it sounded delicious. I had the Cheddar melt, black beans, and lentils. It was perfect."
"I love their food. It's probably my favorite vegan restaurant. I think they still have a lot of growing to do though. I don't like to eat-in because almost always the tables are filthy and we have to clean them ourselves. But they have rules about what food you can take to go, like the specials are dine-in only. Things like that limit how much I go there because I don't want to deal with other people's food on my table but I also can't get what I want to go. But, despite these things, it's still my favorite place because that's how good the food is."
"I went here with my vegan friends and had a delightful meal..pizza supreme, pizza cheesesteak, chocolate tart dessert, cheesecake dessert and a chocolate chip cookie dessert. I am not vegan but will go back. My vegan friends have a hard time finding new places where we can go together and enjoy.Delicious!!!"
The food is super tasty.  Go there.
"I just can't say enough about this place. I am sorry it's been so long since I've been back... we dined there yesterday and ordered a bunch of stuff... ALL of it was delish. The desserts, the ruben and the shawarma ... and right now I am eating the breakfast burrito we bought from the deli counter-- - all fantastic!I'm just sorry they don't haven't opened one in Edgewater. We could use a place like this."
"I hate to be the first person to give this establishment a 2 star rating, but Kitchen 17 does not live up to all the 5 star hype.  I understand a lot of people are upping the rating because the owner is really nice - he is, and that makes it hard for me to give a negative rating.  But I wouldn't be fair to others if I just gave them 5 stars because of a nice manager when I clearly intend to never dine at K 17 ever again.  Also, feedback is important to restaurant owners so that they know what works and what doesn't.My dining partner and I ordered many things from the menu so I feel fairly confident that my rating is warranted.  Also, when we finished our meals we both made the observation that nothing appeared to be made in-house, each entrée seemed to be thrown together with store bought ingredients.The Food:- Nachos:  VERY average.  The nachos were covered in black beans, TVP, canned salsa, vegan sour cream, and a tasteless vegan cheese (note, this is one thing we think was made in-house, but it seriously tasted like nothing).  You could easily throw this together with a bag of chips, a can of black beans, a jar of salsa, and a tub of Tofutti vegan sour cream - which is what we think they did.- Sloppy Joes:  Not that good and not worth ordering.  There was nothing sloppy about these Joes.  The sandwich was literally bread and dry TVP.  We asked the owner for BBQ sauce and since they didn't have any he whipped up something quickly.  The sauce he made was good and made the sloppy Joes taste much better.- Philly Cheesesteak:  Vegan Philly Cheesesteaks are my vegan food drug of choice, so I've tried these all around the country.  This one was among my least favorites.  The sandwich/seitan was mostly dry, I didn't care too much for the ranch-like sauce on top, but I was happy there was Teese cheese on the sandwich. - Potato Salad:  Never arrived.- Peanut Butter Cake:  This was actually good and would be the only thing I'd eat from K 17 if I were to go again.The Service:- You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you.  Although it's really confusing who to place your order with as the girl that was standing at the register (who we thought would be taking our order) kind of ignored us - but the owner wasn't, as he was the one taking our order.  It was just confusing.- This is BYOB, which is a nice feature.____________________________________Response to the owners comment:I appreciate part of your response.  I don't understand how you can comment on my apparent enjoyment of the food, as you were in the kitchen most of the time.  We knew right away that the sloppy joes were not good, and since you were in the kitchen we waited awhile for you to come out but eventually got up and walked over to the kitchen to ask you for the sauce (which takes time to make).  The other issues we just dealt with, because who really wants to send everything back at a restaurant and complain all night?  Who has time for that?  It's really important to get things right the first time and many restaurants do that.  And not to mention, we were hungry and had places to go that night.  Regarding where to order, we were at the register trying to order, but the girl standing at the register didn't even look up at us.  I don't think a sign is required, but maybe attentive employees would help (or maybe they shouldn't stand in front of the register if they're not going to help customers order food).One last thing that I was not going to mention in the review because I was being nice about it, my boyfriend felt very sick after eating the food and vomited soon after.  We both also did not like the food.  The only good thing on your menu is the peanut butter cake.  I made sure to try an array of things in order to give you a fair assessment.  I travel around the country to try vegan restaurants and feel that I'm well rounded when it comes to vegan food.  Honestly I would have rated your restaurant a 1 because the taste and quality is subpar and the food made my boyfriend sick, but I was being nice with the 2.  But I will rate it appropriately at a 1 now."
Came in with a group of six and was basically asked to leave the restaurant because the cook told us he could not serve more than four people at a time...even though there were tons of tables available.
I'm the most terrible vegan ever because I like to eat like a carnivore and this restaurant satisfies my fatty cravings. I had a chili cheese burger with a salad. Both were delicious. I look forward to trying one of their deep dish pizzas soon :)
"Maybe the food is great... Wouldn't know!  the guy kicked us out because we were a group of 6. It may be great for couples, but don't go with a group larger than two! The guy was yelling at us from the back kitchen, he wouldn't even come out to tell is to leave to our face. He had more than enough tables to accommodate us we were the ONLY ones in there! Remove your tables if you don't want more than 2 people it there! What a rude, awkward experience.... Very awkward man.... Hire someone, your losing business."
Best vegan food in the city. I've tried them all. This is by far the best and so chill. Love it!  Great classic rock always too.
"After multiple visits to kitchen 17 I have to say this is one of my favorite places in Chicago. The food is consistently amazing. I am surprised to see any review say otherwise, considering I have tried the Nachos, Philly ""teese""steak and Taco Pizza which were all very yummy. As for the reviews complaining about not knowing where to order or about missing food it seems like that is a personal problem less than a problem with the service. I don't need a sign telling me where to order or someone to hold my hand if someone forgot to give me an item."
"This place is delicious. I usually get takeout and I get something different every time... because everything is so good!The chocolate chip cookies are seriously amazing - better than any other vegan restaurant cookies I've had. The only negative thing (for me) is the styrofoam containers. But, I understand that non-styrofoam boxes are a lot more pricey. Maybe someday!"
"This is a great vegan option in Lakeview. The owner is personable and attentive, and obviously very knowledgeable about his dishes. The food is pretty good if a little simplistic (like this post), but I'm a fan."
Stopped in here today on a whim and grabbed some food to go. I had the Rosemary burger and a side salad. The Burger was incredibly tasty! It was also a substantial amount for $9.00. I was very pleasantly surprised by this place and can't wait to come back and try more!
I've yet to have something here that didn't make me smile. The buffalo burger was definitely the best though. And the deserts are always amazing.
"Kitchen 17 is an absolute delight.  The food is delicious, and it's prepared with great care.  We had the Buffalo Greek Burger, Caprese Panini, and Hummus plate.  The owner is down-to-earth and personable, and he's created a friendly, relaxed environment that makes the food even more enjoyable.  (And we loved the music he was playing on the sound system.)  We definitely plan to come back."
"Kitchen 17 is definitely one of my new favorites in Lakeview. If you enjoy tasty vegan food made with fresh ingredients and prepared with attention to detail then you need to check this place out. The restaurant itself is quite small and homey, which makes for a comfortable, relaxed setting. I had the vegan-sloppy joe and it was fantastic. Highly flavorful seitan served on a ciabatta bread. I walked away happy and satisfied, and looking forward to eating there again."
"While Don, the owner, was really nice I don't feel I should give this place a 5 just for the personal attention (which is a given with the size and newness of this place.)Had the rosemary burger fixed up per Don's recommendation with hummus and veggies. It was good, but I feel like I can do something like that almost... or rather there was something that makes me feel there could/should be more. Also got the rice with both versions of beans to go and that was really good, but for the price it was kind of expensive.I'd rather go to Native Foods as prices are around the same, but I'll round Kitchen 17 to a 4 just for the nice talk I had with Don."
"Kitchen 17 is an excellent addition to the neighborhood!! This spot on Briar seems like it has a new business every year. I feel like Kitchen 17 stands a good chance of actually making it. I went there last night and tried the Asian Burger ($8) with a side of potato salad ($3). It's not a ""meaty"" burger in terms of thickness, but it still packed a lot of flavor and had an interesting texture (probably due to the tempeh). The burger was topped with slaw a ginger slaw, although the ginger didn't seem to come through. Get a side of Sriracha for this burger if you like a little spice. It really brings out all the flavors. The potato salad was SOOOO good! The mustard-spiked rosemary vegenaise really sets it apart from ordinary potato salad.There's so much on the menu that I want to try, but both of these were great first impressions. Plus, the chef/owner is super nice and you can tell he's passionate about his business. I hope vegetarians, vegans, and even die-hard meat eaters will give this place a try."
"Great BYOB vegetarian restaurant, even (and especially) for those who aren't vegetarian.  There's not a thing on the menu that won't blow you away.  No matter what you get, make sure to get the black beans as a side - the only downside being that all other beans will seem fairly disappointing after having these.Just try it, you'll love it! (and support a local, non-chain business in the process!)"
"Don, the owner, is a very personable, big hearted guy that really knows how to cook!  His food is wonderful comfort food that also happens to be vegan.  I make it a regular stop!  Don't forget to check out his desserts as well.  Love it!"
stopped by this place to grab lunch on a Monday.  Based on the reviews i was looking forward to eating at Kitchen 17.  When i arrived i discovered it was closed so I took a look in the window just to see what it looked like for when I came back another day.  Much to my surprise I saw 2 full tables of food sitting out which clearly had been left from the day prior and left out to sit for 2 days (since they are closed on mon/tuesday).  I can only imagine how unsanitary the kitchen/food must be at a restaurant who's staff can't even clean up half eaten food prior to closing for 2 days..I won't be back unfortunately.
"Oh man, the California burger is one of the best burgers I've ever tried, maybe even the best. And I've tried A LOT of veggie burgers.  The place is small and cozy and, if you find parking, you won't regret it."
"Everything about this place is absolutely wonderful! The man who cooks and runs the place is a great guy, very kind. The food is freaking delicious. The desserts are extremely tasty too! Can't say enough good things about it."
"I recently found out about this place from doing a cursory search for ""vegan"" near me. I was surprised to find a great all vegan place in the city that had been open for so long. I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The place is a bit small, but very comfortable. We started with a hummus appetizer which was fantastic. I had the chili cheese burger and my girlfriend had the cheese melt burger. The house-made patty is unbelievable as is the cheese sauce. I can't say enough great things about the food. However, the real prize here is the owner. He is incredibly friendly and passionate about the food he makes. He made me feel like I was eating as a guest in a friend's home. This place is so great and I will definitely be going back soon!"
"First tried the delicious food at Kitchen 17 about a month ago and I have been hooked ever since! The pizza ( all kinds), Philly Cheesesteak, and nachos are all spectacular and amazing! I love that all of the beverages are complimentary! Keep up the great work!"
"Completely stumbled upon this place while biking today. MADE MY DAY. Being vegan I'm always searing for a new spot, and this place hit the nail on the head. For vegans and non vegans alike, kitchen 17 won't disappoint. The lovely gent that runs it was super laid back and makes a mean falafel. Will definitely be going back often. Decent prices. Comfortable atmosphere. And he makes everything on site. Do yourself a favor and pay it a visit."
"Whatever bumps early reviewers mentioned have been ironed out.  The food here is excellent.  It is like a smaller version of Native Foods.The cheesesteak is a variation of the standard vegan chicago variety, with slices of seitan and teese.  I thought it was juicy and flavorful, and the seitan is homemade.  The bread is really crisp, but it held together well.  This is one of the best vegan cheesesteaks in Chicagoland, though that's not saying a lot.  I'd eat it again though.  It doesn't deserve the emnity of some of the other reviews.Also tried the shawarma,  which I don't think I've ever seen veganized before, oddly enough.  It was excellent as well, with lots of flavor requiring many napkins.The black forest cake is excellent as well, moist with a delicious coconut frosting.Very nice is the free iced tea and lemonade.  You don't see that often.Definitely worth return visits.  Though I know, I should have tried the pizza.  Next time."
