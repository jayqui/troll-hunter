Formento’s
"I've got nonas' meatballs that comes in 3 units with 3 small breads to appreciate with it. The red sauce made with fresh tomatoes, herbs and pepper is delicious if you enjoy spicy taste.We also took the carbonara macarroni and the half chicken parmesan, both unique, never tried something like that before!My wife felt a smell of eggs on their cups, forks and knives, but i didnt feel the same.The place was not full (it was something like 30% occupation) and thats why I think that they could be faster to take our orders.the small problems are not issues, worth due the delicious food."
"The three stars is for the excellent service. On the other hand the food... honestly my friend said it best: it's like a pimped out Honda Accord.  It's Italian food without fuss in a cool lofty atmosphere, but at the end of the day it's just a Honda Accord.  Music was Moby, and other top 40 delights that just didn't fit what they were going for in the space.  Music seemed odd and nothing seemed coherent. Loft, food you could make at home, with Moby. Felt a little odd.That being said if you want excellent service with out anything surprising in your food, this is your place."
"For some reason I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't come up with any reason to deny the perfect score.The vibe here is cool, as many reviews noted. Big space, definitely feels new, but still has an old school aesthetic as well. Let the server help you find a nice glass of wine, it really completes the experience.Really enjoyed the food. The antipasto sampler was perfect for 2 people but could also work for 4. We had the veal and Sunday gravy. Both were really good. Portion was appropriate, we were comfortably stuffed.This is just a good place. Like I said, I can't find anything negative to say!"
"Nice restaurant with good outdoor seating. No beers on tap which was disappointing. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce and noodles were very well prepared, good flavoring. Portion was disappointing. Only 5 or 6 bites and my whole plate was gone. If you are hungry go with a carni or other meat main as the pasta is a very small portion."
"Stopped in for dinner.  Ordered the Roasted Heirloom Beet salad, Calamari Fritti, and Orecchiette & Sausage.  The Orecchiate was served undercooked.  The server fixed the issue immediately.  The service is great.  However, the menu has a limited selection.  The portions are small for the price."
"I know there are so many different factors and variables that go into having a truly great dining experience, but all the stars must have aligned perfectly, because our dinner last night was amazing, memorable and I would recommend every aspect of our meal! Service - our server, Andrew was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and all of his recommendations were spot on. Appetizer - Shrimp Scampi, it was light and each bite was a burst of delicious flavors! The sauce it was served on was so citrusy and complex that I could have drank it.Entrees - I ordered the Scallops. The portion size was on the smaller side, with three scallops, but I was thankful for this. The scallops were cooked to perfection and literally melted in your mouth. There was a variety of textures with some nuts and cucumbers and once again it was served on a well thought out sauce. Highly recommend!My partner ordered the quail, which he states was one of the best meals he's ever had. It's no wonder why this dish has been with the restaurant since it had been open. The highlight of this meal was the smoked cauliflower (who would have thought?!), but it paired perfectly with the juicy meat and crispy prosciutto and made the meal!Dessert - I'm not the biggest fan of sweets but even I had to admit that the chocolate cake was decadent and delicious. I'm all about texture and there was a nice crunchy component in a few layers which really brought it to the next level! Drinks - Having recently come back from a trip to Singapore, it was a pleasant surprise to see a Singapore Sling on the menu! It is a great refreshing summer drink. I think I've raved enough, but you really can't go wrong with the shrimp scampi, scallops and quail"
"Formento's is a YES! OMG how cute and sexy are you smack dab on good ole restaurant row? That's right I'm talking to you Formento's. It's just a gem! My gf and I hit it up on Saturday night amidst the taste of Randolph crowd. I was a little surprised to see tables available seeing as it was a busier-than-the-rest Saturday night. So I thought to myself hmmm why is that? Well, it's because its HUGE! There are rooms upon rooms and little hidden coves (as least it seems) inside in the joint. So cool. The vibe, as I mentioned, is uber sexual. Drinks....were do we begin. The wine list is comparable to a novel. Pages upon pages of delicious wines. You can seriously show off your wine knowledge here, or in my case, lack there of. I went with a traditional Cabernet and boy was it robust. Hell, I even had a second glass;) my gf went with a red Zinfandel which is traditionally lighter...and muy delicious as well.Food: the menu is diverse filled with old Italian classics complete with a modern twist. For an app we snacked on the crab and artichoke dip (served cold) which was very pleasant and much more than your traditional artichoke dip. For mains we split the chicken vesuvio and the rigatoni vodka. Both were phenomenal. The chicken was cooked to perfection, packed with flavor and the rigatoni was al denti served with a rich creamy vodka sauce. Our server even split our plates for us so we were not reaching over one another fighting for the next bite. How nice is that?Dessert is always a yes so we tried the banana split. Boy was it yummy! A good, and light digestif since our food was more on the heavy side.Formento's has staying power here on Randolph St. They meet all the criteria for great food, service, and ambiance. Well done Formento's....clap, and end scene."
"Waited 20-25mins without having reservations and we were sat at a table in the bar area. Not a bad wait on a Saturday night and not having reservations.Service was not speedy. We were not explained specials or how to best proceed since we were first time diners.  The crowd was trendy and wanted to be seen.Funny to watch.Bar had two big screen TVs with the game on.3-4 bartenders behind the bar at all times.We opted for:Caesar salad, Chicken Parmesan (served with a side of Nonna's spaghetti)Wedding soup (Chicken meatballs) and Nonna's Spaghetti with meatballs.EVERYTHING was delicious.Chicken Parm was the best I have ever had.Spaghetti was perfectly cooked - al denteThe meatballs were very rich and so so good.We opted for some sort of chocolate hazelnut mousse cake to celebrate our anniversary.Would have given 5 stars but service did not seem to be a priority or the girl was just overwhelmed with the volume of people she had to take care of.Our food was left sitting in front of us for an extended period of time after we had finished eating. Multiple dirty glasses were left on the table, which was not big to begin with, and even when dessert came out they were not removed.No coffee was offered with dessert. A cappuccino would have gone nicely with the Chocolate Hazelnut cake."
My family and I went to formentos for a birthday I recently had. It is located in a great area with many great restaurants to try. The place was very expensive with small portions. You pay $16-18 for 4 oz of pasta. Learning this I ordered the $27 chicken parm which was very good. However they did not provide enough sauce or spaghetti on the side. The bead is pretty awesome too. I don't think we'll be going back here for over $40 a person.
"My friend lives nearby so she planned a dinner for a group of us here this weekend. Valet is available for $12 which is nice and we had a reservation and were seated right away which I also appreciated. Our server was friendly but possibly overwhelmed-we had to ask for things numerous times and he didn't come back for long periods of time.We started with some appetizers. I ordered the porcini bruschetta but I asked for no mushrooms and added capers. He asked if I wanted to add tomatoes, so I don't know if they usually don't come on it or what but I said yes. The bruschetta was very good..we were a large group so this appetizer, as well as the crab dip we ordered, came on what I thought was 2 split plates which I thought was cool. Once the bill came we realized it was actually 2 orders so I am not sure where that miscommunication came from. We ordered 1 of each and got 2 of each.  The dip was very fishy and went mostly uneaten at our table so that was doubly disappointing. Someone also ordered the relish tray, but I didn't try that. The focaccia bread that comes to start was VERY good, however it took forever when we asked for more and then again when we asked for butter. I also had to ask for a refill on my diet coke 3 times before our server brought it. Imagine my surprise when towards the end of the meal my drinks suddenly started coming out in bottles; I was NOT happy. I had ordered 3 by that point and usually when pop is in the bottle you know that ahead of time. Once the check came I was glad to see I was only charged for 1.I started with the Cesar salad, which was really good but a small portion for $11. I then got the penne ala vodka which was really good as well, had a spicy kick and was a decent size portion for $16. I ended with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream. It was good but literally a very small scoop for $8. Not worth it. Overall, I don't think I would go back. Portions were small and prices were high for what you got. Service was not at it's best either."
"The service at the bar was great. Very friendly bartenders.Gorgonzola mashed potatoes were amazing.Nonnas spaghetti and meatballs were just ok, really. Tasted like home-made pasta, but the portion was about a third of what you are served at rosebuds for around the same price. For $21 for a pasta dish, it should be a large portion. I feel like I was served a side dish."
"I've been seeing this restaurant pop up all over Instagram and decided I needed to indulge. We started off with their fried calamari and mozzarella and prosciutto. The kitchen sent us a relish platter which blew our socks off as well. But to be honest, I could have eaten their house-made bread and giardenara.When it came to order, I faced an epic battle between rigatoni vodka and eggplant parm. My waiter swayed me into the latter. What he didn't tell me was that it was as tall as the tower of Pisa. Honestly, delicious. However, the star of the show was the dessert. The chocolate cake was what dreams are made of.It's definitely a great special occasion spot and in the running for my next bday venue. Ciao!"
"Four Words...Trendy Old School ItalianMy husband and I recently enjoyed a date night at this fresh take on an Italian grandma's kitchen.  I appreciate the concept and the food! On trend, dimly lit dining room with fun, quirky elements your grandparents' home probably has. Food was great, but not out of this world amazing. Service was a solid B+I would recommend for a fun group dinner or date night."
"So I get many messages from owners and managers after I place a bad review and TBQH I don't even open them up. For the first time I peeked inside a message from a Formento's manager and they offered me a chance to experience Formento's as intended after apologizing for that terrible chicken parm. Since I usually like restaurants from this group I decided to give it another go.Our waiter was cool, she gave us assurance in experimenting with the menu so if we didn't like something we could send it back no problem. But I was determined to enjoy this dinner menu so I kept the exploration to a minimum.We started off with fried calamari which was your typical dish. We also got the meatballs which were just as great as last time, although they skimped on the sauce(boo). We also tried this stuff pepper dish which consisted of softened red bell pepper wrapped around potato and salted cod. Our waitress labeled it as ""refreshing"", we simply called it terrible and sent it back. She happily obliged and sent us more meatballs. Also ordered gorgonzola mashed potatoes which had a lot of flavor. For mains we got the chicken vesuvio and the pasta with Sunday gravy dish. The chicken was pretty good, typical roasted chicken with an Italian twist. The Sunday gravy was a heavily salted tomato sauce with a meatball, italian sausage and shredded pork neck. I prefer salty foods but this was VERY salty. I loved it but I'd be surprised if other could handle it.  My lady almost died.The experience was much better than the first. Seems like if you stick with the classics you'd be much better off."
"Perhaps it was just the day we went, but this place was dead at lunchtime - reservations are definitely not needed. We started out with the meatball salad, which is an actual salad (contrary to the meat-and-cheese-heavy ingredient list) with lots of lettuce. Unfortunately, I wasn't crazy about the taste of the meatballs. I ordered the rigatoni vodka and was underwhelmed. The portion size was fine, but the sauce was bland and the pasta was freakishly chewy to the point of being almost undercooked. Some of the guys ordered sandwiches, including the Frank, and those seemed much better received. The foccacia with house made gardinera was a nice touch and I quite liked both. Overall, I probably won't be back but I won't cringe while I pass by."
"Went here recently with my date for an early dinner before a show. The place is located in the west Loop and the interior is impressive. The service was generally good but our waiter was so-so at best. Because it was early, there were many very casually dressed diners, an epidemic in Chicago.To begin with, the wine list is staggering. Excellent selections at reasonable prices along with signature cocktails. For starters, we had the prosciutto with some spreads, which was excellent. Copiously lacking with this dish is any crostini. When pressed, the waiter brought 4 Ritz-like crackers, which did not do the trick. Hopefully, the management will add some crostini as otherwise the spreads do not make sense.For our main, we both had pasta, which was excellent. Small portions for an upscale Chicago place but delicious and fresh. For desert the chocolate cake which was so good. Definitely would recommend Formento's for any special dinner. With two drinks each, about $150 including tip."
"Delicioussssss! Loved this place. My husband, my son and I had a great time. The tiramisu was awesome! My Carrot cake was really good too.  the pasta is home made and so as the bread."
"I definitely have not eaten my way through all the Italian food this city has to offer, but I would not hesitate to recommend Formento's. We visited during restaurant week but did not end up ordering from that menu - the regular menu just looked too good to avoid.We started with their meatballs (recommended as a signature dish) and the antipasti plate/sampler. The meatballs are a side item, not a main course, and they were fantastic - incredibly tender, nicely seasoned, and with a very lightly spicy red sauce. Really really good, I would not miss these if I was visiting again. The antipasti platter was also quite good - some things better than others. It's fun to share with the table, but not really that remarkable. Of note, a meal comprised of a side of the meatballs and a side of the spaghetti would probably leave you very full and happy.My entree was the quail saltimboca - I love saltimbocs dishes, and this did not disappoint. Almost quail confit, served with smoked cauliflower and hazelnuts. I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, but this was good, and the hazelnuts were a great crunch counterpart to the quail, which was very rich tasting. Very good, and definitely worth ordering again.We split the carrot cake for dessert - a massive steakhouse style serving of good cake, with the right cake to frosting ratio. Silly as it sounds, there is actually such a thing as too much cream cheese icing, and this was not an attempt to cover up dry or tasteless cake with frosting. The ice cream it came with was also very good - butter pecan with lots of butter pecan bits.Our service was very good - walking us through the menu...in perhaps a little too much detail, but recommending a few things we ended up ordering and are glad we did. And something definitely worth mentioning, the restaurant was full by the time we left, and the dining room isn't exactly acoustically damp, yet we did not have to scream to be heard. It looks like the sort of place that would be deafening, but isn't. Big points, however they pulled that off.As I said at the beginning, would not hesitate to come back or to recommend this to others. Very good."
$50 bottle of wine.  no clue and wont pretend to know how it was (gave me some personality).  I drink whiskeyApps: Meatballs & Beet SaladEntree: Shrimp Scampi & VealCarlos was great.Great date spot and the people watching is on point. It's a double Ding...DING DING$180 - 200 with tip-Arp Darp king
Old-school Italian with traditional menu. The clams were delicious. The lamb was tender and the ambiance was nice...especially after a long stressful day. I would come back again...only if someone else paid for my meal!
"Love this addition to restaurant row! Food was delicious. Exactly what the west loop needed - great upscale Italian food with a modern flare. Our service was great, too. No attitude at hostess stand despite it being a busy Friday night and server was friendly. Only two cons are timing & salad options- took us 20 minutes to get our first drinks then they immediately wanted to take our order before we even had a sip of wine. Also thought they could use an additional salad option - wasn't impressed with what we got (beets). We loved the pasta & chicken parm, though. Will definitely be back. The ambiance is great too."
"My party was so excited for a fabulous Italian meal...unfortunately, that was not our experience. Positives: roasted beet saladNegatives: Extremely inattentive service.  Eggplant parm was burnt, soggy and over salted. The halibut was cooked and seasoned well, but the vegetables had absolutely no seasoning. The lyonnaise potatoes were forgettable. My two star rating is due to two of our lack luster or poorly executed dishes being comped. However, my table felt like more of a nuisance to the server than guests."
The carrot cake and peanut butter desert was phenomenal. I actually refused desert at the restaurant I ate dinner at just to come here. Plus I felt like a mob boss walking through the restaurant.
"1 star for good service, 1 star for an extensive wine list. Food was mediocre. Definitely have had better. Bread was cold. Portions were on the small side. Too many other (better) options for Italian cuisine in Chicago."
I was REALLY looking forward to eating here due to the reviews and Formento's is in my backyard. So I dragged my friends here a couple of weekends ago.We were there in the evening and the bar was busy so those of us waiting for a table were crowding the hostess stand. The hostesses were getting annoyed. The bar cleared up and we had a drink there and the bartenders were very professional. Then some of the bar tables cleared up so we sat there for dinner.We ordered a bunch of items off the menu but the only thing that stood our was the Caesar salad which I recommend. I was really looking forward to the clams casino but they didn't taste fresh at all. Other stuff like the chicken parm and meatball side were average.The service was polite but very abrupt which I assume it was because we sat in the bar area.I may come back for a drink.
"Disappointed. Prices are very high for the quality of food, and portions are extremely small (not very Italian at all!). My so-called steak was $38 and was not a good quality piece of meat at all. It had a lot of pieces of fat and gristle, and although I had asked for medium-well, it was simply seared (more like burnt) on the surface and pretty much raw (not rare, raw) on the inside. My husband ordered fish, which was pretty good, but came with absolutely no sides. My kids had some not-so-Italian pasta and the portions were so small that they were still hungry. It's unheard of to eat pasta and still feel hungry afterwards! I believe in second chances, but from my own personal experience, this is one restaurant I can't give a second chance to! Just my opinion.Part IISo I received a message from the manager who courteously apologized for my negative experience and offered some gift certificates. I don't normally give restaurants second chances, but I am a sucker for a genuine apology. So we shall try one more time. To be continued..."
"Had dinner here with a friend visiting from NJ on Friday evening.  First of all, you don't come here for Osteria Langhe style delicate flavors- this is Frank Sinatra's Italian.  If you go with that in mind, you will enjoy your meal.  We had a nice rum cocktail to start.  We ordered a pasta (the orichette) that we shared as an appetizer.  We split the (enormous) chicken parmesan as an entree.  Seriously, I still brought home half of it.  Everything was good, though if you don't like garlic, run.  The waiter recommended a nice, if pricey malbec.  Good, well informed service.  My dad will love this place."
Fun atmosphere and good service.Food was fine.  Nothing remarkable though I really liked my Caesar salad.  Nothing special but nothing bad.
"We were very pleased by the service at Formentos. Both Andrew, our waiter, and the sommelier, who didn't introduce himself, were very attentive and friendly. And this is just a beautiful restaurant. We sat in the front room and I think we had the best seats in the house, a corner booth by the front widows. The menu [$$$$$] is made up of what they call ""red sauce classics.""  That just means familiar Italian dishes. I think the chef was challenged to do the very best version of each famous dish. The waiter wants you to understand that you are supposed to pick two or more courses in the Italian style. But Americans don't normally eat that way. Rest assured the modestly priced pastas are large enough to be a lone entree. And they all looked good, based on observing what was ordered around us. The entrees start at $27 and go up from there.I had the chicken Parmesan because one reviewer I read just raved about it. It was a complete half chicken, pounded flat and smothered with red sauce and bubbling cheese. It was OK, but needed salt and the red sauce seemed to be puréed tomatoes, again with no seasoning to spice it up. The cheese was tasteless. All in all, an impressive-looking dish that just missed the mark on taste. My wife had the Branzino (fish), and she thought it was fine. The wine list is many pages long and filled with very expensive choices. I am sure it was carefully ""curated.""  But there are only two chiantis under $50/bottle. Wines by the glass were unfamiliar and unappealing. We are very familiar with Italian reds. Couldn't find any affordable choices here.  This was very disappointing.Given the choice between Formentos and nearby Piccolo Sogno, I will stick with Piccolo Sogno every time, where the wonderful Italian wine list is priced just a couple of bucks over retail (which is astonishing).In sum, this is a very lovely, very expensive supper club.  On our first and only visit the food was interesting but bland.  But I am sure this will become a regular haunt for the one-percenters.If we ever come back, I would bring my own bottle of Felsina  Chianti Classico and order one of the pastas."
"I kicked off my experience at Formento's by telling my friends ""i'm pretty skeptical of this place.""I knew the Bristol guys probably did a great job, but I just didn't understand how a red sauce italian joint hits #1 on the hotlist. But, alas, the space is beautiful, the wine list is massive, the pours generous, and the food is wonderful.We had the relish tray, the calamari, and I had the linguini with clams and the chocolate cake. My linguini with clams was definitely the best I had ever had, really rich flavor.  The chocolate cake was really great, it had an unexpected layer of wafer that added to its complexity. Also, the entire staff was very nice as we shut the place down at 11:30p on a Tuesday. :)"
"Very excellent experience. A+ service from the entire staff. Ate with 7 and we ordered for 10, nearly eating 75% of the menu. I'll say the homemade mozzarella was lacking salt. But honestly, it was almost offensive how incredible all the pastas were (carbonara, scampi, gravy, lasagna, rigatoni with sausage). The Branzino (fish that day) was masterfully prepared and phenomenal, as were the lamb chops. Sides included the Gorgonzola potatoes (insane), ""creamed"" escarole (f yes) and grilled corn with parmesan. All were great, particularly the escarole. Slightly bitter and perfectly seasoned. Highly recommended this place if you're in the mood to carb load. Excellent wine list as well. Haute Randolph street location but prices were super reasonable."
"A lively space with an interesting menu and bright flavors, but bring your wallet.The chintzy pour on our starter glasses of wine and Prosecco was a disappointing start to the evening but a fair indicator of the price/value of this restaurant.  We started our meal with Nonna's Relish Tray, an extremely tasty and contemporary take on a mixed antipasto plate.  Main courses of half chicken parmesan and orecchiette & salsicca pasta dish were tasty and satisfying. The sommelier helped us find an Italian blend from their list of ""Fifty Or So Wines For Fifty Dollars or Less"" that proved to be a great choice. Unfortunately it is not that go-to Italian place that most of Chicago continues to search for.  We were big fans of Cafe Bionda in the South Loop before it fell into disrepair and then Salatino's became our bi-weekly standard during its inexplicably short-lived run. Given Formento's high price tag, if you want more premium Northern style Italian, Coco Pazzo, Piccolo Sogno or Davanti Enoteca are all better, and well established nearby options.  Try Charlatan if you want a cool new place with better food and a lower price point.Still if you are looking for an Italian place with a nice vibe in the Randolph St. area (and are on an expense account so you don't mind being overcharged) you will find Formento's a good trade up option from Vivo or La Luce."
Blown away by how good the salad bar is here. Great high end vegetarian options. Much better options than ZED's salad bar options.
"Was here past weekend with a group. The building was beautiful. But the food was ok.  Nothing stood out. The in-house bread was good, the garlic bread wasn't, it got hard really fast-something you'd get at a pizza place. =/  Appetizer: We got the caesar salad which was good- I do prefer fresh pepper on my salads didn't get asked. The shrimp was ok, beet salad was alright. Entrees: Chicken parmesan was good, the spaghetti that came with it- was not good- All the pasta dishes we ordered were really cold. One member had the steak ordered medium well- came out medium rare so they returned it to cook a little bit longer- came out the same? So that was weird. The lamb chops were cold as well. Other members had the fish special said they liked it? So that was a plus.  Dessert: The carrot cake was a little dry. The chocolate cake was nice, big. The donut filled with cream were everyones favorite! I'd recommend those!"
"They had a great and large wine list here, and that's the reason it's at three stars. we started out at the bar and very slow service as it was a fairly busy night. Once we were able to be seated, the waitress was slammed and kept running over and apologizing for the wait. After a while, we got the focaccia bread and giardiniera, which was the highlight of our meal. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the orecchiette & sausage. The spaghetti noodles had a weird texture and taste to them that I didn't really care for, but the meatballs were fairly flavorful. The orecchiette was a little better, my boyfriend enjoyed it immensely more. We asked for a wine recommendation and got a full rundown - the waitress was very knowledgable. However, her response when asked about a cab was that she doesn't really drink that so she doesn't know."
"A good ole hearty Italian restaurant with proper portion sizes?  It's a dream come true.Our big table ordered a variety of appetizers.  The meatballs were outstanding.  I had the filet.  It was phenomenal.   Other hits were (of course) the chicken parmesan and the chicken vesuvio.  They have an extensive wine menu including a list of 50 wines for under $50 (for when I return on my shoe string budget).  And, because it was my brother's birthday, the chocolate cake was divine.. my dad readily admitted it was head's above Portillo's and that is all the endorsement you need, really. A really wonderful experience.  I'll definitely go back."
"Food was good but just so you know the $27 linguini with mussels, clams, calimari and shrimp is actually 3 mussels, 2 clams, 1 calimari and 1 shrimp... not really what I was looking for at all."
"We had dinner last night. 9 PM reservation and we were taken to the back room promptly. It's too warm and confined so we opted to wait for the front room. Highly advisable. The place was packed. Largest evening ever. Over 400 saves according to our waiter. Service was a bit strained due to the volume. You could feel it was borderline out of control.Menu was predictably interesting and the Food was average.  The salads were overdressed. The pastas were perfectly toothsome but too salty. I had to return mine as the garlic was burnt. I had the whole Branzino and it was sadly overcooked and not warm. I did not send it back as I won't waste a fish. Our server Andrew was fantastic and kept the evening together.  However, it won't be enough to bring us back any time"
"Formento's is an absolutely beautiful dining experience. The ambience is striking, both cozy and elegant. I don't think I've ever seen such an extensive wine list which is a bit overwhelming, but makes it impossible to make a poor selection. The staff is also amenable to answering any wine questions. Everyone is so friendly and attentive!The food was absolutely divine. We had the calamari, ceasar salad, mashed potatoes, roasted cauliflower, rigatoni alla vodka, cavatelli alla norma, and chocolate cake. Dish after dish delivered with truly amazing food.I love this place as a date spot and a place to get delicious italian food. A great addition to randolph!"
"I am so torn on Formentos. My husband and I walked in here in a Saturday night with a reservation and were immediately impressed by the interior. Then we waited at least 2 minutes past our reservation time to walk right by the impressive interior to the back room where we were banished. The room was loud with several large parties and 2 top tables that were on top of one another. I guess a positive was that our neighbors were all really friendly but this did not work for a date night for us and I would actually refuse to be searing back there again.We also had mixed reviews on our food. We started with a side a meatballs and were not disappointed, I wouldn't hesitate to order again. I also loved the focaccia bread they started with I just wish they gave us more than 1 little piece. Now on to the meal, my husband order the quail saltimbocca and this a fun twist on the classic and was very satisfying. I ordered the bucatini because this was one of my favorite dishes when we were in Rome. The waiter did his job by aggressively trying to up sell me on something in addition reminding me the small portion size even after I had stated I was ok with a true Italian portion size. I didn't feel this was small, I felt it was enough. The portion size was definitely what I would expect in Italy, unfortunately the bucatini was nothing I would find in Italy. This was a disappointing dish to me that lacked on more than one front. First off, the pasta was slightly over and the pork that was in this dish was more like a shredded pork rather than a guanciale or a pancetta. I feel like the dish really needed that texture of one of those crispy pork products and that could have made the difference. For a side dish we had the Brussel sprouts which I thought were good. Overall I wanted to love the place being that it is in my neighborhood but couldn't, however I would go back but would refuse the back room seating and would not order the bucatini again. I hope my next visit leaves me wanting to come back for more."
