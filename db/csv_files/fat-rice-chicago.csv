Fat Rice
"Had a fun and interesting dinner at Fat Rice. The flavors were great and the server was super knowledgable and friendly. We turned up without a reservation and waited 10 minutes, which I especially appreciated. Of note, they have communal seating at some of the tables. So if that's not your thing you should plan accordingly. I'm eager to try more of the menu the next time I go."
"Oh Fat Rice, you are so confusing to me.  I've now tried Fat Rice for brunch as well as dinner and I'm torn.  On one hand, this is a restaurant that offers a truly unique cuisine, blending Asian and Portuguese influences for dishes that you will not see anywhere else in Chicago.  On the other hand, although the dishes are certainly unique, I don't know that they were so amazing that I would want to eat them again.  Fat Rice is definitely a restaurant that is worth trying for a special experience but timing is everything because the menu is constantly changing and on any given day you can have something mediocre, something off-putting, or something mind-blowing.  But beware, if you fall in love with one dish, it may not be an option the next time you go.First off - brunch.  They have significantly reduced their offerings for brunch and that was disappointing when we went earlier this summer, as I was excited to try things like their fried egg tofu, tofu puff lacassa, and other dishes.  When we arrived, the brunch menu had been cut in half, and the number of vegetarian options were scarce.  Four of us split a few items including the curried vegetable dumplings, the Hong Kong French toast, and the minchi hash.  The dumplings were tasty but a bit overpriced for what we got.  The Hong Kong French toast was super rich (as you'd expect from the description) and just too much of a smooth and dense texture without anything to break it up.  It's also just way too sweet.  I suppose if you go with the bacon option, that could add the diversity that this dish needs.  But the vegetarian version is with jam and fruit that just gets lost under the peanut butter and banana mushiness.  The minchi hash was fine but not quite memorable.  I hope they bring back their other items soon.Next - dinner.  My husband and I went last week and shared the potstickers, the bacalhau (salt cod spread with olives over bread), and the po kok gai (Portuguese chicken).  Three items were PLENTY for the 2 of us to split.  The potsitckers are unique and arrive in a pancake form.  They're quite tasty and unique, but not necessarily better than other potstickers.  I liked the bacalhau fine, but wished we'd gotten something else.  There is a strong fish taste and a strong olive taste, so if you don't like either (like my husband), don't get this.  The po kok gai was definitely unique - with every bite we discovered another ingredient that we never would have imagined went together.  Chicken with a tomato curry sauce with potatoes, sausage, cheese, croutons (yes, I said croutons).  This is a very flavorful dish with many layers to the point that each bite tastes different from the previous one.  That said, I'm not sure that I preferred it to a standard Thai curry dish.  It's different and unique, but not necessarily better or more enjoyable.  The servings of the entrees are pretty large, especially the heavier dishes like the po kok gai.Service is excellent - friendly and prompt.  We went to dinner with our stroller and newborn in tow and the hostesses were kind enough to hold the doors open, assist us with moving the stroller and making room for us to park him next to our table.  This is definitely a restaurant worth trying, but for the category of restaurants that Fat Rice falls within, I don't know that they are a standout for the price point.  They definitely stand out for creativity and uniqueness, but not necessarily in execution.  I will come back when the menu changes in the winter time, I'd love to try some of their winter stews or fat noodles that are not currently available."
"After having fat rice on my short list of restaurants for longer than I can remember I finally made a reservation.  I was excited to say I've tried Portuguese Asian fusion food. I had to do it a few months ahead of time because I guess I wasn't the only one that wanted to eat here.  On the inside you're greeted by a cozy dining room.  Some people don't enjoy the proximity you are to your neighbors but I don't find it something to complain about.  The menu is kinda neat though.  There are no beers on tap but the bottles they did have were solid though.  We decided to get the namesake dinner item, the Arroz Gordo and the three for $10 small bites. We got the boiled peanuts the pig ears and the eggplant.  I'll say this, I don't know what I was expecting with the pig ears, but it wasn't for me.  It was kind of grisly and reminded me of head cheese when I worked a deli.  The peanuts were just ok too.  Maybe it's just not my thing. The fat rice was just that.  They bring a put packed with so much food it's almost comical when your waiter describes it.  Linguica, clams, bbq pork, tea egg, rice, duck, giant prawns. I'm most likely missing a few things.  This thing gets huge points for presentation and you can feed about 3 comfortably in my estimation.  The thing is that it wasn't as great as I hoped.  It was missing flavor that I was expecting and the rice seemed kinda bland.  Regardless, that presentation made the meal.Fat Rice missed the mark a little bit for me.  It's possible I should have tried a few different things instead of going with the arroz gordo.  If you go here come with a very open mind as there may be some things you haven't had an opportunity to try."
"Totally overhyped and utterly overpriced!! Food was very mediocre, service was lacking.Came here for dinner one night early around 5:30pm and thank god there was no lines. We got a seat by the bar and ordered food to share. Ordered the 3 items for $10 appetizers, the pig ears had an interesting flavor, the eggplant dish was decent. We got the Portuguese chicken entree, it tasted decent but cost $22 for a very small bowl of not so high quality chicken and the rice was extra $3!! Holy cow! I've never heard of rice not included with a curry dish. The Hole in the wall Indian place down the street has better curry and charges a 1/4 of the price. Service was lacking, and we didn't see our waitress at all except for when we got our food.Our bill was $50 for appetizers and 1 entree, hella expensive for very mediocre food and bad service. Way too much hype with zero substance!"
"I wish this place opened in LA. Macau-nese food so good that you probably can't even find in Macau itself. We snagged a late seating and got seated right away at the bar which gave us a good view of the kitchen in the back. Love the old-school chinese decor, which definitely adds a nice homey touch to the place. They have some small plates which they let you choose 3 out of a list of whatever is special for that day. The pig ears were the most memorable. Usually pig ears in chinese cuisine are more of the crunchy, hard texture. But here, these were so soft and smooth. I could have eaten this all day! I seriously wonder what their secret is, and why haven't the chinese places in LA figured this out?!The must-order here is their namesake dish - Fat Rice. This is cooked in a traditional chinese clay pot, filled with some portuguese style fried rice, then topped with loads of seafood, chorizo, chinese sausage, and other meats. This is so good! The rice is soooo flavorful as it soaked in all the goodness from the toppings. Its a pretty decent size, so its definitely meant to be shared. So halfway through the meal, I saw one of the chefs carry a fresh tray of portuguese egg tarts. This completely surprised me since I asked our server at the beginning of the meal if they have any, and she said they don't have them at dinner. When I saw the tray, I asked her again and she said those were special order since there was a private party next door. I asked her if they could spare me an egg tart since I came all the way from LA, and this was literally my first meal in Chicago. I even threw out that my mom and grandparents were originally from Macau (which is true), so the food definitely hits home! And guess what??? We got to try the egg tarts!! Score!!I left full and happy. The food was delicious and tasted like authentic Macau food (a fusion between portuguese and chinese). And I don't think I can even find this even in Macau (as most food there are either portuguese or chinese, but never a balanced fusion.) While we were waiting outside for our uber, the chef was taking his break and chatted with us for a short bit. Super nice guy! He told us to visit again during lunch for the pork chop bun! Definitely need to have that in my itinerary for the next Chicago trip!"
"Fat Rice is godly. And yes, you will pay a pretty penny to dine here if you do it right. But I promise you won't be disappointed! I'm not sure how we managed it without reservations (does Fat Rice even take reservations?), but we scored a place at the bar at 6 PM on a Friday without any reservations. Fat Rice has a fairly small dining area, so I was surprised there wasn't any wait. Within half an hour, the place was completely full and there was a line of people waiting to put their name in with the hostess as we were leaving. So, my advice would be to go a little bit earlier to avoid the waiting. I also just generally would not recommend coming here with a group larger than four people. I don't think it's designed to seat big group of people.We were started out with waters and our server brought us an amuse-bouche of some kind of pepper, which tasted delicious. The server explained that Fat Rice is meant to be a shared plates kind of place, but we decided to skip that and order our own dishes (mostly because I eat meat and my girlfriend doesn't). We both decided to get curries and both were really tasty. Mine, which had meat in it, had a slightly thicker consistency curry that I preferred to my girlfriend's vegetarian sweet potato version, but both were pleasing to the tastebuds. We also enjoyed drinks before our entrees and they were fantastic! Honestly, I would return just to grab drinks at the bar and maybe one of those delicious-sounding apps.The only thing that irked me a little bit was that we were charged for the rice. Really? I've had curry at a lot of places and rice always automatically comes on the side of a curry dish. Automatically. Included in the price of the dish. It was just your average everyday white rice (which is worth maybe two cents). I don't know, maybe I expected a little bit more of a place that has rice in the name of the restaurant."
"The weekend brunch menu is a bit disappointing - please expand it. Wish I had visited on a weekday for the full menu, but one member of the party couldn't confirm dates. Make reservations two weeks in advance for dinner, a few days in advance for brunch. The appetizer that resembled samosas were too similar to frozen ones I've had in the past, but the tamarind sauce was quite good. The side of cabbage and the dumplings were ok. My group enjoyed the juicy pork chop bun; the fat rice (arroz gordo) had a wonderful presentation. We paid extra for more prawns, but it was worth it. The coconut rice was outstanding. The Portuguese egg tarts were fresh from the oven and amazing. I highly recommend the citron chamomile, which can be prepared in a large pot. Staff were extremely helpful, offering water and more tea. They even opened the door for a family member who was disabled."
"Overall: Great mix of tasty Portuguese food with a cozy and hip atmosphere.The good: Food tasted great, with plenty of options to choose from and share. I wouldn't say it's 'authentic' but that doesn't mean that it's not good. The atmosphere is small and darker but the decor was neat. Luckily we didn't have to wait on a Saturday night. The waitress was friendly as well.The bad: Prices add up. Not a lot of seating. Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"
"Fat Rice has been open for a while, and my crew of four stopped by for lunch last Friday (taking advantage of the day off!).  Not only did I miss the hype, I think I missed what makes--or made--this place special.We tried all of the lunch items and I had a mango mimosa (the drink was just fine).  That means we also had the chicken (a half-chicken goes for $16 and comes in two flavors; we got both the spicy Fatracha and the peanut-y tangy Afrikana), the Zhu-Pa-Bao (the banh mi-ish flattened pork sammie), a round of the pork dumplings and the veggie dumplings, and the Nasi Lamak rice dish.All of it--truly, every dish that I tried, although I did skip the Afrikana chicken dish because of a peanut allergy--was average.  Flavors were fine, in some cases muted, and all of it was prepared well and the sandwich was on fresh bread.  It just wasn't special, and for the serving sizes and the prices, I would have been IRATE if we had to wait in line for an hour to eat this food.  (As it was, we strolled in at exactly 11 AM last Friday and the staff was very accommodating, including seating for my 17-month-old.)Nice space, and the patio certainly helps.  If I was eating alone, the single-seat counter outside would have worked for me as well.  Service was ok.  Our a la card discount dining deck was put to good use here so we got $10 off of our meal.Very glad I finally got to eat here, but not incented to go back."
"I went to Fat rice for my birthday dinner. This place is is great for a casual dinner with friends or a date. If you have a large party, this may not be the place for you. The dining room is cozy and they don't seat parties over 6. I didn't know about this rule, and I had a party of 8, so they seated us in groups of four, and we're kind enough to seat us near one another.  Also, there is no waiting area inside, so we waited for our tables on an outdoor patio. It's a cute space with seating, but I was wishing for an indoor waiting area after the sun started to set and it started getting cold.My friends and I like to share food, and my server was fantastic and gave me a great rundown on how much food to order. We ordered the linguica, the shrimp dumplings, piri piri chicken, and the fat rice. This was just the right amount of food for 4 people. *Tip: the fat rice has linguica in it so you don't really have to order the fat rice and the linguica if you only want a taste. Everything was fantastic. The only thing that was bad, and I mean very bad, was the person servicing the patio.  She was rude, aggressive, offensive, and just all around awful. She refused to give us a snack menu until we ""settled up"" our drink tab. Then she forgot to bring some of our drinks. Part of our party got seated, and she repeatedly asked us who was covering the tab and forced us to close our tab although we ended up waiting another 20 minutes for a table and had planned to order more drinks. She was in a big rush and almost knocked me down trying to serve other customers. I'm not sure what her deal was, but she almost ruined my evening. Besides her horrible non existent hospitality, I had a good experience."
"I am pretty familiar with some of the food from this part of the world and its flavors.  With all the accolades this place has gotten over the last few years, I had to check it out.I went for brunch there and ended up trying a lot of the menu. I came away not as impressed as I thought I would. Some things were pretty good and other things were just downright bland and not that great.The peanuts (boiled) were decent but kind of weird that they were cold as I was expecting them to be warmer. The taste was alright though. The dumplings were decent but the skins were a touch too thick and the filling was pretty bland even if the sauce at the bottom of the bowl was OK. The pork chop bun was pretty good but could have used something extra I feel. The downside were the crab chips on the side. They were so bland that you couldn't tell they were really crab chips. The Chili Prawns were well done too - one of my favorites. Then there was the the clams with sambal - far and away the worst and blandest sambal I've ever had to the point that it tasted like straight up stewed tomatoes. I don't mean much offense (and I'm sure it will be taken) to these guys but you can buy sambal from pretty much any market in town and it'll be better. No spice whatsoever and it tasted nothing like the Sambals I've had in various parts of Asia. I don't know what went wrong with that. Perhaps it was an off day. Not fond of the vegetable dish either, but only because I was not in the mood for that. My favorite dish was the Minchi, which is kind of a hash/fried rice type of dish with the egg. Actually very good and was happy their flavor was not lacking like other dishes. The french toast with peanut butter was good too.Overall, it's obvious the guys here have their hearts in the right place, but I was really let down. There were some good dishes here but overall I thought it tipped a little bit towards the not so good/mediocre side. I feel like they really need to elevate their spices so their food is not so bland. I was actually shocked by it.The atmosphere was cool though and the service was great. The outdoor space is good too. I'll be back to try the aptly named fat rice dish, but I hope they put more spice into their dishes.P.S. it's Nasi Lemak, not Nasi Lamak."
"Ok, yes the food was amazing, and the creations are completely original and unlike anything I've experienced before.  The problem was in ordering the food.Our staff would not give us a second to think about the menu and nagged us to make a decision.  Once we did, they told us our decision was improper and not fitting the culinary experience they seek to foster.  They said the selection we made did not pair well with the appetizers, and they said if we did not order desert with our appetizer we may not get a dessert later because they were too busy with a high volume of customers.  Eventually, we got our meal, it was great, my group was happy and well fed, and we were all well.  But damn! What a nightmare ordering our food."
"Eh, not for me. Took over an hour to be seated, and the food wasn't worth the hype.The first issue is that they don't take reservations, which is annoying since it's SO busy. We got there early-ish (like 5:45 pm) on a Monday thinking because it was a week day we'd be ok. A party had arrived a few minutes before us, but they were still waiting on 2 members of their party. We were a complete party but for some reason the hostess waited until the other party was complete and sat them before us. They took the last open table so we ended up having to wait over an hour. They let us wait in this strange little bar area that you have to leave the restaurant and walk outside to get to...which was sort of nice since there is literally no where to wait in Fat Rice itself since the space is so tiny. When we were finally seated, our waitress was not very pleasant. My friend is a bit of a picky eater and eats some seafood but not others. She told the waitress she was a vegetarian yet open to eating shrimp dishes but not scallops (I don't understand the logic either but whatever, she's allowed to eat/not eat whatever she wants) and the waitress replied ""you know shrimp isn't vegetarian, right?"" Yikes. As a vegetarian myself, I felt there weren't many options for me. I had the vegetable curry which was edible, but man it could've been so much better. It was very thick and heavy and yet not very flavorful. Something about the consistency kind of made me feel sick. My boyfriend and another friend split the fat rice dish which they enjoyed but agreed that this place wasn't worth the hype. Another thing that bugged me was the communal seating. It feels as if they are just trying to cram a ton of customers into a space that is too damn small and then charging a shit-ton of money for food that is subpar while trying to be trendy and exclusive by not taking reservations/their weird seating policies. If we're paying upwards of $100 for a meal, I don't want to feel like I'm eating in a glorified cafeteria. We won't be back."
This is an interesting spot. Many communal tables that we barely fit at. I'm not a huge fan of the communal dining. Most of the food was actually really good. We finished our food and they asked for the table...so we got up and left.The place is really small so be prepared to wait! I did hear they started taking reservations so I recommend doing that.
"I think Fat Rice is cool, but I also think it's a whole lot more style than substance. I thought my meal with friends was just aight, but there wasn't a single dish that stood out as memorable or that I would've put up a fight about getting seconds on. In fact, I thought a lot of the stuff we ordered (as recommended by our server) kind of tasted the same and really wasn't all that flavorful... which is a surprising characteristic for any restaurant doing a fusion type menu.It's a tiny place and there's a lot of bureaucracy to get a seat here- know that going in.We arrived around 6:00 on a Saturday night and I put my name on a list, and was told the wait would be around an hour and 45 minutes, which is understandable given the size of the place, but their method for this list is sheer madness and in all honesty, would keep me from ever going back again. It's just not worth the headache and attitude from the host staff. When I initially put my name on the list and got the hour and 45-minute wait time it was no big deal. We figured we'd just stop over at Radler for ein Bier und Brezen while we waited it out. The host told me to call back closer to an hour and and 45 minutes from then and she could tell us where we were at on the list. So off my party of three went to Radler. We waited for the suggested time and called an hour and a half after we'd initially put our name on the list only to be directed to automated answering machine and no one to answer the phone. I called 4 more times in the next 15 minutes in hopes of connecting to the host for news about our table, but to no avail, it went to their vm every.single.time. So we decided to just head back and check in in person. When we walk in, we can see that they're now turning away diners as the wait now extends beyond their closing time. I check in with the hostess and she tells me that since it was now past the hour and 45 minutes, I was no longer on the list and they wouldn't have a space for my party... which is unreasonable since it was *maybe* 10 minutes past the initial table guestimation and because the instructions she gave us to get our table were moot because you can't call the restaurant when their busy because they don't answer the phone. When I brought this up, the hostess responded back with attitude that they're a very busy place and she doesn't have time to answer the phone. BUT THEN WHY WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE TO CALL? I asked why they don't take people's phone numbers if they can't be bothered to answer the phone when people call, and again, she responded that they don't have time to do that... so their list system is pretty much total bullsh*t.  Mega frustrating and a very broken system, but my far more patient dining counterpart managed to smooth things over a bit and basically begged to get us and his very pregnant wife in since they kind of, sort of, totally burned us. We got to wait next door in their private waiting room, which is cool, but still super non-sensical and while the bar snacks we got there were good, the drink I got tasted like someone had ground up a chewable Flintstones vitamin and added water and chia seeds. It looked cool and sounded cool, but after that it fell flat, just like the rest of our order. We eventually were able to be sat at the kitchen bar and from there our service and server was actually pretty welcoming... as much as they could be for constantly reminding us that the kitchen was closing in 40 minutes. As far as the actual dining, the whole meal was a miss. Lacking flavor and tasting more like watered down, middle of the road attempts at clean-eating ethnic cuisine.I don't know if we just came on a really off evening or if the shallow experience we had is indicative of Fat Rice, but to me, the hype was not lived up to, and certainly not worth the stress."
"Just hearing the name of the restaurant was enough to sell me on this place. Rice? Yes please. Fat? Even better. I haven't had any previous experience with Macanese cuisine, in fact I did not even know Macau was a part of China (I thought it was in Spain... which is embarrassing because I've lived in Spain). Anyway, a good summary of Fat Rice would be: ""overpriced Asian food made by hipsters."" The food was good, don't get me wrong, but when the bill came we were all a bit flabbergasted. How did we spend that much and not notice?! The big winner of the night was the Portuguese chicken - the favorite of everyone at our table. I'm not sure how a bowl of this costs 20 bucks though. The big letdown of the night was the Arroz Gordo. We all thought it would be more substantial - the picture in the menu had us thinking it would be a large bouquet of food. When it came out we were like: ""where is the rest of it?"" $50 bucks for normal sized bowl.Overall, it was a good meal, but be ready to break the piggy bank."
"Hip hop and fusion-Asian / Portugese tapas served up in a nicely decorated sushi bar.  (I've been to a couple places (kinda) like this on the West coast and when done with good food and booze + hip hop, it can be a great experience.)    However, some of the pretentious rules stated and re-stated by staff can be overwhelming to the experience.  At least that's how we felt during our dining session.  (P.s. Seated only when our party had arrived fully. No waiting room, so during cold season, waiting on the rest of the party to join is not fun. So get your ass here on time!)Our waiter lacked personality and timeliness whenever approaching or leaving the table.  I'm not asking for much, just a few smiles, a couple cool recommendations and some banter in-between drink and food orders.  (She gave a few recommendations which didn't mesh with our palates) We got a few reminders about adhering to their ""in-house rules"" governing how to order food and what not to do with our potstickers.  (They insist that plates are ""shared,"" and you should not state that the dish is ""my dish"" or ""I'm ordering this for me."" ((Maybe it was our specific waiter that was such a stickler!))  And regarding potstickers; I like double dipping, so to tell me to eat them whole because of it's soul... wasn't happening.) We ordered a couple dishes to share between four and I think we were all satisfied for the most part.  The craft cocktails were interesting and tasty and gave a sufficient buzz till food arrived.  Since the style of ordering wasn't like a standard meal, different items came out at different times.  Mixed pickles.S&S eggplant.PotstckersMalay veg curryraba-rabaPortugese chicken Porco balichang tamarindand a few more....   The experience was costly, though tasty.  I believe many of us had never tried Portuguese anything.We were full by the time we left.  (Per their house-rules and menu, a table should plan to spend a max amount of time: of 2 hours. At first glance, you think.. who eats that long anyway. But once the orders are in and your group is imbibing good drink, time flies and by the time the serradura (you must order this) hit the table, we've realized we have overstayed our time!...  It's not like food and booze flew out of the kitchen. Everything took it's time.  That was one rule, she didn't hard press us for.  So, for that, we were happy.  In retrospect, I wish we had ordered their namesake dish.  Per the menu and the diagram of the entree it looked appetizing and something of interest to see in person.  I say wished because... although it was fun dining with friends, I can't say the experience was rounded out enough to warrant a second go.  Some flavors were exciting and others weren't as meaningful.  And then we factor the cost which was pretty hefty when looking closer at technique and portions.  Solid 3.5 for me."
"This was our second time dining at Fat Rice- the first time being 8 months ago before they developed their reservations system.  The hubby surprised me with reservations here and I was so happy! I loved this restaurant the first time and hoped that it would be just as good this time.My fave dish remains the Fat Noodles in XO sauce. Love the chewy noodles in the savory sauce.  Another great dish is the piri piri chicken. Good for sharing, very tasty and definitely order it with the coconut rice.  Under the specials we ordered the 3 for $10 bites including the pig ears, tofu and mushrooms and clams. We also got the shredded squash, which was alright but made us very full by the time the piri piri chicken and coconut rice came out. Service was very good and attentive. Overall, Fat Rice was as good as we remembered and we hope to be back soon with friends so that we can order the namesake dish, Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice)."
"Service, service, service! The service here is phenomenal! The entire staff was so friendly!We were running late and called to let them know.  The host was friendly and understanding and gave no judgement (which helped because I hate being late and was so embarrassed).When we arrived they sat us right away. Our server came to introduce himself and talked us through the menu. Throughout the night the staff refilled our carafes and cleared our plates without intruding. The food: The portions are deceivingly large. We ordered the pot stickers and they we're delicious. The soy sauce includes garlic, scallions, and a chili sauce. So good. For our entree my husband and I shared the Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice). It was also delicious! It has everything in it; jasmine rice, Portuguese sausage, mussels, pork belly, duck, prawns, pickles, chilis, so much more. Their drink menu includes delicious cocktails and great Portuguese wine (try the Fura wine).Beware of the Diabo Ghost Pepper sauce... I was a little overzealous and I drenched my entire pot sticker with it. So tasty but deadly hot. A little goes a long way."
"Fat Rice serves Macanese food, which is Asian fusion fare by dint of Macau being a trading hubs for centuries. We had the Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice) and Saba Saba (seasonal greens). The former was good, though my dining-mate didn't care for the raisins (I liked them). The latter was too salty towards the bottom of the plate, though I liked the vegetables. Portion sizes were reasonable. Overall I would say that the food was interesting and good, but not worth the price to come back again. We also got two of the specialty cocktails, which were on the sweet and cloying side, so we didn't care for them. The tables are very close together; while eating here, expect to unintentionally but constantly eavesdrop on your dining neighbors. If you have to wait for your table, you'll be directed next door to their lounge, the door for which is covered in Chinese newspapers."
"I'm just full of five star reviews lately.  Perhaps it's because I've gotten to the point where I don't want to bother risking going somewhere that will potentially be crap?  Either way, Fat Rice was delightful.  Yes it's tough to get a seat and even to get a reservation at a ""normal"" time but if you're not afraid to eat dinner at 5:45, you'll be just fine.  Granny dinner and getting out of work at 4:30pm has been my key to getting in just about anywhere I want to be including Fat Rice.An amuse of pickled carrots and the beet appetizer got myself and my two pals started.  We decided to order a bunch of stuff to share which is a good plan here.  We shared the fat noodles with XO sauce, piri piri chicken (how could we not), malay vegetable curry, some coconut rice, and an order of papo seco.  We had plenty to eat and even had a bit of the piri piri chicken left, which I got to take home!  Everything was fantastic and frankly this review got written because I'm starving and fantasizing about the XO sauce right now.  I'll definitely be back as soon as I can schedule my next early bird special reservation."
"Potstickers: goodAsparagus: awesomeFat rice: waiting, but I believe it is awwwwwwwesome"
"I love ethic food, Fat Rice is a unique Macau-Portuguese restaurant with tons of tasty dishes!1. The inner deco is really cool and staff are super friendly! They will explain every dish served!2. The food is made fresh but the waiting time is not that long.3. I ordered iced tea shrub to start! It's a nonacoholic  house made soda that taste like cocktail:) the vinegar taste blended in the shrub made me happy:)4. Portuguese Chicken is my favorite! It's a curry type of dish with lots of ingredients in it! The chicken is really tender and the tea eggs are amazing! You should order it with their coconut rice, which is a good combination with the coconut milk based curry. 5. As a Chinese, I was amazed when I saw Mu-ER in Raba-raba! The dried fish sprinkles added a special taste of seafood in to the vege dish! Love it. 6. Spicy lovers: need to try their fat rice sauce!! It made my tongue on fire!!!Will definitely come back to try their brunch and the signature fat rice bowl!"
"Fat rice is definitely and experience you should check out. I'm not educated or aware enough to know how ""authentic"" the food is, but I will say that it's not mainstream. We tried the 3 small sides for $10 and got the skate special, pig ear, and eggplant. The eggplant was delicious but really spicy. The heat just builds as you keep eating. The pig war is pickled with great flavor, but I just couldn't get over the gelatinous texture. The skate wasn't bad, but had a musky undertone that I couldn't decide if I like or not. For the main course, we shared the Devil's curry (not the right name, but it was a spicy curry) which was great. It wasn't as spicy as the eggplant, full of various meats and veggies, and overall delicious. I wasn't the biggest fan of the sausage in the dish, but that was a personal preference. Be sure to get some starch to eat with it. Overall, the food was a fun experience, but you definitely have to more of an adventurous eater. Had a great time!"
"Finally had dinner at Fat Rice last night. It was a great experience. First, if you want to have dinner at a tiny spot like this, don't expect to be seated immediately on a Saturday night and have someone patiently waiting to satisfy your every whim. It's called patron etiquette. If you're trying a new restaurant, you need to go with the flow, take recommendations from the staff, and relax. Don't think that you know more than the people who work there, the customer is not always right. We were walking by on a Wednesday night and noticed there were some empty tables. We headed in, ordered drinks and perused the menu. The waiter mentioned the potstickers and fat rice were popular, so we ordered those. It was a lot of food, but I wouldn't change a thing. Coming home with a lunch the next day is fine by me.They get a lot of things right here. It was just fun to get the big bowl of fat rice with a little bit of everything. It seems pricy when you see it on the menu, but consider it 2 large entrees and it's actually a good deal.Service was good, but I felt like it could've been better (but not enough to drop a star from my review). Don't live for the weekends! Stop by mid-week and skip the line! You'll have a better experience!"
"No, No, No. Ok, I need to not be so dramatic, but I love brunch and this made me sad.I ordered an iced tea off of their extensive tea list. I asked for sugar for it to be sweetened. This must have been a weird request because they forgot any sweetener. I had to ask again, they then brought me a small cup of simple syrup. Do people not like their tea sweetened?The apps were amazing. Croquettes and dumplings. I should have had those as my meal. I ordered the pork chop sandwich. Sounds simple right?  Nope. Gross. It was so greasy that I felt like I had a pool of oil in my mouth. It was served on a butter roll. Who butters and toasts a roll and then puts a pork chop on it?  Gross. The pork chop had a bone in, was also fried, greasy and pretty much inedible. Our server was pretty good but you can tell she was not used to questions about the menu. I will not be going back."
"It's always interesting eating at a restaurant that is native to a certain area when you've never had food from that area before. It makes the first time both the best and the worst. ""Well this is the finest Botswanan food I've ever had!"" exclaimed everybody. Except in this case substitute Botswanian with Macanese.That's not to say it's totally new. From what they say, the food of Macau is happily fusion and has been since before ""Asian fusion"" was a dirty word.I also knew that I had to try the Fat Rice. Yes I was aware that it feeds 2-3 ""normal"" people and that I wasn't totally sure I could eat it all despite how much I wanted to. And after a few appetizers and drinks got me ready, I dug in.In the true style of a dish where everything is thrown together in one pot, this was all over the map. Savory, sweet, spicy, rich, salty... Different parts of the bowl tasted differently. But they were all good. In my day to day life I eat a lot of rice and felt prepared for fat rice, but what I wasn't prepared for was all the sausage. Yeah I probably should have been, it is Chicago after all, but woah it almost got me.Almost.But no. I defeated the rice and felt fat. And happy. It all made sense. I want more."
"A+ cocktails, inventive,spicy Asia Fusion comfort.A rambunctious, vibrant neighborhood spot with loud noise levels and tightly packed tables, which is the only thing I can suggest you cast aside, and venture here regardless. It's hip, on point with their comfort food crossed with Asian Fusion... and it's too much fun not to try almost everything on the menu. Unless you are into leftovers and adventure, this might take 3 trips to do it justice.  We let the server guide us, as we caught up with old friends, and we had an incredible family style smattering of most of the menu.  Make sure to manage your spicey levels during ordering... they can get HOT.  Listen to your heart... be adventurous... and enjoy some fantastic and innovative food that proves Chicago's food scene is hitting high marks."
"Crowded. Have to sit literally next to other group of people. Food is okay. We got the Fat Rice, was $48 and it is nothing special. Tea egg in the dish was too salty.We also tried the pig ears and peanuts for appetizers. They were good! Wine was overpriced and they only filled up 1/6 of the glass for $12.I like dining at fancy restaurants but they have to offer me what the price is worth. The music was loud in this place and hard to talk to my friend over the music. Not what I was looking for."
"The service was great, but the food had no flavor. We got the pork dumplings, the pork chop sandwich and the coconut rice dish. The dumplings were super doughy and not a lot of meat was provided, although the sauce was pretty good. The pork chop was well prepared and the bun was buttery and crisp. Without the hot mustard, the pork chop was just a pork chop. Coconut rice, we could have made this at home. The Hong Kong milk tea was delicious."
"I have been meaning to come here for brunch for a while and finally made it in.  I had a reservation which was good because I got here soon after opening, but the place was packed already.Tried several of the dumpling and brunch dishes.  Every dish was quite good.  The standout was the pastel de nata which is a Portuguese egg custard tart.  Would recommend coming here just to try that dish!  Best version I have had outside of Portugal."
"I had read that Fat Rice may be considered for a Michelin star next year based on this year's Michelin ""starrings"" of Chicago restaurants, so a friend and I came here for dinner to see what all the hype was about. We had a few small plates, the potstickers, two beverages, and the mini version of the arroz gordo in stew form and let me tell you: it lives up to the hype. I would not be at all surprised if it garners a Michelin star next year.The stew was ridiculous! So flavorful and vibrant. It was doused with a ton of ingredients and spices and the outcome was magical. The potstickers are similar to ones I've seen in a Toronto potsticker/dumpling specialty store where they pan fry it such that the process renders a beautiful, crispy, golden brown lace of crunch that connects the postickers. As for the small plates, I remember the eggplant one being especially delicious. Price-point wise, this is definitely on the pricier end and not somewhere I would frequent. But food is amazing and I would definitely come here for a nice dinner for whatever special occasion or date. Next time, I will also make it a point to save room for the Portuguese egg tarts, which look incredible."
"My co-worker has been raving about how authentic and delicious the food offered at Fat Rice was, so instinctively I knew I had to go try it out for myself.  I was in the area one day with my sister, so I suggested that we grab some dinner here.  There was barely any signage, so it was a little difficult to find the restaurant during the evening.  So take a note: it is located on the corner of Diversey and Sacramento in a building shared with an apartment complex.Finally when my sister and I found the restaurant, we were greeted immediately at the door.  The place was already bustling, but we managed to snag a couple of seats at the communal table.  The waitress came by shortly to explain a couple of popular entrees as well as some of their specials.  We decided to share the fat noodles in X.O. sauce and the Portuguese chicken (po kok gai.)  The fat noodles were just mediocre at best.  The X.O. sauce didn't have the bold spiciness to it.  It kind of tasted a little watered down.  The Portuguese chicken was cooked with mussels, chorizo, olives, and cabbage in a mild coconut curry.  I didn't enjoy this one bit.  They tried to spice up this dish with ingredients that just didn't go well with each other.  This definitely is a fusion dish that went wrong.I don't understand why so many people are raving about Fat Rice and how does it attract such long lines.  They are trying to create fusion dishes, but some things should just be left alone.  Overall, Fat Rice offers small mediocre entrees at ridiculous prices.  They even charged $3.00 for a bowl of rice whereas in most Asian restaurants rice is accommodated with the entrees.  Definitely save your time and money, skip this place.  If you're in the mood for some good Asian food, make the trip to Chinatown or to Argyle."
"So I took the wifey here as a surprise and purposely made it slip that we were going to mott street. I knew this was a gamble as there really are only two other restaurants I could take her to after alluding to mott street and it be ok....kai zan and fat rice. It was not overly crowded - likely due to it being the night after thanksgiving. I always start a joint off with five stars and work my way down if they leave a pitcher of water as I am a voracious drinker of it. We started off with the three small plates, the tofu and mushrooms, the special pig ears and the special clam. The tofu was something I had not had since I lived in Hong Kong and was great. The other two dishes were delicious. We order three larger plates - the squash dish, the piri piri chicken and fat noodles. The fat noodles are just so darn yummy. I wish we could figure out how to make the xo sauce at home. The squash dish was good but really put us over the edge when it came to the piri piri chicken with coconut rice. Have my wife we from Singapore means that any dish served with coconut rice is to die for and this was certainly the case. We ended up ordering a portion of fat noodles to eat the next day for lunch with the piri piri chicken leftovers. The meals was delicious and the service great as well. It had been 8 months since we last dined here, and I am committed to it not being that long the next time around."
"If you wanna find traditional Asian food, this is not a good idea. We come here especially for ""Arroz Gordo"" following other's advice, and now I am gonna punch that guy on his face."
"The problem with affordable food and fitting all the Brunch entrees on one page is you will want to order everything. How dare they make everything seem so attainable! And then, they have the nerve to tell you about their specials, so then you go an order those too. I guess this is only a problem for people who have eyes bigger than their actual tummies. I mean, how often does that happen?The menu appears simple but it is deceiving, because the food actually is more complex than its description. I dare you to look at the pictures I took of my brunch on Saturday morning. Sitting in the patio, surrounded by newly bloomed flowers on gray picnic tables, it is a humble setting, and then the plates come out adorned with bright, colorful foods with taste and spices to match.  Some foods are quite spicy but if you are not impressed, Fat Rice has its own ghost pepper sauce to light your fire. Vegetable Lacassa, their rice noodle soup, was our table's favorite dish. The three of us adore curry and this curry broth hits our list for one of the best around, at least as far as coconut curries go. The tea egg was a nice touch, and the tofu puffs definitely are protein ""fillers"" since there is no actual real meat in this dish (well unless you count the tea egg). Minchi Hash - With the minced pork and beef, crunchy croutons, and a sunny side up egg, it tasted as great as it looked! Colorful presentation and full of spices. How could you go wrong with this entree?Juicy Pork Chop Bun - You are literally eating a perfectly cooked pork chop as a sandwich, bone in, so it's packed with flavor, The chinese mustard definitely added flare to the dish but the pork chop was even good on its own. It is described as being served with crab chips, but they are more reminiscent of shrimp chips (or crackers) which are puffy deep fried crackers that are salty, light, and airy all at the same time. They are addicting and delicious and I took them off of my friend's plate and dipped them in my coconut curry.Dumplings. All are good. I can say this only because we ordered every type except the chive dumpling. I guess that was our limit for dumplings and that's why we stopped at the chives. Pastel de Nata - custard tarts - rich creamy thick and flan-like. Loved this!Chinese Almond Pudding - Sour cherry, rhubarbs, coconut, basil seed, and mint. This will definitely challenge those who have texture issues, but there is a great reward in sweetness and tasteThe one thing I wish I had room for - The Hong Kong Style French Toast. This is my friend's favorite dish, who lives in Chicago, and the reason why she keeps returning. It is typically served with peanut butter and banana stuffed jam OR maple bacon, so she requested bacon on the side to have the best of both worlds. It was a daring move on her part, but they definitely have a lifelong patron now."
"Hmm. Difficult review to write. First, the service at the bar was over the top phenomenal. Seriously enthusiastic and committed to this place. Food;  The only real highlight was the Piri Piri chicken. And that was 5 f**cking stars. Everything else, while very interesting, was just ok. The asparagus was 4*. The potato dessert was a disaster. Avoid at all cost. Good gin and tonic.Would I come back?  No."
"My friend actually got us a 9:15 reservation on a Friday night - we got there around 9pm, the hostesses were friendly and directed us to their waiting room about 2-3 doors down the street where snacks and drinks could also be ordered. Pretty amusing set-up. We waited enough to appreciate the parlor vibe but not long enough to have to order any waiting room refreshments. Got seated at one of the communal tables with space between us and another couple at the end of the table but no space between us and a group of four that came later with one mildly obnoxious dude who was very impressed with himself for being able to eat head-on shrimp. They ordered the Fat Rice for four; we ordered the same for two. Our server seemed taken aback by our appetites...and then we got two desserts after handily finishing the Fat Rice. One apparently gets a small Fat Rice for finishing the whole thing with two and a bigger pin for finishing the Fat Rice solo!It did take maybe five minutes after seating for our server to give us water and talk to us about the menu - we got a side of the mixed Sichuan pickles to go with the Fat Rice upon his recommendation. The pickles were not as good as the complimentary Sichuan peppercorn pickled cabbage that came before the meal - whereas the cabbage's natural sweetness paired well with the vinegar and peppercorn brine, the brine used on the mixed pickles tasted flat and could have used just a touch of sugar. Perhaps the preparation was authentic but the flavors were less than inspiring. The Fat Rice (Arroz Gordo) is as glorious as illustrated in the menu and as described - the shrimp and clams were fresh, clean, and thoroughly seasoned. The curry chicken thighs were deboned, tender, and well-sauced. The char siu slices were thick, juicy, and sweet whereas the linguica slices gave a chewy counterpoint on the other side of the pot. Underneath these generous toppings was rice infused with seafood and meat drippings and mixed with shredded duck and plump raisins. The rice was also decorated with slivers of little red chili peppers, tasty little olives (our server warned us the pits were still in), and cornichons. As expected, the rice had a charred bottom that was easily scraped up for our enjoyment. Drinks-wise, I got the Mallorca Melon iced tea, a refreshing but ultimately boring magneta liquid that tasted like hibiscus tea with a little fruity extra. It tasted like a somewhat less flavorful version of traditional Chinese sour plum iced drink. Friend was very happy with the salty g cocktail, which had a lovely herbaceous top note from whatever gin was used. He also got the tawny port with dessert - it was delicious on its own and went well with the potato tea cake's strawberry-rhubarb sauce but seemed like a somewhat skimpy pour for $12. In addition to the batata, we also got the serradura, an utterly delicious and creamy mousse covered in tea biscuit crumbs. A beautiful finish to a very strong meal."
"What a truly unique and splendid dining experience at Fat Rice. First, the geographic backdrop of this interesting (and delicious) fusion cuisine had me hooked. Macau is a  blend of Portuguese and Asian food that is singular in nature, flavor, and did I mention it's like heaven resting on my palette?!!Come here on a night when you're feeling adventurous, communal, and ready to eat yourself into a Macau coma. The sharing style that this place encourages is a lot of fun and makes for a great experience.We had salted cod spread, pork belly, fat noodle with xo, mackerel, and the amazing ""sawdust"" dessert. My particular favorites were the mackerel, salted cod, and dessert. Please do yourself a favor and save room for dessert. I know it seems daunting (especially if fat rice is your play...and let's be honest, why the hell not?!!) but get that cream cheese mousse dessert. You will most definitely thank me later.I would recommend asking for Maggie as a server too. Homegirl knows her sh*t and made 100% awesome recommendations. Plus, she's a family friend so BE NICE AND TIP EXORBITANTLY! :-) Cheers Fat Rice and don't you worry...I'll be back!"
"I told friends I was going here and they said, ""Hmm...yeah the Fat Rice is basically rice with just a bunch of random stuff dumped on top.""And that's exactly what it was. I mean, sure it was pretty good. But so is the bacon I ate for breakfast and I'm not going across town to drop big bucks on it. Also the rice closer to the bottom of the pot they serve it in was burnt and crackly.I don't get the hype based off my meal. Personally I think the Phat Rice at Urbanbelly is tastier. Ditto on the potstickers we had.For dessert we had the serradura, and I admit that was delicious. I'd get some more of that. But overall, I wouldn't come back or recommend it to others. I think you can get better Asian food for cheaper (where you don't have to wait in line)."
"I have had such a great experience here and wish I live in Chicago so I can come back again and again. We ordered-piri piri chicken African style: like it with the sauce-Portuguese egg tart: it is really authentic, the same as the ones I tasted in Macau-Porkchop bao: it is the best! The porkchop is both juicy and tender. Together with the house-made bread, it is the best! You have to try!-HK style milk tea: Another must-try! -The other fat rice: It was ok. Not my favorite. We had a nice talk with the waitress and it turned out she is half Chinese half American. The chef is Portuguese and I admired their passion for food and thank them for bringing authentic food to Chicago.  I wish I could try the Po Kok Gai and Fat Rice"
"I brought my sister here for her 33rd birthday dinner - we got there right at 530PM (when they open on Saturdays) and was somewhat confused that the restaurant was already almost packed.. maybe leftovers from the brunch crowd?  Not sure.  Anyhoo - we snagged two seats by the bar which was actually great because they have a completely open kitchen and we were able to watch all the food getting made.  Also the girl manning the bar was fantastic, super friendly with great suggestions on the food and drinks.We had the bacalhau - a salt cod spread topped with sliced chili peppers and green olives.  I normally detest olives, and the spread did have some olives chopped up and mixed in it, but it was delicious!  Really fantastic spread on top of their delicious house made bread.  Next we shared a white fish in a coconut curry sauce - really delicious, especially over their basmati coconut rice.  The last dish we had was the pirri pirri chicken - it was a LOT of meat.  Comes smothered in an african peanut sauce with roasted potatoes, gherkins, and olives (little green guys - not terribly offensive).All in all, a DELICIOUS meal.  I definitely want to come back and try out their brunch menu."
"The food, even with all the hype, was good. It reminded me of the first time I had Malaysian or Vietnamese food. It has flavor combos I hadn't considered. The staff, however, know their restaurant is hot right now, and were accordingly snobby. I usually tolerate a good amount of haughtiness, but they went too far, specifically the hostess. If this place wasn't in a city devoid of great Asian food, while still unique, I don't think they would get away with their attitude."
This place has an interesting and very delish take on Asian food! The music sets the perfect mood. Love this place!
"Dining here reminds me of dining in NYC.  Very small interior with high ceilings.  Hip, chic decor.  Hands down truly fabulous food.  We came here on a Saturday evening so it was busy and loud.  Since there are only a few tables we were told there would be a 45 minute wait.    To enter the waiting room you must walk out of the restaurant and down the street a few doors.  It felt very speakeasyesque.  There you entered another -even smaller- dimly lit space with a few tables where you could just sit and have a cocktail.  I did not have a cocktail but they sounded fabulous -- one in particular I will try next time: the 'salty g' which is gin, citrus cordial and salted preserved plum.  The tea selection was also nice with the inclusion of a 2010 Sicilian blood orange pu-erh.For dinner we (4 of us) shared: for appetizers - the 'bacalhau' which was a salt cod spread and french bread -- amazing!  Also, 'linguica' which is portuguese sausage - spicy and also served with bread.  The rest of our dinner included 'fat noodle', a hearty, hand rolled, dumpling like rice noodle and then the 'portuguese chicken' which had chorizo, olives, cabbage, potato with curry and lemon all served in a hot pot.  We had a couple sides of coconut rice to accompany that.  OH. WOW. LOVED. IT.  Perfect deliciousness.Service was lovely.  Definitely want to return.  A great place to bring friends from out of town who love a unique food experience.  It is pricey.  The chicken dish was $22 and not huge.  But everything was SO GOOD.   It's a sure thing.  It will be a place to return for a special night out.  I'll just come for a cocktail and an appetizer in between times."
"Worth the wait to get in! We headed over to Maza Azul while we waited for a table which was a great decision! Ordered the pick three (peanuts and eggplant are a great). We ordered the Fat Noodle dish with egg and mushroom and this is my favorite item on the menu! Try the ghost pepper hot sauce, but be ready! For the large dish, we ordered Portuguese Chicken which had great flavor. Would definitely order everything again and I saw lots of pot stickers so I wanna try those next time!"
"To say that Fat Rice was just a good meal, is definitely an understatement. Let me set the stage for you, Friday evening. I was rushing to get here after work and met some friends. We arrived at Fat Rice all decked out ready for dinner, drinks, and whatever happens preceding dinner and drinks. Admittedly, I stalked this place many times via the internet, word of mouth, and through various write-ups in the papers. Of course, this cozy little restaurant was packed. The friendly hostess told us about their waiting area a few doors down where we can have some drinks and light snacks while we wait. Drinking always makes the wait better. So we wait for our table and have this amazing libation called the Calimoxo (pronounced Cali-mow-cho""), it's red wine with coke and some lemon. I know it sounds strange, I promise you, its refreshing. We finally were seated and as I stated before, I stalked this place so we knew what we wanted. Fat noodle with X.O Sauce - The Fat Noodle wit xo sauce was a great start to our meal. These hand rolled wide noodles hold the complex flavors that they built in there. Baby Bok Choy - The baby Bok choy was not my favorite but certainly edible. I felt like it was a bit bland.Balichang Tamarindo -  Oh they knew how to win my heart through a braised cooked pork belly with a rich dark sauce topped with chiccharonnes, and pineapple.Arroz Gorodo (Fat rice) - The  mother of this perfect meal. Sofrito Jasmine rice topped with chicken, mussels, clams, prawns, char sui beef, and linguica sausage, and tea eggs. It was served much like a paella but way more flavorful. With the many components of the dish, every single item was cooked to perfection. I urge all of you readers to try this when you go.Pok Kok Gai ""Portuguese Chicken"" - Super tender chicken with mussels and chorizo in a coconut curry sauce. It was a merriment of flavors that I didn't think would go well together. The chorizo and mussels melded so well together in the curry sauce. It had the right amount of spice and we ate it on top of our coconut rice.Coconut Rice - Not slimy at all. Coconut rice, nuff said. It was delicious. The owners were very involved and very visible throughout our meal. The place is very small and the kitchen is open-style. I loved watching them work their magic in the kitchen. Everyone seemed very impressed by the wonderful food that was being produced. No complaints here either. The prices are a little expensive but the food is excellent so take that how you want. There is street parking readily available.  I am so glad to have been able to eat here and I think of the enormous yet delicious meal we had over and over again. I guess that means its time to go there again."
Visited Chicago over the Christmas holiday this year and my favorite foodie stop was Fat Rice!  I loved the casual atmosphere of a small neighborhood restaurant with the open kitchen. The menu was innovative. Our waitstaff was very helpful in our ordering process since most items were unusual based on their description.  We had an array of dishes and loved them all.My favorites were the Arroz Gordo and Pastel de Nata.  Fabulous!!
Well combined Chinese cooking way with indian and western taste.You just want to try their every dish.
"Yum!! I've never had Macanese food before so this was my first time--I was very intrigued because I could see how Portuguese influence played a part in the cuisine. Came here with my sister and her bf. What we liked was that there was a separate lounge from the restaurant where people could order drinks and small bites while they wait for their table! Our hostess said it would be about an hour, so we didn't mind chatting and drinking before dinner. It was only 45 minutes before they came over to the lounge to tell us our table was ready. WHAT WE GOT: 1) small bites plates: 3 plates for $10! We got the pickled veggies, pig ear, and eggplant with peanuts. We loved the eggplant and the pig ear! The pig ear was super tender--didn't even taste like we were eating pig ear because the texture was so, so soft. Pickled veggies were just eh, not amazing.2) Potstickers: filled with pork, shrimp, dill, and accompanied by black vinegar. We loved the egg-crepe thing that comes on top that connects all the potstickers! Wish I could make this at home myself....3) The beloved FAT RICE aka ""ARROZ GORDO"": On the site it describes the dish as .....""Reminiscent of paella, Arroz Gordo is a bountiful, home-style, layered rice dish [...]Jasmine rice laced with sofrito, chinese sausage, salted duck and topped with portuguese chicken thighs, char sui pork, linguiça sausage, fatty prawns, clams, tea eggs, croutons, assorted pickles and sauces"" ------This was gooooooood. It was the perfect amount for 3 people after the appetizers we got! What we loved most about this dish was that it came with literally every time of meat and a variety of seafood. This did remind of of paella--but again, this was good, not amazing for the prize. We thought the bowl would be a bit bigger for $48 even though it did come with a big variety. SERVICE: Waiters/runners were very nice and accomodating, explaining every dish to us. I would come back here again! We all agreed we'd love to try what else is on the menu."
"Absolutely delicious and unlike anything I've ever had! Service was quick and friendly. I made a reservation for a Thursday night, got there 20 min early, and was seated almost immediately. I would highly recommend making a reservation because it was totally full around 7:30, and when I left at 8:30, there was a wait of almost 10 people. My boyfriend and I had the salted cod spread and the signature fat rice. OMG. The fat rice may seem small because it comes in a regular sized bowl but between the two of us, we could barely finish half. The clams and prawns were perfectly seasoned, the pork and sausage were absolutely delicious and had a smoky flavor, the curried chicken was an excellent balance to the more salty flavors, and the rice itself was AMAZING...so amazing that it deserves its own sentence: it was perfectly crispy and moist at the same time, and the duck breast and sausages were a beautiful touch. I can't wait to come back and try more!!!"
"Fat rice now offers brunch on Friday, Saturday (11am-2pm), and Sunday (11am-3pm)! It's a Macanese dim sum menu with lots of goodies to choose from. We came with four people which is a good number since many of the dishes come in multiples of four, and you can get a taste of everything. We ordered almost one of everything off the menu:- pickles and peanuts- guava & cheese toast- 10 karat dumplings- shu mai (with a twist)- pork dumpling- Macanese minchi- clam & bacon congee- Fishball lacassa- Portuguese egg tart- almond puddingWith the Portuguese influences, this is definitely not your typical dim sum. Flavors really marry well, even surprisingly the Big Mac shu mai. My fave was probably the Macanese minchi, which is a minced pork over rice, which sounds simple, but I dare you not to fill your bowl a second and a third time.You can really taste the love that goes into the preparation of the food -- from the homemade dumpling skin to the homemade egg tart crust. I hear that they're still perfecting a xiao long bao (soup dumpling) recipe so I hope that makes it to the menu in the future!Very enjoyable, would definitely recommend for an alternative brunch option, or if you don't feel like getting rudely snubbed in Chinatown."
Came in with a group of 6 for the dim sum brunch. We ordered a variety of plates but the Favorites of our table was the porkchop sandwich that comes with 3 crab crackers and the egg custard! I love how they cooked the egg custard here (with more egg and less crust) compared to Chinatown's version. We met the owner and she is super cool and so nice!
"The food was imaginative and tasty, a winning combination.  We sat at a community table (it's a small space) and thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. I am vegan, and had many options from which to choose. The is a coded such that any dietary issues can be easily addressed"
I have never had egg tarts before they are good but not even sour why are they not but I like them anyways also the rice was nice but less fat that I thought I would eat here again more times even though they lie on their menu.
"Dear Asian Fusion restaurants, why you make me pay double for food I get in Chinatown? Oh wait, Chicago's Chinatown ain't that cheap, either. Nevermind.Fat Rice had been on my ""to try"" list for some time, so when a friend recommended their new Macanese dim sum Sunday menu, we made the trek out to Logan Square. I've honestly never had Macanese food--a dang shame, too--since the Portuguese-Chinese-Malay influences are a triumvirate of deliciousness.The dim sum menu is actually light on actual dim sum. A few small plates and dumpling dishes blot the menu, but there's still a push to noodle-rice-soup dishes in the entree section. The pork dumplings were good, with a really tasty skin, but I greatly enjoyed and preferred the ""10 karat"" dumplings, a shu mai looking creature that was pure gold. The homemade dumpling sauce, heavy on the vinegar, was a plus. Small dishes were mostly forgettable--what should be free or a buck-fitty at a traditional Chinese restaurant was extravangantly overpriced. Also, the guava-cheese toast sounded great in theory but really just made me wish they made kaya toast in the States.The entrees, while a bite out of the wallet, were surprisingly delicious. I really dug the clam-bacon congee, particularly the picture-perfect poached egg that oozed delectable yellow into a sea of orange. I also can't recommend enough throwing a few dashes of Fat Rice's ghost pepper hot sauce into the mix. The lacassa soup tasted like Thai tom yum blended with a Singaporean laksa. Which is to say, a little spicy, a modicum of sour, and a lot tasty.Despite being filled to the brim, we finished off with an almond pudding and some Portuguese egg tarts, two desserts I'm all too familiar with given my Asian heritage. The almond pudding was fantastic, elevated with slices of Asian pear and longans (as opposed to the traditional Dole fruit cocktail I'm so accustomed to). As for egg tarts, I vastly prefer the Taiwanese style puff pastry to the traditional Cantonese dim sum ones, so I was pleased to see the puffy Portuguese menu offering.Overall, I abhor paying American prices for Asian food, but Fat Rice acquitted itself nicely. Well done."
"First time trying Macanese food and I was not disappointed! If there is a wait for seats, they direct you to their lounge three doors down (a bit tricky to find apparently) where you can order drinks and snacks (e.g. nuts, chips, etc) while you wait. My sister and I had two of their house-made sodas, ginger and grapefruit, and my bf, a locally brewed sour beer. After what seemed like 10 minutes which was actually 45 minutes of waiting, thanks to the lounge, we were finally seated. If you aren't done with your drinks in the lounge, they bring it over to your table in the main dining area which is awesome! After perusing the menu, we decided on the following:Three small plates:-sweet & sour eggplant - our favorite of the three-pig ear furuso - nice and spicy, soft but not crunchy-mixed jumpwater pickles - what do you expect? the name says it all!We also got a complimentary dish of lemongrass carrots! Back to what we ordered:-potstickers - came with a nice crispy crepe-like shell holding all of them together; love the mix of textures and the dill really came out in them-arroz gordo - really good, reminded us basically of a macanese paella with everything going on! I love that there was little bits of everything here and there instead of having just one protein, or else it would've been boring/old after a while. Here is where the knocked off star comes, because after paying $48 for this dish, we thought the bowl would have been bigger. Yes, we were stuffed by the end of our meal, and I get that the different proteins and the time it takes to assemble the dish counts for something, but I'm not sure if it justified the $48 tag.Service was accommodating and attentive, though it did seem like they were rushing us to finish. Despite these little nit-picky things, I would definitely come back here!"
"Outstanding customer service, amazing high quality food and ingredients. Quick and efficient service. We loved all 4 dishes we had, the fried tofu, the banana spring rolls, the fish balls and the curry rice veggies main dish. They all tasted incredible. To end the meal we had kind of a cheese cake but softer with caramel sauce and cookies made power on top. Good job! This place rocks, we will be back! Just need to say watch the time you go and maybe better to make a reservation. We got lucky but it's a small place and always packed. The first time we headed there we were told 2 hours waiting to be seated...so we left and came back this Sunday nov. 23rd at 1:30pm and no waiting time but almost packed..."
"Over-rated....even by me!Loved my server, Jan who was a bundle of energy, so i'm giving Fat Rice a 3 (instead of a 2).Food was ok to not ok. In fairness they had a few other dishes (chicken, pot sticker, fried rice) that i need to try before fully making up my mind. So, that's a good sign that i'll go back.Dinner for one, no drinks $45 plus tip. Bit too much for what it is."
"My husband and I came here on a whim for brunch one Sunday after having read Chicagoist's listing of best dumpling places in the area, which included Fat Rice. My friend mentioned this place over a year ago and the Chicagoist article just propelled me to give this place a shot. I had heard about the crazy wait times so my Husband and I had a snack prior to leaving for this place. Well we walked in around 2pm and there was a whole communal table open along with several areas at the bar. We did not have to wait at all. Score! The waitress came over and took our drink orders and then told us we should have a couple starters, a couple shared plates, and definitely one main each. That seemed like a lot of food, how does she know how hungry we were? (We weren't since we had that snack!) We ordered the sour chili cabbage, chive dumplings, steamed pork & shrimp dumplings, sweet & sour stuffed eggplant, and shared one main (minchi hash). The presentation of the food was great, however, the taste was not there. Many Chinese restaurants serve a pickled cabbage appetizer, and perhaps I wrongfully assumed this would be similar. It had very little taste but we ate it all cuz we like vegetables in general. The eggplant was good, but my mom makes it better. And the dumplings.... those were disappointing especially because that was supposedly the draw. The chive dumpling skin was so thick in the middle, it was similar to how an amateur would fold a dumpling (i.e., my dumplings look like that). There were crazy garnishes on the dumplings too, flowers and sprouts. The minchi hash was very salty, the only redeeming factor was the 3 small bok choy given to offset the salt. Once the hash was mixed together, it did not look very appetizing. The pork pieces were large and the potato croutons were odd.I have been to Macau twice and this is not the type of food you find there. I know this place is ""Asian Fusion"" - that should have been my first red flag. I'm generally not a fan of fusion as it is confusing and doesn't seemed defined one way or the other. They are usually Franken-dishes and not the flavors a common person would think about or crave. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the meal. But, since we didn't get caught in traffic driving here, or had to endure a wait for a table, I was less upset than I could have been. PS - I had forgotten to check in with my friend who originally mentioned this place. Followed-up with her after the meal and found out that she too did not have a great experience here."
"Macanese food?  Who knew it was so good?  I love food from the fringes of the great foodie countries.  Macao is exactly that, a delicious amalgam of Chinese, Portuguese, and Southeast Asian food.  This is not fancy food ... it's homey, comfortable, unpretentious and ultimately delicious.We went for brunch.  We had to change our reservation and they were so accommodating even though the Open Table system said there was no availability (amazing what a real phone call can do!).  This place is small, only about 40 seats total.  A bustling open kitchen takes up half the square footage and that's a fun thing.  Because of the small space, they do not take parties larger than 6.Service is attentive and informative but the place is loud so pay attention!  There's a full bar with specialty cocktails, beer and wine.  There's also a tea list.  Nice.The brunch items are meant to be shared.  For starters we had the stewed peanuts, fried egg tofu, boiled pork dumplings and steamed pork and shrimp dumplings.  The stewed peanuts are nice for a nibble but they show up in various other dishes so I wouldn't advise getting them as a separate dish.  The fried egg tofu is a hot silky thing but could have been crispier and the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste.  The boiled pork dumplings are expertly rendered, a perfectly chewy wrapper with porky filling sitting in a lovely vinegary chili sauce.  The steamed dumplings are also good but as an affirmed Chinese dumpling connoisseur these were just ok.We shared a sampling of the bigger items.  The pork chop bun is a sandwich that features a very juicy deep fried pork chop nestled in a warm Portuguese bun.  The bun is quite amazing actually, the crust is thin and crisp, almost like duck skin.  It is served with a spicy Chinese mustard sauce and crab chips.  But where are the sandwich accoutrements - greenery, pickles, etc?  Seems a big miss there.The eponymous ""Fat Rice"" dish, Arroz Gordo, is their signature item.  This is Macanese paella.  The base is a bowl of seasoned rice containing olives, raisins, shredded duck meat and Chinese sausage.  The bowl is then topped with various meats and seafood.  It's not just topped - it's stuffed till overflowing with fatty prawns, clams, BBQ pork belly, curried chicken thigh, Portuguese sausage, tea eggs.  It's a mountain of gastronomic goodness - truly impressive.  Each meat is cooked separately and arranged strategically to maximize the density of presentation.  There's something to be savored in each bite and it takes some time to eat the whole thing.  There's a reason this dish is traditionally served at family celebrations - it's communal, nostalgic, and heartwarming.  Oh, lest I forget: The fatty prawn is the bomb.Unbelievably, we ordered some more food.  The Macanese hash is a riff on bibimbop - coconut scented jasmine rice, stir-fried minced beef and pork, swiss chard, fried egg, with crispy puffed rice and potato croutons.  Yummy.  The vegetarian curry is a yellow coconut curry served with rice and all kinds of delicious vegetarian stuff.  It's amazingly good - salty, sweet, sour, curry coconutty richness, and a multitude of textural elements from the vegetarian add-ins.  Like a carnaval in your mouth.One more thing: Get the Portuguese egg tarts.  Maybe the best ever.  Ever."
"I'm worried the 3 star review may come off as aggressive but wait and read though my review. Finally Fat Rice decided to take reservations so I made one and went with one of my girlfriends. I even made a second one for a couple months post, convinced I was going to love this place and want to come back.We were about 10 mins late for our reservation and they couldn't have been nicer. We called ahead to tell them we were on our way and they said no problem and held our table for us. Once we arrived we dove right into the menu. We needed help - so many of the items on this menu are unrecognizable so the waiter literally had to walk us through line by line. He did so without being annoyed even though he probably does this at every table all day/night long. Here's what we ordered: - Pig Ears, this was on special - kind or rubbery, almost looked like a ribbon vs. pig ears- Bacalhau, this was pretty delicious - it came with a small warm loaf of bread and it's probably some of the best ""hummus"" esk food I've had- Fat Noodle, Mushroom & Egg, this was promised to us with a fried egg and it was more like a scrambled egg - kind of a disappointment. The fat noodles are like what these guys are know for - I thought it was good, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was life changing. They are big fat noodles - taste more like potatoes or gnocchi than noodles. I would order this again but was not in love like some of the other reviewers here.- Pot Stickers, ok so these are good, but they are potstickers - this is not revolutionary!! but they are good. I will give you that.- Portuguese chicken, this was cheesey and good. Lots of flavor but super heavy. I would probably try a different entree instead next time.- Coconut Rice, basic white rice with coconut shavings on top - we didn't need this but it was a nice side with the chicken.Net Net:Service: 5Food: 2/3"
"An easy five star rating. When dish after dish can surprise you with flavor complexity and unique texture, there's nothing to do but smile, shoot praise to the kitchen, and enjoy yourself. The best moments of this meal included a crab apple and rum punch that makes me want to get vinegar on my bar ASAP, an XO smothered noodle dish that out shame to egg noodles everywhere, and a tamarind washed pork belly that was a match made in heaven to the coconut rice. Order a lot and share. As our waitress told us, this stuff makes great leftovers. I can't vouch for that though, because there was nothing left when we walked out."
Came here for brunch and I loved it. The pork and ginger boiled dumplings were really good. The minchi hash was AMAZING and pretty big.
"First off--Fat Rice should definitely advertise that Macanese cuisine (a blend of southern Chinese and Portuguese cuisines) is SPICY and that if you don't like spicy foods, don't come. I have a low spicy tolerance, but my boyfriend's is extremely high and he commented: ""this is the spiciest restaurant I have ever been to."" We both eat pescetarian out, so we got basically everything veg/fish on the menu (it's a meat heavy menu, so that sufficiently narrowed our options). For bites we got: jumpwater pickles (too spicy for me); burdock root (wasn't spicy but was only okay); and the sweet and sour eggplant (spicy but deliciously sour). The fat noodles with mushroom and egg came next and those were great (and not spicy!) These are wide rice noodles rolled up into a thick cylinder bite. Really tasty.The mackerel was, unfortunately, entirely too spicy for me to eat (I took one bite and was done for), but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it and said it was one of the spiciest dishes he's ever had out. (Note: I think this one should be categorized with 2 spicy signs on the menu instead of 1).Finally, my favorite... the malay vegetable curry with a side of coconut rice. So perfect. So many wonderful, bold, almost fruity flavors (cilantro, coconut, cashew curry, cabbage, sweet potato, pineapple, fluffy tofu, onions..) Really, really heavenly (with a slight kick), and I can't wait to enjoy my leftovers for lunch today (it was a fairly large portion so we couldn't finish it).The cream cheese mousse for dessert was a satisfying way to finish up the meal (it soothed our burning tongues). It was fluffy, creamy, and devoured in about 2 minutes. Fat Rice is a place you should check you if you're an adventurous foodie who likes heat. I probably won't be back again for dinner until the menu changes (since we really ordered everything we could order as non meat-eaters). But it was definitely a fun and spunky experience."
I don't understand why this place only had four stars. It should have ten in my book! Best restaurant in Chicago.
"This review was for Brunch on Saturday (11/22).I had read a lot of favorable reviews about Fat Rice beforehand so eating here was definitely something to which I'd been looking forward. I'm also a big fan of eating a place's signature dish. I couldn't do that here because the fat rice is a $48 dish intended for 3-4 people.Instead, my date and I tried the kimchee, a pork-chop bun with crab chips, Macanese hash and the fried egg tofu.The hash and the pork-chop were delicious. My favorites were the egg tofu and the crab chips, however. Those chips somehow combine the appearance of styrofoam with an excellent flavor and just have to be eaten to be believed. Yes, you'll want to use then as dunnage at 1st glance but they are wonderful. The fried egg tofu is also an unusual flavor profile in that the texture of the egg adds a lot to the tofu without overpowering it.The only miss for me was the cabbage. It was a little over-seasoned with what tasted like star anise to me. Of course, I'm no chef so that means no anise probably ever got close to it."
Went for lunch and can't wait to go back for dinner.
"come here for the interesting food, but Im not sure about the taste of everything. we tried the lacassa and the steamed yong kau fu and the portuguese egg tarts. the tarts were the best tasting of all, and reminds me of authentic portuguese food, I will come back for those. they are sweet, so get them for dessert. The lacassa wasnt the best, i didnt find it too authentic- it is a biggish dish though and all the food we ordered was good for 2 people. I would recommend the Hong Kong tea, since it comes with condensed milk but ask for less ice. The place itself is interesting in terms of decor, it looks like a lunch room that you would find in the Far East. Rather laid back in looks, but the food is a little pricy for me, given that I wasnt really wowed by it. They do have a sauce that I plan to get as well, which they make in the restaurant of ghost peppers, has a good kick to it. I came here a second time as well with friends, the Fat Rice itself is rather small as dishes go, but was filling."
"Overrated!  The food her was mediocre! Over priced on cheap quality ingredients that anyone can make.Come for drinks, but not food.  Oh and the wait is long if you don't know anyone."
"When this place first opened, it was such a welcome change to the traditional hipster foodie landscape in Logan Square. I came here all the time. Had I written a review the first few times, they would have been 4-5 stars because this place offered such a novel experience, and the food was very flavorful and the flavors authentic. Each time I visit, I always get the Fat Rice. I've had the Fat Noodle before, too, but don't think it's worth it. Tonight made me rethink whether the Fat Rice is worth it. The rice is supposed to be ""caramelized"" and somewhat crunchy at the bottom where it lines the clay pot, but moist throughout the rest of the dish. It has been this way 100% of the times I ate it in the past. The way to achieve this is to have sufficient liquid in pot while cooking, and to not cook it in/over super high heat.Unfortunately, this time the rice was tough, dry, hard and crunchy throughout, and burnt on the bottom - it was so inedible that we had to order extra coconut rice on the side just to have rice with our meal. When the chef (Abraham) came over to inspect it, he said that level of char was normal. I wish he had tasted it to see how awful it was. Rice is not supposed to be painful when you eat it. It was worse than eating under cooked rice because of the burnt flavor, and so hard it I couldn't chew it without hurting my teeth. The thing about this dish is that the toppings are so flavorful and spicy that it cries out for something to balance it - like rice. But if the rice isn't good, you're left with a mouth full of salty, spicy meat and seafood. And at $48 a pop, you're left feeling robbed even if just one element of the dish was poorly executed. I previously thought the price was worth it because the dish was so unique and tasty. But I sadly can't justify it anymore. I don't normally pay attention to the service because it's usually really good. This time was a mixed bag. The waitress in the waiting lounge was awesome. Our main waitress in the restaurant had attitude, so that kind of soured the whole evening. Chef Abraham's denial of the burntness of our rice was disappointing. There was one waiter who floated in at the end who actually asked how our meal was and actually listened to my remarks, which smoothed things over a bit.Macanese food is hard to come by in the US, let alone Chicago. If you've never had it, it's worth a try just for the experience. But sadly, this is will no longer be my go-to neighborhood spot as the food and service don't justify the prices anymore."
"Have had the pleasure of enjoying both a fantastic brunch and more recently a wonderful dinner at Fat Rice. You often hear people speak about ""layers of flavor"" in food and if you are not quite sure what this term means, dine here. My dinner here came on a snowy, sub zero wind chill Chicago evening and was the perfect remedy; I entered the restaurant weather weary and left with a big smile on my face. Hearty, warming, delicious food. Fat Rice is a restaurant worth travelling for; very unique cuisine executed perfectly; I am ecstatic to reside just a short walk away. I am looking forward to exploring more of the menu in the near future."
"We had some incredible culinary experiences while stayin in logan square, and all over Chicago for that matter, and that is the only reason that I knocked off 1 star. This place was great, came highly recommended, but with so many other options that (for me) kicked on every cylinder, I would have to say 4 stars."
"The whole experience was great from start to finish. Welcoming hostess, knowledgeable staff, and very good food.  Will be returning very soon!"
"I usually do not give 3 stars to a great meal, but although most of the food was good, the things they should be best known for were not and they are way over-priced. This is certainly a hipster's paradise- over charged food that can be made with pennies. It cracks me up. For instance, $3 for a piece of bread, no not a loaf. It's an itty bitty piece of bread disguised as a loaf! They should serve miniature silverware to go with the theme. It would go with the miniature ambiance. It's a tiny place with little room away from the next table with tiny plates and tiny bowls, but exorbitant prices!! You are basically eating one meal, but probably paying for 2.5 tables of guests eating that one meal. And now onto the food:  Lemongrass carrot: pretty goodBacalhau- salt cod spread- delicious and yet the smallest plate I've ever seenpotstickers- pork, shrimp, dill, with a black vinegar dipping sauce- My absolute favorite. No complaints here. bredo raba raba-mixed yard weeds, green papaya, mushrooms, etc...- good, but expensivepapa seco- Portuguese bread- waaayyy over pricedArroz Gordo ""Fat Rice""- Now this is where I leave the rest of my review. This place is named FAT RICE, so why is it that the dish that the entire restaurant is named after is the worst dish on the menu? I thought the rice tasted like it came from a rice-a-roni box! It was just...well...plain and simply put, NASTY! I thought the prawns were delicious. They were super spicy, so not for the weak at taste, but they were full of flavor for those that can get through the spice. The rest of it was cheap throwaways- pieces of bbq pork, chorizo, and blah blah blah... I'm bored. For $48, I would have rather gone to the grocery store and ordered a few pounds of prawns and cooked them at home instead of wasting my money on 4 for nearly $50 and a bowl of bad rice that probably cost pennies!! Overall, everything else but the fat rice, although way overpriced, was delicious."
"Food: 3.5Service:5My husband and I have been meaning to come here for well over a year, but we heard that there was always a line and we don't like lines so we never made it out. However, on Friday we decided to go around 6 and we were so happy because there were only a few other diners and no line yet. Yay!We started with some pickles (sichuan eggplant, special pickle of the day, lemongrass carrots). Our favorite was the sischuan eggplant...very tasty and nice flavors. We had the linguica to start. The sausage was very good and the portion was generous. I believe they make the sausage in house possibly. Then we had the fat noodle with X.O. sauce. This was good, but we eat a lot of Chinese food so we are pretty usesd to rice noodle rolls and XO sauce so this didn't really stand out for us. This tasted like something you could get in Chinatown. Although it was good, but we were not blown away. It was not some new taste we had never had before. Although, I imagine that for people that don't eat that much Chinese food, XO sauce and thick rice noodles might be more exciting.We then ordered the raba raba, which was a stirfried veggie of the day. I actually really liked this dish. The veggies weren't over cooked and they had that asian stir fried veggie taste but with a twist (chard/kale type veggies were used). I could have eaten a whole second plate of this.We then had the the Portuguese Chicken and an order of coconut rice. I loved the rice and you could smell the coconut before you even ate it. The chicken was good, but it was kind of a curry chicken type dish. The flavors were familiar and tasty. The dish was very good but not great. Maybe we should have ordered the piri piri because that looked a little more exciting. To finish, we had the blackberry pudding cake. This was outstanding. It was like a mousse but also like a cake. Even my husband who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth loved this. I want the recipe. Soooo good.We each had a few cocktails and they were okay, not great. However, the thing that really sets this place apart is the service. Our server, Matthew, was phenomenol. He was friendly and made great suggestions. He was always there if we needed something, but he didn't hover. All the waiters/bus boys/servers at this place were great and even when they were busier later in the night, the service remained awesome. Overall, we enjoyed the food. However, we have heard so many things about this restaurant, we might have set our expectations too high. Overall the food was good, but a lot of the flavors you can get at a Chinese place for cheaper. We will be back to try out the fat rice at some point though!"
"I came to Chicago with one soul mission: to eat my heart out on the most remarkable Chicago ""soul food"" I could find. And by ""soul food"" I mean a cook's passion for flavor-melding and tradecraft; to market their food as an upspring of emotion, good feeling, family and time-honored tradition. Chicago has its deep dish, its haute dawg, its Italian and Polish and beef smorgasbord. But who knew that I'd discover the best meal that I've ever had in 40+ years on this continent at an anecdote written about two foodies returning from their travels to Macao. Fat Rice is the mutha grubbing bomb, dog! Don't sleep on the good eats found at this curation of Asian glory. (I'm from Denver. And I've been humbled.)"
"Great brunch spot we had to wait at their waiting room about 2-3 doors down the street. Croquette and other brunch options were really good. Very casual, room is cozy so not recommended for a large group."
"Huge fan. It's a small restaurant, so the wait was 45 min-1hr on a Friday night at 7. They have a hidden lounge/bar while you wait. I had an amazing cocktail called ""The Lover"" that had hibiscus-infused vodka and little ""bubbles"" of chia seeds. I also shared with infamous ""Arroz Gordo"" with my husband. So many tastes to explore in one bowl! The tea egg and rice topped with mushroom soy sauce made the dish for me - perfect salty accompaniment to a slightly sweet/savory dish."
"After a brief tweet conversation about where we should go for ""field trip friday"" it was decided that Fat Rice was our only option. We took different cars and thankfully my travel companion and I chose the scenic route because appetizers were just arriving as we were seated at our table for six.Before I had a chance to even look at the menu I was greeted by delicious house made pickled vegetables and a most wonderful and slightly peculiar peanut dish. The menu calls them ""charlie's peanuts"" and I'm not sure who Charlie is, but he has good taste. Seasoned with lotus, burdock & star anise, they were delightful little nibbles eaten with the provided chopsticks.Following the first round of bites we had some fried egg tofu. Deeeeeelightful texture, with a hint of maple. The balance was perfect, and I'm glad I shoved the whole thing in my mouth. Perfectly hot and melty.Next up? Some homemade boiled pork dumplings, with a sichuan garlic oil & sweet soy sauce that was so good, my friend Moshe poured the remaining sauce from the serving dish into a spoon and slurped it up. No shame here folks. We were in the zone.If that wasn't enough, we also enjoyed some chive dumplings. Great crisp texture on the outside with a strong green chivy center. Lots of great vegetarian options on this menu friends. Veg-heads don't be shy.In between our apps, I ordered a glass of the mallorca melon iced tea. It was slightly purple in color and had a bright floral flavor. Fat Rice serves their cold drinks with giant bubble tea straws, which helped me gulp down this ice cold smack to the palette.For my main dish, I waivered for a bit and ordered the macanese hash, which features pork and beef. As the orders came flying towards our friendly server, I overheard the phrase ""pork chop bun"" and changed my order. Our waitress nodded knowingly, and said I had made the right choice.AND OH MY GOD I TOTALLY DID! Don't get me wrong, everything I consumed was good. But the pork chop? The best! It was perfectly juicy, crispy on the outside, seemingly deep fried and just wonderful. No question one of the best pieces of (non BBQ) pork I've had in my life. Sandwiched in a homemade roll fitting for the ultimate banh mi, it instead supported the ultimate pork chop and some super flavorful, spicy mustard. Sticky and thick, it was nice that it was offered as a side VS. just being put on the sandwich.And back to the porkchop... it was bone in. After I ate the majority of my perfect sandwich, I nibbled on the bones and ate everything I could. It was worth the effort. At this point, all of the flavors and textures started overwhelming my senses. I chomped on the crab chips that came with my sandwich, and pondered what could possibly top this unexpectedly wonderful brunch...And that's when dessert arrived. Portuguese egg tarts and bowls filled with incredibly paired fruits were plated and the entire table exploded in excitement. After all of the things we encountered, from the gorgeously plated hash (see my pictures) to the INCREDIBLE looking ""hong kong"" french toast with hand picked berries, we knew this final round of food was going to be amazing. And speaking of amazing, at this point we were also served up a carafe of ""boozy bourbon"" tea. Holy smokes, it was delish! Anyways... back to the desserts. The fruit bowl featured a great mix with seeds, rhubarb, strawberries and ... I think coconut? There was also a bit of a pudding like product. It was bright and fresh. Like all of the dishes I experienced, it provided both the perfect balance of flavors and textures.The portuguese egg tart was gorgeous. In itself, would have been notable for the flaky crust and bright creamy inside. But the fact that it was a meal ender... a wonderful wave goodbye from the kitchen.Finishing my meal, I was a bit overwhelmed.  I felt like a king. Five stars for one of the best brunches I've ever had."
"This place can be hard to get into.  There is always a line and the place is small.  The food is unique,  fresh and yummy! Our server gave us excellent recommendations and we look forward to coming back."
"Not bad, not great, just... eh. Cute spot, interesting menu, but it just doesn't have anything that stands out. Maybe I am just over the uber hipster movement of the moment, and I just wanted a comfortable spot at the bar. Unfortunately, that can't be done here. Bar seats ate treated like a table.The food is ok. The wine was alright. At the end of the day, it just didn't impress.  For the money, I could have gone to a fine dining establishment."
"Trendy Spot and Interesting CuisineI enjoyed the room design, the open kitchen atmosphere, the specialty cocktails, the eclectic music, and the overall hipness of Fat Rice. Our server was very pleasant, knowledgeable and super hot - which is always a nice bonus too. The food itself was okay - as a group of five, we ordered several starters and entree-sized dishes to share - and while we all agreed that everything tasted good - nothing really wowed any of us - especially a dry and rather worthless dessert cake. Still, the overall flavors in the meal were interesting enough to warrant a second visit, should the occasion arise."
"Wow. I've been dying to go to Fat Rice for some time, and it did not disappoint. A friend and I went there on a Tuesday evening, and the restaurant was actually bubbling with activity - a good sign for a random weeknight. We sat outside in one of the back booths and didn't feel distracted by everything going on outside. The waitress told us to pick between 3-4 dishes, not including the small bites listed at the top corner of the menu. She was very nice and explained the menu and portion sizes thoroughly, then provided some great recommendations.To start off, they bring you boiled peanuts; a good way to start a meal. Then, we ordered a small bite, the Sichuan eggplant with peanuts. The eggplant was sweet and salty and spicy, yet not overwhelmingly so. The texture was also just right. It was a good first dish.Then, we moved on to the potstickers. Seven of them came on a plate, and they actually came in a fun presentation where you had to break them apart in order to dip and eat them. The black vinegar sauce served with them was very good, and you could definitely discern the pork and shrimp within each potsticker. They came in piping hot as well, so we knew that they were freshly made.From there, we ordered a dish with string beans and minced pork minchi. The beans were great - crispy and salty, and again, spicy. Although there were many peppers on the plate, the green beans were not too spicy. The minced pork minchi was delicious as well. I was ready to sprinkle them on top of rice and just eat spoonfuls of it.Lastly, we ordered the po kok gai (Portuguese chicken) with a side of coconut rice. Having been to Macau before, I was very excited to try their po kok gai. The sauce was creamy and rich, yet not too heavy for a summer day. The boiled eggs, potatoes, and of course, chicken, were delicious in the sauce; and all of it was delicious atop the fragrant coconut rice. Again, there was a hint of spice to the sauce, yet it was not overpowering. (The leftovers the next day were great too!)Overall, I really enjoyed my trip to Fat Rice. I can't wait to go again and actually try their namesake, the fat rice. I think I'll need to bring more people so I can try more things next time though!"
"THIS PLACE IS SOOOO GOOD. I got the Fat Rice because it was their signature dish, and boy was that a great choice! I'm sure the rest of the menu is tasty as well, but Fat Rice was heavenly! The curry chicken was tender and falls apart upon the tough of the spoon, and the char siu pork was tender and its flavor was spot on! The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the stuffed chilies are super hot -- beware! The jasmine infused rice was charred just to perfection but also soft and full of aroma. Oh, and the potstickers are absolutely perfect!"
"This review is for their brunch, I haven't been to Fat Rice for dinner yet. If brunch is any indication of the quality, dinner plans have to made soon. My 2 younger cousins and I arrived at 11am and were seated in seconds. The place is tiny so don't be rolling in with a large group. Four in a group seems to be the best number, especially since most of the small plate offerings came 4 to an order. Everything we ordered was good, some very good.  If you are going to only order a couple items, I have to say that you can't go wrong with any of the dumplings and the pork chop sandwich is a must!!  I'm getting ahead of myself though (get the pork chop sammich!!!) We started with two orders of the egg custard tarts, fried egg tofu and chinese almond pudding. The egg tarts were right out of the oven and just excellent. I think the kitchen should have let them cool down a little more though. Our server gave us the option of having the tarts in the beginning or the end of our meal and looking back, I think having them at the end as dessert is the better option. The tofu was the only dish that was just okay. It came as four small disks of fried tofu with a creamy center but it turned out to be bland, even with the accompanying sauce and mushrooms. The almond pudding was light and a nice cool down after having two hot items. This too might be better at the end of the meal. For entrees, we ordered the minci (macanese hash), pork chop sandwich and the hong kong toast. The hong kong toast was good and the most American breakfast item on the menu. It was stuffed with a little too much peanut butter and a little greasy. The server poured a small glass of coconut milk over the toast but I thought that made a already sweet dish even sweeter. The minci was very good and had a good balance of each ingredient. I poured a little of the coconut milk in the minci and I loved that it changed the taste to almost a thai curry flavor. Try it out!  When the pork chop sandwich came out, I was really skeptical because it was literally just a bun and chop. There was a side of mustard and some chip puffs but outside of those, it looked almost too simple. I understand now, the pork is so good and it doesn't need anything else except maybe a light smear of mustard. I repeat, get it!Service was excellent and we didn't feel hurried as the brunch crowd grew and grew out the door. Welcome to the brunch scene Fat Rice!"
Asian fusion done right.  A fun lunch at the bar.  Service was good from start to finish.  Enjoyed all the dishes - dumplings and macanese hash were the standouts.  I'd gladly come back and try this for dinner.
"So. This one has been on my list for a while now. We did a walk in and it was super easy to land a table on a Thursday night. We shared everything - did the 3 for $10 mini-appetizers (sweet and sour eggplant with peanuts, beets and seafood salad), and the fried potstickers with pork. The potstickers were presented upside down with the crispy side on top and it was OH SO GOOD. Seriously I eat a ton of potstickers/dumplings in my life and when I say it's good it's helluva good. I wish I knew how to make them. Are they perhaps handmade from scratch?!?Then came the creme de la creme - the famous Arroz Gordo, an enormous bowl of rice topped with all kinds of goodies. Let's break it down:Sausage - BPortguese chicken thighs - A+Roasted pork - B-Fatty prawns - B+Tea eggs - BClams - BI wouldn't get this bowl again - instead I would try the dozens of other dishes that sound mouthwateringly savory like the curries and the fat noodles. The bowl was good experience to ooh and ahh over for the first time but nothing too special IMO."
"We finally made our way here a few weeks ago, but unfortunately it was during their 1st year anniversary celebration weekend, so it was definitely more crowded than usual.  It was a 1.5 hour wait when we arrived at 6pm on that Friday night.  The hostess directed us to the waiting lounge 3 doors down from the restaurant.  We got there with another waiting party, but the door was locked.  Nobody answered when we knocked.  When the hostess came around to open the door, the room was FULL of people!  Maybe they didn't hear us knocking?The lounge is a cool concept, but unfortunately, not directly connected to the place.  It's a small space that quickly became standing room only.  We ordered a few drinks and tried the crab chips (so-so) and deep fried green banana rolls (okay) for appetizers.  The estimated wait time was pretty accurate.  We ordered the Portuguese country sausage to tide us over until the Fat Rice arrived (takes an additional 30 minutes to cook).  It's too bad you can't place that order in the lounge while you're already waiting.  So many layers of flavor, texture, and meats.  It was a Pandora's Box for my taste buds.  The pineapple upside-down cake was delicious.I really liked the restaurant decor, from the pigs and figurines on the shelves to the doors of the restrooms.  We sat next to the china hutch containing the serving ware.  It was as if we were in a big dining room at someone's house.  I liked how the servers all wore the black t-shirts with the Fat Rice name in big chubby yellow font letters.  The Fat Rice itself was worth the 30 min wait, but not sure about the 2 hours total we waited for it."
"Had a great dinner at fat rice.We were 4 people and with drinks it came out too about 60 a person, its more like tapas style or small plates meant to be shared.There are no portuguese resturants in Chicago but this place def helps ease the pain as its a great fusion place, my parents were loving it and dont forget to ask for the egg custards!!"
"I had high hopes for this place because it got such great reviews. It opens at 5:30, and I believe we got in line around 5:15. It was a bitter cold winter evening, so there weren't too many people in line. We were allowed into the restaurant at 5:30, so I guess 15 minutes of waiting in the cold isn't too bad...The restaurant is tiny. If you're one of the unlucky ones who are at the end of the line and end up having to wait for the first people to finish their meals in order to get your table, I'd say try somewhere else. OR make sure you come around 6:30, once most of the first diners are finishing up their meals or already starting to leave after their meal.Anyway, on to my review of the place. We sat at the bar, so it was really fun watching the mixologists do their thing. You can tell that they know what they're doing. Mental note, try a few of their drinks next time.It was just the two of us, but we weren't sure if we'd be able to come back again. We really wanted to try the Fat Rice (which should be enough to feed us), but also really wanted to try the Portuguese chicken. Good thing I'm pretty diligent about eating leftovers (I don't like wasting food or drinks), so we just ordered both so that we can at least try both. Variety, people! It's the best! And all that meat definitely needed some balancing out with a veggie dish, so we got the baby bok choy (delicious). I think the Fat Rice dish is a little pricey (I think it was something like $42) for what it is. And the Portuguese chicken is actually more like a curry dish, so make sure you order a side of rice with it (they charge you for the rice, btw). Out of all the dishes, the bok choy was my favorite.I'm sorry, I really wanted to give an awesome review with 5 stars, considering it was one of the top restaurants in the nation...but realistically, it's a 3 in my book."
"Really fun experience. Had to wait for about an hour, but we were escorted to the adjacent holding space. Pretty groovy - actually added to the experience. The food was above average. However, the portions are large and our server recommended too much for our party of four.  By the time the crown jewel of the meal came (Arroz Gordo Lit), we were too stuffed to enjoy it. Moderate your ordering and you'll be happy."
"Likes:  Hip hop playlistCommunal SeatingChill vibePotsticker presentationHousemade LinguizaThe red pork, I forget what its called.Dislikes:Rules.  The menu has a list of rules.  The server wouldn't let me order appetizers  because ""only one food order per table"" so I had to do nothing for 20 minutes until our food came.  Then the server told me I shouldn't order coconut rice.  I want coconut rice.  Bring me coconut rice!  And the excessively rich pork belly entree definitely needed it.Why is this 6/10 Paella knockoff $48.  I hate leaving such a critical review, but f* rules."
"Came here for brunch at noon on a Sunday with a reservation - restaurant was packed when we arrived, and we waited for about 10 minutes for our table. We ordered the potato croquettes, the Arroz Gordo, and the almond pudding dessert, as well as pots of different teas. Service was very attentive throughout the meal - we were never short on hot water refills for our teas! The croquettes were ok, nothing special. The minced meat inside was dry and not super flavorful. The fresh mint leaves on top were a bit random - not sure what role they served in the dish (mint is all over the menu, interestingly enough). The plum sauce was absolutely delicious, but probably in part because our blood sugar was low by that point. Then came the signature dish, the Arroz Gordo. There were a lot of ingredients in this thing so I'll categorize it accordingly. The good: the char siu pork, linguica, and the chilli prawns. The ok: the clams, the chicken thighs (bland), and the rice (golden raisins were a nice touch). Things I could have done better / without: the tea eggs (no flavor whatsoever), the chicken-fat fried croutons, the olives / pickles / peppers (the flavors seemed disjointed from the rest of the dish). Overall, good but not amazing.Finally, the almond pudding dessert, which came with fresh coconut strips, lychee, and basil seeds. It was light and refreshing, and the perfect ending to a protein-heavy meal. Enjoyable, but there wasn't a very strong almond flavor in the pudding. A pleasant experience in all. I would come back and try other things on the menu."
"We went last night and had a nice experience. Unfortunately, Fat Rice just didn't live up to the hype that we saw. It was good food, really cool atmosphere, and Matthew, our waiter was awesome.We ordered the pig ears which were interesting. Not fried and crunchy, but good. Really spicy. I read good things on these, but am not a HUGE pig ear fan in general.The pot stickers were delicious. Definitely the highlight of our meal.Then we ordered the Fat Rice, which is a mish mash of everything. All the food was really good, you just have to be prepared for a unique combination of spices. And ready to eat a lot!Overall, good, but not great."
"Yes, believe the hype. Really cute place. I'm glad we chose to sit at the bar. The service was excellent. The drinks and food were really unique and delicious. Didn't try the fat rice because I think it's a large dish and we figured we would be back with friends to share that. Great experience all around."
"The atmosphere is fine. The service is attentive, and the food is overpriced and over seasoned. They have outrageous prices to portions and the food served within those portions is fair to mediocre. Quite a waste of time and money. Considering it was just over $80.00 for the seafood paella type dish($50) and a puny sampling of mushrooms and tofu in the ""small plate""($4) I was extremely disappointed  in the emptiness both left in my stomach and wallet. Not good and overpriced. Meh......."
"Can I live here?!?!I just don't even know where to begin, I loved it so much! There were three of us and yes we had to wait and we knew we would, but much to our delight we were escorted to the secret den where you can have a cocktail before dinner. Don't expect to use the washroom in there though, there isn't one.We had the Fat Ricebalichang tamarindo malay vegetable curry sweet & sour eggplant    I cannot stop thinking about that balichang tamarindo. The pork belly was the best I've ever had. I'm saddened to think that I went here with two essentially vegetarian friends. Just think of the other delicious carnivorious creations I missed out on. Can't wait to go back!"
"It was such a let down after I heard about this place and I just had to go try it for myself. There wasn't much of a wait since it was a weeknight but I read some reviews that there were 2 hour waits and I would not venture to do that for this place AT ALL! There offered us seasoned peanuts as a free appetizer and that was tasty, but we ordered 4 dishes to share: 1. Bacalhau-a codfish spread was very briny but it was the only dish that was not too salty and it went well with the warm roll that it was served with.2. then we ordered a vegetable side dish that I can't recall the name, but had fried okra, fried green beans, peppers but unfortunately it was overly salty and the spice was good but lingered with the saltiness that it wrinkled by lips!3. the Arroz Gordo which is the ""Fat Rice"" signature dish is like paella with good portions of meat and seafood and I have a photo of it, but again, TOO SALTY! 4. the upside down pineapple cake was good, but I have had better. must say, I am not sure what the fuss is about actually...I am not even curious to come back and give it a try. I'm tempted to contact the business to give them input, however I read a review about a consumer with onion allergy and don't want to get a nasty email for constructive criticism."
"After going to Fat Rice a couple of times for dinner and feeling very meh afterwards, I have to say I now feel like Fat Rice is amazing in a million and ten ways! And it's all because of their brunch. Fat Rice just started serving brunch last weekend and right now they are serving from 11am-2pm on Friday & Saturday, then 11-3pm on Sundays. In talking to our server, they may extend the hours a bit in the future as word starts to spread. I cannot recommend their brunch highly enough - it's the best I've had in quite a long while. Seeing as it's just a couple of steps from my best friend's place, I see danger in my future. Danger in the sense that I'm going to be eating 2000 calories & dropping $30 every weekend at Fat Rice's brunch.Our server during brunch was a million times better than any we've had for dinner and the food was just delicious. It's kind of strange because they don't seem to go by Fat Rice for their brunch but rather Cha Gordo - so Fat Tea. It's a Macanese dim sum type of affair with so many items that sound amazing, it was hard not to get the entire menu and will require many more trips.My friend and I completely engorged ourselves on:+Kickin' Ninja House Tea $5 for a little pot, $9 for a big pot - Just like it says, it's their house blend. I was a fan but look forward to trying some of the more exotic flavors. All the staff was fabulous about constantly keeping our pot hot and adding additional water.+Cheese & Guava on Toast little plate $6 - I wanted more! Our waiter recommended this from the small plates when they were out of their fried egg tofu. This dish is fabulous with guava baked between texas sized toast & some really yummy cheese. The guava is hidden between the two toasted layers but when you bite in, an explosion of flavor hits you! This small plate comes divided in half and each half is just a couple of bites. Next time I go, I'm getting one of these for just myself so I don't have to share! I'm greedy!+Steamed Shu Mai $10 - bacon, cheese, burger & fancy sauce. This was the coolest sounding of the shu mai offerings...a Big Mac cheeseburger in a shu mai wrapping! I'm happy to report it tasted as cool it sounded. They came out piping hot and as soon as they cooled down a bit we devoured them in just a few minutes. Shockingly, the wrappings may have been the most delicious part of the dumplings.+Bone In Pork Chop Sandwich $9 - Way better pork chop than my mama ever made at home. My friend got this dish and was nice enough to let me try it. Seriously succulent swine.+Macanese Minchi $10 - Stir fried minced beef & pork, fried egg, bok choy, coconut rice & potato croutons. Huge portion for my main dish! It had a bit of kick to it thanks to the peppers mixed in with the meat but not in an overpowering way. I could not stop eating this even though I was full to the brim. I probably should have & could have taken about half of this home but it was hard to stop shoveling it down the hatch. The dish tastes best once you mix all the components together, kind of made me think of it as Macanese Bi Bim Bap with a ton more meat! Now at this point I was so full I felt like I might burst. Our server asked if we wanted something sweet to end things. No!!!! I exclaimed. But my friend insisted on them bringing us the menu to pick something out. I thought he was a complete nutbag, but had to try some of the Egg Custard Tart he ordered.+The Portuguese Egg Custard Tart $5 for 2 says it's filled with love & secrets and I believe it. As I said, I was going to try a bite of one tart due to being stuffed beyond belief. I tried it...tried it some more...and even more...I couldn't stop! It was hands down my favorite thing of the entire brunch. It's smooth & creamy custard within a flaky shell. Do not miss this tart duo! They have a million types of tea I still want to try (okay so I exaggerate a bit, 10 total on the menu), as well as many more delicious sounding items so I'll be back soon for their brunch.My advice - get to Cha Gordo while you can without a wait. Once word catches on that they now offer brunch (and a superb brunch at that), the wait is going to quickly jump to similar times that they have for dinner. My personal opinion, Fat Rice is 3 stars for dinner (though I will try them again soon for dinner because everywhere has an off night, right?) but for brunch....it's way beyond 5 star worthy!"
"What an odd place.Things that were very good:Blood sausage fried rice, lemongrass-ginger pickled carrotsThings that were good:Stir-fried asparagus with sichuan peppers, mussel/chicken-thigh curry with preserved lemonThings that were meh: Salad with spanish ham and cheese, olives, almondsI had a nice time, but I think I would rather go to Chengu Impressions and just get Sichuan food straight up."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this place. I came here on a Saturday evening with a fairly large group of 8 people. We ordered and shared the following items family style: pickles (lemongrass carrot, smoky tofu & mushroom, sichuan eggplant w/ spicy peanut), bacalhau (salty cod spread), papo seco (Portuguese bread & butter), and the arroz gordo, among a few other specials that day. Favorites were the salty cod spread and arroz gordo, which was enormous and fed the four people at my sub-table. The ambiance of this place is a bit homey-feeling, which I liked. Would definitely recommend this place for a unique dining experience!-L."
"Went here on a Saturday night right at 6. That was a good call because by 620 the place was packed with a wait. The staff were all super nice and were quick to describe the vegetarian options on the menu for me. We started with the choose 3 pickled items. We tried the carrots (the best thing I ate all night!), the cauliflower (good but not great), and the cabbage (too oily IMO). We then got the pumpkin soup which was ok but barely tasted like pumpkin. We moved onto the fat noodles with mushroom. The noodles were really good as was the peppers, but the rest if the dish was mediocre. I wish the sauce had more flavor. My husband had the sardine. He wasn't too impressed with that either. Finally we finished with the pumpkin curry. The coconut rice that came on the side was tasty, but the curry itself was nothing special.  I was a little bit torn between giving this 3 and 4 stars. I feel like 3 stars is a bad review, and this place doesn't necessarily deserve a bad review. But it's not on par for 4 stars in my opinion. Maybe I was a but let down due to all the hype? Maybe it was the communal tables with the dude next to me blowing his nose the entire time ruining the ambiance? I can't really put my finger on it. I wouldn't refuse to go back, but I wouldn't be the one doing the picking again if I did."
"Ironically, the T-shirt that one of the servers was wearing really sums up this place: ""DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.""No reservations, no parties over 6 people? Ok, I understand, it's a fairly small place. Service staff is friendly and helpful, but with the noise level, it is hard to understand. Also, you get the feeling that they really want to rush you through the meal. We had a few of our plates just taken away without them asking if we were finished with them, which we weren't. The explanations of the menu seemed a little excessive... For example, when they say that the crispy, startchy film around the potstickers is a ""crepe,"" I mean, come on... I make potstickers st home, it's a natural product of cooking potstickers, don't present it like some special twist was added. Also, I'm not sure what exactly was in them, but our tongues felt like they were electrocuted after eating the potstickers. A tingly sensation similar to what I've experienced with a certain Japanese spice, but way too much of it.We ordered the Arroz Gordo, the house specialty. It's ok, but for all the trouble they go through to explain the different ingredients, the flavor seemed to be very busy, yet one dimensional - strong. Again, this is just my personal opinion.  And maybe we should have ordered the othr menu items, but we felt that there really wasn't anything that was delicious.  We all agreed that we were eating just to finish the plates.So overall, the food wasn't bad, but with all the waiting and the rave reviews from others, much more was expected."
I found this place on yelp. This place was nice. I'll agree that it's a little small but the staff was very nice and accommodating. The lamb vindaloo was underportioned for the price but it was delicious and very tender. It melts in your mouth. The Piri Piri chicken was well portioned and also delicious. I appreciated that they cut the chicken into manageable pieces.
"This place is so delicious! We had the sambal clams, the potstickers, and the pineapple pork belly. The clams are very good, but you have to be up for super spicy food - they are incredibly flavorful and hot! The potstickers were wonderful - the interesting twist on the normal potsticker is that these came on a plate with a crispy rice flour pancake on top, very reminiscent of an Indian dosa if you've had one of those before. The pineapple pork belly was a real treat - sweet and sour, super fatty (in a good way); tasted great reheated the next day with the coconut rice. The place smells divine when you walk in the door too. One thing to note - it's noisy, so if you want a quiet meal, go at an off time when they aren't very busy."
"Food was okay. -Fat rice($42) is good but not great. Peri peri Chicken is ok. (I probably spelled it wrong) ""Pickle"" is good too. we had eggplant/ tofu/ papaya salad. (3 for $10) we also ordered two desserts (there are only three on the menu) Service is great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Price: it's 200 after tips for our group of five."
"My friends and I were at Fat Rice on Saturday night (2/7/15). My husband and I arrived as the door opened because we had heard about the long lines and wait times. And, we were happy to wait seeing as it was 5:30pm. Our 4 friends were in cabs and would be meeting us shortly. The hostess gave me a disgusted look when I said we were not all here and then let us know their seating policy, of which we were aware and were happy to have our name put on the list to wait. She sent us to the lounge, an entrance three doors down on the exterior of the building where we had cocktails and waited. The waitstaff was lovely. When the last two members of our party arrived, they let the hostess know that they were the last members of the party of 6 who were waiting. The hostess sourly responded ""Oh, are you with Katy or whatever?"" My friend responds ""She prefers to go by or whatever."" The food was delicious and our server was wonderful. I want to say I'll go back, but the hostess was so rude it marred our entire experience. We couldn't stop talking about her. Who wants to be made to feel unwelcome the moment they step into a restaurant?Recap: Food was delicious (dumplings, big noodles and veggie curry were amazing). Hostess was rude to the point that I was compelled to write a review about it."
"We really wanted to love this place but oh my, what a disappointment. The little dish of nuts was the only highlight. Their supposedly special dish ""Arroz Gordo"" was mediocre at best. The curry chicken did not taste like curry. The rice was overcooked, as well as the the shrimp and egg. The BBQ was rubbery. Just sad."
"Holy crap... I just logged into Yelp and noticed that I had a half written unpublished review about Fat Rice sitting in my account since February 2013!  Sorry, Fat Rice... This 5 star review was meant to go out ages ago!We'll at least now word is out and most people don't need to be convinced how amazing it is, so I'll keep the review short and sweet... I'm a huge fan and love their food!"
"Great food! I've been there for brunch and dinner and absolutely loved everything. The wait is pretty ridiculous, so I don't go often. The Portuguese egg tart and French toast are amazing on the brunch menu. The vegetable curry on the dinner menu is also really great. Solid cocktails too!We had a slightly negative experience with the chef coming out and pushing to order more food, but overall love the place!"
"Dinner in Logan Square 2 nights in a row...and totally worth it!My friend was visiting from out of town, so we decided to come here for an early dinner on Saturday.  We arrived at 5pm and there was already a line out the door.  We got in line around 5:15pm and moved right in at 5:30pm.  We opted to sit at the bar so we could catch up, rather than the communal tables.For drinks, I recommend the bourbon cocktail.  Being new to bourbon, it was perfect with a hint of vermouth and chocolate bitters.Our waiter, Matthew, was wonderful.  He gave great suggestions and was super enthusiastic about the food.  We ordered a ton!  We started with the eggplant and linguica.  I tend to hate eggplant, but this was delicious with a more Asian twist.  For the entrees, we shared the Piri Piri Chicken, Fat Noodle with XO Sauce and the Mackerel (special of the night).  Everything was amazing and the portions were huge -- we ended up with a lot of leftovers.  The Mackerel was my favorite!  I would've devoured the whole thing and licked the bowl of the sweet and spicy sauce if I wasn't so stuffed.  In fact, all the food had a great kick to it.We had to try one of the desserts, so we opted for the Pumpkin Dumplings (special of the night).  The doughy, pumpkin dumplings mixed with the sweet syrup was quite the party in my mouth.Overall, great night here in this little gem.  I'll be back!"
"We were two hungry people in search of deeply satisfying food on a cold January night; food that wouldn't just fill our bellies but a meal that would transport us back to our wonderful days in Macau last winter. Fat Rice delivered! We arrived around 6pm and the restaurant was already packed, but we were jumped over to the lounge and enjoyed a gin and tonic and a caipirinha. We were seated at the bar in the main restaurants by 6:20pm and promptly set about stuffing our faces. First came the beets, eggplant and potstickers. I tried to refrain from just picking up the dish of beets and tipping them ungraciously into my mouth. It was hard. The potstickers were perfect. Just the right amount of dough, a nice crispy bottom and bursting with meaty goodness. The dipping sauce was to amazing, too, with just the right blend of umami and vinegar. Eggplant was a nice balance of light veggie dish with flavorful sauce. Next came the piri piri chicken. The chicken was better than I remember from Macau! It was moist, sweet, tangy and with just the right amount of heat. We ate it all, including licking the sticky film from our fingers that developed from greedily pulling the meat from the bones.Last, but not least, was the delicious cream cheese dessert. We shouldn't have finished it. We were both too stuffed and tipsy from the delicious cocktails but, lo and behold, we couldn't restrain ourselves and the bowl was practically licked clean!Thank you Fat Rice! I can't wait to return."
"Brunch, I feel a little like I missed something. Many of the touted items are not on the brunch menu and also they were out of some of the more popular dumplings. That said, I did enjoy the ""carrot cake,"" though I like the Singapore version Chai tow kway better. Loved the house hot sauce and though the custard tart was good, I think it would have been better had it been more freshly made. Cool atmosphere, like to go back and try it for dinner."
"Had a great experience at Fat Rice.-Wait time: hadn't been here yet because of the crazy wait times. They have started a reservation system but we went at 6 PM on a Saturday and waited for about 40 min (for a party of 2). They have built a lounge next door where you can get drinks and wait, and they'll seamlessly bring over the drinks to you when your wait is over and add it to your overall bill.  Would recommend getting there early, they open at 530 for dinner.-Service: service was great, really attentive and had great suggestions-Food: For two we got the bacalhau - a salt cod spread topped with sliced chili peppers and green olives (LOVED), the fat noodle w/ egg and mushroom (probably could have done without this), and the arroz garrodo (their signature dish that everyone must try!).  We ended up having leftovers to take home.Fat Rice didn't disappoint for me and I would definitely come back!"
"I've had dinner and ""cha gordo"" (Macanese high tea or dimsum) here.  It's definitely one of a kind in Chicago (a ""must try"" if you will), but the food didn't blow me away.  It's colorful and all, but I'm sorry to say that I didn't love any single dish that I had.  The flavors are not your typical sweet or salty - rather spicy and tangy/bitter, and the mix of ingredients is definitely what makes this fusion restaurant unique.Also, it's worth mentioning that both times we made it inside, we only got seated right away because we waited outside the restaurant prior to opening.  There was a line of hungry patrons both times even after door opened.  And at least half of the restaurant is communal seating (I don't remember what the other side looks like).Thanks for introducing Portuguese / Macanese / Chinese food to me, Fat Rice!"
"Seated quickly, greeted nicely. Hard to tell if it was open from outside, which is not much of a problem.Inside, it was too loud and the lighting was not optimal. I'm not a fan of open-kitchen layouts, in general, or halogen spotlights on the ceiling that hit the center of your table. I like it quieter, with less crowd roar and less kitchen clatter. I'd prefer indirect lighting and some curtains on the windows to dampen the sound a bit. It is hard to work with standard Chicago narrow-lot buildings and tin ceilings, but something could be done better here.We had the vaca estufada de riquexo (22) slow cooked local beef - red wine - star anise - cauliflower - turnip - oyster mushroom and a fried rice that I can't remember the name of ... or find on the menu today. The vaca estufada was a delicious roast. The fried rice was fresh with crispy elements (corn?) but not particularly satisfying. Bottom line: too loud, decent food, some good tastes and values and some not so good. I want to try coming back with friends for the signature Arroz Gordo but if I walked in and it was just as loud, I might just turn around and walk out."
Fantastic tasty dishes...I would give it five stars but the desserts were all pretty bad imho...just eat alot and avoid the desserts
"We had a reservation at Fat Rice for brunch. If you're looking to try Fat Rice but want to avoid the long wait, I would highly recommend coming right around opening time, as there are plenty of seats. The brunch menu is a little different from the regular menu, but we still enjoyed many dishes. We had a number of small plates that we really enjoyed including the egg tofu (yum), boiled pork dumplings, and Portuguese egg tarts (Chinese ""dan tat""). On the egg tarts, I've only had one other variation that was as good as Fat Rice's, so bravo! As for the main dishes, we had the Macanese hash, pork chop bun, some sort of vegetable curry, and the arroz gordo, or the signature fat rice. We enjoyed the curry and the hash. I felt the pork chop bun could use some sort of pickle or something. It was a little plain. But the arroz gordo certainly lives up to the hype. The presentation is beautiful with every kind of protein you'd ever want to eat layered over crispy, paella-like rice. The huge prawns on top were fantastic. So juicy and delicious! However, I do not think the fat rice overshadowed some of the awesome smaller plates we shared. Overall, we really enjoyed brunch here and hope to be back again!"
"Went for brunch (Cha Gordo), which is their version of dim sum. Best. Egg. Tarts. EVER.The shrimp and pork dumplings were my least favorite dish. Not bad, per se, but not mind blowing.Macanese hash was delicious. The minced pork & beef were like crack.Was able to get an 11 a.m. reservation on a Saturday pretty easily. Great service."
"I have mixed feelings about Fat Rice and hip hop between 3 and 4 stars.Our meal consisted of the potstickers, portuguese chicken, and squid rice, a special for the night.  Interesting presentation on the potstickers: the order of 6 was served with a crunchy ""veil"" over it.  Visually unique, but I'd rather the love have been spent on filling the dumplings a little more.For me, the highlight was the portuguese chicken.  Wonderful flavor combinations, especially when paired with the coconut rice!  I thought the olives were out of place, but the mussels worked well with the poultry.  Note to you: if you opt for the squid rice in the future, note that it is spicy!  My mouth still tingles at the thought of it.Fat Rice has a cozy, dim ambiance.  Tables were a little too close together for my liking, as our neighbors' conversation kept carrying over into ours, and my personal bubble was slightly invaded.Worth a try!"
"On a Saturday night at 8:30, we were prepared to wait a long time. We put our name in and were told that it could be 15 minutes or an hour and a half. We assumed it would be the latter. We were told we could wait in the lounge ... walk outside and look for the door covered in newspaper. Um, ok. The lounge was actually pretty awesome. There was one other party inside. We ordered 2 snacks (crab chips and plantain spring rolls) and drinks, thinking we'd have to hold ourselves over for a while. But before our snacks arrived, we were told we had seats. Score!We sat at the bar, which we enjoyed for just the two of us. Unfortunately, the snacks ended up cutting into our appetites. We loved the chips, but would pass on the plantain rolls. For dinner, we had potstickers, bok choy and piri piri chicken. The pot stickers were the best I've ever had. The bok choy was really well seasoned. The chicken was tasty but not 5 stars tasty. It made for good sandwiches the next day. We had the pineapple cake for dessert, which was good but a little heavy after our meal. Service was good and total bill with tip was $113, although we didn't drink that much. Solid 4 stars."
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""Lounge"" only. This lounge is a joke! ... Over priced beers, decor is out of a thrift store and service slow! However I am looking fwd to dining at the restaurant and will share shortly."
"Finally made it to Fat Rice for brunch this Sunday.  Everything exceeded my expectations.  We sat at the counter, which is fun, I enjoy watching the kitchen and the service was incredibly attentive and helpful!What we ate (for 2 girls with large appetites!)- Boiled Pork Pot Stickers - I wasnt expecting much of this dish, until i uncovered the sauce laying in the bottom of the dish - holy amazing.- Macanese Hash - soooo delicious.  A great savory option to balance out the next dish.  I love a good hash and this version didnt dissapoint.  Only issue was the baby bok choy on top wouldnt really cut so it was difficult to eat with the rest of the dish.-Hong Kong Style French Toast- with Maple Bacon Topping - asked the server for which topping and glad we took her advise and did the maple bacon.  This dish is incredibly complex for french toast, and amazing balance of savory and sweet.  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!Cant wait to go back for dinner!"
"Jusst A-okay food from an asian girl's perspective. Overrated and too hyped (waited in line at 5:15pm and opens at 5:30pm). Great service and the specials were well explained. Very loud and noisy atmosphere. The tables were literally next to each other (you could say almost ""communal table"") and you can hear patron's whole conversation. Total dislike. Fat noodle $14: literally rice noodle roll with xo sauce (taste like store bought). The fat rice noodle was still hard and not steamed through. There's no flavors inside the roll. Fatrice, you gotta work on this dish.  Gals, i recommend going to any of the chinatown cafe (Chi, My Place, or Sweet Station) and you can order the rice noodle roll in xo sauce for less than $5 and taste more legit and soft/flavorful. Balichang Tamarindo (braised Pork Belly, pineapple, chicharrones) $16. The pork belly was tender, but too fatty. The bite-sized pork rind tasted stale, possibly the frying oil was old? Overall, it was okay, quite forgettable. Portugese Chicken with mussels $18: Most enjoyable dish of all, but it was just OK. The chicken was tasteful and tender with the curry sauce. Nothing special, doesnt have the WOW effect. Mussels were a decent size. Generous portion. I ate the curry sauce over the rice.Coconut rice $3 - there's garlic/scallions on top of rice bowl? Literally, it's really just jasmine rice3stars because it's well-marketed for average food - you literally lined up outside for a table and No reservations allowed.  Great customer service.Weird - the napkin was a blue old rag with holes in it.....bring yo own tissue"
"Like the Yelp description of a 3 star rating, this place is A-OK. Not bad, not great. Decor is quite cozy and very dim so if you have a hard time seeing in the dark, be warned. Bring a flashlight to read the menu.  What cozy also means is if it gets crowded, you'll have a hard time finding a place to stand while you wait for your table as immediately when you walk in, there's the host station. Tables start right near the door.On the advice of friends we went early The place opens at 5:30 and we got there at 6. We got the last available table and it was a Thursday! Apparently it's quite popular and the crowd ranged from hipster 20-somethings to families with kids. Quite a mix.Service was very friendly and our waitress definitely knew the menu and the cocktails. She was good about asking us what we liked and served up drinks that were mostly a hit (my wife didn't like her recommendation but they switched it out free of charge so bonus points for that) and potent so worth the price I guess.Food was where I was a little underwhelmed. We got the eggplant appetizer to start in a peanut sauce which was good. Then the dumpling which it's presentation is quite cool but it's pretty basic. Followed by the Bok Choy which seemed to be stir fried in quite a bit of oil and then the Fat Rice main dish which was basically an Asian fusion paella with rice, and various sea-foods and meats and was just OK.The thing I didn't really like about Fat Rice is that other than the eggplant, the food was very plain. We were always encouraged to squeeze lemon on this or pour soy sauce on that. How about making the dish with some flavor? Everything was so... bland...At least we finished strong as desert was spectacular. We had the pineapple upside down cake with plums. It came with a nice cream sauce drizzled table-side and the cake was like a spice cake with a nice flavor. This was far and away the best item of the night. Like they say life is short so eat desert first. That adage definitely applies to Fat Rice.With tax and tip we spent around $55 per person which when you think about it is pretty high given the food we got. My wife and I commented that for another $10 pp we could have gotten a way better meal at The Girl and the Goat.Glad I went I guess but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."
"Must admit we did not eat here. After going to two Thai restaurants that were randomly closed, we ended up here on a Tuesday because it was close. Total hipster joint. Loud music, dark lighting, studious servers, and worst of all, tables that are two inches from each other. I'm one of those dumb people that sits in my diaper no matter how shitty it is, and I knew I was going to hate awkwardly sitting in between two couples who could smell my breath. Thankfully my boyfriend immediately said, ""I don't like this,"" then looked at the inaccessible menu and asked, ""Where is the food?"" This was followed by a ""We're going!"" For me, this was like being rescued from a tower after years of imprisonment. Eureka. I don't have to eat at a restaurant if I don't want to be in it! Fat Rice might have good food, it's just totally not my style."
"Goodness.I must say reading reviews has become somewhat tedious.""We were greeted at the door with a friendly smile.""""I don't like chef's with hairy arms.""""My pot sticker left a funny taste in my mouth.""""Don't arrive at dinner rush hour or you will wait in a long line.""oh Yelpers  - I adore you.Let me sum up my experience: LOVELY! Perfect Double Date Summer Mid-week Evening! Will definitely go back!I  think (I can't be 100% sure) we ordered every cocktail and item on the menu. yupI do remember (100% sure) I loved EVERY item.Oh please do get dessert OMG - real dessert - unique and PERFECT!A casual spot with perfect staff, pleasant and effortless. LOVE THIS PLACE.Did I mention the prices here are super appropriate!ooh and  maybe that other yelper was right = the pot stickers did tickle my tongue with flavor - maybe that was the ""funny"" taste.I like Chefs with hairy arms - mmmhmmmDinner Rush - LMAOI always smile when entering an establishment and can't remember not receiving a smile back : )oooh I wish they were open for breakfast!"
"Fat Rice...what a gem! Went to a birthday dinner here and we sat in their new garden patio - it was the perfect casual setting with fun and colorful decorations and fresh peppers growing right next to you. The patio is rather small but so is the inside so careful on how big your group is (no parties over 6 is their policy). Drinks were fun but not overly complicated. A Basil Gin & Tonic hit the spot on a moderate summer night. Also loads of sangria, some craft beers, and even madeira frequented our table.  Ordering was hard because there are a lot of options and it is sharing plates so you risk ending up with too many trucks of food or not enough. Our server Lindsey helped us out and nailed it on the head as we didn't send a crumb back but all left pleasantly fat riced. My personal favorites were the sichuan eggplant, bacalhau, and two of the best chicken dishes you can imagine: piri piri chicken and portoguese chicken. The portoguese chicken had some sauce that I was pouring over everything else because it was that good. Of course you are going to want to try the fat noodle and the fat rice but the two chickens were my highlights.I am already itching to go back and get fat!"
"I really wanted to like this place. I live in the area and have heard all of the raving reviews since it opened, so I was very excited when we were finally able to secure a table on a weekend night. My wife and I opted for 5-6 smaller plates at the suggestion of the waiter, and I have to say, I was not impressed with any of them other than the octopus, which was outstanding. Bottom line, its a cool hip spot with great service, but the food was a total disappointment. I could give this a 3 star rating if the prices were more reasonable, but when you drop over $100 on dinner for two you should be absolutely blown away, which neither of us were...at that price, this is just a 2 star joint."
"We had a reservation for 4 at 7:30 and we were seated immediately. The place is intimate. Tables are close but I was surprised I didn't hear my neighbor. Our waitress explained the menu well and we all ordered a different drink. The Singapore was excellent. The food was delicious, especially the potstickers, cauliflower and fat noodles with egg and mushrooms. Next time we come, I'm not sharing!"
"Is it possible my Piri Piri chicken was even better as day-after leftovers? Like the spice fairy did some magic wand thing and poof, here Eileen, some leftovers you're not just going to pick at. You cannot look at this place as ""just Chinese"" ish and I pretty much disregard any review that has to do with wait time because let's get real people, you've got to be desenstized to waiting at hype restaurants in Chicago by now.I will say I know nothing about Macanese cuisine but if you like food that packs on heavy flavor profiles like Thai, Indian or Chinese, I think Fat Rice'll be right up your alley. If not, Fat Rice probably isn't for you. The staters are about the size of a small saucer, but the entree portions are huge! We actually wished we had another couple with us because it was so difficult to narrow down our selections. A big fan of the eggplant and the linguica though. And the different hot sauces (which they also sell). I'm a sucker for heat, so the ghost pepper sauce worked up that sweat-and-smiles-and-wincing sensation/abuse (however you see it), but it a good way. Would love to make room for the jamón de jabugo de bellota, fat noodles or po kok gai next time.If you'd drop your pants for a kick-ass Old Fashioned or Manhattan, the Singapore 1932 is your cocktail. If you like a little citrus and sweet but still want to stay in the caramel spirit category, the Braganza might do it. Black tea infused brandy, white port, grapefruit, and rosemary. Yum.5 star service from Jenn at the bar, by the way!"
"Went for brunch -an awesome idea, they have a lot of spicy and savory options capable of obliterating your hangover.  To drink I got their version of a michelada, it was refreshing and delicious with a nice bite.   My companion got the boozy bourbon tea which was sweet but very nicely balanced.We ordered sour chilli cabbage & jumpwater pickles to munch on while we waited for the fat rice, which were great for what they were and served to tie us over.The fat rice was a sight to behold, I wish I had taken a photo but I was too excited. Two fat prawns, clams, chicken thighs, some sweet (glazed?) pork chunks and another type of sausage, assorted pickles and a hard boiled egg on top of paella style rice in a cast iron pan. They gave us house-made soy and ghost pepper sauces and we were on a roll. Definitely recommend If you're in the mood to try something new!!"
"Amazing!! I love the ambiance. Then there is the food. We just had brunch and my taste buds have yet to stop doing a happy dance. We tried many dishes. Only one main, so many ""appetizers"". All complex flavored, fresh and aromatic. I had the Byron tea which was so refreshing. Then we finished off with this custard dessert! Oh heaven!! Culinary nirvana."
"I had read a lot of great reviews about Fat Rice and wanted to check it out for myself. Really cozy restaurant, with a capacity of maybe 40 inside with a full view of the kitchen over the bar. Fits right in to the Logan Square vibe. Our waitress was very friendly and explained the whole menu to us when we said we hadn't been there before. We opted for the fat noodles in x.o. Sauce, Portuguese chicken and THE Fat Rice. Fat noodles were really tasty and the chicken came in the most delicious sauce that we ended up using on most of the food. The Fat Rice was one of the craziest dishes I've seen, and tasted really good too! Especially the rice at the bottom. Would highly recommend all the food we ordered. If you're looking to try something new, something a little unconventional, this is the place. If you're not very adventurous or have a weak stomach, you might want to skip this one. And remember, light on the Diabo sauce."
"Macau-influenced food in Logan Square.Hip vibe.Great service.Delicious appetizers, entrees and drinks.There you go.[Keep reading if you want the long, rambly version that is about half accurate since I ate there over 24 hours ago]We went early on a Tuesday, figuring that if we go there early in the week 15 minutes after they opened they would have tables available. They did. 15 minutes ALL the tables were taken.It's not a big place, maybe seats 40? [I did not count the number of seats]. Maybe it's 50 if you count the 10 or so spots to eat at the counter. The background music was electronic with a beat, kind of like something you hear in the background during a TV show on Bravo. Place did get a bit loud as the night wore on, and granted I'm 47 so maybe I'm just getting too old and it was fine.I had the boozy Bourbon Tea. It was good. It was $10. My wife had a glass of Riesling. It was $12. That seems high to me.We had the pickled eggplant as an appetizer along with potstickers. Both were outstanding. I had even said to my wife before we ordered the potstickers that we shouldn't bother they'll be just like everyone elses. Nope, I was wrong. They were better. The eggplant dish was very enjoyable. Now let me point out that I'm half Japanese and eat a lot of Asian food, and I really appreciated all the flavors even when they were not super Western. By the way if you try their hot sauce, and you should, it's HOT. HOT. I had a big dollop and the server's eyes opened wide. 3 minutes later I understood why she she was agog. I didn't jump and dunk my head in the sink but I did down a glass of water in 2 seconds.Liked the boiled peanuts. I loved 'em. Wife, not so much. I know my mom would like them. It's that Asian thing.We got the porkbelly [something Tamarindo] and the Piri-Piri Chicken, along with a small bowl of coconut rice.This braised porkbelly was wonderful. I've personally made porkbelly and this was just really well done. I remarked to our server [I'm so lame I did not get her name arghh she was great] that it reminded me of a Filipino dish and she said the chef has that cuisine as an influence. The sauce had a sweet'n sour vibe, loved it. It came with a small rice cake on the side that I really liked too.The Chicken, cut up, grilled, very nice. Slight Tandoori-esque vibe, but the sauce was more Portuguese'y and had olives and small pickles in it. Onions too. I don't see how other reviewers could ever call this bland, cuz it is not. Curry flavors, tomato sauce, cumin, other spices... Nice.We wanted to get a fat rice but it's like a paella and really for 2 people you either get a fat rice or the stuff we got but not both.  Plus it's $48 dollars. We are both recovering overeaters and luckily I was about to call someone else in WeightWatchers who talked me out of ordering everything.I'd say if you like Asian food and a bit adventurous you will love it. The price point is a little high but I'd go again so that's saying something. If however you want to go because it sounds new and sexy, but you thinka Panda Express is a really good chain especially their restaurants in O'Hare, then this is not the place for you."
"I was thrilled to finally go here, and it was as I expected as far as atmosphere.  I loved the Piri Piri chicken and the squid  + rice.  We also had the picked vegetables and the bok choi.   The drinks were great too. Here is my recommendation if you're someone like me with very little patience waiting to eat dinner:Get there at 5:30 with your whole party.  If your party isn't complete you get shuffled to a waiting room down the street, however you can order snacks and drinks in there too and its a cute little spot.If you like to linger at your table after you pay, don't.  They will ask you to move back to the waiting room so the table can be freed up for other guests.  I honestly have no problem with this at all, because there is nothing that drives me more crazy then seeing people sitting a table forever after they have paid while there are hoards of people waiting to eat.  The service was fantastic, as was everything else.  And we managed to eat all gluten-free for one of our friends, and nothing was missed.  I highly recommend it!"
"Items Selected:House Pickles - Lotus Root and PeanutsBread and ButterBacalhau - Salt Cod, Olive, Chili, Mint, BreadWinter Melon Soup with Foie Gras, Jamon Iberico, Dried Scallop, Shitake, Enoki, Kumquat, Superior BrothFat Rice - Arroz Gordo with Jasmine Rice, Croutons, Sofrito, Chinese Sausage, Salted Duck, Portuguese Chicken Thigh, Char Siu Pork, Linguica, Fatty Prawn, Clam, Tea Egg, PicklesPineapple Upside Down Cake - Sweet Cream, Licorice Plum, Cinnamon Taro ChipSerradura - Cream Cheese Mousse, Guava, Tea Biscuit CrumblesGarnering considerable praise since opening its doors there was little doubt Abraham Conlon's Fat Rice would play into my Chicago dining itinerary and planning advance while easily recruiting a friend the plan was to arrive just as the restaurant opened in order to avoid a long wait, our reward a corner seat on the edge of the bar with a full view of the kitchen where Abe and his staff worked with smiles and silence turning out plate after plate to a restaurant filled mere moments after it opened.  Featuring stellar service and seasonal specials to accompany the more traditional Portuguese and Macanese menu staples it was admittedly with much deliberation that my friend and I weighed the options and with decisions eventually made it would not be long before the show began; a three savories and two sweets meal with enough food feed a small family and each plate a lesson in boldness and balance, tradition with creativity, but most of all the frequently misused/overused term ""umami.""  Sticking largely to the traditional Macanese items it was with creamy salted cod spread that the evening began and pairing the fish first with spice and brine but then scaling it back with mint this superb starter was only improved by the pillowy bread with light sweetness and a delicate crumb, a second roll proving equally amicable for sopping up the broth of the seasonal soup - a $34 masterpiece with nearly 6oz of foie gras scored and braised in an unctuous broth briny with pork and scallops yet intensely aromatic from the copious mushrooms.  Moving on it was an obvious choice from the start that the signature Arroz Gordo would find its way to our table and although approximately 1/3 of the bowl went home with my friend it should go without saying that this is a dish well worth the price of admission, the complex flavors and textures running the gamut of the palate and the tea eggs, salted duck, and char siu pork particularly funky while the paprika from the linguica and chilies from the chicken tickled the back of the throat.  Clearly not about to skip dessert after such a meal and unable to select just one despite being quite full it was on our server's recommendation that we eventually opted for the restaurant's two signatures and coming from entirely different places in terms of both taste and texture it should only be said that there is no 'right' answer as to which was better, the cake truly inspired in its construction and balance of sweet and savory tones but quite heavy while the more traditional serradura was a cloud with light sweetness up front and a mellow, tangy finish that lingered pleasantly at the end of such a heavy yet delightful meal."
"Well that was fucking wonderful. The skins on the boiled dumplings were, I shit you not, the texture of hand pulled noodles. That alone is reason why any review of 4 stars or less was clearly written by some sort of anti-yelp vigilantes taking mis-justice into their own hands. The tofu appetizer was brilliant with well thought out flavors and every item on the dish absolutely needing to be there. The egg custard, I mean, fuck man, those are just a thing if beauty. Flaky crust, sweet custardy egg, brûlée action on the top. God I need so many more of those in my life. Pro tip for NYC people- sneak some hot sauce on there and it channels pies and thighs salty sweet spicy amazing happiness and I don't want to be friends with you if you don't know that that is the best thing someone can say. Here is the problem though. It's not they they give a shit, it's they give sooooo many shits. No, actually, I'm pretty sure that they give ALL of the shits. Every single last one. A lot of shits is what I'm saying. So that means that the care in every dish we had was beautifully evident. This is obviously food made with love. Buuuuuut... Love takes time. We came during brunch, so it was relatively quiet and really gave them a chance to shine. I can only imagine the challenge of preparing food like this at high speed to keep up with the demands of a long line out the door. Looking at the negative reviews on here I have to assume that it is due to growing pains as they learn to keep up with the huge growth in demand (oh, and douches... Lotta douches writing bad reviews). So be smart. Come at brunch or a slow night if you can so that you can get the true experience. If you go on a busy Thursday night then hopefully the food you get is as excellent as what I had but... I dunno, no promises?"
"What do you get when Bruce Lee walks into a place with his Portuguese and Spanish friend and tells the chef what to cook... a whole lot of AMAZING is what you get!  This casual Logan Square gem serves up Macanese cuisine - a hybrid of Chinese and Portuguese food.  Definitely a combination I've never had and LOVED!  We had Curried Fish Balls (mackeral & pollack with cilantro), Green Banana Spring Rolls (plantains with sweet chili sauce), and the to-die for dish... Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice)!!!!  This dish was just... well let me just tell you what was in it.  It's very similar to a paella, but had so much more. There was curried chicken, char siu, linguica, prawns (huge), clams, croutons, raisins, spare ribs, two different kinds of olives, tea eggs and the rice was cooked to PERFECTION!  Definitely a signature dish that no one should pass up on, especially on a first visit."
"There was a server who had a shirt on that said ""Don't believe the hype."" This kind of sums up my experience at Fat Rice. Our dinner was good - not great. Dumplings - good. Left a weird coating in my mouth. Fat noodles with mushroom - delicious. Sweet an sour pork belly - WAY fattier meat than it needs to be and had a funky flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of. Servers Jen and Matthew at the bar were delightful. But, what really left a bad taste in my mouth was watching the arrogant chef trying to carve Iberian ham. He was swearing like a sailor (I'm not a prude but I was trying to enjoy my dinner). I also didn't enjoy watching his hairy arms all over the ham he was carving. Food sanitation, anyone? Glad I didn't order it. His arrogance also carried over into how he treated his staff - awful. I'm on the fence as to whether or not I'll go back. Leaning towards not...simply because of the chef's attitude I observed."
"I really liked their minchun from their lunch menu. They have a good tea selection, too! I want to go back and try their dinner menu."
"I grew up in Asia. The place reminded me so much of a Chinese BBQ joint we usually went when we were kids. It surprises and delights me to find this kind of flavor in Chi-town! We only tried fat rice. We were a party of 2 and we were full from this one dish. We didn't have room for dessert (we didn't order appertizer). The dish was packed with yummy components: clams, big shrimps, pork, sausages, and etc. My favorite was Chinese bbq pork & Chinese sausage. I'm not sure whether I love the place because it reminds me so much of my childhood or the food is truly amazing. Regardless, the fact that the place can mimic flavors & authenticity deserves 4 stars from me!"
"I had higher expectations for Fat Rice and the food just did not deliver for me. My foodie buddy and I arrived right around 5:30 so we did not have to wait too long for first seating, which was great. We ordered the potstickers, fat noodle, portuguese chicken and the sweet and sour pork belly. All sounded delicious but the actual taste of the dishes ranged from forgettable to just not good. I actually only had two bites of the sweet and sour pork belly - first one to try and second to confirm that it really was not tasty. I just don't get it. I just see it as overpriced mediocre food. Sorry, Fat Rice."
Came back again today.  The fat noodles were great have in the xo sauce.  The potsticker were ok you can pass on them.  But you need to have PortugeseChicken.  That dish can feed two people.They now take reservations.
"I absolutely loved their brunch! We had the curried fish balls, pork dumplings, pork chop sandwich and the Macanese hash and I'd order them again...twice. So good!!The fish balls had just the right about of curry, accompanied by some Serrano chiles and cilantro. The dumplings were steamed to perfection and served over a sweet/sour vinaigrette. The pork chop was from Slagel family farms, brined in house and served with the bone and a side of hot mustard. So tender and delicious. The Macanese hash was a mix of beef and pork wok seared with ginger, served with coconut rice, a fried egg, and fried potato bits. It was like a dim sum breakfast skillet and awesome. I haven't stopped in for dinner, but now I have to. Darnit."
"Put me in the ""I don't get it"" crowd. We were bubbly with anticipation after friends swooned about Fat Rice. Everything was OK, but not much different than neighborhood Chinese/thai which is 1/4 the price.  The vegetables were a salt bomb.  The chef agreed and took them off the bill and offered desert.  While I appreciate the gesture, I'd rather have good veggies and pay for such."
"Enjoyed the brunch food and ordered everything on the menu for our table of 4. Only one way to describe it ""fantastic comfort food""! Hope to try the dinner menu one day."
"It's full of hipsters. like literally full. the waiters, the customers, everyone. Food is good but pretty overpriced."
"Went for dinner two nights in a row and I must say, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I loved the unpretentious, laid back atmosphere and the communal tables. The servers are very knowledgeable about the dishes and the service is great. Now, on to the food. Both nights, we started with small plates. The eggplants are great and have a complex flavor because of the chili and the sesame oil. The pickled vegetables and the tofu are good dishes, but not amazing. The star of the small plates is definitely the pig ears. They were cut very thinly so they almost resembled terrine. The flavor was a perfect blend of sweetness and spiciness. This is definitely the best dish of both nights.We also tried the fat noodles with XO sauce and the potstickers. I didn't enjoy the fat noodles very much. I thought the noodles were too fat and didn't like the texture. The potstickers were very strong. The inside is moist with oil and the outside is crispy because of a thin bread or crispy rice they put on top (I forgot which). The black vinegar complemented the dish quite well. I don't expect to reorder the potstickers in the future though, because they were a little too familiar for me. I'm hoping to try more creative dishes.For the mains, we tried the piri-piri chicken, the pork belly balichong and of course, the fat rice. All were great. My favorite was surprisingly the balichong. The meat was very tender and the sauce was incredible. It contained hints of pineapple and tamarind, but was still very savory. The fat rice was very good. I really liked the different sausages and the clams. The shrimp was cooked well and I liked that they left the head so I can eat the brains. The rice was better than paella for me because of the shorter grain and because it's not too soft. The chicken in this dish, for me, is on par with the piri-piri chicken so if you are ordering the fat rice, you should think about the redundancy with the other chicken dishes. My only complaint is the I would have preferred that they remove the seeds from the olives because it made eating the dish a little difficult and somewhat dangerous. The piri-piri chicken was solid. The red meat portion was soft and the sauce is very smokey. The white meat, I found to be a tad dry (just like the chicken in the fat rice), but it's still an above-average chicken dish. For deserts, the almond jelly was a very refreshing palate cleanser and a good end to the meal. It's not a special desert, but it was very appropriate after such a heavy dinner. The other dish we had was rice crispies with pork floss and seaweeds on top. It gets points for creativity, but the flavor didn't work for me.Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. I tasted flavor profiles that I've never had before and appreciated the creativity and inventiveness of the dishes. I'll definitely try to go back to try the other dinner dishes, but for now I will have to go to their brunch."
I came here for dinner and definitely loved the food - VERY flavorful and it really was delicious. It took a while to get seated because it was so busy. The service was very friendly. My only complaint is the lack of vegetarian options on the menu. Will definitely be back!
Chinese food for hipsters. If my fat noodles with XO sauce had a handlebar mustache....
"My friends had been wanting to try this place for a while, but I have an onion allergy (which isn't the easiest thing to have when you're out for Asian/ Pan-Asian/ Asian Fusion).  I usually end up with some steamed veg and a side of plain rice if nothing else.  We sat down, ordered our drinks, and told them about my allergy.  The server went to the kitchen to see what could be done, and the chef/owner came out of the kitchen, condescended to me asking where in the city I eat, then raised his voice and told me he wouldn't serve me, and to please leave.  I tried to stutter out, ""just plain rice will do"", but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.  We left, but not before they made us pay for our drinks.  One star because the soda wasn't flat and the beer wasn't warm."
I did not like the food at this restaurant.  Its like the Emperor's New Clothes set in a store front kitchen.  Everybody raving about food that has very little taste. Seriously nothing at this place was worth sitting in their opium den for an hour.  I liked it about as much as I like Flat Lice.
"I came here on a Wednesday night with a friend at around 9pm...maybe a little after. There was a one hour and 30 minute wait at this time. We didn't mind because 1. we expected it. 2. they have an outdoor waiting area where you can get drinks and light appetizers and the evening weather was gorgeous.We ordered the pork rinds and our drinks were the Trade Route and Pimm's Cup. The drinks were good. Trade Route is stronger, which I preferred I like bourbon. The pork rinds were ok, nothing special, but the sweet chili sauce that you sprinkle on it made it pretty tasty. We were already a bit tipsy by the time our wait time was over, that we ordered too much food. (This must've been a part of their master plan).*coconut rice-Not much to say...it was cooked right, simple and great accompaniment to the twice cooked bacon and Portuguese chicken. I didn't taste much of the coconut, but I might've been drunk.*twice cooked bacon-the bacon is not prepared crisp in anyway, which is what I expected from the name. But it was delicious still. Veggies cooked perfectly. Sauce was tasty*Portuguese chicken-wow, this was delicious! The flavors, the flavors! Excellent dish Chicken nice and tender, mussels also tender, chorizo yummy. Highly recommend.*fat rice-what in the world?! ""Jasmine rice laced with sofrito, chinese sausage, salted duck and topped with portuguese chicken thighs, char sui pork, linguiça sausage, fatty prawns, clams, tea eggs, croutons, assorted pickles and sauces"" YES PLEASE!!! Despite the richness in ingredients, they all worked! All of them. Great flavor profiles! Highly recommend*macau rice crisp - This is not too sweet, which is what I wanted. A good cleanser of the palate. I may not be the best judge of this dessert b/c I had 4-5 cocktails by this time.The Portuguese chicken and fat rice were the winners. If you asked, ""Which do you like better?""...their flavors and combos were different. Although you have the seafood and meat combo in both, they had different flavor profiles. I'd say that the Portuguese chicken will have more pop in your mouth. The fat rice will more melt you into culinary bliss. Hope that helps!"
"Everything was excellent. Service, drinks,food and value. It was busy, but we got seated immediately. Bourbon cocktail was awesome. Boiled peanuts to munch on while we waited. Each dish was better than the next--spicy eggplant, portuguese chicken, fat noodle with XO sauce and shrimp with okra in a curry sauce. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."
"one of the best meals i have had in a very long time. located in logan square, so nice neighborhood, relaxed vibe, lots of flannels and beanies. more like communal seating, with open views of kitchen. we had a reservation, but still waited a little. went to the lounge which is someone's room where you can sit while you wait. think you can order drinks too, but the server there was pretty busy once we sat down, everything was phenomenal. had a bottle of red, delicious. bacalhau was a great start, is a salt cod spread that reminded me of anchovies, with a cute little loaf. heard the fat noodles were fantastic, wish i had gotten them. the potstickers were amazing - the black vinegar and hot sauce were to die for. prob my favorite thing on the menu, with this amazing crispy pan fried bottomone of the specials, sweet and sour pork was mouth watering. one of the best things on the menupiri piri chicken had this amazing red sauce, portuguese chicken was so tender with this amazing yellow curry. have to order the coconut rice with these. the fat rice was amazing tooended with the macau rice crisp, which is like a rice krispie with a little bit of savory. almost exactly like the one from elizabeth, which makes me wonder which one came first.overall every single dish blew my mind - can't wait to come back"
"They describe the menu as Euro Asian The food is bold and flavorful with the perfect mix of old and new. Expect a wait this hot spot and I would request a seat at the counter with a great view of the open kitchen. The service was fantastic and very knowledgeable of the menu.I had the chicharones snack, the granmother recipe bacalhau spread, the fat noodle with XO saud (not sure what this sauce is but dam it is good!) and the piri-piri chicken.I can't wait to go back and try their signature dish Arroz gordo (Fat Rcie), they make this dish for 2 or 4 people to share.Recommended Dishes:"
"Hands down, Fat Rice to me is one of the best new restaurants in Chicago during the past 5-6 years. Don't get me wrong, I like pork belly and bacon as much as the next person, but it's starting to get a little overdone - and then came Fat Rice, with it's unique blend of flavors and textures consistent with it's Macau influence. The piri piri chicken was a highlight, but there were no losers in what we've tried over two visits to Fat Rice. The dishes are truly designed to be shared - family style. It doesn't look like a lot of food, but I've been stuffed at the end of the meals! The wine / drink list parallels the food options in it's unique approach. The wine is not easy to pair with the food, but they have done an excellent job. The service is attentive, friendly, and helpful. They do not take reservations, and it goes against my rule of thumb to avoid standing in line for any restaurant. I've made an exception to my own rule (twice), however, for Fat Rice. Definitely be prepared for a long wait if you show up at the height of the dinner rush. They do have a spot down the block to wait inside with drinks, though. The service does not rush you, but don't expect a leisurely 4 hour meal either."
"The food is amazing, Beautiful decor and great service = Happy DesignerI had what the server suggested and wow a Delish!I will be back for sure"
I am a Chinese and I just love this place! Those small plates are extremely awesome :)
"I had been wanting to try Fat Rice for longer than I care to admit but after a former co-worker proclaimed that he had just had the best meal of his life here, I knew what I had to do. Fast-forward 3 days and there I am, having a delicious, delicious meal with my guy. We started with the sichuan eggplant with the spicy peanuts - a small dish of Japanese eggplant (at least I think it was Japanese eggplant, which I find sweeter and more tender than the chubby ones you normally see) swimming in a flavorful, slightly spicy sauce. The eggplant was soft and sopped up the yummy sauce, and the peanuts added a great crunch texture. So, so good - we could've eaten at least two more plates of this.Next, we had the bacalhau - also incredibly flavorful, savory, and satisfying. The bread it came with was so crusty, pillowy, and yeasty. Could've also had boatloads more of this. We then split the fat noodles in X.O. sauce and a fish special they had for the night. I don't remember much about the fish special - which kind of says it all - but the noodles were perfectly soft, a little gummy, and covered in a wonderful sauce. I would definitely get that dish again. We rounded out the meal (or feast, rather) with the macau rice crisp, which wasn't really my favorite. I couldn't quite get over the pork and seaweed flavors in this instance, but it wasn't terrible and I'm glad we tried it! Anyway, where else in the world can you try a dish like that? And side note: their cocktails are spot on!"
"Limited drink menu. Waiters were not very knowledgable or helpful. Even unsure about some of the ingredients. The fat rice...down south we call that jambalaya. Rice crispys for dessert were wonderful. Great restaurant, yes. Top 10, no. Worth a weekday night low key dinner."
"I really, really wanted to like Fat Rice more than I did.  I mean- my personal life is basically Latin-Asian fusion, so I guess I enjoy experiencing other people's take on it.  At Fat Rice, the food is delicious, but there are two things that bug me: the amount of food for the money spent, and the godforsaken WAIT.  There was a wait to get into the restaurant, and it hadn't even opened yet!Is it strange to say that I enjoyed their homemade pickles more than anything else on the menu?  I did.  Seeing nothing remotely 'appetizer' like except for those, Elsworth and I ordered three of the five different kinds of pickles:  Eggplant, Sichuan-style, carrot & lemongrass.  At $10 for three decent-sized bowls, I thought it was a pretty good deal.  My favorite were the carrot and lemongrass pickles- the flavor was so bright and tangy, with a ginger punch and slow heat!  The Sichuan style turnip-based ones were the crunchiest and probably the most fun for me to eat; I tried the eggplant, but can never really enjoy the texture of cooked eggplant.A medium-sized dish was recommended to us by our server, so I went with it.  Fat Noodles!  They are hand rolled chee cheong fun with mushroom & egg-can't really say that this dish is unique, unfortunately. I get the feeling that I can get better noodles in Chinatown for less than $14.  On the bright side, the eggs were nice and light.The large dish was a tamarind-based sauce with pork belly, pineapple, and cherry tomatoes served with toasted coconut rice and topped with chicharrón.  I have to admit that the only reason I wanted this dish was because it was supposed to be topped with it. The chicharrón was such a disappointment- absolutely no flavor.  None at all.  Not even salty, because I was hoping to even out the sweetness of tamarind and pineapple.  *sadface*All in all... I'm not really sure it's all it's hyped up to be.  It's certainly tasty and I love the Asian-Portuguese mashup, but I think Chinatown is better.  However, if the service in Chinatown doesn't suit you, Fat Rice definitely shines through.  Our ser"
"I would give Fat Rice 3 1/2 stars, which is on point because that's where they are sitting right now.It's good food. I wouldn't say it's worth all the hype and long wait times, but a lot of that is due to how small the place is. It's a solid all around. The only thing I was disappointed in was the rum punch we ordered. For the price, I wish I had ordered something more straight up. But I might as well been drinking fruit punch.The food was all tasty. We got 2 apps and 2 entrees rather than the Fat Rice. Maybe next time. Overall, I was expecting the food to be more eclectic and fusion-y. But it was more traditional elements of Chinese and Portugese (which I would compare to Spanish food) with a nice twist. Nothing life-changing, but I would go back."
"I can't believe I haven't review this place sooner! Everything I've ever had here was amazing and well made. They are all so well-seasoned and tasty. My favorite is the Egg Tarts, which you have to get early on before they sell out. Also check out their cocktails!"
"We went early on a Tuesday to avoid waiting (HULK DOES NOT LIKE TO WAIT!). Seated our party of five fairly quickly. We did get the Fat Rice which was very good - not for vegetarians. Also ordered pickles, potstickers (worth it for the presentation) and beef and mint meatballs. A big surprise was the delicious desserts. Pineapple upside down cake and serradura were terrific together. All in all, not terribly expensive and an interesting evening out. Best advice -- eat early!"
"It definitely was tasty. I'd go back if someone asked me to, but I'm not going to feel like I'm missing out if it doesn't happen again either. There's some subtle complexities to every dish that makes them stand out from other Asian creations, but I'm happy with more traditional ingredients at traditional prices as well. I mean no disrespect to Chef Conlon and his concept. I saw him on a panel at the Chicago Gourmet and was impressed. He made a point to say something along the lines of there being a challenge to using a specially crafted soy sauce versus regular sauce. Personally, if there's so much going on in each dish it makes it harder to realize the sauce is being showcased. I take it back... I would like to go back and tour the offerings. What makes those $12 potstickers so different?"
"3.5Came here twice, once for dinner, once for brunch. Sadly the tshirt they sell that proclaims ""don't believe the hype"" is accurate. The dishes were hit or miss, memorable favorites were Portuguese chicken (bomb croutons) and the Portuguese tarts. Worth trying, definitely not worth the wait."
"Service was awesome. We had the tofu and dumplings as appetizers..they were extremely flavorful but the real star was the signature entree- fat rice. Simply amazing, delectable favors, tender meats - chicken, pork, sausage, prawns!! Finished off with tasty egg tarts. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had!!"
"The food: 2/5. I didn't think it was anything special, but rather a combination of random ingredients whether or not they went well together. Portuguese chicken was pretty good, but everything else we had was very underwhelming. Also, I didn't like Portuguese sausage almost in every dish. Drinks were overprices and not great.The service: 3/5. Our wait was about an hour. I find it awkward to go outside to a different entrance for the waiting area. Once we had our food, the waitress never checked on us to see if we liked the food or wanted more drinks.Overall: hipster foodies unite. Can get much better food and ambiance elsewhere. 2/5"
Sorry yelpers!  I was disappointed with the overpriced food.
"Fat Rice couldn't be a more wonderful lace if it tried! From the moment we got there w/the great posters upon entering to our wait in the secret other room, everything was fun.  The service while waiting was outstanding, so much so we never minded waiting! They served you drinks & appetizers while you wait, but the best is when you actually get your dinner.  Such great food combinations! Again great service.  Yes, we will return!!!"
"It is with great pleasure that I inform you, dear readers, that Fat Rice lives up to the hype.  The food is outstanding, the cocktails delicious, the ambience cozy and the service friendly.The four of us arrived just after 5:30 on Saturday, and we were seated immediately, but to the last open table in the house.  And on a very snowy slushy evening, no less!  I don't always eat dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday night, but when I do, its to avoid waiting at Fat Rice.  If its OK with The Most Interesting Man In The World, its OK with me.For cocktails, I had a Singapore 1932, Fat Rice's Asian take on a Manhattan.  It is wonderfully balanced and complex, with a nice interplay between the sweetness of the bourbon and the other ingredients.  I liked it so much I had another one after dinner.  My noble bourbon boozers will love it.For food, we had the pork & shrimp potstickers, a dumplings appetizer & rabbit soup, both from the specials menu, the piri piri chicken, and, of course, the arroz gordo.  Everything was good to fantastic.  The potstickers and dumplings were perfectly chewy on the outside and the insides were fresh and light.  The homemade dipping sauces were fresh full of spice.  The rabbit soup, flavored with sriracha if I recall correctly, was overly spiced but still flavorful.  But the star of the show was the arroz gordo, and it was a revelation.For starters, the prawns were milky and juicy and fresh, perfectly cooked and probably the best of some superb prawns I've been eating in Chicago lately, including Dusek's, Longman, and Telegraph.  The linguica, pork, duck, and sausage were all impossibly savory and flavorful - each bite a delicious exploration of flavor - and all of that flavor is soaked up into the rice, which is pleasantly chewy without being at all tough.We downed all of this with the Spanish Ribeira, which was a pleasant medium bodied red with some old world earth from the 80 year old vines.  By the time we were finished with our entrees we were all full, but not stuffed.The service was very friendly across the board and the feel of the space is cozy and whimsical.  I would not want to wait around in the room if I did not have a table, but when you are seated it is quite cozy.  There is an outdoor space for waiting in the warmer months, and other reviewers say a nearby indoor space exists for waiting during our long dark winters.  I cannot comment on that, so inquire within.  I'll definitely be back."
The food and service are good. Prices at dinner are too high. You can find better potstickers at a dozen spots in Chinatown. The Fat Rice dish is interesting/nice variety but not remarkable. I don't understand the hype.
"We came, we saw, we ate, it conquered.We showed up at 5:45 on a beautiful Saturday with a line that extended beyond the cutoff for the 6'oclock initial seating. I'm glad we just barely made it in. I came here hungry with two other people who love to eat, and we took home leftovers. Whether or not that's because we overordered, I'll leave up for debate, but it definitely wasn't for lack of trying.We started with some of the pickled cabbage ($4), which is a smaller size than their small dishes. I think I might have skipped this in retrospect, but it was good.Then we had the linguica ($8), a fragrant Portuguese/Brazilian sausage that must have been 60% fat, in a great way. Sometimes, meat dishes like this come with a ton of  accoutrements that make you sometimes wonder ""okay, why is this here? you don't need to bling out my meat"". But the cilantro, cabbage, ginger and olives were perfect complements that lightened up and rounded out the sausage.We're in asparagus season right now, and that Sichuan asparagus dish they've got on the menu currently is a wonderful way to celebrate this time of year. When they plunked down the piri piri chicken ($21) dish after, I thought it was the Fat Rice at first. To my amazement this wasn't even their main specialty, but it tastes like it should be one. The heat in this dish builds subtly but potently. Before you've had more than 2 pieces you realize your mouth is on fire. But you don't even care to stop because it's that good. As for Fat Rice ($42), oh, how it's aptly named - the signature dish is a smorgasbord of rich, fatty meats from linguica to salted duck, hiding an amazingly flavorful and well-seasoned rice that evokes the idea of ""asian paella"" done right. I flipped out over the prawns in this dish. We finished off with the pineapple upside down cake, which was great with subtle caramel notes. I could only manage a few bites of that by then. As for drinks, I LOVED the salty hound, which had vodka, grapefruit and a salted plum. Why I haven't thought to put salted dried plums in drinks before, I have no idea. But you can bet I'm going to for now on.Basically, Fat Rice has killer food, desserts and drinks, which explains the killer line / price tag. Bring something to do or entertaining people along for the wait. It's worth it."
"Food was just okay, but a little expensive for what it was.  I can make a better Po Kok Gai, and my mom makes a much better pot of fat rice.  Overall, it wasn't worth the 1 hr and 20 min wait.  You can definitely find better food in Chinatown for a fraction of the price, but I guess you don't know until you try it."
This cozy little spot is a jewel. We went on a Thursday at 9p and sat right down at the bar. We enjoyed...Jellyfish salad Grilled Spanish octopus Pot sticker -  pork and shrimp Sichuan asparagus Macau shrimp & okra...and every single dish was a '10'. I am definitely planning to visit again and I recommend you check it OUT!
"I am from Macao, so I came in with a high expectation the wait was really long the Food it wasn't authentic. Tastes pretty good but a bit heavy food me. I don't like the community table type setting myself."
"Cozy Friday brunch and great, friendly service!  Some of the delicious items that my friend and I shared:  fried egg tofu, chinese almond pudding, portuguese egg tart, steamed 10kt dumpling (shrimp dumpling), and the vegetable lacassa.  All were super tasty with unique flavor combinations.  For example the fried egg tofu was similar to any other egg and tofu dishes that I've had but it was made with maple syrup. Sounds questionable but it was done with a great balance so that it wasn't purely sweet; instead it was a subtle combination of sweet and savory and it totally worked.  The egg tart was similar to something I've had before, really tasty.  The vegetable lacassa was really hearty...bok choy, okra, noodles, tofu, cilantro, eggs in a nice stew broth.  We finished everything off with the chinese almond pudding which was delicious and a mix of longan, pears, and a kind of jelly.  Super tasty!  The one down side is that this place is not cheap.  without tip it came to nearly $50 for two which is a bit steep for brunch.  Though we did order a lot of dishes and 2 drinks (drinks are not cheaper).  The staff was really great and accommodating to my friend's baby who was in a high chair so it was nice to have special attention.  However it was also not that crowded on a Friday afternoon so that was helpful, I'm not sure how it would be packed.  With the steep prices, I'm not sure if I'll be rushing to be back here anytime soon, but I'm glad I got to come here and cross it off the bucket list after seeing Fat Rice featured in Daily Candy!"
Da Bomb!!! Will be back very soon. Fantastic!!! Lindsay is awesome and let her order for you! Can't go wrong with Lindsay or Fat Rice!!
"We had some friends in town that really wanted to try this place, so we decided to wait what we were told would be under 2 hours and ended up being over 2.5. The food was decent but definitely not worth the wait. We tried a variety of items and nothing really wowed us. I'd only return if there was no wait."
"This place is adorable and it is delicious! I first went for dinner last year but then went back the first weekend they started doing brunch.If you go with more than 2 people, you get to sit at a table but I enjoy the bar because you can watch the bartend making mind blowing drinks and also see the kitchen prepping your food.The wait is real so come before you're hungry and be prepared to be turned away if it's a weekend and it's pretty late. They have a little storefront next door where you can wait and there's a bar and some limited seating but it's a little cramped.I recommend the brunch but get there early and wait in line before they open (trust me)The food is good, I won't recommend anything in particular because I can't remember... just know that everything is tasty.The drink that I really enjoyed at brunch was something that sounded good and iffy but turned out to be THE BESTEST! It had a little coffee and bourbon I believe in it. There are drop bottles involved and it's a delight to watch being prepared almost as much as it is to drink it. The drink is called Breakfast of Champions! I was hesitant but it's really much lighter than it sounds.The food is like something you could get elsewhere (like Chinatown) but with really fresh ingredients!Anything brothy served in a clay pot does NOT disappoint and save room for egg tarts! YUM! Best!"
"Total mehGlad I went but I never have to go back.Read other reviews complaining about the waiting policy here but I actually liked it.  We got there around 830 and they sent us to a small room around the corner and told us it would be 45 minutes.  We had drinks and 30 minutes later we were seated.  Seemed reasonable enough to me.The food was decent I guess.  When we ordered the waitress told us we placed the ""CLASSIC"" order.  Which in lay mans terms I believe means ""BORING"".  The Fat Roll which is a rolled up egg noodle covered with sauce was decent but afterward I thought ""Hmm, that was just a rolled up noodle with an average sauce"".  Interesting but REALLY what did I just eat? The pot stickers were OK.  The Portuguese chicken thing was at best 3 stars as well. The ""finger foods"" were all completely average and TINY, like barely enough for 2 people to share.  (We had mushrooms, crab chips and the pickles)How this place is getting 5 star ratings, I do not know.I will not be going back.  There are just too many awesome places in Chicago for me to waste another night there."
underwhelming.  they were trying really hard to act like they aren't pretentious which actually made them seem more pretentious
"We arrived at Friday at 7:45pm stupidly  not realizing just how small this place was and was in for a 50 minute wait. We never wait. This time, I wanted to wait because I was very excited to try this place, have been since it opened.BTW, I overheard something about a waiting room somewhere else, apparently, but unfortunately for us, this was after our 50 minute walk to look for coffee on a humid day. Yay.I think our experience was a bit ruined by some poor dish choices.The communal seating here is awful. I don't think communal is always this bad, but it's VERY squished and the place is super loud. I couldn't hear our waitress standing across the table. We were shouting the entire dinner and barely able to hear. It felt chaotic.If I come again, I want to try the portugese chicken and some more pickles. The octopus small plate had the most tender octopus and a great flavor combo. The sichuan eggplant pickle also gave the meal a great start, though I wouldn't call it very Sichuan...I wouldn't get these again, and I'm a little bummed that there are all these misses on their menu :/-Potstickers: bland bland boring filling. Don't live up to home made at all. but the crispy batter thing is cool-Fat noodles: sounds awesome, but the xo sauce version tastes like something we could get from Joy Yees, except the noodles had a better soft chewy texture. Not worth their price though. -pork shank and clam (? I think?): The stew part tastes just like something I make at home with zero effort. Disappointing...The service was very prompt. We didn't see much of our waitress, but our food runners described the food, answered questions patiently and were all very friendly. And our water was constantly filled even though we got the bottle to ourselves... I want to come back here again, for sure. Portugese chicken..."
"We waited two and a half hours for our table (party of 4), considerably longer than the hour and a half time they told us.  We were all excited about the pot stickers and put in an order right when we sat down...and then were informed they're out of them and several other menu items.  Heartbreaking.  All the other dishes we ordered were tasty and unique, no complaints there. Waitstaff was just ok - not overly friendly or helpful, especially considering how long we waited and that there were only two other tables eating.They explained they could only take three credit cards when we were closing out at midnight.  And then found out they can't charge more than the total bill amount on the cards (we wanted to include tax and tip amounts), which made the process of paying the bill more complicated than it should have been. Overall the food was delicious but the service and experience were sub par.  I understand it's a popular restaurant and they don't need to bend over backwards to please each patron but they should have done more for us.  We waited for two and a half hours and weren't able to order everything we wanted, perhaps a round of drinks on the house was in order?  They need to up their service game once the hype dies down if they want repeat customers."
"Totally worth trying for the unique food, but ask lots of questions and be on time!We came to fat rice on a bitter cold day at exactly 5:27pm.  We were able to sit at the bar in the first seating and were the first people to leave at 7:20pm.  Eating at 5:30pm isn't my favorite, but I also have no patience to wait hours for a meal.  My only other complaint is the menu didn't have the best descriptions, which I like when eating something as uncommon as Macanese.  What we ordered:smoky tofu & mushroom - best app we had, had a great smoked flavor sweet & sour eggplant - good sauce and peanuts, didnt care much for the eggplantmixed sichuan pickle - I think this is what we ordered, but the menu descriptions are so vague it is hard to tell.  It had a mushroom I had never had before called a cloud mushroom, super cool, was almost like tripe.fat noodle with XO sauce - great sauce, but wish the noodles were a little more rolled out in order to have soaked it up squid fried rice (it was a special) - amazing fried rice with puffed rice and peanuts added on top give it a crunch.piri piri chicken - favorite dish, great smoked chicken with nice sides.  Huge portion!"
"My friend and I wanted to try Fat Rice because we went to Portugal last fall and when we heard this place had Piri Piri Chicken on the menu (something we had in portugal that was beyond amazing) we knew we had to try it. After reading reviews and seeing pictures on yelp, we decided to arrive right as the restaurant opened at 6 since there is usually a line that forms outside. We got there a few minutes before 6 and were the third group in line! We ordered a great bottle of cava that was reasonably priced.  On to the food! We ordered a few items from each section. The jamon iberico went really well with the pear that came with it but if I had to replace something it would be this. We also had the pork and shrimp pot stickers (delicious, can never go wrong with a dumpling) and the octopus - I have been turned off to octopus because I got sick from it once but after a successful attempt at ordering it a few weeks ago at siena tavern I decided to give it another whirl. It was the BEST and most tender octopus I have EVER had - you must order this! Moving on to the medium section. We ordered the fat noodle with mushroom and egg - I loved this but I love wide rice noodles. We also got the salada which came with a refreshing mango vinaigrette and parrano cheese which has become my new have cheese - so good! We then of course got the Piri Piri Chicken which was very moist but not as spicy as we had in portugal. We ended our meal with pineapple upside down cake, which tasted like banana bread topped with pineapple and drizzled with cream. Let me preface by saying I don't have much of a sweet tooth and never have more than a spoon or two of dessert but this was absolutely amazing! Not too sweet and so moist! Loved my experience at Fat Rice. Cant wait to go back. Oh and do yourself a favor and drive or get a ride or call ahead for a cab while you are waiting for your check, we learned the hard way!"
"Walk-ins strongly encouraged? Not quite. They gave us an hour and 15 minute wait. We went and got drinks elsewhere before coming back and waiting yet another hour. The restaurant is crammed, but not in a cozy way. The waiting area is even more crammed.The waitress/servers were nice and helpful, but the food itself was just ok. We got the fish curry which had an awesome taste except the fish itself was overcooked. The cauliflower was nothing I couldn't make at home. The Piri Piri chicken was good. Overall, poor atmosphere (albeit good music) and the food is too expensive for the quality."
"If you decide to dine at Fat Rice, go very early in the evening or later at night.  We arrived at 8pm and only waited 30 minutes for our table.  You get to wait in a separate waiting area that serves drinks and apps so the time passes quickly.  1.  Try the 3 for $10 pickles.  Great way to start off your meal.  The Smoky Tofu & Mushroom and Sweet & Sour Eggplant are great choices to start.2.  We ordered the Fat Noodle with Mushroom & Egg Sauce, Balichang Tamarindo, and Coconut Rice.  The Fat Noodles were an ""okay"" dish.  You can find this dish and flavor profile at almost any Chinese/Fusion restaurant.  MUST EAT: Balichang Tamarindo.  A bowl of marinated Pork Belly with sweet pineapples, crispy pork chips, in a creamy dark sauce.  Mix with a bowl of Coconut Rice and you will not be disappointed!  We finished our meal with the pineapple upside down cake.  Fantastic finish to the meal.  The sweet milk that is poured on top of the cake is delicious!Fat Rice will be a relatively expensive meal.  $50-$70 (per couple) without drinks and $80-$100 (per couple) with drinks as they range from $9-$12 for mixed drinks and $4-$8 for beer."
"Went for brunch and had a fun meal with delicious food. To us the Fat Rice entree was kind of like paella but better with more and different flavors. We were worried that we might have ordered too much food but it ended up being perfect - though I have to admit that we were starving.  For 4 people - boiled pork dumpling, Fat Rice, Pork chop bun (probably our least favorite, though still good), Macanese hash.  we also ordered the egg tart for dessert. I don't usually like eggy desserts but I found myself wishing it were bigger because it was so-o-o delicious! Actually it is just the right size because I am sure it must be 1000 calories all on its own with its rich buttery taste. We really enjoyed the different flavor profile as compared to other Asian fusion cuisine."
"We got the fat rice dish.........INCREDIBLE.  Love the atmosphere.I'm taking off a star because the wait was insanely long (an hour and a half for 3 people).  I think the waiting room is a good idea in theory, but actually being in there kind of stressed me out.  It was packed, there were hardly any chairs, and the second they gave us our drinks, they called our names and said our table was ready.  But whatevs, totally worth it for the fooooood."
"Love this place!  Went in on a Friday night in the winter, got seated right away, cute and cozy, Its like tapas, plates to share,  Love the pickles, the seafood rice dish was amazing."
"Since the dawn of time, man has been taking dough and stuffing it with meats and vegetables in the hopes of creating culinary perfection. British with kidney pie, the Italians with ravioli, and the Poles nearly did it with pierogi. But God strike me down right now if there's ever been a better potsticker to grace this planet than the ones found at fat rice.   Just one part of a four course meal, these delicate delicious morsels were in company of wonderfully tender pork belly, rich sausage, and dry fried string beans.   My girlfriend and I were floored not only by the food, but the wonderful wait staff as well. They were all willing to discuss the food and we were so obvious about our enjoyment (gushing) one of the cooks came over to tell us he's never seen a couple go at their food with such joy. We were famished and in the presence of wonderful food, who could blame us?"
"So I finally broke down and tried Fat Rice. I had a friend that kept hounding me to go and raving about the food. Previous to finally getting a seat I had made one attempt before but did not have the patience to wait for Chinese food and ended up going to Small Bar. Just to put this out there before I go any further. I have worked all over Asia for the past 12 years and spent quite a lot of time in South China specifically so my cynicism could stem from having almost identical food (in most cases better) in China at a fraction of the price. For what seems to be family style dishes the portions are tiny especially making the comparison to family style dishes in most other establishments of similar taste. The flavors are correct and for the most part authentic to what you can find in China. Staff is nice, space is tight and unfortunately for me it is not worth the wait or the price."
One in a lifetime experience. I appreciated every bite sip and waiter recommenation. The whole staff was working with me to experience the macau/Portuguese cooking style.
"It's impossible to be on a diet here. Hence the name Fat Rice??I love the husband and wife team here. They are so friendly, personable and love talking about food! The menu is a blend of Chinese/Portuguese, and very interesting. Everything we had here was delicious. Spicy, salty, and fatty. Done!"
"I tried Fat Rice for the first time last night, what a great experience! Upon reading Yelp reviews we learned that not only do they not take reservations, but people line up outside the door before they open at 6. Thanks fellow Yelpers! We tried this tactic and arrived 10 minutes before they opened and were the 3rd group in line. We were seated right at 6. The outside of Fat Rice is unassuming and as the blinds were closed the entire evening while outside you're not quite sure what you're getting into and while inside not sure where you are. We walked into a modern but rustic and funky room that really did blend Portuguese and Asian decor. It gave off a very cool vibe. We loved everything we ordered last night. We started out with three small plates, the Pork & Shrimp potstickers which were incredible, the dipping sauces were also great (and spicy!). The Jamón mangalica with asian pear and garlic almonds were also good (but would be the small plate voted off the island if it came down to it) and the grilled spanish octopus with romesco, jalepeno, arugula and almond. This is the most tender and delicious octopus I have ever had. Please order it if you go!We ordered two small plates which were both delicious, the fat noodle with mushroom and egg, which reminded me of pad see ew a bit and was the heaviest dish we ordered and the salada with padrón, olives, almonds, parrano (I had never had this cheese, it was great) and a fresh mango chutney port vinaigrette. We split the piri piri chicken which wasn't as spicy as I've had before and I probably would order something different next time. Dessert was a great pineapple upside down cake - more cinnamon-y and nutmeg-y then I'm used to but such a good combo. Do yourself a favor and try Fat Rice, it'll be a unique and tasty night!"
"Wow - this place was AMAZING. We visited Chicago recently and stayed with friends who live there. They told us about this place and we all arrived 35 minutes before it opened on a Saturday. We were about 7th in line and sat promptly.First off - the staff is SUPER friendly and amazing. A++++. The best.We ordered an assortment of food, here are some thoughts:potstickers - i eat a lot of potstickers and these are different. very interesting and def worth ordering!Ginger Lime Cauliflower - i love me some cauliflower. this was really good. i thought it was a little salty soaked in sauce, but nonetheless, it was yummy. Fat Noodle - super yum. great flavors. and who doesn't love fat noodles? :)Macau Rice Crisp  - AMAZING. WHAT EVEN IS THIS??? asian rice crispie treats? really, the most unique and awesome dessert i've had in a really really long time. overall - so interesting and different and delicious. fat rice is a must try!!!!"
"yes. I've been looking hard for good asian (broadly defined) food in chicago. This place is the best I've been to and miles, miles ahead of other blue line fusion spots (Mak, Rodan, Oiistar, Belly Shack...). Brunch was fantastic; restaurant was the right size and well lit. I will go back lots of times."
"Outstanding! I loved the Portuguese Chicken, one of the most interesting and complex dishes I've ever eaten. Fat Noodles were also great. I'm not a huge bread fan, but I'd gladly return and pay again for the special Portuguese bread & butter too. Yum!The waitstaff was perfect - knowledgeable, attentive, and made our entire meal even more satisfying."
"Food: more like 5.5 stars minus 1/2 a star for one nitpickService: 5 stars, not withstanding HEAVY upselling - this is usually annoying to me, but our server's reco's were, admittedly, delicious and welcomed.Minus 1 star for communal seating, ""house rules"", potential for being rushed, and it being drafty and cold in the restaurant. FINALLY made it to Fat Rice and they obviously don't need my review, yet here I am. I live in LS and am sick of having to wait to get into restaurants in my own neighborhood so have avoided Fat Rice, despite it's intriguing menu and foodie-mecca reputation. Well, I'm a dumb@ss for waiting (thank you open table for letting us make geriatric hour reservations - not being snarky!) because Fat Rice lived up the hype. It's a cute place, very hip yet homey, a little loud (probably yell-talking-loud when it's full). It was COLD and drafty but they just opened and it was 8 outside. Get ready to bump elbows with strangers; it's small and with picnic table seating. This is NOT a ""fancy"" place and I was glad I was wearing jeans. Great date night, wouldn't come here with my boss (mostly because the food was so good I didn't want to use silverware). Don't come in a group bigger than 4 and don't bring the kiddos.They've got a great wine list - we each had a cocktail, I thought they were OK but didn't go with the food at all - mine was too sweet, his was too strong; and we wanted to enjoy our drinks but felt a little pressured to hurry up an order and the food came out FAST. I'll stick with wine next time. Our server was a pro, friendly, fast, not intrusive;  explained everything to us, and made some killer recommendations on small plates that we weren't planning on getting and were very glad we did. We had the eggplant small plate - soy, peanut, sesame, mushroom flavors served at room temp;  and the salt-cod spread with great olive oil and a fresh, fragrant mini-baguette. Both had familiar flavors, but not quite like anything I had before, and totally addictive. I think I could live on the salt-cod spread. We split the arroz gordo - it was easily enough for 4 people with plenty of appetizers/small plates for starters. And we're big eaters. It was a simple, homey meal - so I can only imagine you're paying $48 for it b/c of the quantity and quality of the ingredients. The linguica is fabulous; the char siu delicious and traditional. The chicken thighs were like nothing I ever tasted, only wish their skin was crispy; and the prawns were served head- and shell-on with no good way to peel them but with your hands; they were a big as large langostines, stuffed with deliciousness, but unfortunately a tad mealy (if you've ever left shrimp next to pineapple too long, you'll know what i'm trying to say - this is my one nitpick). The rice is well-flavored and the crusty bottom parts were wide-eye inducing. Get this on your first go-round. We tried the special white from Portugal which was like a dry reisling meets pinot gris and was delicious, crisp and perfect with the dish.We each got a fabulous glass of port with a super down-home desert; whipped cream cheese (pudding-like consistency) in a bowl with guava paste topped with sweet/salty crushed tea biscuits. WAY better than we were expecting and I will for sure try to replicate this at home.Anyway Fat Rice, i actually agree with your house rules; and understand you're busy and need to turn tables and frankly that people can be jerks. BUT putting them on the menu makes you seem like you're doing the patrons a favor. I also get it's like eating at mamas house, so maybe it's supposed to be taken tongue-in-cheek, but I don't drop 2 bilz for dinner at my mamas house. Whatever, I'll be back. Like nothing I ever tasted before - fantastic, sweet, smoky, spicy, yum."
Delicious! We mainly ordered off their specials menu but their pickles are a must. Try at least 3 you won't be disappointed. Recommend the sichuan and eggplant.Note you will have a lengthy wait if you don't go early. I can't remember the last time I ate dinner @ 5:45pm but that's what had to happen to get into this trendy joint. But trendy for the right reasons!
"Here is your one line review: everything was good, but nothing was excellent and certainly not worth the obscene waits. Luckily we have a friend nearby that put our names in for a table so we didn't have to wait long. It was essentially a reservation that you had to get in person, which makes you wonder why they don't do reservations.Anyway, so much of the food strikes me as overpriced renditions of classic Asian dishes and not even superlative versions. The balichang tamrindo is essentially soy sauce braised pork belly with the only tweak being some acid and the pork rinds on top. Any Chinese restaurant worthy of the name can make an equivalently good, if not better, version.Such similarities continue with potstickers and twice cooked pork and their fat noodles which are your typical ho fun noodles and not particularly tasty looking ones at that. Or even the eponymous Fat Rice which seems particularly overpriced for what is a rather tiny portion of paella for 42 dollars. We didn't order any of the above because, though I like all of the above dishes, the Fat Rice version while almost assuredly tasty sound in no way unique.Also I ended up a bit disappointed with the fusion aspect. The menu is rather bifurcated with Portugese dishes and Asian dishes clearly separated. Throwing some shishito peppers next to a steak does not equal fusion. The bar here is Belly Shack with stuff like their brussels sprouts with chorizo in sambal olec and fish sauce. That is fusion and extremely delicious as well.Finally, I want to naysay the adoration for the pickles. We love pickles and we found the three we tried extremely disappointing, particularly the sichuan."
"let's start out with the positives.  the place itself is cool.  good vibe, good decor, hipstery-asian (that's me).  the staff is real helpful and friendly.  as someone who's allergic to fish and peanuts, it's not a great place for me to go.  everything's made with fish sauce and fried in peanut oil (though the allergen is taken out, but i'm always a bit weary about it, and hey, i'm still alive, so that's great).  there were only 4 dishes i could choose from.my roommate and i shared a buncha stuffs.  1) the tofu + mushroom bite.  it was real small and like, $4, which i wasn't thrilled about. it was ok.  the pickled pink stuff on it was good.2) the mushroom + egg noodles.  my roommate really liked it, but i thought it was just mediocre.  the sauce was nothing incredible, though they did make the egg fluffy and tasty.3) the pork belly.  yeah, that was good.  fatty pork belly all up in my mouth.  we paired it with a side of coconut rice, which was ok - i mean it was kinda oily and not soft.  i get it, it's fried, but you can make soft fried rice, and it doesn't have to be doused in coconut oil.all in all, the tab came to $40.  the dishes weren't huge.  no alchy bevs.  so i don't know.  i'd be back only to try the portuguese dish."
"I went here with a friend on a Friday night. We got there right at 6pm when it opened and we were the second table in line. This place isn't very big and it's communal dining, but unlike some other places with the long tables I didn't feel like I was squished against the person next to me. Fat Rice filled up pretty quickly by 7pm and after that there was an hour wait.There is a lot to choose from on the menu which I really liked. My goal was to eat as much food as possible, but there was no t-shirt for me to win despite my efforts which impressed a few people on the staff. My friend and I had the pumpkin soup (way too much going on in here), the fat rolls (good but not spectacular), a bacon dish which was tasty, the potstickers (OMG these are the best potstickers I have ever had), and the fat rice. For those of you who are curious, the fat rice is a big bowl with a bunch of stuff in it. It's kind of like paella. There's a rice base and then shellfish, pork, chicken, sausage, etc. piled on top. I can't say I was that impressed either. It is also $35 per person for the Fat Rice which includes a soup and dessert.So as you can imagine with all that food we had a fat check. The food was fine, but I can't say it was worth the hype. The location isn't terrible, but it's not great. But in terms of the food and service it is A-OK."
Finally!!! Have been trying to get here since the place opened.Super cute. Friendly staff. Excellent food! Simple yet creative. We order a bunch of different stuff and shared. Everything was great.So basically....order everything. : )
Let's just say this you could go to a way cheeper place and get the same food and service. The service was bad and the food did not make up for it. This was my second time there and I'm not going back. We ordered 4 dishes and a bottle of wine the waitress could not describe the wine or how they would go with the dishes.  They could not explain the dishes and got the order wrong two times.
"Many years ago in a quaint seaside restaurant in Lisbon, I pieced together badly-pronounced Portuguese phrases into a menu order much like the auditory equivalent of a ransom note made of jagged newspaper clippings. The waiter eagerly served me a gargantuan fish that could have fed an entire family, while the old sailors at an adjacent table looked over at me and laughed. ""Foreigner"" was the one word I understood. Then I learned that with Portuguese food, the thing to do is to share.Likewise, many of the entrees at this heavily Portuguese- (and Chinese-) inflected joint are meant for sharing, and the communal tables make that just the thing to do. And, even in English, some of the ingredients are a bit baffling (hongos, Calamansi Conserva, padrón)- but the staff will patiently explain that a Calamansi Conserva is a fruit from the Philippines. Thank you. I would have guessed that a Calamansi Conserva was a Republican gourd, which is not normally what I eat for dinner.I wasn't in the mood for sharing with anybody today, so I pieced together my first meal at Fat Rice with some smaller plates- pumpkin soup, linguiça, and rice crisp, washed down with a tasty Belgian ""Blanche de Bruxelles"" beer. The spicy and charred linguiça was truly wonderful, but the pumpkin soup (with chicken fat bread and soft tofu) made me feel like a king. The kind of king that sets the entire peasantry to work cooking vast cauldrons of pumpkin soup- for me, that I might eat continuously and cease my proletarian hobby of taking breaks between meals.The rice crisp was the one item I wasn't crazy about. It tasted too much like a rice krispie treat for the interesting seaweed and pork flavorings to stand out. And yet, it fit the adventurous and unique spirit of the menu so well that I have only myself to blame for not trying the ""African"" Chicken, the Balichang Catfish, the Salado Gordo, the Mango Bebinka, and everything else on the menu. Maybe even in one sitting."
"This place is trendy for the right reasons. The food was fantastic, lighting was dim, and the place was bustling. Of course we ordered the Fat Rice and a collection of appetizers. The staff accommodated my fish allergy by serving it on the side. Wine was served frequently enough to make dinner even more fun."
"I got here at 5:30 on a rainy Tuesday, so I didn't have to wait at all.  Standing room only by 6pm.Service is great, decor is great.Food:I loved the boiled peanuts they put down - unusual flavor that I hadn't had before, and very addictive; a nice start to the meal.Marlin:  Awesome, perfect.  I highly recommend this.Fat noodles: whatever.  It's exactly like the pad see eiw at your local Thai place.  I could not discern the big deal here.Asparagus:  Tasted exactly like the fat noodles.Pork Belly: very, very good. Dissolving in my mouth, wow.So here's why I'm stuck in 3-stars: Nothing, and I mean nothing, had any heat at all.  Everything was bland, even though two of the dishes were labeled spicy.  The asparagus, for example, had whole chili peppers all over it, but I ate one whole, and it was like eating bread: no heat whatsoever.  They brought some hot sauce, which was nice a spicy, but I don't understand how they have these bland, bland chili peppers.  I'm not a spice masochist at all, either."
"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Chicago"
Food was good and tasty. Service was friendly and very helpful. Prices a bit high for the portions served. A nice and pleasant experience. Will definitely return.
"WOW. The food here is delicious. For $10, you can choose up to three small appetizer plates.  We ordered the sichuan eggplant,  ginger lime cauliflower, and thespicy garlic cucumber.  The sichuan eggplant was DELICIOUS. I wish we had ordered three small plates of that dish!We also ordered potstickers which came with a crepe crust. Definitely different than any potstickers that I've ordered. Overall, it tasted good but nothing spectacularly different from any other potsticker I've had.I ordered the Portuguese chicken dish. It was SUPER SUPER GOOD. It was a large entree dish so I took home half of it for lunch the next day. It tasted even better the next after the flavors infused even more into the rice and chicken. If I were to come back to Fat Rice, it would be for this dish.I was also able to try the shrimp with okra and the shaken chili whitefish. Both dishes were flavorful but I really liked the portuguese chicken the best.For dessert, we ordered the serradura which was made with guava, sweet cream, banana and almond brittle cookie crumb.  I only had a spoonful, but it was a wonderful spoonful! I could eat that stuff up.We arrived early, a little before 6pm.  15 minutes later, the restaurant was full and there was a long line that formed. I highly recommend coming here early for dinner. FYI, some tables are large and dining is more of a communal experience. There were a few small tables for 4 people but not many."
"Spotty service, exceptionally overpriced, mediocre space, but good food.Took a friend here for his birthday.  His choice, and our first time there.  They don't take reservations, so we were ready to wait.  Luckily, there were seats.  We were shown to the end of a table, next to two loud people, and we immediately asked if we could sit at the almost empty bar.  Annalise, our angst-rich seater, clearly didn't approve, but she stomped us to the service side of the bar.  My friend asked for the quieter end of the bar, (a whopping few seats away), and she became even ruder.  ""Whatever you want.""  She dropped the menus and walked away.  We nearly left.  Bad impression so far.Our waiter, Ryan, was quiet and polite, and he dismissed Annalise's attitude as quickly as possible.  We enjoyed his suggestions, and his passive demeanor.  Annalise passed us many times, snatching food from the expediter, and giving us hostile looks.  I thought, ""whatever you want.""We ordered a ton of food; the Fatrice dish, all four pickle dishes, and the Portuguese chicken.  We had two carafes of the rum punch, which was good, but obscenely overpriced.  The food was good, and the handsome and friendly expediter checked on us several times, which saved us from reliving Angst-y Annalise over and over.  It was a celebration, so I wanted to splurge a bit, but it ended up being a lot.  The total for the food and drink was over $200.  We left thinking, ""interesting place... But I'll never go back.""  Fear not, dear Annalise; You can save your dirty looks for others to enjoy."
"First, I love the idea of this place. Second, I think that the execution leaves something to be desired. The idea: take regional Chinese food, and present it far away from Chinatown and give it some style, and some presentation, and you've got the recipe for some innovative cuisine served to the never to travel to China or not often to travel to Chinatown's side streets and hidden gems. Very cool idea here! Love it. We ordered 3 apps, and a cross section of plates. Our food was well prepared, and tasted wonderful. The food here is top notch. There were some issues when it came to the food coming out with some sort of pattern/plan. We had the pineapple cake which was amazing. Our server was running around like a track star, but still took the time to talk to us about what he liked. There were things on the menu he did not know. The booze selections is small, and focused. Our cocktails were so-so. I really don't know why they have beer and wine at all. This place might better use the space taken up by the beer/wine coolers and just go  BYOB with a cork and bottle fee! The execution: No reservations. Significant confusion. Large Parties beware! The pros: You can be seated here if you are a party of two in about 10 minutes! The cons: After watching 5-6 parties of two get seated before you - a party of 4 and up will probably leave and many will leave! If you are a party of 4 or 6 you might have to wait 50 minutes to two hours! This is insane. This space is small. I get that. It is not like Revolution which opened small and now is as big as a department store. I disliked those fake 2 hr waits. The chaos: We waited then were almost skipped, and watched larger parties leave. Another party went in and was almost given our table. One party of 3 was seated before another party of 4 and a woman complained at the table that the 3 seated persons had jumped them in line. I have never seen anyone yell at another party for jumping line, but with waits of an hour I get it! Yep. You might have to politely remind them a few times that you are in line. The solution: I really think that rather than just seating all the 2 person tables right away, they need to think about when the tables are turning over so that parties of two can be balanced against parties of 4 or 6. A good manager knows how to rotate tables and control table flow. Get on it. For now: I will say that I am excited to see an aspirational effort here, but a staff-training day is really needed for the weekend rushes, and perhaps a better focused plan for dinner (and perhaps even reservations for parties of 4-6?). I keep thinking that those nice people who waited for an hour and went home would probably give this place 1 star if any at all. The food is amazing. But after an hour or two you might just skip the snout and go get some good Korean or Chinese food made by Korean and Chinese chefs or some taqueria tacos made by fellows from the place where the food style came from."
"So disappointed by this place. We got there early, so we sat almost immediately. Our waitress was sliiiightly too chatty. When the food arrived, it wasn't even good. We were all pretty shocked about the quality. Small portions (they claimed one of the dishes could feed 4 - nope!) and lacking flavor all around. Nothing piqued my interest. One-timer."
"This place is not my cup of tea. I ordered thw squid rice, which lacked flavor. And my friend ordered a african chicken. It had a curry flavor to it that I strongly disliked, but my friend seemed to enjoy itThe restaurant is small plates style, but really none of the plates are ""small""  For me, one ""medium"" dish was too much to eat as my entree - I have a decent sized girl appetite, by the way. I went on a friday right when it opened and it was full within five minutes. So get there early to avoid a wait."
"I wanted to love this spot so hard, but I don't think I can say that I love it quite yet. The Fat Rice is insane - absolutely way too heavy and too much food. The rice was not cooked, and it was kind of painful to eat.  I don't think I would recommend it, because we all felt sick afterward. The salad was nice, but the greens were not cut up so it was a bit awkward trying to stuff some of the huge lettuce into my mouth (we were not given knives). There was a seafood dish that we had, but I cannot find it on the menu -- I think was the coconut curry or something like that, and it was my favorite dish. The flavors were great and I'd definitely come back for that! This spot is pricey, and I don't know if it's quite warranted. However, the atmosphere is nice, and the drinks are strong. I'd probably give it another shot."
A haiku:Award-winning foodDown the street from a Popeye'sYep - that's Logan Square
"Waited 90min to be seated.  The atmosphere is ""intimate"" (note sarcasm).  We were a table of two and we had to sit at the end of banquet table for 10.  The party immediately next to us was loud and self-absorbed types who were just rude.  Not a good date night place.Food was just so-so for asian fusion food.  Place seems over-hyped and didn't deliver.  The signature dish, the Arroz Gordo (Fat Rice) was a Macau-Portugese version of paella served in a cast-iron bowl.  Meat and Seafood (Clams, prawns, sausage, duck, pork, chicken) was marinaded and had good flavor but the peppers and sauces that are supposed to accent the dish just overpowered the flavor of the meat.  The rice, though saucy and starchy was good.  I just felt the spices and sauces took over from the main show (the meat and seafood).We also had the Balichang Tamarindo and appetizer Green banana egg rolls w/Chili sauce.  Both were good but the Green Banana egg rolls were way pricey for what you got.Overall, it's not a place we'd go to again.  The restaurant is too small and their idea of seating at a large shared table is not very conducive to having any sort of conversation unless you want to yell above the noise of the music and other patrons.  If the food was great, yes then it would probably be the deciding factor but since it wasn't something to write home about, we just wouldn't put it on our list of go-to places."
"Amazing! Great beer list and each item we ordered was totally unique and delicious. My boyfriend looooved the Portuguese chicken and I couldn't get enough of their dumplings. We ate at the bar which I would also recommend because you get to see their chefs in action, a really awesome treat. I will say though that it's super small and getting a table can be annoying, so be prepared, but it's worth it!"
"Finally got a chance to try this place out last Thursday and was definitely please with the experience. My partner and I arrived maybe a few moments before 6pm and there were already a few other patrons. As our meal progressed it got increasingly full, and by the time we left, there was already a decent wait time. Our server was very attentive and took the time to answer all of our questions about recommendations for both the food and drink menu. We ended up starting with the clam served with vermicelli which was served with a lemon dipped in chili powder and was the perfect start. Light, yet flavorful, the ideal small plate. Also from the small plates menu, the potsickers (pork and shrimp) are served with a tasty habanero sauce and are fun to eat because they come in one dough sheet and you have to pull them apart. The filling itself was seasoned perfectly, as sometimes filling in dumplings can be a bit too salty especially when working with pork. Such was not the case here.Moving on to medium plates, we ordered the salada gorda. This is kind of like a garbage salad, full of ingredients. I have never had anchovies before and was a bit nervous but I loved the flavor they added. I'm a cheese lover so the machengo was a great addition and even though the salad seemed a bit daunting at first (size wise) I would definitely order it again.For our large plate we ordered the piri piri chicken. The chicken was cooked nice and tender in the sauce, with enough spice without being too much. The coconut rice on the side was a nice balance, though I wish I had asked for more to go with the leftovers I had the next day for lunch.  Next time we go we'll definitely be trying the arroz gordo pre-fix for only $35/person. We debated between the pre-fix and small plates but wanted to get a good taste of the menu on our first try. Can't wait to go back!"
"I have only been to Fat Rice once, but it was delicious.  We got there at about 5 PM and were seated right when they opened at 5:30.  The service was good and the food was excellent.  We had the piri piri chicken (which I didn't taste), the Malay vegetable curry (has shrimp paste, not vegetarian), and shrimp-corn stirfry.  The guys raved about the chicken and couldn't stop eating it!  The curry was sooo good--great balance of flavors and textures.  The shrimp stir-fry was also good, but kind of a quiet dish next to the others.  The shrimp were big and cooked perfectly.  We also got coconut rice to go with everything and we got some of their little bites as appetizers--pressed tofu, Sichuan pickles, and sweet-sour eggplant.  Yum!  I would certainly go back, but I don't think it's worth a 2-hour wait or anything.  I mean, I wouldn't even want to wait in line for 2 hours to eat at an incredible place like Alinea.  The thing that's nice about Fat Rice is that, unlike other trendy places that say you should share dishes, these dishes are actually family style and are sized for sharing.  Hallelujah!  It's annoying to order a $13 dish at someplace, be told you should share, and receive about 5 bites of food on the plate.  Ugh.  That is not shareable!  Fat Rice serves very generous portions, and they are arranged such that everyone can have a little bit of everything--main event and garnishes.  I am happy to say that it lives up to the hype, and I love the mashup of Portuguese/Chinese/Southeast Asian that makes up food from Macau.  Makes me want to go there!"
"Amazing Macanese food. We got eggplant dumpling with pork inside and split the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup was an amazing explosion of curry and cilantro flavors. Also, this restaurant is not too pricey. Go here!"
"All i've ever heard about this place was the wait, and their Fat Rice. So the question is if their prized dish was worth the wait? Were any of their dishes worth the wait?If you are a vegetarian, it definitely is not. They have a very slight number of vegetarian dishes, which while good, were not spectacular enough to justify the wait. If you like meat and Asian fusion, then this will likely hit the spot. The Fat Rice comes in a cast iron pot with the rice crusted on the bottom and topped with a layer of meat and seafood. Immersed in the rice are also pieces of bread (or a similar texture to stale bread). The dish also comes with a mushroom sauce that you'll lather on the rice.  It reminds me of a Chicken and rice dish my dad makes where we would pour a soy and vinegar based sauce over the rice. Overall, a good and very filling dish.We also tried their pineapple upside down cake.  When it first came out, the cake looked great. Then the waiter destroyed it by pouring cream all over it...or at least I thought it looked destroyed until I tasted it. It was phenomenal. I would happily order a whole cake to bring home if I could afford it. The cake just melted in your mouth. It's definitely a different twist to Asian fusion since it's based on Macau cuisine, which has Portguese and Chinese influence, rather than simply Chinese cuisine. Despite having to pay two to three times more than what I would pay at a typical Asian restaurant, it was a great dining experience."
Go early if you don't want to wait in the weird waiting room (3 doors down it's like a yoga studio reception area). If you don't mind sharing a table with strangers you get seated faster. It's best to sit at the bar or a non-communal table. There are not enough vegetarian options. The best thing the veg pot stickers were removed from the menu! The Malay Vegetable Curry is so flavorful! Pickles and smoky tofu&mushroom are really good.  Service is fast (so they can seat the next person) and wait staff is friendly. It's definitely a place for big flavor and unique menu options.
"I waited a while to write this review. I couldn't decide between 2 and 3 stars...ultimately, I went with 2. ""Meh. I've experienced better"" is a much more appropriate description for Fat Rice than ""A-OK"". The food was simply unmemorable. The Fat Noodles? Tasted like nothing. None of the typically delicious xo sauce was infused into the noodles, leaving a really bland dish overall. The Portuguese Chicken was overcooked, although it was probably my favorite dish of the night, although the coconut curry was a bit too mild. The sweet and sour pork belly was fine, but that's mostly because I'm a sucker for pork belly (I grew up on ssamgyupsal - korean bacon; that should be enough to explain why). We also got the dumplings which were really uninspiring outside of their fun presentation (which is essentially what Lure Izakaya had with its spaceship gyoza before they shut down...RIP Lure). I don't get the hype. I don't get the 2 hour waits. But I don't understand much of the world either. I just know where I like to eat over and over again, and unfortunately, Fat Rice is not one of those places."
"Went w/ 2 friends to Fat Rice recently (which was on my visit list for awhile).Overall I had a great time and I liked Fat Rice, but didn't love it. Went on a Friday night and feared that I'd have to wait FOREVER to be seated, but was easily able to get a table at 6:45/7 for a table of 3. The place is quite small and it's shared seating so it's better to be on the conservative side.Service was fantastic! Some of the best staff I have encountered in awhile at a Chicago restaurant, so the entire staff deserves a big thumbs up for being helpful navigating the menu, knowledgeable about what to order, courteous, and had an overall great disposition. They seemed happy to be working there!How the menu is set up (not the cuisine) reminds me Avec. Lots of small plates, lots of medium-sized plates, few entrees. My table ordered a couple starters, a couple medium-sized dishes, and shared the 'Fat Rice.'Most dishes were good, some weren't, and some were fantastic. The best thing on the menu were the green beans special, which don't get me wrong -- were unreal. But the best plate shouldn't be green beans. I was a little disappointed with the ""Fat Rice"" dish, it was good, but nothing out of this world. I also thought the restaurant was a bit pricey. I feel like restaurants like Fat Rice are incorporating the ""Tapas Model."" Rather than an entree, order lots of different small/medium plates! And even though I like trying variety, this type of ordering can get expensive pretty quickly. Rather than trying to ""guess"" which of the 6-12 small dishes are great, I'd rather there be  good entrees that incorporate many of the flavors from the smaller plates, but maybe that's just me. Fat Rice was good, but not out-of-this world. I've enjoyed my dining experience more at Avec or Ruxbin (other highly rated restaurants w/ similar vibes/price range). I'd definitely recommend it if you've never been, but I'm not rushing to get back."
"Pretty awesome place. We got the chicharrones with the pineapple vinegar and couple of cocktails to start, the Pim's Cup was exceptionally refreshing on on a summer evening. The chicharrones are not recommended. Be prepared to wait for a table though, as we got there right as it opened and still had to wait an hour to get in. The waiting area is quite pleasant though, especially if you can sit outside.The meal itself is crazy, we started with bacalhau de vovo, totally unique flavors of salt and citrus, with a nice fish aftertaste on warm bread. Fantastic. For dinner we selected the Fat Rice, and for this I cannot speak highly enough. The prawns, chicken, and sausage were all stand out, but the rice at the bottom was incredible, with bits of crispy duck and croutons. The piri piri sauce that they provide was out of this world, I had to cover everything in it, and I ended up stuffing myself. The food here is five stars and so is the service, they are truly professionals at what they do, and service is quick and friendly. For how crowded it was, I didn't feel rushed.  The wait was the only thing that knocked the star, and the restaurant can't control how popular they are. When this place cools off a little this will be a seriously fantastic experience."
Love the food here!  Get there early otherwise you will be waiting for a table!Drinks are nice and strong.  Service is great.  Will be back soon!
"The hype surrounding this restaurant is just incredible. Hipster foodies unite. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it in Food and Wine's top ten. The few problems I have with the place: I don't trust foodie restaurants that don't know how to make cocktails. I'd rather you stay BYOB if you don't know how to make drinks. The drinks here were incredibly bad. Like, undergrad frat party bad. Watered down, no balance whatsoever, flat tonic. The food itself really isn't all that bad, but severely overpriced. You can get similar XO noodles for less than half the price at chinatown. Pickles were okay and kinda necessary as a palate cleanser with all the heavy protein meals, but also not cheap.The po kok gai was our fave dish. Huge portion and savory. I always have a thing for stews and curries. Not the easiest thing to eat, but no complaints here based on taste.The fat rice had some impressive bulking, but was pretty flavorless with a bad protein to rice ratio, leaning actually too heavy on the protein side. The protein was salty, but the rice was quite bland. Unfortunately bland + over-seasoned did not combine to make seasoned, it combined into unbalanced blandness. I understand the thought process of using a side dish of soy to enhance the flavoring, but the side seasoning is inadequate to properly season the crisped rice at the bottom of the pan... And that crispy rice is supposed to be the most cherished portion of any hot pan-rice meal (i.e. Paella, bibimbop, etc). Overall really not bad at all, but disappointing when you factor in the wait and price."
"Fat Rice is aptly named - I ate so much that I thought I was going to explode.   Portuguese-Asian fusion sounds so strange, but it works.The waiting situation is ideal - there is nothing more irritating than having nowhere to wait for a table.  They give you a card and send you a couple doors down to an empty storefront, where you can sit and have a cocktail while waiting for a table.  The food was phenomenal.  Everything we ordered brought the heat in that really pleasant way, not the mouth searing way.  We had the calamari, the house-made linguica and the piri piri chicken.  The chicken was outstanding, and it was just as good the next day.We will definitely be back!"
"Cool decor / spot. Shared a fat rice with 2 others. Fat rice is tasty but a little disappointing in size. Definitely thought it would be bigger. Server said that it could feed 2-4 people but we were definitely still a bit hungry afterwards. Overall, good experience but probably would not go out of my way to eat here for Asian food."
"Five stars for the AMAZING meal.  They clearly still have some kinks to work out with regards to service (timing, mix-ups, etc.), but I'm still awarding a 5 b/c the food was out of this world and the space/atmosphere is so unique and enjoyable.  I had the shrimp and pork pot stickers (not your typical presentation, liked it, and delicious), the African chicken (*superb* .... spicy, complex, sauce over the potatoes was divine), and the mixed vegetables (cooked perfectly, delicious broth .... especially tasty as it was absorbed into the mushrooms).  Cocktails also light and delicious (I had the rum-tamarind-vanilla drink.....highly recommend.My only complaint, as mentioned earlier, was service.  The servers were friendly and warm, but the timing was pretty awful and there were several mix-ups (both for my party and others sitting near us).  By the time we got our vegetables, we were done with the rest of the meal, as the server had accidentally delivered our veggies to the people sitting next to us.  We had to ask repeatedly and when they finally arrived, two different servers each brought us an order at the exact same time!I'm looking forward to going back when they have had a little more time to smooth out the bumps.  And I can't wait.  It was an amazing meal."
"Food is good but not great. A little overpriced for what it is. Good decor, nice layout and family style seating. You can get better food with the same vibe at Mott St, but this place is definitely worth visiting."
"Being that I live a block and a half from Fat Rice, I'm surprised it took me so long to get there.  From all the hype it's been getting, I've been building this place up in my mind since it opened, and on the whole, Fat Rice delivered.We were smart enough to go during the week and were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes.  We adjourned to the outside seating area for a cocktail and 20 minutes later were being seated.  I love when a place gives a generally accurate wait time and over-delivers, seating us sooner than expected.  Drinks: The Gintonic is fine.  I expected more thai basil flavor but it's pretty much a standard G&T.  I more enjoyed the Trade Route which is a testament to balance and proportion in a cocktail rather than expensive ingredients.  My girlfriend enjoyed the Kalimotxo which is more or less cola sangria.  The Passaporte unfortunately was overpowered by passion fruit.Food: Standouts were the chili clam, sichuan eggplant and fat noodle, though honestly everything was delicious.  Maybe it was by virtue of having ordered too much food but by the end of the meal it was all starting to taste similar.  A lot of the dishes are reasonably spicy as well and it's a safe assumption that a combination of the food and cocktails somewhat anesthetized my palate.  Ambiance/Intangibles: The space is great, noise levels are appropriate and the staff is generally friendly and helpful.  They made a curious choice to include a douchey, Violet Hour-esque list of house rules which had us remarking, ""fucking hipsters..."", but other than that I was pleased.  Overall: Recommended.  Vibrant food and atmosphere make me think this place is here to stay."
"I've been eating at different X-Marx pop-ups for years.  I was so excited when I heard they were finally opening a brick and mortar location!  The opening kept getting pushed back and the wait seems like forever, but when I finally was able to get there I was not disappointed.  We arrived right at 6 PM on Saturday night, which was a good move.  When we got seated, there way only 1 open table left.  A few minutes later, it was full and after that there was almost always a line.Our waitress was sweet and helpful.  She seemed slightly overwhelmed at times, but other waitstaff would always step in to make sure we were being taken care of.  We tried a ton of different dishes and each one was a delight.  Some of my personal favorites were the pumpkin soup and the smoked tofu.  I also could not get enough of the pot stickers.  They were the best pot stickers I have ever had in my life.  I am dying to go back for more."
"Loved everything about this cool little place , except one thing I am sorry to say. That is the $50 rice bowl. It was our least favorite thing and again, sorry, it's not remotely worth 50 smackers. 2 shrimp , some pork that was very tough & soft fatty chicken pieces. Cocktails awesome, servers excellent & our other dishes all delist!"
"Amazing. Great ambiance, great music, decent beer on the menu, but most importantly the food. Absolutely amazing. Everyone we had from the small dishes to the entrees it was all great. Highly recommend. Small hidden gem in Chicago"
"Great place for a group of friends to share a meal and have lots of variety since everything is family style. Had to try the signature Arroz Gorda...delicious! Their potstickers are not your standard potstickers. A must try. Server was excellent, quick with recommendations and explanations. Their specials menu was almost as big as their normal menu! Will definitely be back!"
"Very good. The place is small, so try and go off peak. It is worth the hassle and the hype.  We had the Portuguese chicken, salted cod spread, and special meatballs. The cod spread appetizer was wonderful and the portions size was perfect. I would have to say the Portuguese chicken was the star of the meal. It was so special and flavorful. I would definitely recommend it."
"Small, cozy environment, great service, well worth any wait.  Food is originally prepared and delicious.  We tried a sampling of many dishes and all were delightful.  We tried one of their crafted cocktails - the Braganza (made with black tea infused brandy, white port, grapefruit and rosemary - very refreshing.Dumplings were originally prepared with an overall crepe on top.  For me, a sign of a great restaurant is one that knows how to not cook the life out of a vegetable.  The sautéed bok choy was perfect.  Highly recommend ordering their named dish - Arroz Gordo.  A great dish to share and a panoply of flavor.  Even the shrimp was stuffed inside.  Very, very good."
"Delicious!  We got the potstickers, baby bok choi, piri piri chicken, and the arroz gordo. Potstickers were ok. Nothing special in my opinion. The bok choi and piri piri chicken were absolutely delicious. The arroz gordo was also fantastic although, personally, I was less fond of the sausage and chicken in the arroz gordo. The char siu, though, was heavenly. Sooooo goooood."
"How can this place be anything other than 5 stars?Quick rundown.  We went on a Saturday night at 5:15 p.m. so we only had to wait for them to open, instead of a long way for a table (they open at 5:30).  We very much enjoyed dining at the bar and seeing the action in the kitchen.  Food is ah-mazing!  We seriously over ordered - ""pickles"" - the eggplant was outstanding (didn't love the others).  The potstickers - oh my, dreaming of them still - and the Fat Rice (yes, this dish could serve 3-4 people).  You MUST order the potstickers and Fat Rice.  I'm certain the description is in other reviews.  We were blown away and continued to enjoy the leftovers for 2 days, each time commenting how wonderful it was.  The drinks, ridiculously good.  My only complaint is that they go down too well.  Our server, Janelle, could not have been nicer.  A true pleasure.  We can't wait to return!"
"I went to Fat Rice a few months ago - didn't even have to wait for a table. Apparently since then the wait times have gotten ridiculous, which is a bit of a downer. Not a downer? The sichuan style bacon with a side of rice. Nice, thick pieces of bacon mixed in with bamboo and leek with a bit of heat. The potstickers come connected by a web of crispy crust on a plate. We were advised that one of the accompanying dipping sauces was very spicy, but it was not bad at all. Lies. I would've gotten another order of potstickers - yeah, they were good. The rolled rice noodles in the fat noodle were hard to control with my chopsticks but were well worth the struggle and slurping. The best part of this trip to Fat Rice was that I went with my friend who does not eat a lot - more food for me. The atmosphere is dark, relaxed, and casual. Our waitress was a little weird. I definitely want to try the fat rice, the namesake dish, one day, because it has seven different forms of meat. I am so up to the challenge."
"At last, there is Portuguese cuisine in Chicago.  This was the best meal we've had in a long time.To start, we ordered a carafe of the house red.  Mind you, the house red is not your ordinary house red.  This house red was a Portuguese red which was a blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon.  The carafe (that's 500 ml, or 2/3 of a bottle) set us back only $15.  Any good Touriga Nacional dominated wine will have violets on the nose, and this one did not disappoint.  The wine more than stood up to the spicy cuisine, also.  A perfect food wine at a perfect price.  This place gets high marks for not gouging on wine.  Their most expensive wine was a white Chateauneuf du Pape that was only $68.  Maybe next time.  We led off with the linguica, a Portuguese pork based sausage that was made in house.  I think this is a must.  I don't think I got to eat this in Portugal because I was so busy eating every slice of presunto (like Italian prosciutto) I could get my hands on.  But yes, you get a little bit of spice on this one, and it comes with a few accoutrements in case you want a little more.We followed this up with a spicy squid dish, and then took a break from spice with the fat noodle dish.  That set us up for the main dish, called Po Kok Gai, which was also known as Portuguese chicken.  Lots of spicy flavors, along with mussels and the chicken.  We had two dessert dishes, their take on pineapple upside down cake and the Macau rice crisp, along with a glass of sercial Madeira.  Both were very creative dishes.  The rice crisp had a bit of Rice Krispies treat in it.  All that before tip came out to only $105 or so.  Good luck finding a better value for two than this."
"I have read about nothing but Fat Rice in my foodie emails for months....  It definitely lived up to the hype!!!!  I will absolutely never forget the fat noodles (similar to the wide rice noodles in Thai cuisine) and the Portuguese chicken was INCREDIBLE!!!!  That little pot of goodness was like a treasure chest and the further down you dug, the better it got.  The biggest mussels I have ever seen lined the top of the dish and under that were many layers:  croutons, vegetables, chicken, and so on.... and so on...   I would probably put this place at a 4.5 if Yelp would allow me.  The only thing holding it back from a 5 is that I did not fall in love with my drinks.  They were good, not great.  I would probably opt for wine or beer next time I go.You may see quite a few negative reviews for this place, but please notice that most of them result from wait times and such.  I did not have any issue getting a seat here, but that is because I know that if I am going to one of Chicago's hottest restaurants that does not take reservations then I need to plan accordingly.  My friends and I showed up at 5:45 on a Friday and were seated right away.  If you are going during peak dinner times, then plan on putting in your name and heading somewhere else for a drink during the wait.  Now, go forth and order the Portuguese Chicken!"
It was good but not amazing. There actual fat rice dish was nothing really special. However there dumplings are amazing! That is must if you go. The atmosphere is super crowded and loud. I would not recommend a group bigger than 2.
"So good I'm mad I haven't been before. The pork, chicken, and beef stew is fantastic."
"aafter reading about this place on all foodie sources, we came on a friday and waited 1 1/2 hour for a table and were seated at the bar. we orderedlinguicafat noodlepo kok gaiflaming fish curryeverything was good, but not great and the bill was $70?? it's over priced chinese food!"
"This was amazing! I think we had perfect timing, because we arrived on a Wednesday at 5:37pm, and there was virtually no wait. I heard the wait could be pretty long so we came almost exactly when they opened. Even with that though, almost all the tables were full when we arrived. Wow! We sat at the bar which I liked because then we could ask the bartenders questions about the menu. We ordered 3 appetizers to share-lemongrass carrot, smoky tofu & mushroom, and the mixed sichuan pickle. Of these my favorite was definitely the smoky tofu & mushroom-so flavorful, and almost melt in your mouth! Off the drinks menu I ordered a Pimm's Cup, which came in a very large glass and was strong, jus the way I like it. Of course we also ordered the Fat Rice to share. It really is more than just rice-it's pretty much anything you could ever want or imagine. I won't say much about this except that it was HUGE, we took leftovers home and the leftovers lasted for 3 days after. Definitely, definitely worth it. I highly recommend this place, and the wait is well worth it!"
"Solid four stars to this place. Had to wait in line for 40 minutes to get in the door before they even opened! Madness! Its a small and cute place- bar and communal seating only, which is pretty trendy and social nowadays. We sat at the bar - the service was superb! Our waitress/bartender was super helpful and had tons of suggestions about the menu. We ordered the 3 picked dishes: pickled cabbage (good), pickled eggplant (excellent) and pickled cauliflower (good). Then we ordered veggie potstickers that came looking like a huge pancake - it was pretty delish and fillling, I wouldnt recommemd getting it if youre planning on eating ur heart out in the entree secrion of the menu. We also got the pea soup that we split, or maybe it was lentil - it was tasy, my hubs liked it more than me. Them we got Fat Noodle with shrooms - it was pretty good. After we ordered the African Chicken - oh my it was soooo delicious but SOOOo freakin spicy!!! I was a lil ticked that our wonderful waitress disnt say anything about it being so spicy when we were ordering but whateves. I ate it thru tears and sweat and possibly other bodily leaks. ;) I really wanted to save space for some dessert but I honestly just couldnt do it :( i do want to go back and try some other things incl dessert. Be prepared to get there early like around 5:30 pm and earlier on Saturday! They open at 6pm!  ...and good sirs and ladies ... good luck!"
"Very impressed. I wish I could give a four and a half stars but I can't so I didn't. Had the Potsticker, the Piri Piri Chicken, and some sort of rice dish. All were very good. Cocktails were also tasty."
"Meh. Great atmosphere. Food?  So so at best. I have a headache from the sodium content. There's such great Asian food in Chicago, there's no reason to spend this for what you get. I've been to Macau, and the food there was excellent - this isn't like that. Staff is friendly and the pineapple upside down cake was great. That's why the two stars. If pricey and salty are your thing, by all means go."
I went here after the hype from Food and Wine's top 10 restaurants. We got there 30 minutes before opening and just missed the first seating. They do have a waiting room area to get drinks and snacks which was nice. The dinning room is small with communal tables but also emanates an festive environment. I loved it. The fat rice itself was a little disappointing (not nearly as flavorful ad I would have liked). I loved the complimentary starter they bring out. I can't remember the name but it was a salty and tangy boiled root. The fat noodle is a must eat in my opinions it was warm with soy sauce and veggies. I need would have picked the potstickers by my friends did and boy am I glad. It's crunchy exterior and juicy interior made this my easy favorite. For dessert we had a tasty cream cheese mouse with hints of guava and crunchy tea biscuits on top. The serradura.
"Fat Rice was a restaurant on my friend's list of restaurant that she wanted to experience. We arrived at the restaurant went it opened at 5:30 to avoid the long lines that she read about. We were seated right away, I guess because there were just two of us we had to sit at the bar even though there were still plenty of empty tables. Sitting at the bar was pretty cool because you get to observe that happenings inside of the open kitchen. The downside of sitting at the bar is that the stools are extremely uncomfortable after a while.The service was excellent, the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. I was disappointed when looking at the menu as 90% of offerings were prepared with some form of pig/hog innards or sausage.  I informed the server that do not eat pork, and she was very helpful in telling me the items that could be prepared without the pork. I was disappointed again to learn that was only about two items, the steak and something else. Additionally, to have so many items made out of the cheapest possible meat; pork sausage and innards, the cost of the items are kind of high for what you are actually eating.  For appetizers we ordered the pickles, and the cod spread. I thought the pickles were o.k,  but my friend really like the eggplant.,we both thought  the cod spread was really delicious. The server suggested the noodle dish, which is noodles, mushrooms, eggs, and a sauce, it sounded like it would taste very bland so I passed. For my main course I ordered the squid and rice which is cooked in it's ink,. The squid was tender, overall the dish was spicy with great texture,  very tasty. I recommend the squid and rice dish. I would not return to Fat Rice because of the lack of menu offerings for me also, I feel that the items are a little over priced. On the plus side, the restaurant is designed well (with the exception of the uncomfortable bar stools), the severs are professional and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is cozy."
"Everything was good, but nothing was excellent and certainly not worth the obscene waits. Luckily we have a friend nearby that put our names in for a table so we didn't have to wait long. It was essentially a reservation that you had to get in person, which makes you wonder why they don't do reservations.Anyway, so much of the food strikes me as overpriced renditions of classic Asian dishes and not even superlative versions. The balichang tamrindo is essentially soy sauce braised pork belly with the only tweak being some acid and the pork rinds on top. Any Chinese restaurant worthy of the name can make an equivalently good, if not better, version.Such similarities continue with potstickers and twice cooked pork and their fat noodles which are your typical ho fun noodles and not particularly tasty looking ones at that. Or even the eponymous Fat Rice which seems particularly overpriced for what is a rather tiny portion of paella for 42 dollars. We didn't order any of the above because, though I like all of the above dishes, the Fat Rice version while almost assuredly tasty sound in no way unique.As for specific dishes, we love pickles and we found the three we tried extremely disappointing, particularly the sichuan.  The peppersteak was tasty but not particularly interesting.  We had a vegetable curry that was my favorite of the night somehow being crunchy while still bathed in curry.Also I ended up a bit disappointed with the fusion aspect. The menu is rather bifurcated with Portugese dishes and Asian dishes clearly separated. Throwing some shishito peppers next to a steak does not equal fusion. The bar here is Belly Shack with stuff like their brussels sprouts with chorizo in sambal olec and fish sauce. That is fusion and extremely delicious as well."
"Loved Fat Rice!We went late (9:15 on Saturday night) and still had a 45 minute wait. They have a nice lounge area next door and its definitely worth the wait if you're up for it. We sat at the bar which I highly recommend.We had the pickled cauliflower, eggplant (awesome), and tofu mushroom. Potstickers, Char Siu Pork and Littleneck Clams, and the Po Kak Gai (portugese chicken) Everything was great, the kitchen has it down and the food came out fast.We went with the Pineapple upsidedown cake for dessert, it was good but not my favorite dessert of all time. Also the server forgot my cocktail but other than that, no complaints! We will be back to try the Fat Rice."
"Amazing food but eat fast or you might be asked to leave in not so subtle ways. Our silverware was taken away from us in the middle of dessert without a word - 2/3 of the desserts were still on plates. The check was brought, we paid promptly and were told they needed the table for another reservation. I said ""I know - we got the hint when you took our silverware away during dessert without asking."" The server felt she needed to repeat the request. I found this rude and unnecessarily aggressive and we vacated the table. Fine but we each ordered cocktails, appetizers, entrees, wines, desserts. I get it - you want the table even if no one was waiting for it despite the fact that we kept pace with the speed the servers brought the courses. I loved the food but to be made to feel unwelcome because a restaurant is enforcing a policy of fast turnover is simply wrong when the kitchen and staff can't keep pace with their own bookings. Perhaps they could warn their customers when the fat rice is set down at the table they have precisely 20 minutes to eat it, 10 minutes for the starter and 5 for dessert, otherwise they'll save all the attitude for the end of the meal and just ask you to leave. Their website states very specifically they ""reserve the right to request their table back after you have paid your bill."" This means that immediately upon collection of your signed credit card slip you may be asked to leave, stared at from less than a foot away until you stand up and go. This uniquely negative treatment far outweighs the delicacies here."
"There are three kind of restaurant reviewers, hype makers, hype haters, and people from the suburbs. Take reviews with a grain of salt. Some external factors that make certain people haters: The wait is going to be long at a popular restaurant that doesn't take reservations. Accept this, and move on; your fear and loathing in the waiting line doesn't help anyone. The waitstaff was competent, efficient, and left us alone until we needed water, which is all I want from a waiter. They even offered us a drink while we did the waiting in line. What else do you need?The room is small, but unless you need a double wide seat to fit your double wide body, I think most of the population will fit just fine. Ethnicity of the kitchen staff: I don't even understand how this is a complaint? For the record, affirmative action doesn't apply to kitchens. The ethnicity of my cooks doesn't matter unless he's applying for native American scholarship. Finally, the thing that actually matters in a restaurant review: The Food. The Food was awesome. I've never had anything like the Arroz Gordo, but the namesake dish alone is worth the trip. It came heaping with seafood, pork belly, sausages, chicken, longiza, the rice at the bottom soaked in all the juices from the proteins and was studded with fresh grapes (wuh?). It was gift that kept giving. I've never had the same combination of flavors before; the simplicity of Portuguese food with some of the umami packed flavors of Chinese food really worked in agreeable harmony."
"Here's the deal, the food is good. It really is. We had the ballchang tamarind (incredibly well prepared pork belly, pineapple, tomato in a tamarind sauce), the noodle curry dish with the shrimp whose name escapes me now, the coconut rice was tasty, the boiled peanuts were a great snack. Heck, even the  drinks were really well done. The food quality is not the issue. The problem is that while it's delicious, it's not worth the hefty price tag because in reality...the food is nothing special. This is stuff that you can get at other places around the city. Sure it won't be in a trendy restaurant, but I go to a restaurant for the food, not the bragging rights. In addition, we were told that the plates were family sized, so naturally the $16+ (and that's among the least expensive) wasn't an issue. However, when the food arrived it was not family sized. It was barely couple sized. Would I go back? If it were up to me, no. There was nothing about this place I found to be so amazing. However, if someone else wanted to try it and asked me to come along I would certainly go. You should also know that it's a very small place with communal tables. Some people, like the friend I was dining with, enjoy this. Me...not so much."
"The cuisine at Fat Rice is terrific, and truly unique.  The titular dish is a little overwhelming - you need at least three people in your party to order it - but with a little coaching from the friendly waitstaff, a great experience.  If you're out in Logan's Square, I highly recommend checking this place out."
"Skipped seeing a movie to wait for a seat and it was WELL WORTH IT.  Everything was spot on at Fat Rice - the food, the flavor, the portions, and the service.  We waited no more than an 45 minutes at 7pm on Friday night for two seats at the bar (which are not first come first serve) and drank our wine to pass the time.  The hostess was very gracious and thanked us many times for being patient.Our waitress/bar tender was incredibly friendly and helpful without being pushy.  She explained the menu and recommended her favorite dishes and then let us alone to decide.  We started with the pickled cauliflower, smoky tofu, and pork and papaya.  I would say skip the cauliflower as it's good but nothing special and definitely get the other two.  Beware the pork and papaya is spicy but even with my lips burning I kept going back for more.  The smoky tofu had a great texture and flavor.Our medium plate was the pork and shrimp potsitckers with a dipping sauce - they were to die for.  Really delicious, great texture, and there were five of them which was more than enough.  I would say these are not to be missed.Our large plate was the ""African Chicken"" which was excellent.  The sauce is a tomato base with rich flavors but they're not overwhelming.  Coconut rice comes with and we had both chicken and rice left over to bring home.We ended with a new dessert on the menu, serradura that had light, sweet cream, bananas, guava, and cookie crumbles.  We could have licked the glass clean - it was light, smooth, and delicious.The chef checked us up towards the end of our meal which topped off the whole evening.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT and can't wait to go back."
"This is a great 4.5 star restaurant in my book, but it's uniqueness, great staff, and awesome food tilt it into the 5-star category based on Yelp's rating scale.  It definitely deserves 5 stars as opposed to 4, but let me expound on that.When I think of Fat Rice, I think of unique (and tasty) entrees that you can't get anywhere else.  Sure you can get potstickers at most Chinese/Thai places, but Fat Rice's potstickers are served upside-down, so it looks like your getting a delicious potsticker pie.  They are very tasty and come with a sweet and tangy sauce that the server mixes up for you (reminiscent of PF Changs, but better).  And they offer up a hot hot hot ghost sauce that will leave you chugging water if you apply too liberally.  I'm a fan of it, but recommend proceeding with caution.  But the best thing that I've had at Fat Rice is the po kok gai (aka Portuguese Chicken).   Picture if you will succulent chicken breasts swimming in a coconut-curry stew along with delectable mussels and other scrumptious odds and ends.  It's really fantastic and a big highlight for this guy.  I've also had the braised sweet and sour pork belly, and while it was pretty good, it wasn't in the same league as the Portuguese Chicken.  The same could also be said for their mammoth main dish: the Fat Rice.  We got that once, and it's basically like they threw everything but the kitchen sink into one fantastic bowl.  That said, there were a few too many exoskeleton seafood additions for my liking personally, a few too many hard shells and the like.  There was so much going on in that dish that it was hard to focus on all the varieties of deliciousness, and it seemed like 1 out of 4 bites I took I found myself confused at what I was chewing/tasting,  so although nothing was ""bad"" in the mix, it's still not necessarily a great thing.Moral of the story: you can't go wrong with the potsticker pie and the Portuguese Chicken, as those 2 items are almost 5-star worthy in and of themselves.  And as an added bonus, we really love the staff, from the hostess to the waitresses.  One waitress in particular, I forget her name, she always recognizes our baby daughter whenever we come in, and remembers her name, and considering we only pop in once every 2-3 months on average, it always feels like home when we do, so that's nice.  While the space can tend to be a bit cramped, it's a fun lively atmosphere with great service, and as an added bonus, they serve Old Style which is my favorite crappy beer of choice.Love Fat Rice, a welcoming restaurant that serves very tasty and unique food."
"Overall, 4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food taste and portion size.Went in on a Friday night when my boyfriend and I went to Chicago. Got seated right after they opened.Ordered Potsticker, Fat Noodles, and Sichuan Asparagus. Not impressed by the food at all.Definitely had better potstickers before - I'm originally from China and my boyfriend is Chinese-American. The potstickers taste just like any potstickers you would get in any American restaurant, it doesn't taste bad, just nothing special.Sichuan Asparagus tasted decent, but the portion size was way smaller than we thought. It was not worth the price.Fat Noodles tasted like those fried noodles you would get on the fast food stand on the streets in southern China. The mushrooms and eggs were good, but again, nothing special.The food came out really slow too - we waited about 20 mins between each course, while taking like 5-10 mins to finish each dish because the serving size was just too small.It could be what we ordered, but we didn't think any of the dishes tasted like Portuguese cuisine. The food's name implied Chinese and I was really hoping that they did some kind of twist to it, but they were just overpriced-not-so-great Chinese food.However the waiters and waitresses at the bar were super nice and helpful. Definitely great service.Given the wait time, the price and the overall taste, I don't think we would go back next time when we visit Chicago. This place is overrated in our opinion."
"2 hour + wait on a Saturday night are just not worth it. Staff nice enough while waiting but I've ordered drinks and got here at 7, it's now 9 and still not seated. Just not a fan, I guess if you've got time to kill that's ok. I honestly can't give a good review after having to wait that long. They were honest about a 2 hour plus wait but how do you gauge your appetite and how many drinks can you have."
1st time in last night and was really happy.  Can't beat the service!  Exceptional!  Went early which would be my choice anywhere so had a chance to see the place empty.  Charming!  Server made several recommendations and combined with Yelp reviews made good choices. Want to go back and try more menu offerings - BTW something for everyone.  Kudos to Joseph our server and the rest of the staff!  Favorite item demo last night - Fat Noodles.Went again last night.  Again awesome and the serradura - aka Macau Sawdust Pudding is wonderful
"Everything about Fat Rice feels right. The wine list is confident: just one option per color (including a cava and rose), and each is a compliment to the menu items. The beer list is small but diverse and includes delicious Sri Lankan Lion Stout.   There are no cocktails to speak of (my BF says, ""gin and tonic doesn't count"").  I say, extra points for bucking the craft cocktail trend. From the bar we watched the chefs throw clay pots and delicate fish over open flames like we were Chopped judges. ""Ooh he has such finesse with that adjustable grill.""  I still can't believe our Portuguese chicken was cooked perfectly, and I could make a meal out of just the pickled appetizers. The atmosphere is cozy but edgy with some familiar Chop Suey place items thrown in.  Charred woks hang above the stoves adding authenticity to the brand new restaurant, but it hardly needs it. Fat Rice is the real deal."
"Went here for dinner recently. My friends loved it, I just thought, meh it was okay.  Wouldn't go back. Highlight for me was the cocktail we shared before dinner, which came in this neat pitcher that you tipped into your mouth. Funny and tasty! I thought the fat rice was nothing special, and definitely not worth the $48 price tag (well, actually more, since we had to pay extra so we could each have a prawn). The rest of the dishes were tasty, but the prices are really too much."
Two words: Balichang and Catfish.Two more words: Holy. Sh**.Just go here.  Order this.  And you will thank me later.
"Fat Rice lives up to the hype. We got there before opening and were first to sit. The place got crowded very quickly. The drinks are creative and delicious. Each plate of food was better than the next. Almost didn't get the potstickers, but was super happy that we did. They are delicious. I look forward to returning."
"Great job former XmarX folks, thanks Abe & Adrienne as it was rocking!!!!  Your Macau (Portuguese & Chinese flavors) influenced food is amazing and I appreciate you coming to the Logan Square hood!!  Here's the skinny on what was eaten:Pickles - Pork Ear & Papaya (least favorite, but I'm not the biggest fan of papaya & the pork ear could've been crispy for some texture as both items were a bit slimy), smoked tofu & mushrooms (amazing & I'm not a tofu fan usually), and spicy garlic cucumber - amaze-balls!!Pot Stickers - went w/ the pork & shrimp.  Hands down the best I've ever had.  There's a crispy layer on top of them that adds just that extra crunch that's perfect.  Also the dipping sauce house made and is a perfect combo.Fat Noodle - hand rolled chee cheong fun with x.o. sauce (the meat & vegetable version) - these noodles were fun, they were the wide noodles that are rolled up like a fruit rollup and then sliced.  The melody of flavors were paired up precisely.  Po Kok Gai (Portuguese Chicken) - mussels - mild curry - parrano - coconut - chorizo.  The combination of the crispy & juicy chicken with the mussels and coconut curry makes for a so well balanced dish.  The jasmine rice that accompanies it was cooked amazingly too.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the place is quaint with simple decor.  I really enjoy the open kitchen so that when you're sitting at the bar, you can watch the team work and food preparation.  Can't wait to come back for more mouth watering delicious food and another round of adult sodas - the callan club was a good choice!"
Had a great experience from the food to the wine to the service.GO GO GO!
"We love fat rice.  Still not quite sure what it is we are eating, but it tasted good and the service is great.  It is right around the corner from our apartment and I just noticed it coming home from work one day.  My fiance didnt believe me that a restaurant called ""fat rice"" just opened, so I just took her there...no idea what we were in for.Well, a wait for one.  The wait is not the best part.  It is winter and there isnt that much space inside for waiting.  THe second time we went we waited langer but just forced ourselves a standing spot.I think sitting at the bar is better than a table because the bar people/servers/cooks/chef are all pretty awesome and you get more interaction at the bar then the table.  We will be back again and again."
"Interesting food and some of it is quite good, but this place is not worth the hype. First of all, there are no Asians or Portugese that work here - at least from my informal observations. That's certainly not a requirement for good food, but it usually helps.I didn't have any issues with the communal, bench seating, but it can be (as others have pointed out) annoying being so close to your fellow diners. It's loud in there but I guess that's part of its charm.The Portugese chicken dish was excellent but there simply wasn't enough of it. The linquica was also good but wasn't too keen on the rabbit. The desserts were excellent ( we tried all three of them).Overall, for $50/person (minimal drinks) I expected more. Probably won't go back."
"We arrived on a Wed night at 8:30 and there was an hour wait for our party of two. As previous reviews mentioned, we went to the waiting area that's accessed through a separate entrance. The waiting area allowed us to be inside and nod our heads to the real hip hop they play in the restaurant. All dozen or so seats were taken when we arrived but fortunately some seats opened up within minutes. You can order drinks and appetizers there and if your table is ready before you've finished with them they'll bring it for you.After exactly an hour we sat at the bar which was I liked because we could see the action in the visible parts of the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knew the menu well. She explained the portions and made good suggestions based on our interests. At 9:30 there were a few menu items no longer available such as the Peri-Peri Chicken.We ordered the Bok Choy, the Pork Belly, and the Arroz Gordo. I'm a fan of paella and I saw the video from the Bon Appetit article so I was set on ordering the Arroz Gordo. The Bok Choy had a savory oil on it and I was still able to use chopsticks. The Pork Belly was cut similar to Lechon Kawali (Filipino dish) and was cooked in a mild curry sweetened with cherry tomatoes and pineapple. Our server recommended a side of coconut rice to the with the Pork Belly and as someone who grew up eating rice soaked with egg yolk or the sauce of the meat you ate, it went really well. The Arroz Gordo was a nice mix of different flavors. The server recommended that we start with the seafood since they're best hot. The prawn shells were split allowing easy shell removal. They're served complete with heads, legs, and tail in case that bothers you. The char siu was sweeter and had a bit more sauce than usual. The Portuguese sausage were about as thick as a Maxwell Polish. The rice had a nice crust along the bowl similar to deep dish pizza. The 2 of us were able to finish the Bok Coy, 3/4th of the Pork Belly, and 3/4ths of the Arroz Gordo.While nothing straight up wow'd me, I highly enjoyed my dining experience because all the food was quality and well prepared. I like how traditional Asian items are thrown into the non traditional decor to give it some funky flavor. The staff was polite and straightforward. I plan on going back but occasionally since it was on the pricier side. We could have ordered less food and still have enough of a meal."
Folks if you don't want to wait then come before they open and don't come on friday or saturday night.  This is slow food and freshly made and that is why there is a wait.Don't complain if you come friday and saturday night and expect a short wait.  If you don't like communal seating then sit at the bar.
"this review is for their brunch, which we don't really recommend.  we have not had a chance to come here to get dinner, so once i do, i'll update this review.for brunch we ordered the peanuts, pork dumplings, lacassa noodle (shrimp), and pork chop.first, let me tell you what NOT to order.  don't bother with the lacassa noodle and bone in pork chop bun.  the noodles were REALLY bland, and for $13, you'd expect a decent bowl of noodles.  it was painful to finish the bowl because it was so lacking.  the bone in pork chop was also disappointing--lacking in variety, texture, flavor.  it literally was a pork chop in between 2 pieces of bread and mustard on the side.  the porkchop by itself was fine, but even with the other things the dish felt.....just utterly incomplete.the peanuts and pork dumplings were good starters though, so those are worth trying if you're here for lunch."
"My favorite restaurant. Love the food. Love the dinner. Love the brunch. Love the waitstaff. Love that the kitchen is in plain view & becomes entertainment. It's family style.  I'm not an organ eater, so I won't be ordering any of those items off the menu any time soon, but there is so much more on the menu(s) and it's all so yummy."
"I live right around the corner from Fat Rice and I was excited that another interesting restaurant was opening in the area. I went for the first time today and noted some very pleasant things and some not so.The service was very good, everyone was extremely attentive and friendly. My cup never wanted for water, which some people don't like, but I love and appreciate tremendously. First thing I had was the pumpkin soup. It was good, a decent size and priced fairly at 5$. Our next dish was a rabbit leg over bread soaked in broth with mint and peppers. This was delicious. For entrees we had the fat rice noodle and the fat rice bowl. The noodles were very good, thick rolled noodles with sprouts and some of the best mushrooms I have had all in a pleasantly spicy sauce. The bowl on the other hand was not so good, and is my only complaint, albeit a big one. The multitude of ingredients that seemed awesome on the menu, in execution created a crowded dish, there were way too many things happening here; prawns, chicken breast, pork belly, duck, peppers, mussels, rice, and couple of others I cannot remember. This in and of itself wouldn't have been so bad but it was priced at 48$ plus tax... I was shocked. I had thought it was 24 but taking another look at the menu I realized that it said 24 per person, which was strange because it was the only thing on the menu that was written that way. (My sister said it reminded her of studying for standardized tests back in high school with the teacher telling you to read each part carefully and not to just glance over it quickly. Should have followed your advice Mrs. Hayes!) There was no way that was a fifty dollar dish and I felt a bit upset that this was the case. Thinking back I realized the server did indeed ask us; ""for two?"" but I just thought she meant that we would be sharing it. All in all I really would like this place to remain in the neighborhood and I will definitely be back because it is close by and most of the food is fairly priced and tasty and the service was excellent, but I will certainly steer quite clear of that last dish."
Best seating is at the bar. Awesome waitstaff. Jenn was super knowledgable and friendly. The open kitchen with owners is a great sign to a new restaurant. They talk with thier customers and are very proud of the restaurant and shoul be. I loved the smoked mussels and lemongrass carrot. the pickled items are great. Balichang catfish was awesome. the couple next to us had the fat rice and they loved it and looked delish. The coconut rice was so good I ate it all by itself. And for dessert we had the coffee jello with with awesome candied nuts. This place has a bright future. Awesome owners with heart who create great food! Best wishes
"I'm sorry, I need to rain on this party a bit. I think my main complaints stem from the service, which led to mediocre food choices, and well, the food kind of grossed me out by the end. The staff really didn't know what was going on, and was not very attentive. My fiance and I were seated at one of the communal benches, and the couples on either sides of us had similar issues. It was also so cramped in that although communal tables may be trendy, it was crowded to the point of being awkward. I heard WAY TOO MUCH personal (and R rated) information about the couple to our right.Food: Pumpkin soup: there was some flavor in there I really didn't like. Ginger? I couldn't tell. The spice was nice, but I was not a fan.Green vegetable: the waitress recommended this, not sure why. It is okay for a couple of bites, but a huge plate of a single green vegetable (especially for the two of us) was boring, and oily. Fat rice noodle with X.O. sauce: We liked this dish a lot. The noodle was extremely thick, but it was tasty.Portuguese chicken: Fairly good for the first few bites. I had one very bad/fishy tasting mussel that ruined my appetite. The chicken is also thigh, which is extremely fatty. The sauce was good, but went bland after a bit. Pineapple upside down cake: Meh. While this seems to be a rare menu option these days which is attractive, the Fat Rice version just not that good.Beer: I can't remember what we had, they weren't wonderful. The main problem was the 20 minutes it took to bring the beer to the table. We ordered beer when we sat down, and received it 5-10 minutes after our soup. Bizarre.I wouldn't come again, too many better options. I felt guilty about the bill at the end of the meal because it didn't feel worth it, which is never a good sign."
"Long wait on a Saturday night. Drinks came to us slowly in the detached waiting lounge, which seemed understaffed. Once seated had very knowledgeable server and quick service. Personally I felt the food tended to be overbearing, over-complicated and seemed to lack focus on any flavor, rather meant to impress on their sheer number of ingredients. Given that, I was impressed that they ALMOST pulled it off.  I suppose this quality  differentiates Fat Rice from other Asian fusion or Thai places bound to what's traditional.  Despite not finishing our two dishes, we required a rejuvenating walk around the block to settle our stomaches before driving away."
"I went to the Fat Rice with a friend. We had the banana spring roll - delicious. Then, papo seco the bread - TOP, fried vegetables with chili - ok, curry noodles - delicious. The service is good too"
"Oh my god. I cannot wait to eat here again. I went with three other people and we were seated immediately. After having tried to go back and learning there was at least a two hour wait, I've come to accept this feat was magical. I only ate vegetarian dishes here, so I can't comment on any of their meat dishes. We ordered a ton of food, so they are not short on the veg options. The two main standouts were the eggplant and cauliflower. Seriously, I'd go back and wait for two hours for eggplant and cauliflower. It's that good. Love the small plate/ sharing, it's awesome to be able share and  try everything. I left feeling full. This place is reasonably priced as well. I think our bill was about $120 for the four of us, but I'd have a few beers during dinner so....I can't give Fat Rice five stars because of the ridiculously long waits, the no reservation policy (seriously, Countess Olenska saying ""For their great influence...they make themselves so rare"" comes to mind), and that they are closed Sunday. But let's be real, any place that can have such insane rules is doing something right, and they are, as is evident in their food."
"I was so excited to give this place a try!Parking was a piece of cake and we arrived at 5:55 p.m., so we were seated right away.  Don't get there a minute after 6:30!We ordered the pickles, potstickers, white fish and Fat Rice.I will definitely be back...and will do things a little differently the next time:  The pickles were not awesome...my favorite was the cabbage (we also ordered the cauliflower and cucumbers), but not worth $10.The potstickers were the highlight of the meal!  Easy recommendation.While their signature dish is something to behold, the whole thing is confusing, overwhelming, and just not that delicious.  I definitely enjoyed parts of it (the prawns and and the egg especially),  there was just TOO much going on and the rice had a flavor that is best described as 'peculiar'.  The waitress apologized that we were not instructed on HOW to eat this dish.  I don't think that was the problem.We had the pineapple upside-down cake for dessert.....so glad I didn't skip dessert, because it was second to the potstickers.Will be back...at 5:55 p.m., will sit at the bar, will order interesting drinks, will avoid the fat rice."
"I was pretty nervous going to this restaurant that my insanely high expectations wouldn't be met.  But they were!!We arrived at 6:15 and were told it would be an hour wait.  We walked to the ""waiting lounge"" next door had a drink, which was transferred to our table tab.Once inside the restaurant, everything was wonderful.  The waitstaff works as a team, each person as friendly and helpful as they could possibly be.  Even Abraham Conlon got in on the fun, serving one of our dishes and answering ingredient questions.  That was a treat.  Our main server, Janelle, was the absolute best!!  Not only is each dish presented with full explanation, but plates are proactively swapped out in between each course.  This is a benefit for family style dining.  You get to experience each dish on its own, not sitting in the leftover sauce of the last dish.There were two of us and we ordered three medium dishes and one large.  We could have done two medium dishes and one large, but the extra one was fine since we were pretty hungry.Each dish we ate was wonderful:- Pork and Shrimp Potstickers: Delicious and unique.  Cooked with a crispy pancake on top that tastes like popcorn!  It's very salty, but you can break it off if that's not your thing.- Fat Noodle: One of my favorite dishes.  The noodles are just like Lad Nar noodles in thai food.- Shrimp and Corn (daily special):  SO flavorful.  The ground cherries were unique.  Great flavor and heat.- Piri Piri (African) chicken:  I was worried about this dish because it's bone-in and I wondered if that would be difficult to split.  Some genius uses a butcher knife (or similar) to cut the chicken into individual pieces so it's easy to share!  The ingredients here are spice and salt, but it's just so darn good.  Definitely recommended.We didn't have room for dessert, but had TsingTao beer and an awesome Rose.Oh, since I need to find *something* wrong, it was so hot in the restaurant that sweat was dripping down my back.  But, it was 95 and humid out and they have an open kitchen, so it's allowed."
"This is why Yelp exists: To warn people to not believe the hype! As another Yelper put it - ""Hyped, overrated, overpriced, not worth the wait = proof gentrification and yuppie infestation is imminent for Logan Square."" He couldn't be more correct. I won't be able to comment on much of the food, as in the 2:15 we waited, we were only able to eat 2 orders of crab chips, and 1 order of pork rinds, which they call chicharron. We would have ordered the ""best ham in the world,"" but they ran out at 6:30, when they open at 6:00. Smart food buying! Anyway, neither of these 2 fried items were served hot, crackling with the fresh oil from the fryer, so as far as I'm concerned, they both could have been store bought from a bag?Here is why I can't comment on any of the other food: The owner threw us out. Literally. Abraham Conlon, I think that's what he said his name is? Well, he didn't like that we were questioning the wait time the hostess told us, which we were now over, and as much as she tried to say ""sorry,"" and justify why the wait was so long, they were seating 6 tops that arrived later than our 2 top. Bigger checks are better business, I guess? The owner, again, not liking being questioned, told my boyfriend to ""come back tomorrow."" After spending 2:15 in the waiting area, standing, and running about a $50 tab already on store bought crab chips, pork rinds, and 3 drinks, the last thing anyone in the hospitality business should say is ""come back tomorrow."" Completely shocked at this response from the owner, the hostess buds in and says ""they have been here since 6:30."" It was 8:40. The owner repeats ""come back tomorrow, and get here at 5:00 if you want to eat. We open at 6:00."" My boyfriend is the least confrontational person on the planet, and even though he's mortified by how full blown obnoxious this jackass is, he says ""well, we're hungry and if you served some better food in the waiting area, perhaps the long wait wouldn't be as bad."" The owner then tells my boyfriend ""we're not going to do that and you can't tell me how to run my business. You need to leave."" So he follows him to the waiting area where my boyfriend says ""I need to pay my bill,"" which we haven't paid yet, only tipped the very nice young lady working in the waiting area - and the owner says ""It's on us, just get out of here."" Andrew Knowlton says this is the 4th best new restaurant in America, so Abraham Conlon's ego takes over and he loses all common decency, not exceptional decency, but common decency as a human being, and he also completely forgets that he is in the HOSPITALITY BUSINESS. Nice work, idiot. This, like many other 'great' restaurants in Chicago, will come and go. They all do.  If you want outstanding Asian-fusion food, with exceptional service, check out Mott St. We ended up there after getting thrown out of Fat Rice. And I have to say, and I've been to Asia a few times, this is some of the best Asian food I've had in Chicago! Besides, Macau is only good for Casinos.  :)Sending this to Andrew Knowlton now..."
Fat rice... Pretty fat-tastic! The Portuguese chicken was waaaaay better than the fat rice. I suggest getting the Portuguese chicken plus a bowl of rice. Add the rice to the chicken and enjoy!
"Fat rice just didn't hit the spot for me. It didn't really hit the spot when i want to pig out to good chinese food, and it didn't really hit the spot for me in terms of creative high end cuisine. The space is very cute, and its decorated like a kitschy country home in china. The menu can only be described as chinese/south american fusion. Peruvian sausage was served alongside yuchoy for instance. The food was just okay and nothing really stood out in particular. Between four people, we shared at least 3 small dishes, 1 noodle dish, and a hotpot dish. It came out to be about $50 per person, yet that only afforded about one-two mouthfuls on some dishes. I definitely left probably being able to eat a lot more. Chinese food as far as I know is about substance, and fat rice kind of misses the mark here."
"The chicken in spicy tomato sauce was delicious and unique.  The sauce was complex and the olives complemented the dish well.  The appetizer pickles were good but were tad pricey at $10 I thought.  We had to wait 90 minutes for for seating (they don't take reservations and it's not a terribly large space), but the food was well worth it."
"I'll start off by saying that I'm a little behind on my reviewing.  The last time I visited Fat Rice was maybe 2 months ago, but I figure better late than never right?This was the second time I've visited Fat Rice.  Both times the food was good.  The first time the service was spectacular, and the second time was awful.  My husband and I showed up right as they were opening, and were immediately sat at the end of the bar on the left side.  Fine with us, because we like to watch the food being prepared.We are both foodies, and love to order many different things to try.  I think between the two of us we probably ordered about 7 dishes.  Some of them were small plates and some were not.  It was a busy night, and so it seemed that our dishes were coming out a bit slowly.  The head chef (owner perhaps?) was expediting dishes right in front of us the whole time--and occasionally chatting with us and the people around us, but I could tell he was busy.  I have no problem with that though.What I do have a problem with is when our last dish that we ordered (the Fat Noodles) never came.  Our plates had been cleared and we were just sitting there waiting for quite a while.  Finally the waitress behind the bar asked if we needed anything else.  I inquired about our noodles dish, and could immediately tell by the look on her face that she forgot about it.  So she went over and put the order into the computer quickly, and then went over and talked to the chef.  He then came over to me (my husband was in the bathroom at this point) and asked, in a somewhat condescending manner, what the problem was.  I told him there was no problem, that we were just waiting for our last dish.  He asked if we were from out of town, and I said no, that we actually live in the neighborhood.  He then, very rudely in my opinion, said that if we wanted to try more dishes that we could always come back another time.  My husband walked out of the bathroom at this moment, and asked me what was wrong (he said he could tell by the look on my face that something wasn't right).  I told him about the exchange that I had with the chef, and that I felt uncomfortable because I felt like he was obviously trying to get us out of there.  It seemed like all of a sudden we had overstayed our welcome.  By this point they were finishing up preparing the Fat Noodles dish, and I asked the waitress to just box it up so we could go. I also asked her for the check, and as soon as it came we paid it and left.I have to say, I've never had such an uncomfortable feeling in a restaurant before.  Our experience very quickly turned from good to horrible.  Its a shame too because I do like the food at Fat Rice, but I will probably never go there again because of the poor attitude I experienced from the person in charge there.  As a paying customer, especially one that regularly has a fairly high bill and that gives great tips, I don't think I should ever feel like I'm not wanted or unwelcome."
"Like some of the other reviewers whose names I recognize from Xmarx dinners, I've been enjoying Chefs Abe and Adrienne's food for years. I was thrilled to hear they were opening a restaurant in Logan Square. I'd have been there opening night had I been able to get child care. The kiddo is at grandma's tonight, so our first choice for Date Night was Fat Rice. The food was excellent. I expected nothing less from these folks. We started with some small bites: spicy garlic cucumber, smoky tofu, and sichuan eggplant. I'll confess that I'm not normally a fan of eggplant, but this stuff is tasty enough for me to get over that eggplant texture. The tofu was firm and had a mild smoky flavor. Next we tried the potstickers (delicious!) and the killer x.o. oyster. The oyster was served with vermicelli, and it was a little awkward to eat, but the flavor and presentation were great. We shared the fat noodle with mushroom and egg. Soooo good. Handmade noodles, flavorful mushrooms, and sauce that was just slightly spicy. The portion size was good--large enough to share between two people if you're not super hungry of if you're trying other menu items, but one hungry person could probably tackle this as well. Since Date Night doesn't happen often, we decided to go ahead and order way more food than necessary, so we also got the po kok gai (Portuguese chicken). The chicken thighs were tender and covered in slightly toasty coconut, the mussels were perfectly cooked, the potatoes and carrots were tender and also perfectly cooked, and the whole thing was served with a mild coconut curry sauce and coconut rice. This is definitely a dish to share. I'm too full to try to write more descriptively about the food, but it was all delicious. The service was great. We arrived right when they opened and were seated immediately (by the time we finished the restaurant was packed and there were a lot of people waiting--go early or plan on being patient). Our server got our drinks and put in our small plate orders while we looked over the menu more. The food arrived quickly, but not so fast that it all piled up. We definitely had time to talk and digest a bit between courses, but not so much time that we ever wondered where our food was. There are some small tables, but also seating at the bar and at communal tables. The tables and chairs are generously sized, so you shouldn't be crowded next to strangers at the communal tables. Also, make friends. We spent about $50 each including adult beverages, but could have done dinner a bit cheaper. Like I said, this was a special occasion for us, so we ordered more than necessary. Next time we go back we may not go so crazy. Still, it was well worth it. We will definitely be back."
"I am truly confused, like many other people it seems, why this place has gotten so much hype.  I don't mind waiting an hour and a half (even after being told it would be 45 minutes) for food that lives up to its reputation.  This did not.  Insanely over price for mediocre food that did not impress.  Bon Appetit made a real mistake here.  Skip it."
"Fat Rice was highly recommended by lots of friends. After checking out the menu on their website, however, I must admit I did not feel an urgency to go over there. The food all looked great and interesting, but the only photo of the restaurant is of the kitchen. I wasn't sure if it was more of a take-out place, or if it would be right for a nice dinner out, or what. Well, the space is actually REALLY NICE with a couple big communal tables and a few smaller ones and a bar overlooking the open kitchen. It's small and cozy and busy. I wouldn't mind coming on a busy night and waiting at the bar, even if I had to stand, because the beer list is really great and the energy is too.The menu is set up for sharing, which is perfect because we could not decide what to get -- everything looked so good. The Potstickers were the best I have ever had and came with a delicious bowl of garlic and spices that you have to mix with soy sauce. There was also a ghost pepper hot sauce that was so tasty and VERY spicy hot. I would be happy to spend an evening with beer and plate after plate of Potstickers.We also had the Fat Noodles with xo sauce. So delicious! And we got a clay pot filled with Cauliflower Curry which came with a bowl of coconut rice with toasted coconut flakes sprinkled on top. Everything was just perfect, and the service was outstanding."
"Wednesday evening perfection.  After two sips of a delicious, fizzy cocktail with a carnival sized straw, I wanted to try everything on the menu.  Fortunately our server gave me a judgmental glance and firmly told me not to be such a glutton.  Alas, we settled on perfectly flavored pot stickers,  pickled vegetables, shrimp, sweet and sour pork belly and coconut rice and...a carafe of Portuguese wine and  fine,maybe a cream cheese moose.  Judge all you want.  I want to go back tomorrow.  And maybe again for brunch on Sunday.  The service is perfect, the owners are passionate, hard working, innovative and clearly want you to want to come back for more.  And yes, the food is delicious."
"This really is as good as it gets. Amazing flavor packed and extremely unique food. These folks know how to really treat your mouth to a good time! Every bite will surprise you with just how much flavor is packed in. The food is a combination of Chinese and Portuguese food from the island of Macau (an Island off china that was colonized by Portugal, hence the combination). It has a lot of southeast asian influence so it may remind you of Thai or Vietnamese food more than Chinese food. The atmosphere is perfect. It's family style meals. You pick some dishes from several categories to make a complete meal and then you share everything, even the soups. The lighting is low. The tables are shared. There's interesting things to look at, but the space isn't ""busy"". You can sit at the bar to be close to the action, share a long table with other parties, or sit at a private table.The kitchen is visible from the dining room so you can see the kitchen staff hard at work making the delicious meals. The head chefs (Abe and Adrienne of X-Marx fame) of the restaurant are right there in the thick of it at every step. The wait staff are excellent, helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I walked by before they opened and the whole staff were gathered together to taste the new foods for the night. Later when we asked for opinions about various items, the server had real heartfelt opinions about what was great because she's had some of it! The adult sodas will really surprise you with their complex and subtle flavors. Check this place out soon! You can get seating now because it's new, they did a pretty soft opening, and people don't know about it yet. But soon it'll be jam packed all the time."
"My associate was not especially pleased with the offering of fruity teas from Rare Tea Sellers and to be honest they were pretty bland. As far as the actual food, everything was very good and very reasonably priced.  As is almost always the case when I frequent an Asian restaurant with my asian friends, I deferred the responsibility of ordering to them.  So I can't speak to any of the specific dishes, and even if I had personally ordered them, I'm not sure I'd really be able to offer any insights more than a caveman-like ""FOOD GOOD"", so I won't insult you with them now.They offer a wide variety of different ""pickles"" and they were all pretty good. But they were pickles.  Seems wrong to apply any amount of weight to a restaurants rating because of pickles."
"FINALLY tried this place the other night.  The place is small and cozy, and as someone else mentioned, seating is communal.  We had to wait around 35 min outside (just a note, the seating area outside is only for appetizers and drinks while you wait). One word to describe the entire wait/cooking staff: hipsters.  But, the service was good.  I personally didn't care for the appetizers as they were all really really salty (I did try the curry cuttlefish, which was pretty good -- albeit, still really salty). On to the main courses: we ordered the Portuguese soup, the macao shrimp, and the Portuguese chicken -- all were excellent.  My fave was definitely the Portuguese chicken (comes with mussels and the sauce is excellent!!!). They split up the menu into small, medium, and large dishes; and, they did a nice job of pacing the cooking and bringing out the dishes as we were finishing up each one.  Also, just a note: anything ordered under the ""large"" section is meant to be shared (serves 2).This place is a funny mix between somewhat fancy (in terms of food and price) and kind of ""hole-in-the-wall""y in terms of appearance.If you want to avoid a wait, maybe try calling ahead of time?  Have no clue if they take reservations though..."
"Don't hesitate to go here!  Ive been checking this place out for months prior to the opening and my wife took me here for my birthday last night.  We started with the small plate apps and got the pickled cucumbers, Peanuts and the smoked tofu, which is out of this world!  I've never had tofu with this taste and texture.  It was like smoked gouda cheese!  We ordered the Gourdo Salad and the Green veggies, both excellent.  And then there is the FAT RICE dish.....WOW.....a must order.  We wished it had more rice and made that recommendation to the owner when he came to see how we liked everything.  We ended the evening with their Bang Bang coffee and the upside down pineapple cake, which was delish!  The wait staff is really friendly and the owner is attentive and interested in feedback.  No doubt, this place will be a success....Can't wait to go back!"
"This may have been the best meal I've ever had and totally worth the price (about $30 for each person for us, with a drink each. $30 each is crazy extravagant for me, I only eat out at this price about twice a year, and this was completely worth it). The amazingly well-thought-out and uniquely put together ingredients burst in your mouth and made me incredibly happy, I almost cried.I went with some omnivores and I really appreciate they had a couple vegan items on the menu. This is a sharing format place and we shared and loved everything while I happily stuck to the two vegan choices. The four of us were stuffed to the gills on three large items and one medium item, and we had some left to take home as well. We got some amazing fried green tomatoes - perfectly crunchy, even slightly gooey outside, wonderfully sour and flavorful tomatoes inside - surrounded with two kinds of chili peppers and other things. The preserved lemon was amazing in combination! Also a curry with sponge tofu, okra, eggplant, chili peppers, etc. The sponge tofu soaked up the flavor so well. My omnivore friends loved all that but they also shared a couple chicken dishes (Portuguese style with mussels, etc, and a half chicken with african tomato peanut sauce, etc) and reported that it was amazing as well. It looked great!I thought the spice hotness was just right. It didn't get in the way of tasting everything, which I find is often the case with spicy hot food. Here, all flavors complimented each other amazingly and everything looked beautiful.I liked the atmosphere, classic old Chicago tin ceiling with Chinese decoration, and a nice calm but bustling vibe at the community tables. I would love to go back sometime, sit at the bar, and just watch the open kitchen cook to see how they ingeniously make the food.We had to wait about 45 minutes, but that was totally expected and worth it, and the  outside waiting area is cute and they bring you drinks. The waitstaff really knows about the food and they are really nice too.This is my new favorite restaurant for sure!"
"Hyped, overrated, overpriced, not worth the wait = proof gentrification and yuppie infestation is imminent for Logan Square.Went there on a Tuesday night. Hostess said it would be a half hour wait, we agreed then disclosed it could be 45 minutes but we could sit in their ""waiting room"" aka a storefront a building over on Diversey.This ""waiting room"" didn't even have seating available for us and served $5 bodega quality chicharrones- I'm not hating but the price was unforgivable. We finally were transferred to bar seating at the restaurant, mind you the music in the waiting room and restaurant was way too loud, not offering a decent conversation volume. That being said, our server was WAY too soft spoken for said environment.We ordered our two entrees (for a gross sum of $30) and she of course gave us a hesitant look as to say ""You're still going to be hungry...""The drinks were incredibly pricey for what they were, a glass of sangria with coke and a lemon wedge and rail white rum and juice. The spanish octopus came out, a disjointed attempt at paella with almost NO octopus in it.We then waited about 20 minutes for our Fat Noodles- the best entree we ate and by no means is that an accolade as its something you very well could had ordered at ANY chinese restaurant. The kitchen is incredibly slow and showcased in an open format, providing an opportunity for you to speculate to why your food is taking so long. So I waited with baited breath for our bill, of course it was over $70 which is ridiculous given the portions, leaving you with regret that you didn't patron that bistro with their prefix tuesday night special."
"You know those places that you hear about that have outrageous wait times because people love it?Fat Rice is one of those places. So knowing that puts the experience into perspective. We got there at 6:10 on a Saturday. (doors open at 6) and were greeted by a nice woman who kindly told us that we can put our name in and come back in 2.5 hours. Which actually works out because you can do a lot in 2.5 hours. We decided to hit up another Logan Square spot a couple of blocks away.  While there, we went through the back and forth of ""that is a ridiculous wait, lets bail on Fat Rice"" and ""I'm hungry, this place looks like they serve decent food. Let's just order something here"", but after some self control and a few cocktails, 2.5 hrs pass and we are back at Fat Rice being seated. GLAD WE TOUGHED IT OUT!The food was great.The pickled dishes we had were tasty. I especially liked the smoked tofu dish. Great way to start a meal. We also got the potstickers, house made sausage, fat noodle, and the bacon. This bacon dish is something else. It was super salty (in the good way) and had just the right amount of heat. My recommendation would to skip the large courses and just have a bunch of small and medium plates. The Portuguese and Asian fusion idea is a novel one. Why not get as mush variation as you can!!!!"
"I'm definitely a fan of this place. The staff was amazing, the food was amazing - had the XO noodles, and ordered two dishes off the daily menu (pan fried asparagus and lettuce tofu)."
GREAT food. Cool vibe. Feels like a NYC spot when you are in the place.
"We were a little disappointed after all these rave reviews. First time dinner visit on a Sunday night, just the two of us. We got seated at the bar right away. Liked the atmosphere, music, and the view of the kitchen. The staff was very friendly and really very helpful. We asked lots of questions as one of us eats vegetarian, and we decided on the Sweet and sour eggplant as a starter, Fat Noodles with omelette and mushrooms as a vegetarian dish, raba-raba, a stir fry of greens with mackerel chutney, and coconut rice. The eggplant was ok, but only very mildly sweet and sour, most of the taste seemed to be in the sauce, as if the eggplant had not been marinated for  long enough. There was a nice spicy punch to the peanuts, but the flavors did not come together. Would not order again. The fat noodles were really fat, tightly rolled cylinders of a slightly glutinous texture. They did not soak up much of the sauce, and therefore lacked taste. The sauce was not very flavorful, but slightly earthy, and reminded us of mushroom soy sauce. Avoid. The raba-raba was tasty, but the sauce was again rather salty. The mackerel chutney that apparently goes in leaves a bit of a fishy taste, which I liked, but overall the dish was unremarkable other than for its saltiness. The coconut rice, however, was delicious. I also liked the Spanish cider, a yeasty, refreshingly tangy drink with not a trace of the sweetness that many other ciders have. The total came to about $45 w/o tip. We came away unimpressed with flavor and value. Would come back for drinks, atmosphere, and the great service, though!"
"I was so excited to try this place after reading such great reviews, but it is incredibly hyped up. The food was mediocre - not terrible but also not great. For the most part, there was too much salt on nearly everything we tried. Server was attentive. We had no wait which was surprising as it was 7pm on a Thursday."
"Welcome to the neighborhood Fat Rice...with wide open arms!  I love this place!  Went about a week ago and am already thinking about the next time I go back.  In my mind, that's a sign of a great restaurant!Lots of really great asian flavors in all of their dishes but many were very unique and things I have never tried before.Things we tried:Pumpkin Soup - delicious and had a little nice spice kick to itCharlie's Peanuts- a really unique little pickled appetizerPot Stickers- might be the best I've ever had.  They also do a homemade crepe around them to finish it off! Fat rice noodle- Delicious noodles hereCoconut rice and a Rice Crispy for dessert.Our tummies left full and we were very happy about this really enjoyable meal.   I can't wait to go back!"
"Fat Rice is everything you want it to be: a hip, you-have-to-go-here rep, exotic, delicious cross-cultural cuisine and a casual, engaging environment. The price, however, is rather steep considering the portions, but you don't come to this place to save money.Check out my full review with pictures here:thebuckwheater.com/fat-r…"
"Food was ok, the wait was obscene and un apologetic.  Say...new hot place.....if you tell a group an hour and it takes two, comp something.  You're assuming you'll be popular forever, which is  of course, delusional."
this place in insanely good. customer service is top notch. flavors are amazing. this place completely RULES!
"Great overall experience.  Friendly service.  Interesting menu with a great variety.  Everything we ordered was excellent, from the pickles, potstickers (a must), noodles and clay pot stews.  Would definitely recommend if you want a different Asian experience.  Will definitely be back here!  Get there early as they don't take reservations and it fills up quite quickly."
"My friend and I had been wanting to try Fat Rice for the past few months, and last night we finally bit the bullet and trekked to Logan Square. Prior to heading to Fat Rice, I scoured Yelp to see what other patrons had to say about this establishment. After reading the mixed reviews and complaints of over hype I was quite nervous about the fate of our dinner...Well, I'm here to tell you Fat Rice did not disappoint. For such a popular restaurant, there was a relatively short wait and the waiting room proved to be adorable and served excellent spring rolls, so waiting was not painful at all. In fact, I thought it made our experience more unique. On to the food, Fat Rice combines eclectic flavors and is unlike anything else I've ever had. We had the eggplant, fat salad, Portuguese chicken, and fat noodle. All were sublime, I was particularly fond of the fat noodle...mostly because I love carbs. Our server was kind and attentive and the meal came out in perfect timing.The only qualm I had was that the seating at Fat Rice is very communal, like sitting on the person next to you's lap communal. But other than that I cannot complain. Hope to get back to Fat Rice soon, try it out for yourself!"
"The food was just o.k. and edible, but nothing more."
"It's tough whether to be super honest or not because the line to eat will only get longer...But to be honest, this place was fantastic! We tried the sichuan eggplant, smokey tofu, spicy garlic cucumber, bacalhau, fat noodles, portuguese chicken, and serradura.  It was all wonderful!  With a wonderful blend of textures and flavors, it was an awesome and filling party in my mouth!Our favorites were the fat noodles and the serradura - truly heavenly dessert!Can't wait to go back and try the more dishes :) P.S. we came 10-15 min before they opened after reading the tips and we were so happy we did because a long line was forming as soon as we were seated in the restaurant!"
"Do not go here if you want good service nor a dining experience. If the service here was up to par this place would be awesome! BUT it's not! From the moment we arrived the experience became less appealing. We were denied two seats at the bar bc they were ""reserved"" although they don't take reservations and there was no wait-list at the time. The flighty hostess finally realized we could sit there after great confusion. After she sat us we had to wait at least 10 min for 2 beers. Really you can't just greet us and take a quick order? Brutal! After the server insisted on us ordering everything and claiming she would space it out that would be the last we were spoken to til after eating our 4th course. Now they were really good at overlapping our courses, forgetting a course, taking away sauces that we needed as well as plates and drinks that weren't finished, not giving knifes for our chicken dish(I used a spoon and fork to cut chicken) and just as we were eating the 4th course we finally got a visit to see if everything was ok which at that time I had to bring it to her attention that we didn't get course 3. Our date night was a rushed 45 minute. I would consider this an upscale fast food restaurant."
"I don't get it.....the 5 star reviews, all the buzz, seems like much ado about SPICES that mask the flavor of the ingredients.  The food pacing was totally off.  We spent more time waiting for our food than eating it.  We tried the highly recommended Chili Clam and much of it was so tough it could not be chewed.  The twice baked bacon was also tough and disappointing.  Generally all the food was over spiced with the same hot pepper flavor.  The only thing that we ordered that was not spicy was the Salt cod, it reminded us of tuna salad.  Our waitress was attentive and the atmosphere was interestoing, but its my first and last visit."
"Awesome place but go in with your eyes open. You will wait 90minutes if you how up at a normal time (even during the week). They'll get you over to a nearby room/bar were you can relax and have a couple drinks. The food is amazing, an even better after a couple cocktails (very good) and the wait. Commit Ye evening to this culinary experience and you won't be disappointed."
