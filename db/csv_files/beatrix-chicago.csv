Beatrix
"Me and the girlfriend stopped by for breakfast during our quick visit to Chicago. We made sure to arrive promptly at 8am when their kitchen opens to avoid a long wait. Andrew was fantastic in helping me decide what to chose, and the girlfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts. She ordered the lemon pancakes with a latte and after some deliberation I ended up choosing the enchiladas with a fresh squeezed glass of OJ. Everything was fantastic - we wish we had more time in the city so we could return and try some of their other offerings!"
"Visited here for brunch.  The décor is nice and the vibe is trendy.  They have a nice brunch menu, including juices and drinks.  I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes with brown sugar bacon.  As many fellow yelpers have said, I'll agree: both were wonderful.  Pancakes were light and fantastic -- great lemon flavor but not overpowering and the bacon was hearty and really delicious.  They have a decent selection of baked goods and a coffee bar.  Restrooms are in the hotel.  As far as outdoor seating goes, they do have a few tables outside."
"Would do 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up.5 stars for service- our waiter was fantastic, as was the young woman training with him. They didn't rush my friend and I at all, as we were a little distracted since we hadn't seen each other in so long. They even sent us home with a little complimentary cinnamon roll, which was awesome, and that was probably the best thing I ate from there (although I just tried the frosting and gave the rest to my boyfriend).The food was a 3 I'd say. It was good, but nothing special, and the menu was very weird. It was a strange mix of dishes with no theme, and didn't seem seasonally relevant at all. There were very few ""breakfast/brunch basics"" I'd say, and most of it was some sort of sandwich. Portions were fine, but a little pricey in my opinion, for example, to get a small bowl of fresh fruit on the side.I had a WONDERFUL time with my friend, but the food was just not special."
"A fantastic dinner was had here at Beatrix!  Both my husband and I were thoroughly impressed with the food the kitchen (had to be the A team!) put out.We were seated in the bar area and requested one of the 2-seaters with the plush brown chairs.  Very comfortable.  After googling what it was, we opted for the tsukune (Japanese chicken meatballs) appetizer.  The texture of the meatball was kind of like a fishball, which was surprising to me, but nothing that stood in the way of the dish being quickly demolished. Husband was 100% happy with the pork shank entree: the portion size, the flavor, the speed at which the kitchen sent over our meal.  I was tickled pink with the size of my potato and escarole ravioli.  It was buttery, but not overly so, and you can be sure that ravioli is not store bought when it's literally the size of your face.  I would highly recommend this entree, and I may or may not have the honor of posting the first pic of the p&e ravioli on Yelp.Another note. If you order the potato and escarole ravioli, make sure you have atleast one of the following:- floss- a mirror- a dining companion who will tell you if/when you have a huge piece of escarole stuck in your teeth (not that I'm speaking from experience...)Totally worth venturing over here!  You won't be disappointed in the plethora of coffee and drink (alcoholic and non) options either.  I washed my meal down with a blueberry basil smash (+shot of gin), and it was so refreshing!"
"There are a plethora of Yelp reviews for brunch. So I tried and enjoyed that with my girls.On the other hand with the dinner scene, reviews appear scarce. So I arrived Tuesday night with slight skepticism. The quick-and-easy? I left with a new love to add to my list. First off, do something atypical and order a juice. Yes, it's dinner and you would like a douse of alcohol. Well, for just $6 more, you can turn that into a juice cocktail. I thought my blackberry and lychee lemonade was superb without the spike. Dinner mate across from me loved her virgin mango, orange, and pineapple nectar so much that she chugged two. Onto the ""second"" course, we ordered the fries, hummus, tsukune, and straight A salad for sharing. Most of them were good for sharing except for the tsukune which are coarse-ground chicken meatballs that came in four pieces. We just wanted to give it a try so we sliced each piece into halves. Don't let the chili-cilantro sauce throw you off because it's just a baby spice. The straight A salad caught me off guard and swooned me. With arugula, avocado, Asian pear, asiago, and almond, this was easily a pleasant start for the evening. Coming from a person who usually shies away from ordering salad, I see myself re-ordering this upon my return. It was simplicity done at its best. Main courses consisted of potato ravioli, pan-roasted sea bass, slow-braised short rib, skirt steak, and three caramelized pork shanks. It was a very lopsided party with lots of meat lovers. My short rib, ladled with balsamic steak sauce, was served in a rectangular block of lean meat with a thin layer of fat. Beneath the hot pile was a huge smear of mashed potatoes and on the side was a set of un-constructed salad with roasted romaine hearts and tomatoes. It was nothing complicated but everything that I wanted. The pork shank is huge with hints of fat scattered throughout, therefore it was especially tender and juicy. I liked it a little less than my short rib though. With the Michigan peaches, it was a tidbit sweet and I'm generally a savory person when it comes to entrees. I must also note Beatrix takes pleasure in bringing out the dishes at the same time. Two of the pork shanks were cold at the first cut and bite. We brought it to our server's attention and she immediately apologized for the mishap. With no questions asked, she took the pork shanks away and returned 10 minutes later with a set of fresh-made, well-glazed, and sizzling pork shanks. Cheers to top-notch service! (And for this, I gave Beatrix an extra star, therefore capping it at five.)Onto desserts, we skipped the pastry bar and focused on the menu offering. Among us, we shared the chia pudding, vanilla bean kulfi, and two slices of dark chocolate cake. Our server was kind enough to put a candle on the chocolate cake for our belated birthday boy. The cake was indeed as stated: tall, dark, and handsome. Dig your spoon deep into this flourless marvel of deliciousness and you will keep doing so until it's all gone. The kulfi, also known as Indian ice cream, is not to be neglected. The candied oranges and toasted pistachios were excellent complements. The ice cream itself is light by flavor but strong by physique. We almost resorted to using a steak knife to make it shareable. Nonetheless, I would order it and put my arms to work again. All in all, Beatrix is casual and buzzy. It's a good potential for hosting baby/bridal showers, out-of-town visitors, business dinners, girls' day/night out, etc. After trying both brunch and dinner, I must say the latter was much more charming and it won me over."
Came here for the second time and sat outside and had Jackie as our server. She made the experience the best! Brought my friend here for his birthday and she made it extra special. More of Chicago needs servers like her. Great recommendations for the mushroom burger and margarita!
"I stayed at the Aloft while visiting some friends in Chicago. I always stay at the W Lakeshore ( I have no clue why since their service and hotel is not that great) but saw this was $10 cheaper a night and noticed the location was absolutely divine. I've stayed at the Aloft before, but this is the first Aloft where I have seen an onsite restaurant. After a long morning and flight, I decided to try it out. Very busy but not uncomfortable. We had a seat right by the big open windows which was great. The food? I loved! Tasty, fresh and quickly made. I am surprised. I would come here even if I wasn't staying at the Aloft. The prices were good as well, no upmarket price just for being in a hotel.This place will make an ideal brunch setting!"
"This was the first restaurant my roommate and I visited when we moved to Chicago, on Easter Sunday 2014 for brunch... So it will always hold a special place in my heart. We (unknowingly at the time) actually dined next to Pat Quinn while he was governor and were wondering why people kept coming up to this man to shake his hand or take photos. Anyway, we finally returned last night and brought along my boyfriend after a show in Millenium Park.The place was packed but we had made a reservation so we sat down immediately. It was a few minutes before anyone came over to us but they were busy so it's all right. We ordered a couple beers and the habanero pineapple margarita, along with the tsukune appetizer and the burrata. My favorite was the burrata, served with some multigrain chips, an olive tapenade and halved cherry tomatoes. It was very light and fluffy and the saltiness of the tapenade complemented it well. The tsukune was okay, but just a small portion--4 tiny meatballs for the 3 of us to share. Pretty tasty though I would not order it again. We ordered the crispy kale salad, which I thought would be entirely kale but turned out to be fried kale mixed with regular greens. It also had dates, pistachios and papayas. Great combo for a summer salad. My boyfriend got the burger and didn't share any of it. He even got a little mad when I stole a bite of his kale side to compare with mine... So I know everything was good. I still want to try their nitro coffee to compare with ipsento. I'll probably eat here on my last day in Chicago before moving, just so everything comes full circle. Love this place, definitely check it out and go to one of the River North bars in the area afterward!"
"I recently stayed at the Aloft Hotel, and Beatrix is located on the first floor.  They do the room service for the hotel, but I thought I would get the full experience and meander down to the lobby and to the restaurant to give it a try.  It was definitely a happening location on a Sunday morning! It took a while to get seated because it was so busy and there's not a great place to wait given the space.  People were waiting wherever they could. When I did get seated, I was definitely taken care of.  I started off with a blue(berry) mimosa.   It was a delicious treat.  I got the quinoa cakes with poached eggs which came with a salsa. It was a light meal, but a perfect portion size. Service was quick, and made up for the wait. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"Wow! Beatrix is now one of my favorite places to eat in this area. I came after a long week of work to enjoy Friday afternoon and was so happy with everything. We started off with a couple of juices. The cucumber and mint soda was super light and refreshing and the carrot, apple, and ginger snap was something I felt was innovative, healthy, and delicious at the same time. It leans heavier towards the carrot, about 50%, and then maybe 35% towards the ginger snap but then you also get hints of the apple too. Loved it! We decided on sampling a few of their snacks since we had just recently finished lunch. The kennebec fries were great though I think I would have liked it with more potato inside the fries. My favorite part was actually the few slices of crispy lemons sprinkled on top and the delicious aioli with spices. The warm quinoa cakes were really delicious too - they were light, airy, and actually a great compliment to the heavier fries. My favorite snack was the tsukune (chicken meatball) with chili cilantro sauce. SO GOOD. YUMM! I wasn't able to taste the cilantro in the sauce so for those of you who have an aversion to cilantro, still give it a try! I wasn't hungry enough to get a bigger entree except for a bite of the chili and chocolate glazed salmon but I totally have my eye out for the mushroom quinoa burger on the next visit! Other non-food related points: The outside seating area is amazing on a nice low-wind day. Otherwise, they keep open windows even when you are sitting inside so you feel a small breeze. Our waitress was great; she was on top of filling our waters and asking if we needed anything else. Great experience overall."
"I know, I know, I know, Chicago is filled with great restaurants from the simple to fine dining.  Beatrix is middle of the road in affordability, yet, stellar in taste.  You can't go wrong no matter what you order.  We ended up eating at Beatrix three times on this visit, twice for breakfast, once for dinner.  The best pancakes you'll ever have are right here, the Fluffy Lemon pancakes.  It's sad, I'll never be able to eat other pancakes anywhere ever again since having these pancakes.  They are so light, so fluffy and dare I say it... so magical! These pancakes are so light, they literally disappear on your palate, yet leave the best taste behind. OMG, I must practice making these at home.For breakfast we also tried poached eggs over quinoa patties, a very hip and healthy version of eggs benedict.  These didn't disappoint either.  I also tried the chilaquiles - I grew up on this traditional Mexican dish and was nervous about ordering it.  But... it was better than Mom's home cooking!  How did they flavor those chips?! For dinner we had the Ahi tuna as an appetizer and the Chile/Chocolate Salmon.  Both were fresh and full of flavor.  I can't rave enough about Beatrix.  Every dish is healthy, flavorful and filling. A definite must stop while in Chicago. My goal is to try every dish on the menu."
"Came here for a Sunday brunch with my girlfriends while we were in town. This place screams Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Our waiter, Steve Z. (I think) was hilarious and talked way too fast for me and my friends to understand, not gonna lie...he was easy on the eyes, too.I had quinoa cakes with a poached egg which filled me up real quick. The spiked freddo was to dieeeee for!I'd definitely come back here and recommend to anyone who is visiting."
Um...SO TASTY!!!! Loved this place and EVERYTHING we ate. Can't wait to go back and enjoy some of the lunch menu.
"Stopped by at about 10:00am on Sunday for brunch, after finding out that the place we had initially planned on hitting didn't open until 11am. (Who doesn't open for brunch until 11???)Still, glad we ended up here. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, so happily settled outside the restaurant to pet the dogs walking by. However we were texted within 10 minutes that a table was ready. Yay!Our group ordered the Fluffy lemon pancakes, Morning bun and Quinoa cakes with poached eggs. They also have a great selection of morning beverages. We tried a few mimosas, lattes, and juices, and all were great. The food was fantastic, and everything was recommended. Do yourself a favour, since this place takes reservations, book yourself in here for brunch."
"The place: Even during a downpour at 8pm on a Saturday night, this place was packed to the brim. With reservations, we still had to wait 15 minutes, but were lucky to find 2 seats together at the bar. The servers and bartender we dealt with were great, but not extremely expeditious. Big open space was kinda cool, but ill be honest, I was mostly staring at my handsome date, so didn't take note of the decor too much.The taste: We were surprised with an appetizer on the house- the potato salad deviled eggs. Creamy and flavorful, but not something I would have ordered on my own. A little too rich for my blood. We shared the burrata (good, but I've had better at Eataly), the ahi tuna crudo (good, but did it stand out as something I need to go back and eat again?--no). And the short ribs (okay this was mostly what my date had, but he shared some and this was melt in your mouth good. Tender.... Still not sure if it's worth a return visit. I've had good short ribs in other places)My face: four cocktails between the two of us (all pretty great) and 2 snack plates and a short ribs entree probably brought us to $100 pre-tip, but I didn't pay and actually didn't even look at the bill. (Just did some math in my head). We didn't even consider dessert...I would have if my date didn't seem so delicious....and I don't think it was the cocktails that made me feel that way.So Beatrix is good. But I'm not sure I'd need to go back. I can probably find $12 cocktails somewhere else. Just a guess though...."
"Mid-winter, Beatrix was a blessing. The vibe of the space made it feel like you were dining in a garden.It was a wonderful breakfast with some fabulous ladies, the menu had enough variety and there was something for everyone, each meal was well prepared, and service was stellar.Enchiladas for breakfast is always a good choice - what came first, the chicken or the egg? In this case the egg. Scrambled, of course topped with salsa verde. I always prefer the savory option for breakfast but as a group we couldn't pass up the lemon pancake. It's was melty, lemony, fluffy goodness.The coffee was strong and regularly refilled as was the water. Overall, a blissful morning before we all left town. I'd be back in a heartbeat and a close walk to the Kinzie Hotel where I stayed."
"There's something about Beatrix. Every time I have an out-of-towner, I take them to Beatrix for brunch. I took my best friend from NYC to Beatrix. I took my mom from Seoul to Beatrix. We have group weekend brunches here with friends. My boyfriend and I went to Beatrix for Easter brunch. There's just something about it.It's always pretty busy and loud, I haven't seen Beatrix less than 60% full, ever. Walking in without a reservation will result in a moderate wait time. If you're like me and wish to avoid that, make a reservation. Opentable makes it simple.The tables are sufficiently large and fit for big groups. There are smaller tables for smaller groups / couples, too. The place itself is quite large, but they've packed a bunch of tables in that space so you may knock into someone's chair or bag at any given time. Despite the commotion, Beatrix guests are usually pretty happy to be there.There's a LOT OF SUNLIGHT! My favorite part about Beatrix is on sunny days, they'll open the patio and let natural air and light permeate the room, and I don't know who their brilliant engineer must have been, but the restaurant glows. Coupled with Michael Jackson tracks they often have playing on loop, it becomes a lively atmosphere perfect for weekend brunch. Additional note: they display a huge candid photograph of Jagger (pictured) on one of the walls that I think adds to the ambiance.In terms of food, I like their quinoa cake, the chimichurri, the prime burger, the hummus. The cocktails with fresh juice is great. I had a blueberry champagne once, that was delicious. For dessert I always get a cup of cappuccino (I think La Colombe supplies their coffee) as a meal-ender, palate-cleanser, etc."
"Still dreaming about the ""ginger snap"" juice. A fresh blend of carrots, ginger and apples. The most refreshing way to kick the day off! Brilliant ingredient combo.The party continued with the quinoa cakes topped with eggs Benedict and an herb puree. Not only was it guilt-free but packed with flavor. Oh! And for those of us who can never decide if we want to go full on sweet or savory, order the lemon ricotta pancake with lemon syrup as an appetizer for the table. You'll have one and want another. I guarantee it. Last note, this place is huge. Perfect for groups. The bakery and coffee shop counter also make it a great pit stop for those of us who fly solo on the regular with a work laptop in tow. Stop reading and call in for a reservation!"
"It's a Lettuce Entertain You place. Yay, because I love getting my points. There is somewhat of a ""very good"" commonality among most of their member restaurants, but something almost always amiss. I had steak and eggs and a something or other very green, very healthy and very delicious juice. The steak was good, although the chimichurri wasn't spicy at all where I felt it should be. The hash browns were a bit greasy, but I was happy with the juice so it made up for everything that wasn't quite where I wanted. Overall it's a fun place to come with friends with an energetic atmosphere. Not a place for an intimate and romantic date, but a great place to socialize. Definitely going back to try some other things.PS. The avocado toast is totally overrated. Needs a sprinkle of garlic instead of the chili (and this is coming from a person who loves spicy)"
"We actually came here just for dessert and discovered that they also offer Bulletproof coffee!! We had to come.Two desserts: Apple Strudel and a Caramel Mousse Pie. The Caramel Mouse Pie pairs REALLY well with the Bulletproof coffee. The Apple Strudel was good also.Coffee: They serve both Intelligentsia and Metropolis beans, and you get an option to pic which bean you want. Their Bulletproof coffee was pretty decent, lighter than I expected.We had a fantastic server. I would definitely want to come back for dinner.FYI - For those that get rewards points, this is a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant."
"Really pleased with this one folks. Showed up 20 mins late to our dinner rez the night of the Blackhawks Stanley Cup parade, still sat down immediately. Didn't like our table so we asked for one closer to the window. ""Whatever you like, as long as your happy."" Was the response.Waiter super knowledgeable about menu. Drinks and apps came out suuuper fast. Main course came out a minute or two after we were done with apps. Got the prime burger and Kale salad. Shared both with girlfriend. With the two apps, this was the perfect meal size. Gave water bottle at table so we could refill ours as we pleased. I HATE when I'm at a restaurant and waiting for the server to come back so I can ask for water. This place eliminated that issue.Krispy kale salad could use slightly more kale imo. Figs and papaya were great additions to break up the natural tart flavor of the kale. The burger was solid. Added avocado to make it nice and rich.Cherry chia juice was interesting. I've never had chia seeds so I was caught off guard with the consistency. My lady's cocktails were on point though, apparently. Apple strudel for desert was really really good. I love apple things and this was a top tier apple thing.Would go again to try their brunch."
"Loved this place! Had a fun, fancy girls-night-out here. The cocktails feature their fresh-squeezed juices. I tried the Blueberry Tom Collins which was delightfully tangy. For dinner, I had the special which was a vegetarian quinoa chili bowl, and I savored every bite. We shared two desserts: chocolate cake and caramel pie. All of us agreed that the caramel pie was the clear winner. Not sure how they keep the caramel filling so light yet so creamy, but it was heavenly."
"A solid choice for breakfast and business lunches.   If you're up for a big awesome breakfast, the Chicken Tinga is really flavorful. And if you need something f lighter, the juices and baked stuff are all tasty."
"Great restaurant, especially for breakfast/brunch! We had breakfast here twice and both times it was exceptional. Also the bartenders are A-team and make some really great specialty cocktails- see Jake when you are here- he rocks! Also they have house made pastries that are to die for....and if bulletproof coffee is your thing, they carry that too! Oh as well as fresh pressed juices!"
"The wife surprised me with a trip here.  The dining room was really lively, I enjoyed the atmosphere. Since it was brunch we got some lattes.  They have a few nice flavor combinations. Honey and cinnamon was one banana and dark chocolate was the other.  They even put those designs in the foam I always see.  As far as the food my wife got these light and fluffy pancakes.  They were pretty amazing. Stuffed with ricotta cheese they were nothing like the dry bland pancakes I've gotten at some breakfast places.  I ordered the chilaquile bar.  I've never seen this before and I love chilaquiles. They give you a plate and you fill it up with these slightly soft tortilla chips in salsa and eggs with shredded chicken.  Then you add guac Salas sour cream and cheese.  Boom, best chilaquile I've had in a while.  I kinda regret not getting the caramel pie but I might need to walk in a get a slice sometime."
"The brunch was pretty good.  Nothing was mind-blowing, but everything was tasty.  We had the steak and eggs, pancakes, French toast, pot roast and eggs sandwich, and yogurt.  Cocktails were good, but beware- the Sangrita is not really a Sangrita, it is their own concoction.  Coffee is great.Overall, a decent place for brunch if you are not in a rush."
"Beatrix, oh how I love you. Thank you for a truly unforgettable brunch. Love the whimsical interior. The staff was fairly friendly and helpful. At first glance, I thought the menu was limited and nothing really piqued my interest, so I randomly decided on the  light and fluffy lemon pancakes with a side of brown sugar bacon. Wow! Those pancakes exceeded my expectations. Just the right amount of lemon flavor. I've never had pancakes so delicious and light. The brown sugar bacon wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, but I loved it nonetheless. The chia cherry chiller was pretty good at first, but after a few sips I tired of all of the chia seeds. With less seeds it would have been better. I ordered a cinnamon roll to go. I can't believe the cinnamon roll made it the entire 3 plus hour drive to Indianapolis.  When I got home I dug in. Thank you dessert gods for this heavenly creation. I'm not a big fan of cinnamon rolls, but this roll rocked my world. Undoubtedly the best. I will be traveling to Chicago soon and a visit to Beatrix is a must. Pancakes and cinnamon roll are a MUST. Thank you Beatrix. Don't ever change and I will love you for life."
"The food was great and the atmosphere is cozy but trendy! I came here with a group in July and the staff was very accomodating. The only downfall is the periodic wiff of city sewer scent through the open windows. It might a coincidence and perfect storm of the wind patterns, humidity, and scent levels of Chicago that weekend... So I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt!"
"This review is only for the caramel pie. We had dinner somewhere else and came solely for the pie. The flavor was there but the pie itself was lacking something special. It was just a plain caramel pie that I was expecting for something to really win me over. I was definitely underwhelmed. I'm a fan of melted caramel so I was expecting good caramel pie. The piece of pie wasn't soft, it was frozen hard once you get pass the smaller end of the pie. The homemade whip cream stood out more than the pie and that's not a good sign. It's like Robin out shining Batman and that just cant happen! The sidekick can't outshine the star. I came for the delicious caramel pie so it should stand out."
"lots of reviews here for brunch/breakfast but a froworker and i came here for dinner. love love love.first of all, the place looks gorgeouss. if a hipster coffeehouse/juicebar had a baby with a classy farm-to-table joint, this would be it. the place feels invitingly warm and cool at the same time. secondly, the cocktail i had was amazing. fresh blackberry lychee lemonade mixed with tito's vodka and st. germain. it was beautiful and so tasty. i took a sip of the blueberry tom collins too, which was also delicious but not quite as amazing as the blackberry lemon drop, in my opinion. if you love gin, you may prefer it though.honestly i could've been fully five-stars satisfied with a meal of cocktails alone. but i did eat the spring pea soup and ""straight a salad"" which had arugula, asian pears, almonds, avocado and asiago. both dishes were solid and actually pretty filling. we noted that there are lots of paleo-friendly options on the menu too.for dessert, i heard rumors about the caramel pie so we gave it a go, and while my first bite felt like ""what, that's it?"" but with each bite, the flavors started growing on me. or maybe it was the alkerhall. in any case, this place was awesome. the price point is not even all that expensive, considering the quality of the fare. color me a very satisfied chitown tourist."
"This place is a complete surprise. Came here as a walk in on a Friday night. No wait. Was not expecting much given this is a hotel restaurant that I had never heard of. And the food was awesome.I would recommend everything we had. Esp the beet salad with pistachio pesto. I had the spaghetti squash, delish. Nice modern vibe. Stopped by the pastry counter on our way out to pick up some pastries to go, they have awesome cookies including a salted Carmel and vegan chocolate chip. And of course like everyone else says....you have to have the Caramel pie. I'll be back just for that. I Can't wait to try brunch. I also recommend their juices, which they will happily add a shot of whatever alcohol you like."
"Looks like a great menu! The restaurant was very crowded, but the hostess didn't acknowledge me at all. I think despite how good the menu looks great the service could use a bit of polish."
"Went there the other night with a friend for dinner and the food was fantastic.  I'm gluten free and since they are a lettuce entertain restaurant they had a great gf menu and our waitress really knew the food allergies well.  I had the salmon and it was great, hummus for an appetizer and they even had a pudding for dessert.  Great meal, reasonably priced a great service.  I will absolutely return.  My friend lives close by and goes all the time, if I lived close by I would go there often too."
"OK I can't quite remember what we ordered for our dinner, but the DESSERT. oh. em. gee. Sorry that I have such a horrible memory, but I definitely remember the caramel pie. WOW. Caramel crack pie!!! It's seriously the BEST pie I've had in my life. The filling wasn't too dense or too sweet, it was the most perfect, decadent and sinful dessert that I've ever had. If you come here for dinner, make sure you leave room for this baby!"
"My cousin who lives in Chicago made us brunch reservations here during our long weekend trip because it is one of her favorite spots. I did enjoy my experience, and I like the concept of the restaurant, but I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out on some of the other exciting food choices Chicago has to offer. They sell a lot of ""healthier, lighter"" brunch options, which is cool, but I didn't see anything extra special or unique on the menu. One drink which I've never seen before which is kinda crazy is the bulletproof coffee- made with butter.... I was skeptical that it was actually better than regular coffee at $9 per cup, and I honestly couldn't taste a difference, but hey maybe you coffee connoisseurs out there will.I chose the Caesar salad for my meal, and others in the group chose the veggie omelet and the pancakes. All were good, but nothing too special in my opinion. If you're a Chicago local, I would recommend checking this place out! If you're traveling for a short time though, I would try one of the most decadent dining options Chicago has to offer. Because it's just not right to eat ""healthy"" food when you're on vacation :)"
Great brunch spot with awesome service! Our server made great recommendations and was personable
"Divine!  Absolutely blown away by everything!Beatrix really does go above and beyond in their service and food, which was clearly shown during my dinner on February 13, 2015.  We had gone around 6:00pm and the ambiance here during the dinner time is much more romantic and intimate than during the brunch.  The lights dimmed low and flickering faux candles at each table makes this lofted restaurant space feel like you and your table are the only people there.  Groups of girlfriends and couples alike surrounded us, and even when the restaurant became really full (around 7:30pm), the noise level never got intolerable where you couldn't hear the person sitting directly next to you.I had ordered the Chicken Bebe as my main entree and my boyfriend ordered the Prime Burger.  The Chicken Bebe was incredibly flavorful and well crusted.  It's served on a bed of what tasted like a lemon cream sauce, and topped with tender asparagus and baby radish greens.  There's a wedge of lemon on the side to squeeze on top if you'd like, and I highly recommend.  If you've ever had Greek Saganaki cheese (which I love), the chicken crusted in cheese with fresh squeezed lemon had a reminiscent taste of that Saganaki cheese.  The Prime Burger was ordered with bacon and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I absolutely loved the bite my boyfriend offered to share.  Only a bite though.  He was very stern on that.  It was that good.  The beef patty was perfectly season, the sweet candied bacon against the tangy housemade giardiniera gave the burger a nice crunch.  Umami is a great word to describe the flavors happening in their Prime Burger.The Dessert is the best part!  I should've mentioned that first.  The Oh My! Caramel Pie is dreamy!!!  If heaven could be described in a forkful, you'd find it in this Caramel Pie.  Shortbread cookie crust... sweet buttery caramel... served with their homemade vanilla bean whip cream.  I would've skipped dinner to have the whole slice to myself.    We also had the Tall, Dark and Handsome Chocolate cake.  It's base is dark, flourless chocolate cake... topped with a chocolate mousse.  A bit more dense than a mousse I think.. sort of an in between and a ganache.  Superb!  The dark chocolate makes this rich dessert not so nauseatingly rich like milk chocolate could.  A perfect bite to cleanse the palate of your dinner.Great food makes a good restaurant.  What makes a great restaurant is their service, and Beatrix really showcases how they take care of their guests.  You do feel like a guest, rather than any other bar patron.  Our server never rushed us along our meal, or forced the check upon us to get us out of our table.  The manager Steven also made a point to stop by our table and see how our meal was and made excellent recommendations on the dessert.  I thank him for my new vice; the Oh My! Caramel Pie. Delicious and all around a beautiful meal.  It made my birthday weekend very memorable."
Two thumbs up! Stayed at the Aloft and had both cocktails and brunch. For brunch we had a buffet for a family gathering and the space is very accommodating for a large group even though it doesn't look it. The food was amazing! The bacon... I highly recommend checking this place out.
Came here for our last breakfast before leaving Chicago. It's open really early for just coffee and pastries and regular breakfast opens an hour after that. Some of the tables use couches for seating which is cool but we opted for a window seat. The staff there are very friendly. The menu is small but the food looks and sounds delicious. The steak chimichurri was tender and full of flavor. I also got a chocolate almond croissant after the meal to go. The filling was so good and the powered sugar and numerous almonds topping it was a great addition.
"Beatrix has become my ""go to"" place if my guest and I don't know where to go.  Many times, my guest has not been here before.   This time, I brought my friend, CJ.  We had met around 2:00pm, so the restaurant was just finishing the lunch crowd.  We were seated in the bar area.  Mark, bartender, met us and went over the specials including the menu for Restaurant Week (RW).  Mark is very personable and is able to read each of his tables while still maintain the bar.  Great employee!!Both of us opted to try one of the RW's menu.  We had both ordered the Butternut and Apple Soup, then I had ordered the Pot Roast Sandwich and CJ ordered the Three Grain Salad.  Each course was brought to us in the appropriate amount of time.  Of course, Mark would check in with us without being a bothersome.  For dessert, I had picked the Chocolate Cake and CJ had ordered the Caramel Pie.  Both desserts were incredible.  I usually order the Apple Strudel (creature of habit).  Without any hesitation, check out this restaurant!  I'm looking forward to return, if Mark is there.... I'll sit in his section."
"This review is for BREAKFAST:Decor/Cleanliness/Environment - I bought to-go bakeries, but the restaurant seems like a perfect place to take your significant other for a date or your friends for a group meal.  (1/1)Service:  The waitress at the bakery is very attentive and fast (I dont remember her name, but I have seen her twice at the bakery section so I think she is there all the time).  If you are buying goods for the party, just tell her so.  She knows what to do.  (1/1)Food:  The pastries here are ahhhhh-mazing!  bought them for my preceptor since today is the last day of my rotation site.  My preceptor loves them and finished all (i bought her 5) in less than 2 hours -_-  my favorite pastry in that bakery is croissant.  There are two types of croissant, and I love them both.  try it!  my preceptor loves their cinnamon coffee cake muffin (gluten free).  If you don't like sweet, then get the bran muffin or zucchini muffin.  if you have a sweet tooth, try them all! LOL (2/2)Cost: range from $2-$4 each.  I think it's about the same price as pastries at starbucks.  I prefer these than starbucks one.  (1/1)"
"For one of my last brunches before leaving Chicago, my friends and I decided to meet here on Sunday. I have been dying to try Beatrix because I heard so many great things about it. I was not disappointed. We had a lovely time first at the bar, where I enjoyed a perfectly spicy Bloody Mary made by a very cute Asian bartender. Hey cutie!The brunch was to celebrate my impending relocation to California. I want to enjoy all of the places I've been meaning to visit before I have to leave. I ordered the pot roast and egg sandwich, which was genius. I can't believe I've never thought of making this at home, but I'm going to now. The ciabatta was warm and fluffy, the pot roast was flavorful and melted in your mouth. Damn it was good.My girlfriend got the chilaquiles buffet bar and shared with the rest of the table. Tortilla chips, guac, chicken, egg, sour cream, cheese, all of the good fixins to cure any hangover. They were delicious and abundant. I need to implement a chilaquiles buffet in my own home every weekend, pretty much.And our other friend ordered the Beatrix take on steak and eggs, which was also really good. All of the portion sizes were spot on. You didn't feel like a heifer after leaving the place. You just felt very satisfied. We also partook in some of the libations, including the red mimosa (with fresh pureed strawberry juice), the blue mimosa (with fresh pureed blueberry juice), the cherry mojito which tasted like an adult cherry limeade, and the tequila sunrise. All in all, a very satisfying grown up brunch. I loved every bite and hopefully I'll be able to enjoy it again when I'm back visiting Chicago!"
They are good for breakfast brunch lunch and dinnerThe food is very tastyUnique flavours
"We were impressed with Beatrix - it is definitely not your standard hotel restaurant.Located inside the Aloft, Beatrix has great food and excellent service.My husband and I are staying at the Aloft and came for Friday morning brunch.  My husband enjoyed his spicy chicken tinga, which was flavorful and unique.  I originally ordered the shashouka, but it was far too spicy for me (I was told the dish isn't normally that spicy and may have been accidentally over seasoned).  Fortunately, the waiter was very accommodating, service-oriented, and understanding, and swapped out my dish for something else.  I then got the quinoa cakes, which were delicious.Our waiter was truly fabulous, and we were pleased with our experience overall."
Friendly bartender! Only went in for a nightcap but the cocktail was crafted to perfection with blueberry and gin. Definitely worth a try!Favorite part was the variety of seating options. Give me vintage leather furniture any day :)
"I rarely find a restaurant that merits five stars, but this place is, all around, awesome. And as a visitor to Chicago, it was a relief to find a place like this. The hostess were welcoming and nice, got us seated quickly. Our server, Anna, was very attentive and sweet. She was one of the bet servers I've ever had. It doesn't take a lot to be a good server, but so few people are professional and nice while they do it. The food was very good as well. I highly recommend trying a fruit juice. The mango was an excellent choice. Pricey (6$ for non-alcohol) , but worth trying.And the atmosphere was very unique and very well kept. Clean and fun environment. Five stars!"
"Food terrific! Service lame. My server was largely absent from my table -- until it was time to pay, and then, boy was he quick.I came for a breakfast and was very pleased with the menu, which has a nice balance of traditional breakfasts with more trendy / healthy options. Their poached eggs are presented nicely, without the dreaded ""puddle of water"" that accompanies most version of this. I will be trying to recreate their ""quinoa cakes"" at home - they were pretty delish.I also had one of their green juices and it was pretty much perfect. Also, I am a tea snob, and their tea preparation was nearly perfect. They bring an infuser to the table. The infuser is sized so that, after you pour yourself one cub, the tea leaves are still hanging in the water, potentially making the tea gradually more and more bitter, depending on what you are drinking. So, that's a shame in terms of aesthetics and functionality. Also, they never offered me more hot water for a second pot. But, the water was the right temperature, and, the didn't bring it to the table until it had sufficiently brewed."
"I love kids' books; so Beatrix has been on my list for a visit for a while. Turns out that the name for this Lettuce Entertain You establishment was generated from Richard Melman's mother's name, Bea. Nonetheless, this place is a playground of good food.I was fortunate to go to a cooking demo by one of the chefs some time ago. It was then that I decided that I had to go, and when my sister and niece came visiting from the 'burbs, we made a reservation for lunch. (A reservation! Can you believe it?)The room is fantastic, with a nice bar where you can also order pastries to go: some sweet enough for a child, others sophisticated enough to share on a romantic date. Unfortunately, at least for lunch, the music was too loud for romance. Then again, on a Friday, we were surrounded by people there with their work colleagues, and whether or not they were trying to be discreet, I could not tell.They have a wonderful selection of juices, and each of us had the blackberry and lychee lemonade. It was delicious, even with the lemon toned-down in the mix.My sister got a burger; my niece and I each got the pot roast sandwich. But the first things we sampled were the fries. Crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside, perfectly seasoned--definitely among the best I've had in the city. The entrees were mixed, however. My sister loved her burger, and it was still juicy despite her aversion to even a little pink in the temperature. (A crime indeed). While the pot roast sandwich was delicious, and came with ample, tasty horseradish, the meat was not ample. I ate through half of the sandwich only tasting bun. That was a big disappointment.We shared the chocolate coffeecake (truly decadent--I don't think I could have eaten a whole piece myself) and a lemon angel food muffin. My favorite part of angel food cake is the brown, crusty bits that some places cut off, but this cake proudly flaunted them.If I had had a different dish (including the one that was demoed at the demo), this would be a four-star review; but the scrimping on the roast and the loudness of the noise limits Beatrix to ""A-OK"" in Yelp-o-Meter."
"Everything  was amazing,  party of five,  turkey  meatloaf,  sea bass, chicken  bebe, short rib, Cesar  salad with Grant as the server!  You must try the 'Wow,  Ginger Sangria ""...how completely chill -fab!!"
"Service was excellent, food was very tasty (we ordered triple a salad, skirt steak and veggie chili which was a special) drink menu was very good and they carry a variety of smaller local brews.Menu is somewhat limited but apparently changes seasonly so it looks like they use fresh seasonal ingredients. Would recommend making a reservation if you are visiting on Friday or Saturday night."
"It is always a delight to dine at Beatrix. I was introduced to this gem by my brother and sister-in-law. The menu was described as unique and experimental - as such, I was eager in anticipation to try it out.My first visit was during the heart of summer 2014. With an inviting ambiance, marked by plenty of natural light, it felt both casual and trendy. Upon being seated, we noted small water drops falling from above our heads. While we did not mind, as we were excited about brunch and the shockingly amazing Chicago weather that day, Beatrix went well beyond expectation to remedy a trivial blemish on our experience. First, we were moved to another table. Second, our waiter tended to us with a passion to right a wrong (no one's fault!) and even brought it to the attention of the wonderful manager, John, who personally came over to our table to apologize. Finally, telling of this gem's intrinsic hospitality, we received complementary pastries and coffee with our brunch.Due to this hospitality, and of course the phenomenal menu items, I took a friend from out of town to brunch here. John and the team remembered us and treated us like family. We enjoyed the pecan crusted french toast [so delicate and rich], on the house.First timers should try the light and fluffy lemon pancakes [true to the name] and the quinoa cakes with poached eggs.I am looking forward to spending my summer frequenting this spot!"
"YUM! A group of us were staying at the Aloft and this happened to be the restaurant in the hotel.  We had a really early flight on Friday morning and we were starving and ready for a good meal when we arrived.  We decided to have breakfast here since it was convenient.  It ended up being one of the best breakfast experiences I've ever had.  I had a strawberry mimosa and the 2 eggs poached which came with bacon, whole grain toast, and home fries..so delicious! There were 9 of us and everyone really enjoyed their food.We then had an impromptu dinner the following night after a long day.  We ordered the deviled eggs and hummus to start, then I had the prime burger with cheddar which again was so delicious!Both servers were friendly and the food came out in a good amount of time.  I can't say I plan to be back in Chicago but if I ever do happen to pay the Windy City another visit, I will absolutely be back at Beatrix, hopefully to eat outside!"
"Lively is the best way to describe Beatrix. This trendy spot opening off the lobby of the equally trendy aLoft hotel is bustling with business. If you're looking for a quiet dinner for two, this isn't the place. But if you like a clamorous atmosphere and thoughtful small plates, this is a good choice.Everything we sampled was good. The standout was a special, Bulgogi chicken. We also really enjoyed the Caesar salad, which was more finely chopped than usual and had a delicious dressing.The wine and beer offerings seemed a bit limited to me for this type of restaurant, but there are some excellent juices and drinks based upon juices. I particularly liked the whiskey sour made with fresh lemon juice.Service was extremely knowledgable and friendly. If only it weren't quite so lively!"
"Great spot for dinner with colleagues. The restaurant is a big open space with great views for every table. The food is American cuisine made with healthy ingredients. I enjoyed the skirt steak cooked medium served w/garlic cream sauce. For dessert, I recommend the homemade chocolate chip cookies. Reservations are not required but highly recommended, this place fills up fast. At 6pm on a Wednesday night the wait was already 1.5 hours."
"Update- While I LOVE breakfast here, the dinner is definitely not as impressive. - server was too busy to chat, provide reco, or say anything but ""are you ready?""- hair in my Cesar salad- hummus was bland - chicken Bebe my husband got was totally flavorless- just cheesy, greasy, and gross - turkey meatloaf my friend got just OK- skirt steak was just alright- not very flavorful- disappointing chimmichuri- and the fries were super greasy and nothing special Was great that we got in no wait, but I'll only be here for breakfast from now on."
"Such a great restaurant. It was our last day in Chicago so a small group of us walked over during lunch to grab a quick lunch.  The dining area is a good size. The menu offers salads, sandwiches, burgers and fun small plates such as amazing hummus. Our server was very attentive and we ordered quickly so we could get back to our seminar. Very clean inside. The salads are a nice size, super fresh ingredients, and quite tasty. All of our dishes were excellent. This place is great  for health conscious people as they offer great quality and a nice variety of low calorie options.  The prices for lunch were reasonable for the quality of food. Service was great. Awesome place for a lovely healthy meal."
"We started with the deviled eggs, tuna and fries. Of the bunch, I could have done without the fries; they were nothing special. As for our entrees, we ordered the meatloaf, the salmon and the pork shank. All three were delicious but I must admit that the meatloaf lacked loads of salt. Finally, for dessert we ordered cookies and received a complimentary pumpkin pie from our waiter. Overall great experience at Beatrix. I will be back."
"I wanted to like this place because the flavor of their crispy kale salad was amazing with all the textures from the papaya, cheese and mixed greens... Sadly, I bit really hard into a date and there was an entire pit in it. Beatrix needs to pit their dates, makes me think that their food prep is sloppy and unrefined! Glad I didn't give this to my toddler. Next, my burger bun was burnt and every bite kept giving me this vile charcoal taste in my mouth.. The server didn't ask us how our food was and I was too hungry to say anything, so I just peeled off most of the bun and burnt burger as much as I could.  Plus we had a baby with us so we didn't want to wait even more.  I regret not ordering something else, my boyfriend seemed to be okay with his chocolate salmon. Lastly, they wouldn't let us sit in an unreserved booth table because we didn't have a large enough party but we came early before the dinner crowd piled in. We went in, ate our dinner and no one occupied the table we wanted to sit at. Hmmm. Thanks for being accommodating Beatrix. At least our waitress was friendly enough.  There's too many good places in Chicago, this one seems like they're pretending to be something that they're not.."
"My daughters and I recently visited Chicago and found Beatrix in Yelp. We were seated for brunch and had many questions due to a few dietary restrictions. You know you're in the right place when the waitstaff has commanding knowledge of the menu and the kitchen prep. We were so grateful to have Emma as our waitstaff. She made excellent recommendations and was well versed on how the kitchen operates using separate surfaces. Any time staff has worked their way through a menu and knows the importance of important details, you have a winner. Emma's recommendations were spot on and all items were delicious! The fresh squeezed Blue Boost really got my attention with the hint of basil! We were so pleased with brunch on Saturday, we made a repeat visit on Sunday having apple cake and coffee. Ps. Don't try to drop in for brunch without a reservation. It looked like a long wait."
"We've dined here several times over the past year when staying at the hotel and I've rarely been disappointed. The food is hearty and fairly diverse for a small menu, and the dessert and drinks finish an evening well. I enjoy the Tall Dark and Handsome chocolate cake and also (but not alongside - I'm hearing a chocolate cake and grapefruit Cosby sketch in my head) a habanero margarita. Ask for a standard rather than a pineapple with a touch of the spicy bitters. The neatloaf with kale is a nice healthier option and their steak with chimichurri has always been a great end to a day. But beyond all of this is the pastry case. You have to see it to appreciate it but it will blow you away. The cookies, too, do not disappoint. Minus 1 star for an often sparse staff in reaching dining tables, leading to a longer dining and service experience. Never had an issue in the bar area, however. Sit on the edge near the windows when it's warm enough to enjoy outside air!"
"awesome:the caramel pie: it's sooooo goooood. careful not to become diabetic after a bite.the good:-The cocktails with fresh juice is pretty good. the pineapple habanero was not a let down. -Service was hospitable and provided nice recommendations-the pork shank was fall of the bone tender and the portion was easy to share.-the short rib was fall of the bone tender. the brussels sprouts seems a bit undercooked but everything else was good-the chicken meatballs with the yogurt was sauce was flavorful and tender. not spectacular but still good enough to share 5 meatballs. the eh:-The A+ salad was nothing to write home about. we just needed some veggies to cut the amount meat we ordered-though, in general, the menu uses ingredients for a healthy meal, it was still doused with flavorful amount of oil on the veggies...how else can you make it veggies taste good at a restaurant right (?)."
"No one wants to wake up early on vacation. So not waking up early is exactly what I did. Unfortunately Yolk, the popular local brunch place I was super excited to go to, did not agree with my idea of sleeping in. As a result I had to look up a Plan B and ultimately ended up here at Beatrix. To our dismay we ended up sitting down and realizing that we had missed brunch completely as we stared in confusion at the pricey dinner menu. Beatrix did not disappoint though.We started off with their hummus appetizer ($7) which came with vegetables and warm naan. This was a great starter, hearty and full of flavor. For our entrée, we shared the three grain and arugula salad with Miller Farm's chicken ($14). We told our waitress we were sharing it and the chefs were nice enough to split it into two separate plates for us. It must've been a huge salad because even after they split it, our plates looked like they were a normal serving size. The salad had freekeh, millet, red quinoa, fennel, and blueberries which added a subtle sweetness to the dish. All the ingredients were fresh and went well together with the house vinaigrette. I'd highly recommend this salad for anyone looking for a healthy dish.Overall, awesome casual atmosphere. The staff were nice and attentive. I went at an odd time, but I could definitely see this place easily getting filled up on the weekends."
We discovered Beatrix purely based off of Yelp reviews and were extremely happy with our experience. We had somewhere to be that night so it was really helpful that we could make a reservation online. My husband and I both ended up ordering the same thing from the daily specials list and it was absolutely delicious. I loved the fresh juices with the option to add a shot to the drink. This was probably our best meal while in Chicago. My only tiny gripe is that the server brought us our check at the end of the meal without even asking  if we wanted anything else. Perhaps because the restaurant was filling up it was his not-so-subtle hint that he didn't want us to linger?
"Fantastic service, great atmosphere, and the food was healthy and super tasty!!!  Highly recommend. The Mgr and Waitress were phenomenal."
"Whoa, this is epic brunch with unicorns and moonbeams. This cocktail menu is to die for! They have a fresh juice bar, and this parlays over to the regular bar, thank goodness. We tried several different things and they were all absolutely spectacular, and we're a tough LA cocktail crowd. Must try: Potato Salad Deviled Eggs. and all cocktails.The food is healthy, hearty and unique. We will definitely be back when in the area. Totally perfect from start to finish. Bravo."
"5 stars for appetizers, drinks, service and desserts (amazing)! The entrees fell short for me especially for the price, small portions and nothing to write home about but the rest made up for that and now I know what to get when I come back. My boyfriend and I came here for an indulgent night out.  We ordered the: meatballs: almost sweet and sour like in the glaze very good comes in 4 and are on the smaller side straight A salad: this is an entree but we split it as an appetizer, and it was the perfect size. - DELICIOUS so crisp and fresh tasting. Short rib: meh Chicken with asparagus: literally a piece of chicken with asparagus The best part: DESSERT Oh my Carmel pie: just get it.. You have to... Goosebumps Tall dark and handsome: gluten free chocolate cake that is out of this world. My boyfriend doesn't really like chocolate and loved this. I love chocolate and this DOES NOT disappoint. Peanut butter jelly cookie: the peanut butter cookie is really moist and has a scoop of jelly on top, I feel like it could have been better with a heated cookie and more jelly spread on top. Dessert coffee: malted freddo it was iced and was the perfect pairing to our desserts! The service: so attentive and amazing. I ordered a sangria (very good and fresh tasting) and had a slight allergic reaction, it's happened once before to a random red wine. I told the waitress and she and her manager were so accommodating and made sure I was feeling ok. They took down my number so they could check up on me.I will definitely be back here for apps, drinks and of course dessert!"
"Hmm my sister and I came here on a Monday morning for breakfast. I got the shakshouka and my sister got the quinoa cakes--both were really good for the price! We were equally satisfied with the portions as well. Both were well balanced in portion--if I lived in Chicago I wouldn't mind going here to catch a quick breakfast or lunch...I wanted to try everything because their menu seems super awesome! If only they had one in the East Bay...Service was great. Servers were quick to check in on us, refill our coffees, etc. Only thing is that our server came at bad time right when I was putting food in my mouth--and asked a question to which I couldn't answer with my mouth full -__- luckily my sister answered. Food and service was good--just not over the top amazing! Wouldn't object to coming back to this place."
"Great place! Randomly decided to bring my best friends bachelorette party here for some Sunday morning 'recovery brunch.' Wait time is not long and you can make reservations ahead which is great. Service was very attentive, friendly, and quick. After randomly mentioning my friend was bride-to-be to the waitress, she brought over a massive piece of chocolate cake (yes even at 11 am :)...so nice! Even the manager had come over at the end to make sure everything was nice for us. Wow if only every restaurant had this level of service..definitely recommend!"
"Ambiance - very chic and modern without being pretentious. If I lived in Chicago, I'd be a Beatrix regular. Everything my foodie friend and I ordered was absolute perfection and quite healthy.I've never seen a semi-upscale, trendy restaurant leverage such healthy ingredients in such a palate pleasing way!We shared chimichurri steak and the chili chocolate glazed salmon (my absolute favorite). The salmon was paired with a super fresh cabbage, almond, and red pepper slaw, corn tortillas, tomatio salsa and a lime. The flavor combination sounds so simple, but was to die for. I would definitely order it again and again.For dessert, our waiter recommended either the chia pudding (healthy option) or the caramel pie and offered to exchange one if we didn't like the other - sweet gesture. We ended up deciding on the chia pudding Ansley me tell you - this may be healthy but definitely feels so rich because the chia seeds are soaked in coconut milk. Talk about a power food dessert. I loved it, and my friend and I were so pleased and satisfied when we left.I've never been to a place that consistently delivers a perfectly prepped, seasoned, and refreshing app, meal, and dessert combination. If you're in Chicago and want a place with healthier, super-satisfying options, come to Beatrix!!"
The warm pot roast sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Definitely a must try! I also had the pineapple margarita which had a perfect blend of salty and sweet. Very happy we chose this lunch spot!
"Food is 5 stars, but I waited for 14 minutes before the server came and took my order. I also saw another table get up and ask the hostess where/who their server was, and two other tables were looking around for servers. Seems to be a big problem there. I'll go back for the food, but only when I'm not in a rush."
"The boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner last week since I had bookmarked this place forever ago! I made a reservation on a Tuesday night at 5:30pm but it wasn't necessary.  The place didn't start getting busy until around 7. Nick and I tried several of the drinks on their menu, but our favorites were the whiskey sour and the lychee lemonade (with St. Germain in it).  We decided to split the butternut squash soup to start. It was flavorful and very light (no heavy cream). Nick ordered the chimichurri steak and I ordered the short rib. The steak was PHENOMENAL and the sauces it came with were on point. My short rib was tender and flavorful, but I wasn't a big fan of the sauce that was on it. (I preferred my boyfriend's dish!) Our plates were enough to fill us up, but we definitely wanted to try some dessert!After asking the waiter for a dessert menu, I started to get a tad inpatient when almost 10 min had gone by and we still had no menu. Then, to my surprise, he came out with their chocolate cake with a lit candle in it! What a thoughtful gesture, and it truly made my night! My boyfriend got the apple streusel and was enamored with it. (I think the desserts stole the show!) Our experience overall was great and tasty, but we definitely paid for it! Expect to pay $40 a person for entree and drink. They supposedly have a phenomenal brunch here which we will have to check out soon!"
Four of us went here for dinner on a Thursday night. Good thing we had a reservation because there seemed to be a lot of people waiting and not much room to stand. We were brought to our seat right away.Our server was wonderful! He gave insightful answers when we asked what he recommended. I got the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce and fancy French fries. It was all very tasty. We split a kale salad before our meal and it seemed kind of gritty. I think it could have used another rinse off.We finished with some great dessert. The chocolate cake is very chocolately and so so good. The apple tart was also delicious and not too overwhelming on the apple flavor. I would go back again!
"Great place! I actually discovered this place because of a suggestion from an App on my phone. Needed a place for lunch the next day & so decided to give it a try.It's definitely a busy place, on weekends at least, so I strongly suggest reservations, even for lunch. Also, they switch from lunch to dinner menus at 2pm on Saturdays so keep that in mind!!Honestly, everything was great. The potato salad deviled eggs were yummy, drinks were good & the service was spot on. Interior looks great & the tables are adequately spaced so you don't feel like you're a kid in the lunch room again!"
Great brunch spot. Delicious fluffy lemon pancakes & sugared bacon. Good service & they can make a good spicey Bloody Mary!
"After having a rather bad experience at this place for my friend's birthday and writing a review about it, I got a call from the manager of this place apologizing and urging me to come back to try out the place one more time. I am really glad that I did decide to go back and this time, tried their brunch option. Everything that we tried was delicious, full of flavor, and fresh! We started with their bullet proof coffee (SO good) and freshly squeezed juice then ordered their brunch special, can't remember the name but it had a little self serve spot in the back and everything there was really fresh and on point. We also had their prime burger which was really flavorful, as well as, their fluffy lemon pancakes which were literally extremely fluffy and delicious! The food was different, it was more on a healthier side and they mastered it with flavor and fresh ingredients.Service was really great and the manager himself made sure of that, which was much appreciated considering the place was packed! This place lived up to its name and reputation and I am definitely coming back for brunch again!So my advice, this place is definately worth going for their brunch, absolutely no doubt about it. Maybe for dinner would advise to choose another option. Their strong suit is their brunch and they know how to do it right!"
"This is the perfect place to nurse a hangover or get it on for boozy brunch. Do note that Beatrix is packed at 10/11am on a Sunday morning- make sure you make reservations beforehand. Overall phenomenal service and delicious food. Loved the spicy chicken tinga and quinoa cakes with poached eggs. Pretty healthy, I know."
"Great  place to brunch located in the heart of downtown Chicago. Hip restaurant inside the Aloft hotel.  Chicken tinga, oatmeal, chimichuri steak & lemon pancakes were all outstanding. Eating the brown sugar bacon was an out of body experience. Take a pass on the chiliquili breakfast bar. Good coffee & cappuccino. Outside seating available.  Will be back to try dinner."
"Urgh. Had high expectations given the really nice ambiance and stellar yelp reviews, but the food really let us down. Everything tasted deep fried and dripping with grease. We ordered the kennet fries, the crispy kale salad and the poached egg pasta. I get the fries are you know, fried- but this just had grease coating everything. Even my kale salad was coated with olive oil- the crispy part being that the kale seemed to be deep fried. Walked out feeling like we weighed ten pounds heavier. On the plus side, our waitress was the sweetest nicest creature ever, and the two juices we got (blueberry basil smash and acai pomegranate boost) were delicious. So was then citrusy lemon aioli that came with the fries.Don't go here for lunch if you want a lighter healthier meal. Maybe breakfast though, since that's what most people seem to like..."
Came for breakfast. The waitress suggested their power green freshly made juice drink (one of their many). It was delicious and not crazily overpriced. I got the egg white omelet which was delicious. Before I left I got a cappuccino and an almond chocolate croissant. It was the MOST DELICIOUS croissant I have ever had which is a lot as I'm from Manhattan and get good croissants easily. Will DEF come back here next time I'm in Chicago.
"We came for dinner and had a great experience. We called ahead of time and the host was very helpful. We ordered many different entrees and nothing disappointed. Our favorite was by far the pork. Highly recommend it. Our service was amazing, we had Karina. Very impressed with everything!!!!"
"Has to be one of my absolute fav's for LEY places as they best combine coolness with good food, good drinks, amazing desserts. Three of us went for dinner with a friend visiting from out of town, and with a serious gluten allergy. Beatrix couldn't have been more helpful - from the rather unique mixology of drinks to the hummus appetizer, Straight A salad, unique entrees and desserts, my friend was guided by what was gluten free - and all of it was delicious. My husband and I had the  chicken bebe, our friend, the chocolate salmon, and the Tall Dark and Handsome Cake that's also gluten free, simply the best ever, and at a generally reasonable price!"
Through several recommendations from friends I ended up coming here. It was what I expected from an atmosphere perspective- a bit urban and a little loud. I liked that the menu was fairly simple with just enough options. The pork shank was really good where the peaches added a nice complement to the dish. Everyone at the table loved their dish so it's safe to say this is a great option for dinner.
"Needed a gluten-free vegan option, so I had to make some modifications, but it was great! Loved the fries with fried pepper and lemons on top! I'd never had a fried lemon before, and it was amazing. Thin, crispy and tart. Peppers with fries are surprisingly good. Also had the asparagus  (sans cheese), which was ok. Could've been cooked a little longer for my taste (and add some lemon-pepper perhaps?)."
"The menu is extensive and the bartender was so nice and offered several recommendations for our day in Chicago in the River North and Near North area. We each had a local beer.  I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast or lunch.  If the service we received is any indication of the food, I'll definitely be back upon my next visit in the area.The atmosphere inside is very cute and looks updated.  Can't wait to try it!"
"It's fine. It's nothing special. The interior is a really cute mix of rustic and contemporary but I didn't think the food is worthy of 4 stars.There's a café and a bar and a restaurant. It shares a lobby with the Aloft hotel. It also shares its restrooms with the hotel lobby too. Yes...The menu is small and for those who are vegetarian you will find several options. I thought it was a somewhat interesting menu: pumpkin and avocado carpacchio for $9 as a starter? yes, non protein just thinly cut pieces of pumpkin and avocado. I don't get it.Whatever, we opted for the tuna tartare to start which was good. I had the short rib and he had the flank steak chimichurri. His looked and tasted good, mine was a bit skimpy on the portion but it's Grand/State area so your money isn't going to go as far. Our service was very good.2 entrees + 1 appetizer + 1 glass of wine + tax= $77I wasn't blown away. For those of you who eat like a bird or complain about portions being too big then you will like it here. For everyone else... skip it"
"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmMMMmm...I really like this place.  It's trendy on the inside without being pretentious.  The staff is very friendly. There is a lot of green stuff on the menu... which I'm not hating on, I love me some salad, but I come here for the Pot Roast Sandwich.  Oh my dear lord is that a tasty sandwich.  I'm not even a fry eater but I love their fries, as well.A friend of mine got me hooked on this pastry.. which I normally wouldn't think twice about getting.  I have no clue how it's spelled so here it is phonetically: Queen-A-Mon.  Queenamon? I don't know.  It's so good I could pee my pants.A little pricey, but average for River North.  Yaaaaaaay Beatrix."
"I came here last weekend with a group for brunch and had a great time and great meal. The place was packed at about 10:30 a.m., but our group already had a couple of tables, so I'm not sure how the wait times were. I had a hard time deciding, since so much looked tasty, but I decided on the ""light and fluffy lemon pancakes"" ($10.95) with blackberries and lemon syrup, and made the right call. The pancakes were big, definitely fluffy, not overcooked, and tasted of lemon without being overpowering. A handful of blackberries added a fresh fruit and tartness to cut the powdered sugar topping and the light lemon syrup that added a special touch of its own.  I also had a blue mimosa ($8), which I had never heard of, using blueberry and basil. Normally I'm not one for savory herbs in my cocktails, but it was just enough to be very subtle and interesting. They also offer a red mimosa in addition to the original; the red may have involved strawberry, but I forget. My fiance opted for the braised pot roast and egg sandwich, which we both preferred without the accompanying jalapeno relish, but was seasoned and cooked well. The dinner menu also looks good, and I'd be open to returning for another meal in the future."
"Standard staples with a twist.  Excellent pricing on breakfast cocktails that is below $10.  See photo.Sangrita ($8.95) -- sangria and margarita that is slightly a sweet drink.  Good decent portion that is not overwhelmed by ice.  Black cherry vodka, and juice.  Delish with a slight buzz.Spicy Chicken Tinga ($8.95) -- a well balanced dish and spice that you get more chicken than carbs.  The portion may be cute and appropriate for price, but you will be deeply satisfied.  Organic avocado, or just perfectly ripen?  It was tasty that I ate the entire fruit and then some.Buttery Bulletproof ($9) -- a ticker stopper!  (just kidding!). A diet fad in CA.  It has real butter.  Better than affogato.  Coffee and Dessert in one.  *wink*Coffee -- a haven!  Metropolis and Intelligensia.  2 pour over brands -- Big Shoulder and Bulletproof.Dessert -- innovative and healthy.  Gotta try Chia Pudding (first in Chicago?, $6?).  Price range is great.  There are also simpler selections at the counter.Menu -- in addition to regular menu, there are specials in a dish or family style.Service -- Great!  Sarah is a delightful bartender and server who is uber informative, kind, gracious and knowledgeable.  In totality, every one is nice, happy and helpful.Venue -- plenty with nicely spaced tables.  Two bar areas allow quick seating.I have plenty of reasons to come back.  For now, two more dishes to taste plus desserts."
"My new favorite breakfast spot. Great ambiance, music and food! The brown sugar bacon will have me dreaming of more until I return."
Breakfast in Chicago w/my gal pal.Started off with Bloody Mary's then our breakfast arrived: Spicy Chicken Tinga & Eggs our Way w/sausage
"Great food! The staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere and location only adds to the wonderful experience this restaurant offers its customers.I had the quinoa cakes. It is under the appetizer portion of the menu, but it filled me up. The quinoa is baked, topped with a delicious sauce, and served toasty warm! The cookies are huge and well worth indulging in!"
"Had breakfast & a quick lunch snack here.It's located right at the hotel we were staying at so it made things so convenient!Very home-y ambiance.SHAKSHOUKA 3/5Bf ordered this, one of the healthier choices to start off the day. It was yummy - especially the pouched eggs, but when I compared it to what I ordered (below), I liked mine a lot better :)A WONDERFUL EGG WHITE OMELET 4/5The name definitely suits the egg white omelet.. It was so soft & fluffy!! SO GOOD! I'm a big fan of avocados and they've added plenty to my meal :) Would definitely order this again.SIDES: Chicken sausage 3/5LUNCH - SNACKAHI TUNA CRUDO, seven flavour chili 3/5So much avocado was mixed with the tuna - very fresh. Paired this with sparkling wine & mango, pineapple nectar. Great for a quick bite!"
"I came here for a business dinner with my boss who was in town. I mostly picked the restaurant for convenience but will recommend this place to everyone now!The inside is incredibly modern but without a pretentious feel (yeah...Chicago may have a few of those kinds of places). I love that the menu had a healthy twist to comfort dishes. We started with the Ahi tuna appetizer. I am not a fan of seafood so raw fish is not my first choice, but didn't want to look picky in front of my present company. It had no fishy flavor whatsoever, the avocado amount wasn't too much and the crunchy topping provided the perfect bite. I would easily order this again. My boss had the chicken bebe, which admittedly had me wishing I had ordered his dish. I had the pear, almond and avocado salad which was huge! Some places drown salads in dressing but this salad was light and delicious. I also had the habanero pineapple margarita. Definitely recommend but quite strong! What made this experience even better was our waiter.  This guy was so passionate about his job and the food. He spent so much time explaining each dish and even went on to tell us that Beatrix was originally a tester restaurant for Chefs to explore new dishes. He seriously looked like he was going to cry when he told us about the special of the night. He gave us each a free dessert which I'm currently restraining from on my ride home, but failing. Banana cream cheese muffin. How do I deny this? With this place just blocks from my work, I have a feeling I'll be a regular."
VERY overpriced. I'm a Vegan so they told me they would only be able to give me a small portion of the quinoa. Turns out I ended up getting less than 3 spoon fulls and paid full price. Their juices are good but I am so disgusted at the portions and options for non dairy eaters. It's 2015. Let's expand and make small changes to accommodate sometimes.
"Dinner review only (I hear brunch is good too):Like the modern artsy decor, the collection of items on their menu is confusing. They try to do everything here and they mostly succeed. It's not a seafood restaurant, but you'll find a peculiar Chili and Chocolate glazed Salmon. It's not a steakhouse, but the richly braised short rib (fashioned in a cube), was flavorful and good. The pricing and portion sizes are acceptable but not exceptional for the River North neighborhood."
"I took my mother and her best friend here for my mother's birthday.  The music was fairly loud.  It's definitely a place for a younger, hip crowd.  We ordered:- butternut squash soup: good, on the sweet side. You can order naan with it.- kale salad:  wish it had my crispy kale pieces.  This is a light salad.  It was good.- pot roast ragu with spaghetti squash:  was a good substitute for pasta.  I could taste the butter. - prime burgers:  my mom devoured hers and love it.  Fries were pretty good too.They were very nice and comped her a delicious chocolate cake for her birthday. Overall it was a good experience!"
"Tucked inside Aloft hotel, this cozy restaurant is perfect for solo dining while people watching, or with a gang of your favorites for some amazing food. Perfect place for business gatherings or business meetings over f&b. Two different bars to sit at if you choose to go that route, or plenty of tables in their comfortable, homey environment. For breakfast, try your hand at their famous Bullet Coffee (it'll be the best $9 coffee you'll ever buy, if not the only time you spend $9 on coffee). Pair that with their outstanding vanilla yogurt parfait while you're at it. Or a fresh-squeezed juice concoction. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu, a lot (if not all?) of it is organic. And kale on kale topped with kale with a side of kale. Highly recommend this place, especially if you are staying at the hotel. Good bar service to catch a game or socialize, and food available there as well."
"The prime burger is outstanding.  The fries were nothing to write home about though.  Our server, Lizzie, was excellent and gave us several helpful recommendations."
I only had the Nitrogen Coffee which was excellent. Consistency of Guinness with coffee flavor. very refreshing. The place itself looks great. I need to stop in for a bite when I can.
"I dined at Beatrix over the 4th of July weekend, since it was adjacent to my hotel and I had heard so many great things about the food. I sat at the bar, where Matt the bartender was great with his recommendations for food and wine. (Special shout out to Kevin too!) I had two appetizers - the ahi tuna crudo with 7 flavor chili and the tsukune with chili cilantro sauce. I narrowed my dessert choice down to two, and Matt told me to get the Oh My! Caramel Pie which was voted #1 dessert in Chicago. OMG! I am still thinking about that caramel pie - it was to die for!!!!! Highly recommend Beatrix! There were so many great choices on the menu - I might have to make a special trip back to Chicago just to dine there again! Love the vibe of the restaurant too - open windows and industrial feel!"
"I feel that I owe our waitress an apology or at least an explanation, because I was such a dud customer.  She must have thought that I hated the food and was fighting with my wife, but that wasn't the case.  I was feeling very ill before we came in, but it was too late to change plans (long story).  So I ordered a brunch entree that I didn't touch and spent the entire time sitting silent and still, staring at the table in an effort to keep it together.The point is that I didn't get to enjoy Beatrix as much as I wanted to, or as much as it deserved.  The menu impressed me, and it turned out that the food was really good:  later that day I wolfed down my leftovers with gusto.  It was a chicken tinga with tomatoes, avocados, scrambled eggs, and tortillas.  The place is warm and energetic, which I couldn't appreciate at the time, but usually makes for a good brunch atmosphere.  I was also impressed by the value:  our bill was $32 (without tip) for two entrees, a juice, and a tea.  My entree in particular was a generous portion of delicious food for only nine bucks.   You won't beat that in this neighborhood or many others.The juice alone was six dollars though.  However, it's possible that their orange-mango-pineapple nectar put me on the road to recovery, because that's all that I consumed in the restaurant, and within a half an hour I was feeling much better.  It was a damn tasty glass of juice but perhaps it has restorative powers too!"
"Some friends of mine said they wanted o come here for lunch one day...I always like to try new places...not to mention the menu was quite interesting.When I came over I didn't realize it was attached to the Aloft Hotel in which I have hung out in before....cool! We made it over and the place wasn't too crowded. We were seated immediately by our very nice server...she was pretty cute as well. The space itself is pretty open and nice with a contemporary look to it. We started out with an order of fries that came with peppers and lemons...pretty good!I got a drink which was the cherry chia mojito. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but our server put me @ ease by saying its a perfect flavor and not too sweet. She was right as I basically gulped it...very nice summertime like drink. While I was sipping my drink, I noticed state senator Dick Durbin had strolled by...pretty cool. My dining companions told me I should get the Pot Roast Sandwich as they have tried it before. I decided to take their advice and it was well worth it! The sandwich consisted of pot roast (obviously) and caramelized onions on a toasted white cheddar bun. I haven't had pot roast in forever and this was a helluva reintroduction to say the least...very good! The dish came with delicious fries as well. Unfortunately we had no room for some of the delicious looking desserts. By the time we finished, the place was jammed packed..pretty popular huh.After looking through the menu I noticed there were multiple delicious items here which means I will have to make many return visits."
The hostess was rude and scolded me for not coming up to the hostess stand  how dare she ! This is the customer service they provide in welcoming you . Left Never go again !!!!
Been there twice in the past month and enjoyed it both times. I like the open concept and its the perfect place for Sunday brunch.
"Overall: healthy, but flavorful options in a vibrant atmosphere  Likes:- Similar to most LEYE restaurants, this place has a great gluten free menu- There are a lot of healthy options on the menu (e.g. Spaghetti squash instead of pasta or Quinoa cake instead of English muffin). Despite being healthy, the dishes are flavorful. I really like the quinoa cakes for breakfast (healthier version of eggs Benedict) and spaghetti squash rage for dinner - High energy with trendy ambianceGripes:- Service was a bit slow for both brunch and dinner- The cost for the amount of food you get is not great, but I'm thankful that their portion sizes are reasonable!"
"I came here after a pilates class with some girlfriends for brunch because they were really craving some freshly squeezed juice and something healthy. Two of my friends got the Power Greens juice, which has kale, romaine, celery, pineapple, and mint and I got the Blue Boost, which has blueberry juice, white grape, and basil. They seemed to really like the Power Greens juice, which I thought was just okay. It was a little bland and tasted kind of like grass, which makes sense considering what was in it. I thought my juice was a bit sweet and the blueberry juice overpowered all the other flavors. In hindsight, I realized that while I love blueberries, I don't really like blueberry juice, but I powered through it because it was $5.50 a glass! Next time, I will probably get the Sweet Valencia Orange juice because nothing beats some freshly squeezed OJ.For my main dish, I shared the Enlightened Caesar salad and Quinoa Cakes w/Poached Eggs with a friend. The salad was very fresh and healthy tasting, but I definitely liked the quinoa cakes more. The cakes were crispy, the eggs were poached perfection, and the tomato-basil sauce was the perfect complement to the dish! My other friends got the Prime Burger on whole grain toast and the Spicy Chicken Tinga, which they raved about.Overall, another great LEYE restaurant, especially if you're in the mood for something healthy!"
Great service!! Very friendly staff- they made the dining experience very very enjoyable!!
"Best new restaurant I've been to in the River North. Bustling restaurant on a Friday lunch. I had the mushroom quinoa veggie burger which was to die for. Bursting with so much flavor and the spicy sauce it came with, on the side, made for the perfect accomplice. I was left with very small stubby fries as a side (must of been the last of the bunch) which was kinda disappointing, as I love fries. But the tasty veggie burger certainly made up for it. We had the burrata as an appetizer too. It was a smaller portion, but also very good. We ended with the caramel pie. I didn't think it was anything special, but apparentely it's kind of what they're known for. I look forward to trying more desserts and entrees here. It's a wee bit on the expensive side for lunch, but given the freshness of the food I can see why."
"Upon writing my review, about a day later the Beatrix team wrote a Yelp message to me apologizing for my experience. This alone would make me go back. They went out of their way. I would consider going back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"Wow! Surprisingly good find that happens to be the hotel restaurant for the Aloft Chicago City Center. Great service from the bartender, even though we perhaps weren't as hip as the usual crowd they get in there. But he treated us well and the drinks were fantastic. They have lots of juices and I think some fruit purees available to make various concoctions. Had a wonderful (alcoholic) raspberry punch that was nice and tart, not too sweet. The dinner menu was good, I had the turkey meat loaf with kale, and my wife had the three grain and arugula salad with chicken."
"Came back after a few friends said good things. They have gluten free options and they have vegetarian options, but very few gluten free vegetarian options. When I went, they had a mushroom braise that was really good."
"Got there just before dinner rush. Service was great,  tried to ""upsell"" a few times which I am not a big fan of, but understand why they do it.  We got the turkey sweet potato neatloaf (yes Neatloaf), with kale and mashed potato, it was fabulous.  And the chicken Bebe, very moist and delicious.  Wasn't too interested in their appetizers though.  Those two items were one of most inexpensive they had, $16.95.   The turkey neatloaf was worth  $ paid. The chicken Bebe seemed a little skimpy,   not worth more than the 16.95"
"I've ate here for both dinner and a quick coffee/dessert on the go before.  Their coffee drinks are very rich and good, as are their desserts.  For dinner, I like that they have a lot of seasonal offerings on their menu.  I really enjoyed the Pot Roast Ragu.  It was spaghetti squash in a ragu sauce with pot roast. This was a really good combination with a lot of flavor.  As far as the service here, the staff always seems friendly and helpful."
"I came here for restaurant week with K and P. We were there for lunch and were seated immediately which was nice. I liked the wait staff, they didnt linger too long and didnt ask too many questions, but did take a while to bring the check. The place itself isnt very memorable, just lots of smaller tables, clean lines. I tried the potato devilled eggs which come with a mayo- these were good, and the tomato soup was good too. Sadly they dont give a good number of breadsticks with the soup, we had to ask for more, but then they gladly provided them to us. They also made the allowance for K, who is vegetarian and gave her a mac and cheese substitute which wasnt on the RW menu. I had the pot roast which was well made, but sadly, not very memorable. Comes with a lot of well made fries though and I got a cookie in the end. I would come here for basic well made food, good place for lunch."
Came in for the first time on Saturday and liked it so much came back on Monday. Really enjoyed the squash and apple soup. It was unusual for me as it was lighter and less heavy than other squash soups that I have had. Tried it both nights!Would also recommend the pot roast with spaghetti squash noodles. Squash was cooked perfectly and the dish is spiced nicely with a bit of heat that I really enjoyed. The waiter recommended a caramel pie for dessert that he indicated was an award winner in Chicago and I can see why. Just the right amount of sweet and a very light texture. Here in Chicago for a few more days so I might be back again!
"Fresh squeezed juice cocktails?! I'll take 20.This place is great. The atmosphere is awesome. Coffee shop meets awesome restaurant. Couches, a breakfast/coffee bar, and a regular bar. Very modern bust casual at the same time.They have a nice menu to choose from - sandwiches, burgers, your normal yummies. The best part was the fresh squeezed juice cocktails though, A little pricey (your normal Chicago prices, $11), but so good!! The bartender was great - really nice and accommodating. She accidentally put the wrong price on my bill, I told her, and I ended up getting free cookies for being honest. If I got a cookie every time I was honest I would be 1,000 pounds, but I'll take it!I would come here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Great service, nice atmosphere, great drinks, and seemingly yummy food (I only tried the cookies, but so far so good!)."
"I visited Beatrix with a group of four - two were from out of town.  I had never been to the restaurant before, but we had a restriction in that we had to eat early so my friend and her husband could start their trek back to southern Illinois.I had heard about the restaurant but had no clue that it was in a hotel!  I quickly learned this as the spot was packed for breakfast on a Sunday!  We had a reservation, but they wouldn't seat us until the rest of our party was there (and my friend was a tad late...).  I noticed, however, that others were seated without their complete parties, so I was a bit irritated about this.  We had to smoosh in near the bar and it was a bit confusing if we could have a drink at the bar (mimosa, coffee, whatever) or if it was for dining...  We were finally seated and we ordered.  They were rushing us a bit (granted, it was busy, but it's also a pretty big menu).  We selected some mimosas and mostly brunch items (though I had the burger).  I would say that the mimosa was very orange juice-y...not a lot of sparkling.  Probably ok for 10:30 am, but not necessarily for the price.My burger was good, but a big greasy.  The sausage I tried, however, was amazing and based upon the way the lemon pancakes were gobbled up, I assume those were good, too.  I just think it was sort of ranging from really good to just ok.  I thought portions also ranged - some of the breakfast sandwiches were huge, but the other orders weren't very large.  Coffee was quite good, however.All in all, we had a fun time.  The atmosphere was bustling - almost too bustling (I can't imagine it during lunch on a Saturday!).  Service was ok, but they did rush us and forgot some items during the course of the meal.  Food was pretty good, but not overwhelmingly so.  In thinking about if I would come back...I'm not sure... Perhaps if I were downtown, but I don't think I'd purposely go there from somewhere outside of the city."
"Beatrix is a nice spot with a fine-dining ambiance, mid-priced options and great drinks.  My good friend raved about the lunch, and I was eager to try for dinner based on her review especially after seeing it on the Michelin Bib Gourmand this year.The restaurant's philosophy of taste over trend and healthy ingredients is very admirable in theory.  You don't find too many places that offer fresh juice blends that can be mixed with liquor.  However, this time I opted for the current seasonal Black Cherry Sangria - the alcoholic content seems low, but very delicious and enjoyable.  The Tsukune was our appetitzer, and I didn't think that the bite-sized meatballs had much meat flavor, but the chili cilantro sauce gave them a nice finish.  Spaghetti squash is novel to me, and I like the taste and texture of it with the Pot Roast in the Ragu dish.  I would have thought it was perfect if not for being slightly too salty.  I was also able to get a taste of the Chicken Bebe and Cassarecce Pasta from my friends - chicken was very tender with a flavorful cream sauce, but thought the pasta was lacking.  Finally, the Caramel Pie was too sweet for my preference, but is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Based on Yelp's rating system, I'm between 3-4 stars.  Open to trying Beatrix again for brunch/lunch."
"The restaurant is quite nice with modern decor and has a casual feeling. The menu is simple and has a lot of healthy options. The one-sided menu has a list of freshly prepared juices, like Power Green (kale, celery, pineapple, romaine lettuce), a Watermelon and Strawberry juice, etc. And to the right of that were an assortment of espresso style drinks.I had the double espresso. The crema was light yet the espresso was full bodied. The espresso had a sour upfront flavor that was balanced well when you add a little sweetness. My friend had both the above-mentioned juices, and they look pulpy and thick, but not overly thick like some smoothies - so you know you'll get the fiber with your vitamins.For breakfast, I had the quinoa cakes and poached eggs. It was served with a spiced tomato sauce; I also got it with a side of tomatoes and avocado. The tomato was a little mealy, but the sliced avocados went well with the eggs and cakes. This dish is a nice combination of textures - velvety egg yolks, crisp and grainy quinoa, and silky and smooth avocados. My friend had the lemon hot cakes before and definitely recommended it. So I will be back to try those. As described, they're ricotta pancakes served with a lemon syrup and blackberries.Our server was very pleasant and attentive. I would recommend coming here for breakfast.----So I came back the next day just to try the lemon pancakes as I don't know when will be the next time I'll be back in Chicago.So, don't expect fluffy pancakes that you get at IHOP. The presentation is nice; you get 3 pancakes with a few blackberries, some candied lemon zest, powder sugar and a side of syrup. Since these are made with ricotta, these pancakes are delicate and melt-in-your-mouth. Skip the syrup as they are sweet themselves and order a cup of Joe or espresso or even some bacon to help balance the sweetness. This is more of a treat than just breakfast."
"I just ordered the crispy kale salad with grilled chicken. OMG! The best salad I ever had. It has dates, pumpkin seeds,  papaya, delicious crispy kale,  and my fav type of cheese. They delivered it to me at the Loft Hotel and it was fast. I also ordered the chia seed pudding which was light and delicious. I don't like too sweet dessert and this has just the right/healthy amount of sugar. I love this restaurant!"
"I've come here multiple times - from the very onset in summer of 2014, to brunches with groups and fun dinner-dates. John and the LEYE team have done an excellent job delivering on the motif of being River North's ""living room"" - the food is thematically fresh, unadulterated by preservatives, and healthy. Very healthy. Recommended items include starting off with qinoa cakes, deviled eggs, and ahi tuna. Proceed to skirt steak chimichurri and the turkey Neatloaf. End off with chia pudding and any seasonal pastries of desserts. For brunch the serve yourself Chilaquiles are amazing (with all the toppings you want) in addition to the pecan crusted french toast (a new item) and lemon pancakes (which are truly light and fluffy as the moniker suggests). In short, a great choice year-round and across meal types."
"This place is fantastic. Been here several times for brunch and dinner, and it's always packed. For brunch, their chicken chilaquile bar is my favorite item to order. It's all you can eat with countless toppings to choose from. When I'm in a veggie and healthy mood, the quinoa cakes with eggs are a great changeup. So many great options at dinner. I usually stick with the truffled pasta and the ahi crudo.  Both are so flavorful and delicious. Do yourself a favor and order the chocolate pudding cake and the chia pudding. Just trust me"
"We spent 30 minutes deliberating our options before deciding on Beatrix. If that's what you are doing right  now, stop it! Just go to Beatrix. The end.Okay, you're still reading so clearly you need some convincing. The delightful experience I had at Beatrix inspired me to write a song. I present the lyrics here that you may feel the joy that I have felt, so that your heart may be warmed the way my heart has been warmed. Without further ado, ""Tunaaaa crudooooo!!! Fresh blueberrryyyy basil juice!!! Kale salaaaaaaad!! Salmon!!!!!!""At this point, you are definitely convinced and only continue reading now to make sure you get the most out of your time at Beatrix. Here are my recommendations.- If you are lucky enough to sit in Emily's section, rejoice in your good fortune. She is a perfect server.- If the tuna crudo is still on the menu, order it. It is the best I have ever eaten.- If you are a connoisseur of craft cocktails, you probably won't be blown away by the specialty drinks. Turn instead to the delicious, fresh juices and ask that they be spiked with your favorite spirit.- If you finish your entree and are full to bursting, just order the caramel pie anyway and find a place to cram it in there. You will find a way.- If you are supremely grateful and don't know who to thank, you can start with Emily and the kitchen staff. If you continue to find yourself overwhelmed with gratitude, ask Emily to come up with a names for each of the dishes you are consuming so that you can individually thank each of their animal spirits. I'm not normally a spiritual person. I was just really excited. Don't judge."
"The service at Beatrix today 7/12/15 was subpar to say the least! Explain how you can have a 1:15 reservation, show up on time and be asked to sit aside while the hostess find you a table, wait twenty minutes - watch them seat approx. 10 guests only to have that same hostess say we can't seat you because 1 person in your party hasn't showed up yet. Can't speak to the food here but I can say the service made me not even want to try it."
"Vibrant atmosphere and visually interesting interior design while you enjoy your meal and drinks. I had the braised short ribs which were amazing. Full flavor and cooked to perfection. The cauliflower mash was actually very good and the fact that it's light made it a great addition to the ribs. I was not crazy about the brussel sprouts leaves. They was perfectly roasted brussels but the served then cut up into small pieces. It just seemed like a parent cutting food up for a toddler.The food, drinks and atmosphere are exceptional. What more could you want from a restaurant. I highly recommend."
Brunch was so delicious.  Had tomato and egg white sandwich with hash browns.  Husband had egg white omelette.  We shared the waffles.  Everything was so tasty!  The cherry chia juice was yummy!  Must do reservations...gets crowded.  Our waitress was so pleasant!  Great customer service!!!
"Long-time lurker, first time reviewer here--this place was just so good that it warranted sharing the love.My friend and I split the fluffy lemon pancakes and they were easily the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. They literally melt in your mouth and each bite tastes like heaven. The quinoa cakes and poached eggs which I had were also incredible -- not a bite left over! Perfectly seasoned, perfectly portioned, and one of the best brunch places in the city by far.Service was great and the ambiance was pleasant--has a comfortably noisy chatter (not quite in the diner-style way) and promotes good conversation along with your delicious meal.I would give this place 10 stars if possible -- hands down best brunch place in the city."
"Came here for my first dinner in Chicago and I was not disappointed in the least. The waiters were extremely kind and had wonderful energetic personalities. The ambiance was very visually classy, yet comfortably casual.I ordered the acai & pomegranate blast to start, which was a very strong, sour, almost vinegary shot of raw fruitiness. Loved the taste, and it was most appetizing.My entree was the turkey neatloaf - which I thought was a really creative name - which was seasoned splendidly. All of the neatloaf, kale, and mashed potatoes I had were juicy and savory. It was very filling and it left me satisfied. My friend ordered the arugula salad with chicken, which I sampled and found to be very delicious as well.The thing that knocked it out of the park was definitely the desert: the most popular caramel pie, which I can understand why. It was as if you took a pumpkin pie and replaced it with creamy, almost cloud-like caramel filling. Definitely the best thing I had all night.Overall, I very much enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and food. I am very impressed and delighted. I would definitely come again if I visit Chicago again in the future."
My new favorite breakfast/brunch spot! This place is seriously good. Lemon Ricotta pancakes were to die for! I had the quinoa cakes and egg which was healthy but amazing. The red tomato sauce with it was made fresh with high quality ingredients. Bacon was awesome too. Just over all great spot - we had guests in town and it made everyone happy. Service was good too - we had a child with us and they were very helpful.
"One of my favorite brunch spots!!! They have the best coffee and pastry bar too. There is a ton of variety and everything is super fresh. The brunch menu isn't too overwhelming either but has just enough options to choose from which everything is super good. They have waffles, lemon pancakes, breakfast tacos, and more. It's super cute inside and just a nice casual brunch place to hit up on the weekends."
"Brunch, enough said.I wrote a review that it was good not great.  Well, I have been to their brunch many times now and love it.  The atmosphere is nice, the boozy-brunch options are on point, and the portions are great.Easily has vaulted into my top-5 brunch places in the city.  Which I will say my list of spots is better than anyones!"
"My new favorite brunch spot!  From the beginning I was impressed by their fresh juice and coffee bars. I consider myself a pancake expert, and yet, I was surprised at the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were so light and fluffy; it was like eating lightly lemon scented air!  The turkey bacon had a delicately smoked flavor superior to any other I've had. For a unique experience, try the bulletproof coffee!"
"This place is on-point! Was staying at Aloft nextdoor and came down here for breakfast each morning. They're quick, friendly, great food, and not too pricey! Try the chicken tinga - very very good. They also have this cold brewed coffee that's on tap and pours like a guiness - really cool experience and great tasting too."
"I've heard such great things about Beatrix so when my friend said he wanted to go there to kick off Sunday Funday I was down.Unfortunately, I picked the wrong dish for my first experience at Beatrix. I got the steak chimichurri & eggs ($16) and it wasn't worth $6. The steak was just blah, the eggs were blah, the hash browns were a little too crispy (aka a little burnt) and the toast was dry like the desert. You may be wondering why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 if my meal was so bad...well read below my friend.I did sample the pecan & praline french toast my friend got and it was delicious. The drinks were good which made up for my blah meal. The pineapple habanero margarita is a must try (multiple times).Hopefully, the next time I do brunch at Beatrix I'll get a meal that doesn't leave me wishing I had gotta a McGriddle at McDonalds and just ordered drinks here."
"A hip new restaurant attached to the Aloft hotel. I have been here a few times and have always enjoyed my meals at Beatrix. Think comfort food with a healthy spin! Casual yet upbeat restaurant that isn't your typical hotel restaurant. Have tried several delicious dishes here including the neatloaf (turkey meatloaf), pork shank and truffle pasta.The food is usually excellent and all except this visit I felt the truffle pasta was watery and lacked the flavor I experienced before when I had the same entree. Neatloaf was excellent with kale and mash side. Would order this again. The service was good though I know this place gets slower when most of the tables are filled. Overall very good but would like to see more consistency with the dishes."
Great service! This was my first visit & I'll definitely be back. I tried A Wonderful Egg White Omelette & Blue Boost both were delicious!
Apps and drinks. Delicious tuna crudo and tsukune (chicken meatballs). If the small plates are this good I can only imagine how great the large plates are v
"It is the restaurant that is part of the Aloft hotel.  While I am sometimes wary of hotel restaurants, Beatrix is a good option and likely will make another appearance in my brunch rotation.  It was busy on Saturday at 10:30 and I am glad that I had made a reservation for our group of 4.  The hostess stand appeared to be unorganized and there wasn't a lot of place to stand out of the way.  We were seated about 10 minutes after our arrival.They offer a lot of fresh juices and you can make them all into cocktail.  The mimosa was excellent and my dining companions seemed to love their drinks too. Service was pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and helpful in offering recommendations.  She checked on us without it being too much too. The food was also good.  Beatrix has healthy options but also had options that didn't scream ""health"" food so it pleased all of my dining companions. I ordered the belgian waffles which were delicious and we split a side of bacon that was very yummy.  I also had a bit of the chicken tinga with guajillo chili, an amazing broth and sunny eggs. It came to about $25 per person with a tip which is pretty good. Overall, Beatrix was a solid brunch spot.  I am intrigued to go back again for brunch or dinner."
"We've been here for lunch and dinner, and it's a bit of an unknown gem.  Reservations are usually available, and you won't be disappointed by the food!Service:  A little bit slow (often have to wait for waiter/waitress to come by) but otherwise nice.  Ambience: modern, very open restaurant.  Not too loud so it's great for meeting up with friends and chatting.Food:  The juices are absolutely amazing here; for dinner, they can spike them with some liquor.  The veggies are all pretty nice here, especially the golden beet carpaccio.  And definitely order the neatloaf and the pot roast (it literally breaks apart in your mouth)!"
"A River North corner location, eclectic industrial chic decor and walls open to the bustle on the street make this large space trendy, energetic and welcoming. Dining near us were couples and groups of friends and business associates. Everyone seemed happy. The noise level was slightly loud.Everything I ordered was really good, starting with the potato salad filled deviled eggs on a nicely spicy creamy base. The potato salad was creamy, tangy, not too sweet, not too bland. The pork shank was meaty and tasty, maybe a tad dry, but the reduction sauce balanced it. The pork was served atop a bed of mashed potatoes permeated with sauce, and surrounded with in-season baked Michigan peaches. Truly an inspired Fall entree.My spouse's crusted and pounded chicken breast was very tender and moist. It was described as lemon chicken and was too one-note for his taste but I thought it was good. For dessert we tried the vanilla bean kulfi served with a simple mango and pistachio chutney. It was just the thing to finish a very nice meal."
"Ok! Inside the Aloft Hotel lies this place.  Don't mind the wait, it is so worth it.  Go take a look at their pastries at the bar.  Gluten Free included, for my wife.Egg White, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Havarti Cheese with a sweet red pepper relish.  On Gluten Free bread.  Wife, rates it awesome!Braised Pot Roast and Egg Sandwich with a jalapeno relish and a Chihuahua  cheese.  I rate it super awesome!Drinks:Carrot, Apple Ginger Snap - refreshing and tastyCherry Sangria - Super taste, had to have 2.Server, Ryan was very informative and attentive to my wife's allergy and our taste."
"Solid food, great service, delicious drinks. I really enjoy the fresh fruit cocktails--really refreshing and tasty. As well, the food selection is good for groups with varying tastes/preferences. Everything I've had there so far is solid. I would recommend checking Beatrix out--making a reservation in advance would probably be a good idea."
"Went here for lunch and am so happy I did! Decor is beautiful! Great ambience. I started with a blackberry and lychee lemonade which was absolutely delicious! For lunch I ordered the mushroom and quinoa burger, which while maybe doesn't appeal to everyone, I heartily enjoyed! Great flavor and texture. Everything on the menu sounded incredible though, so I'll definitely be making a return visit in order to try more items!"
"I have been here twice for brunch and I truly think this place is Amazing!The place itself its cozy, the waitresses are very friendly and provide an excellent service.The food is fantastic!!! Everything I have tried have made it into my brunch favorites. I totally recommend the white egg omelette which is not only healthy but flavorful. The coffee selection is also great. I usually like dark coffee but I tried some of their coffee varieties and it did not disappoint.You can actually enjoy the coffees and pastries without dinning there."
Really great breakfast. Healthy choices that weren't your traditional options. Love the style of the restaurant and how comfortable it was. Staff was friendly and informative about the menu. Will come here again next time I'm in Chicago.
"Took my out of town visitors here for brunch the other day and we all loved it! The interior was very nice and cozy-- mismatched chairs and even a couch at one of the tables. Very rustic feel. Our server was so pleasant and friendly. We ordered the shashouka, egg white scrambler, and the quinoa cakes. My favorite was the quinoa cakes-- a healthy take on eggs Benedict with quinoa cakes instead of an english muffin. DELISH. The shashouka was second-- poached eggs in a tomato sauce with kale and naan. I didn't care much for the egg white scrambler, but then again it wasn't my pick. Would definitely recommend to others for breakfast/brunch."
"Beatrix. One of my favorite names - I think of a girl, pretty as an English rose, fresh as a dew drop - and with that in mind, I was expecting my tastebuds to be delicately seduced by their brunch menu, which based on a quick perusal prior to arrival, looked banging - thus, I was especially saddened when Ms. B let me down in the flavor dept, becoming of somewhat of a ""40-footer"", if you catch my drift - beautiful from afar, but bedraggled upon further inspection.Went on the Saturday of Lolapalooza, so it was packed full of 20-somethings in short overalls, crop tops, and those peasanty headbands that are Coachella chic - so I don't have a real sense of the crowd - but I think it's generally pretty city-hip. Pearl, my darling grandmother, at 86, was the oldest person there by a solid 45y and we had to kind of shout at each other to be heard above the excited chatter of the concert goers.Menu features things such as ""quinoa cakes w poached eggs"", a DIY chilaquiles bar (aka, brunch nachos), a peach praline french toast, and ten-grain oatmeal - all of which sounded bougie enough for my heart to pitter-patter with delight - but everything was solidly underwhelming, with the exception of the coffee, Intelligensia, always an excellent caffeination choice.My egg white omelette w avocado/heirloom salsa and a side of baked salmon was flavorless at best, with the dry salmon only edible with a copious amnt of hot sauce - and the quinoa cakes (red/white quinoa bound w parm) was no more tasty, though slightly redeemed by the bright tomato sauce on which they sat. The cripsy kale salad w papaya, dates, pumpkin seeds, and parm looked great but was small for the price...not to mention not remotely filling for $10 - the side of hummus was a bright point, served w fluffy pita and more of the heirloom/avo salad - but was it worth $7? No.Overall, brunch for three with coffee and a fancy juice (kale, romaine, pineapple, mint, celery blended for $6) was a bit over $60 + tip, which was more than I think the quality warrants. As it stands, Beatrix needs a trip to rehab before she's ready for her close up."
Stopped in on a Friday morning with no reservations. Wait time was only 30 minutes but we found a spot at the bar and got right in. Had the lemon pancakes and they were amazing. Almost dessert like!  The brown sugar bacon might be the best I've ever eaten. Will certainly try it again.
Had a great burger and good service.  Only 4 stars because value (price for what you get) is just okay.
"5 stars isn't enough to rate Beatrix! The menu is ridiculous!!! Everything looked appetizing. Although we had to wait for about 45 minutes, the wait was worthwhile. Yes it can be a little crowded, but the place is great! I completely recommend Beatrix for a good weekend brunch."
"My experience at Beatrix was fine, but it wouldn't cause me to tell all my friends to rush over.  Beatrix seems to be going for a ""we're not health food, we're healthier food"" kind of thing. I like the idea -- especially in Chicago, the land of cheese and butter -- but I felt like the waiter took it a bit far. Our whole group felt kind of uncomfortable with him even though he was incredibly nice. His comments about how we didn't have to feel bad about ourselves after eating at Beatrix and about how we could split dessert didn't have the effect he intended. Instead of feeling empowered (I think that's what he was going for?) we felt kind of bummed out and shamed. Were we supposed to feel bad about ourselves more often at other restaurants? Do four women really have to share one piece of pie to be acceptable eaters?  We did end up sharing the pie slice, and in the end I'm glad we did, because the caramel pie he raved about was okay, but was in no way as earth shattering as he made it out to be."
"Plenty of reviews on this place, and they aren't wrong! I really wanted gazpacho, so we tried this place out for dinner. We had the blackberry and lichee lemonade (w a little mint, which normally makes things taste like toothpaste, but was refreshing and delicious), gazpacho (yellow bc of the tomatoes!), potato salad deviled eggs, quinoa cakes (w cabbage on top), and hubby had the cider reduction pork shank. Everything was delicious! The flavor balance is perfect for each dish- especially the pork. We also had the vanilla kulfi (very creamy Indian ice cream) for dessert. Each dish was so unique, innovative, delicious and well portioned! Would recommend to try to sit near a window, since it is quieter. Definitely the highest caliber place, the chef is amazing and can't wait to see what other menus he or she comes up with!"
"Beatrix: Enhanced yet casual American cuisine. Summer fun. People watching.Rustic elements competing in an urban industrial design created a cool atmosphere...one that aims to please the consumer of almost every need from a coffee shop in the corner to bakery to casual fine dining and the outdoor patio experience. A Cluster f or genius?No just a perfectly located, blended hotel restaurant.Had an early dinner there. Sampled the Mango mix juice, Kale Salad, Egg and Truffle Pasta with asparagus, Salmon on a bed of rice and finished with a Chocolate cake.Skip the truffle pasta. From presentation to taste is clearly a miss unless you favor a running liquid of bland nothingness. The asparagus was helpful though.Salmon on a bed of rice is actually interesting. The fish was cooked well. Rice was fluffy and a good complement.For a salad novice, the Kale Salad was amazing filled with an explosion of different flavors even without using any dressing?!For their juices, they know they got it right. Highly recommend it.This should be a downtown weekend brunch spot option. Dinner competes but to get the most out of Beatrix and if their juices are any indicator come for the morning lunch period."
"My daughter & I had a late night Salad hereRecently while staying @ the Hyatt Place around the corner, we Both Loved our Salads & the service was top notch . I really appreciated that we weren't pressured into ordering more food then we had an appetite for since it was late @ night !! The Layout & Design is Spectacular & there is also outdoor dining !! It was very ALIVE with a full house but no wait , the menu was limited which put me off a bit , but I heard the Brunch is suppose to be Outstanding"
"I absolutely love this place. Their menu is fantastic! so far I've tried the crispy kale salad, blueberry basil smash (one of their fresh juices), kennebec fries and a handful of their specials. I would recommend every single thing I've tried--so good!"
"Place was great for a light brunch -- really well prepared dishes that aren't too heavy.  We came here whenvisiting from out of town, and it was exactly what we were looking for.  We got the oatmeal, the quiche and the vegetarian quinoa/poached egg cakes and all were superb.  They also make a pretty decent Bloody Mary at the bar -- Grey Goose Citron vodka!Price point is probably considered a little pricey, but it's not bad at all if you're used to SF/NY prices.  The ambiance is upscale/casual, so I guess that's what you're paying for.The wait wasn't too bad (15-20 minutes), but it was strange how they had so many unseated tables but there was still a wait.  Service was really attentive once we were seated -- almost too attentive.  Seems like they can also accommodate large groups if you call to reserve in advance.I wish I could come again to try their baked goods -- their cookies and baked goods look pretty ridiculous tasty!"
"I just want to tell everyone to order the Blueberry Tom Collins, so pretty and delish! This is a nice place for lunch, and perfect when they open the windows up!"
"It's a pretty small menu here but the food is really good. From the appetizers to the desserts everything that we ordered was very good. I couldn't give it 5 starts due to the lackluster service though. The staff was pretty friendly but little things like our appetizer plates sitting on our table for the entire meal, or our server never asking us if we would like a 2nd round of drinks, both display the lack of effort that the staff at this restaurant possesses."
We loved this place! My husband suggested it when we had some friends in town for brunch and we were not disappointed! Declicious with great service!
"I had a great brunch here. The noise level was almost too loud for me, but otherwise, the atmosphere was good. The service it received (hostess, waitress) was great. I had the Steak Chimichurri & Poached Eggs with a side of the Brown Sugar Bacon. I found there could have been more Chimichurri with the meal, but it was still delicious. The bacon was like a decadent dessert. The Spicy Bloody Mary was top notch, as were their mimosas, with which they offer a variety of fresh juices. Finally, I tried some bites of my friend's goodies from the bakery- the angel food cupcake and the chocolate chip cookie were both interesting and tasty."
"I cannot say good things enough about this place .we keep going there for coffee which is really good .the food is also very good . My only reason for giving four star is their hot chocolate drink. When I got it, it was all syrup taste and was a disappointment . Writing this so hopefully they change the way they make it ."
"Was in Chicago on a business trip, and Beatrix fit the bill for breakfast. I walked a few blocks to the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the bustling scene inside. Despite it being a weekday about 9am, there were a lot of people in the restaurant, and the breakfast buffet was in full swing. All items were fresh, guacamole had a nice kick, chicken had just the kick I was looking for.Why the 4 stars instead of 5? While everything was good, nothing really blew me away. Solid breakfast spot if you're in Chicago, you won't regret going!"
I went here for my birthday and everything was delicious.  We tried the chicken meatballs for appetizers which was excellent.   We ordered the chimmichuru skirt steak and pork shank.  They were both cooked to perfection.  The steak was nicely cut into 5 strip's and flavored just right.  The pork shank was good.  I thought it could have used a little more seasoning but it was still good.  The caramel pie everyone talks about was amazing!  I'm not a huge fan of desserts and this really hit the spot.  Service was okay.  It was a bit slow and wasn't too knowledgeable about all the dishes.  So I give it 4 stars.  Food is great and ambiance is chic.  I will definitely come back again.
"We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday with brunch and had no troubles getting an 11:15 reservation on a Saturday (granted, we called a few weeks ahead of time).The space itself is very nice with interesting decor and light fixtures. And the place is deceptively small-looking from the outside. Inside, there is plenty of room with many, many tables. There was no wait when we got there, nor when we left. There is an outdoor area, but we weren't sure the rain would hold off (it did), so we chose a table inside, though right at the open air edge of the restaurant.I started with a coffee, which was quite tasty. I eyed the morning cocktails, and all looked delicious, but I did not partake. I also thought about the iced coffee, but was very content with what I got.To eat, I had the spicy chicken tinga. It was great, and there was so much of it! The chicken ""chili"" packed a little bit of heat, but the tortillas, eggs, and avacado balanced it out. Because everyone's dished looked so good, we all sampled each other's. My favorites were my order, the quinoa cakes (kind of like an eggs benedict on quinoa cakes), and the lemon-blackberry pancakes, which were the fluffiest I've tasted.I'd definitely go again."
Pleasantly surprised. Great service this time around. Had the quinoa poached eggs entree (to die for...and healthy!!) and my dining partner had the pot roast egg sandwich (surprisingly affordable at $7.95). We each had a juice which definitely tasted fresh squeezed. The only downside to the whole meal was that they were out of the cold brew coffee
"Summary: Awesome take on the staple eggs Benedict (Quinoa eggs benedict). Nice interior and decent pricing. Great location. Can get fairly crowded and loud on weekend brunch hours (But that is expected for a brunch place downtown).Detailed:1. My girlfriend LOVES quinoa. I hate quinoa. On my first visit, I was disappointed to find out they did not have traditional eggs benedict (This is what I always order for brunch because it's what I love). However, I ordered tried their quinoa eggs benedict and ever since then... that's what I always get. It's one of the top 3 places I would go for eggs benedict. They made something I hate into something awesome. I tried other entrees and they're all pretty decent as well.2. Nice interior and great location. Modern and warm.3. Decent pricing. My bill is usually less than $17 or so with coffee (before tips). Serving is a little smaller than most places (vs. yolk, eggsperience, etc) but it's just the right size for me."
"I was visiting Chicago for a mommy getaway and we wanted good drinks and breakfast on a Saturday morning. The people at the MAC counter in Nordstrom recommended Beatrix. It was about a 5 minute walk and worth every minute! The hostess greeted us with a smile, we were seated within 3 minutes of arriving...I would HIGHLY recommend reservations...and they accommodated our off menu drink order. Every single thing we ordered was amazing!! The breakfast enchilada was better than anything I had tasted. The chocolate covered angle food was so Devine and moist. The egg white omelet was amazing. What made the visit even more perfect was our server. She had started there only 2 weeks prior but seemed so confident and kind. Thank you for making our weekend awesome!!"
"I've only been for breakfast a couple of times but the food and service I received was great!!Had the Spicy Chicken Tinga with egg whites instead. The Tinga is DELICIOUS. Done well, good kick, good flavors. Would definitely order this again.Second time I ordered the Eggs Your Way with egg whites and chicken sausage. The chicken sausage was more like  chicken patties of ground chicken meat and something sweet in it. I wasn't expecting it to be sweet so my taking my first bite... left me with a surprise. I was 1. expecting links 2. expecting it to be savory. Was a little disappointed that it wasn't savory but it was still tasty. Lattes are made with Intelligentsia and they almond milk!! A rare find sometimes. Would come back again."
"What a refreshing place in the city!  Light and airy, the whole place reminds me of my favorite dish there - the quinoa cakes benedict.  The perfect combination of hearty, yet healthy.  Beautiful, yet very approachable.   Even though its a bit expensive, you must try ANY of their freshly squeezed juice combinations.  Strawberry watermelon is currently my favorite!  Prompt and helpful service with passion about the restaurant and they menu.Can't wait to go back and enjoy some more patio seating and refreshing food."
"This place might be my new go-to! I had been wanting to go here since I saw it open, it looks great! I didn't know it was an LEYE until recently, but that made me even more excited to try it. I made a reservation on Open Table for my girlfriends and myself after work during the week. We had requested to sit outside and they were so nice to even call and let us know if it was nice, they would seat us out there. We did end up sitting on the patio, which is cute, but the restaurant is really nice inside as well. Super cool design. We started with the deviled eggs and the kennebec fries which were awesome! The sauce that came with the fries was really good. The kale salad was nice and fresh and so was the tomato gazpacho. Really refreshing! For dinner we tried the cauliflower milanese, which was really unique and delish! My favorite dish was the poached farm egg and truffled pasta, I mean, you can't go wrong with a poached egg on anything! We also had the pork shank which was super tender and sweet. For dessert we tried the caramel pie which was really good. I just loved the atmosphere, the menu (great variety) and I don't mind that it may be a bit healthier than your usually fare:) I definitely ill be back, hopefully for brunch! Oh and as far as service goes, top notch as all my LEYE experiences typically are!"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat!Great coffee, pastries, breakfast, lunch an dinner.Friendly Manager John who creates the music playlists. Great music. Cool Decor."
"The caramel pie is to DIE FOR!!!! The vanilla bean whipped cream on the side just makes it that much better : )  There's a cozy ambiance (even though it's part of a hotel!) and great coffee/tea. I've only had one of their salads there and it was great but besides that, the deserts and coffee I can't really comment on their other food but I'm sure it's delicious! Definitely a great place to eat out when you're in the city."
"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite spaces to catch up with friends, for dinner or breakfast. With a variety of items on the menu that appeals to any sized appetite, dietary restriction, or budget concern, it's a contemporary American restaurant that feels upscale, without hurting one's wallet. Service has always been on point, and waiting at the bar is something I enjoy when there's a crowd since the bartenders make good drinks and know both their bourbons and wines. The last time I was here, I used a LEYE gift card that had some restrictions and we had a little bit of money left on it, but since it was a one-time use card, I couldn't use it again. The manager gave my friend and I banana bread and a huge pastry in light of the gift card's restrictions. It was a really nice gesture! I'll be back.A few of my favorite things to order:-farm chicken-halibut-blueberry Tom Collins-spicy chicken Tinga-turkey burger"
"I'm giving a 4.5 on the food!  And pending more tastings might go up to a 5.  I had the Korean BBQ chicken special with a quinoa veggie salad.  The chicken was a little crispy which I love, the flavor on the chicken was so good I kept forgetting to dip it in the Korean BBQ sauce which was also divine.  It wasn't just the standard Korean BBQ sauce either, there was more texture and a lighter flavor to it.  The quinoa and veggie salad was a cold salad which I didn't expect but loved it.  It was nice and lemony, a little sweet, had crisp carrots, kale and other veggies.  It went perfect with the chicken.  I'm craving my whole dinner now!  Loved the atmosphere too!  The service was friendly and fast.   I'd definitely recommend it and I'm going back again to try the rest of the menu."
"Dear sweet Beatrix, where have you been hiding? I found out about this gem looking through restaurant week menus and boy am I glad I did! My husband and I had a 7pm reservation but ended up getting there an hour early. They sat us right away anyway which was unexpected and very much appreciated. Looking through the selections, we decided to branch off the restaurant week menu and order from their main dinner menu. Since we had dessert plans elsewhere we ended up saving a bit on the bill this way as well so it worked out great. We started with the hummus and it was fresh and bright. The serve it with a cherry heirloom tomato and onion salad, pita, and a lemon slice. We couldn't eat it fast enough! My entree is what really won me over though. Fork tender pot roast in a homemade BBQ sauce that was served alongside caramelized pearl onions, shaved Brussels sprouts, and whipped Yukon gold potatoes. People. People!!!! You must get this dinner! It was phenomenal and I savored every last bite.My husband got the burger which he enjoyed but no where near as much as I did my meal. It's such a cute, trendy place and the staff couldn't be nicer. We even noticed a pretty impressive coffee bar and multiple delicious looking pastries. They offer fresh squeezed juices as well that you can add a shot of vodka to for a healthier yet still delicious cocktail. They really blew me away here; what a fabulous evening."
"Came here for breakfast the other day and was seated immediately.  I ordered shakshouka and a latte.  The food came out really fast, whereas the latte took awhile to show up.  Kale was a great addition to this version of shakshouka, and the spicy tomato sauce was on point.Outside of the lateness of the latte, everything was fantastic.  The restaurant had an energetic vibe.  I would definitely recommend for breakfast."
I absolutely LOVE this restaurant!  The service is amazing and the food is probably some of the best I've ever had.  We went there for my birthday and my friends birthday so far this year and find any excuse to go there.  I HIGHLY recommend the branzino!  The straight A salad is another winner!
"Beatrix opens the entire front half of their restaurant in the summer so it's like sitting on a lanai instead of indoors. The aesthetics of this place are so pleasing, they have plants throughout, hanging ferns, and large dark brown leather couches at some tables mixed with cushioned chairs. It's classy, definitely has that California feel to it, and they top it off with creative food offerings and great service. Hubby and I sat in one of the couches together and kicked back and chatted while waiting for our food to come out. I had a fresh-made strawberry watermelon cooler, hubby had the blackberry and lychee lemonade. For our app we had hummus with naan. For my entree I had the turkey and sweet potato ""neatloaf"" with veggie gravy and kale cooked in this wonderful tasting broth and spiced perfectly. My meal tasted fantastic and was very healthy, also. I love restaurants that can make healthy food that tastes amazing. Beatrix nailed it on this one. Ambiance, aesthetics, service, drinks, and food were all superb. This was a five star experience."
"We were in Chicago last year and popped in for a drink.  I was so impressed with the blueberry basil smash (a fresh-squeezed juice) that we made a point of coming back during our next visit for food.  I am beyond grateful I didn't attempt to assuage the empty feeling in my stomach at Midway.We ate lunch at the small bar.   On the beverage side, they offer fresh squeezed juice, craft beer, wine, creative cocktails.  On the food side, there are lots of unique and thoughtful options.  I could have ordered any number of things, but I decided on the Supernatural Chopped Salad.  I seriously could eat this every day for the rest of my life.  Fresh, crunchy, satisfying.  Great blend of flavors (greens, green beans, peaches, sunflower seeds, dried corn and more and more - just wow!).  I added chicken for a little protein.   Wonderful stuff.To my great surprise, my typically meat-eating  husband ordered the Mushroom and Quinoa Burger, which came with fries.  The burger was tremendous.  Great flavor.  Very satisfying, yet not too heavy.  The fries were really good as well (yes, I usually try all my husband's food).Beatrix has a bakery area - we ordered a cookie to split for dessert (the cookies are really big - one is a good size for 2 people).  The restaurant is attached to a hotel(we didn't stay in it).  With all the great places to eat in Chicago, when we are in town we don't repeat very often, but Beatrix is definitely worth a repeat visit."
"Wow.  What a great place.  We were in town for 4 days and actually wound up here 3 times!  We only tried lunch and brunch, but were wanting to come back and try more dishes.  For lunch one day they had a korean spiced chicken that was unbelievably good.  We also had a nice salad.  For brunch the spicy chicken tinga was amazing, the quinoa cakes were great and the yogurt with fruit and granola was also quite good.  Be warned, if you walk to the bathroom, you will pass a bakery with phenomenal cookies and baked goods.  I wound up with a cookie to go on each trip (Nutella Chocolate, caramel, marshmellow chocolate...).  The service was top notch on every trip and the atmosphere is very nice.  A great find!"
"our server was excellent and made our outdoor visit ,even better. Sorry Maggianos lost out on our ticket.. The food was super fresh, the korean bbq salad was great value for the money and the hen ,was so tender. I had the fish, which was a little pricey but again, fresh.. The juices simple the best.."
"We came here for date night and had such a great dinner! The place is so light and airy feeling!! We started with the potato salad deviled eggs and those were delish! They really did taste like potato salad! For our mains, I had the Salmon - which was SO good. I loved the tortillas that it was served with and the flavor was so delicious. I would have that again and again. My BF had the slow braised pot roast and he loved it. It was a very meaty serving and the whipped potatoes - it was all so good! I would definitely return here. I really love the concept of the restaurant! Not a typical hotel restaurant."
Spicy chicken tinga was delicious. The fruit was nice and fresh. The mimosas were great with fresh purees. Would go back however so many places to go in Chicago so it's like why not go somewhere new.
"I came here for lunch last week with 3 coworkers and we had a great experience.  The restaurant was packed for lunch and I can see why...the food was incredible!  The salad selection was extensive and they ALL sounded good.  I ended up with the superfood salad with peaches and green beans - seriously one of the best salads I have eaten in years!  My coworkers were equally as pleased with their selections too...superfood salad, kale salad and the caesar salad.  We shared a caramel pie and man, was it ever good!  Sharing was definitely the right choice as the pie was super sweet, but definitely worth the calories.  The staff was very friendly and the decor was modern and reminded me of an NYC stylish restaurant.  Definitely worth trying when in Chicago!"
LOVE their kale salad. It's probably one of my favorite River North lunch spots. Super cute decor and awesome staff. I eat there at least once a month!
"A MUST! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is prime. Every time I've been I've yet to be disappointed. I took my younger sister here two days ago for lunch and she begged me to take her again for dinner last night. Yes, we went. I would recommend anyone to go try it out at least once- you'll be happy you did."
"Underestimated! If you are looking for a menu with a variety of food with a modern environment- make a reservation OR come in during lunch and sit at the bar. The bar menu offers eats at an affordable price. Service has always been nice. Never a rush feeling and it's a great place to have a conversation. Tables are further apart, and when it's not so busy, it's great to be in a quieter environment. The ambiance is beautiful with the floor to ceiling windows. My favorite dish- Poached Farm Egg and Truffle Pasta. Truffle is always a popular ingredient in restaurants, but Beatrix prepared it perfectly. Second favorite- The Meatballs (got a kick to it). Overall- it's a great stop by. If I were to come again it would be for an appetizer. Also, they have a coffee bar with fresh pastries available as a carry out."
"Excellent dining experience!!!  Came in for brunch while visiting Chicago and I loved everything about this place.  Nice trendy Chicago vibe with exposed ductwork giving the restaurant a nice industrial look.  Beatrix offers a full bar as well as a coffee bar with some excellent pastry options. We started with a traditional mimosa and a blue mimosa which was very tasty. For our main courses we had the egg white omelet and quinoa and eggs.  Both dishes were excellent. If you do have a large appetite an appetizer is a good idea. The portions are good size, but not large by any means.  Before we left we hit the coffee bar for a nice freshly baked cookie and king crimson tea which was awesome.  I'll definitely be back!"
This was my first time and won't be my last! This place has some of the best tasting food around! I had the steak and my friend had the sea bass. The sea bass was simply amazing. So much flavor and light. Perfectly cooked. The steak was also prepared perfectly. Plus the plates are not huge which allows you to save room for their incredible desserts. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner. All this plus fantastic service. Takes a lot to earn 5 stars and they did it with ease! Just go!
"It has been a while since I wrote a review but this merit a write up. I can't talk about the food but I will talk about the service. Terrible!!! I stopped here to eat because I am staying at the hotel and after waiting 15 minutes and sitting others that came after me I was told that they forgot that I was there so they asked me to wait again. I will admit, I was dressed average, nothing fancy but clean. I had a long day and just wanted a warm meal.  After another 20 min i just walked out. So moral of the story...if service is part of your dinning experience, don't come here. I am from Miami and used to bad service but this one tops all my bad service experiences.  After acknowledging that they forgot me, they forget again!"
"Wine BarCoffee BarBakeryCasual/Upscale RestaurantFor a River North establishment, the prices are not too bad. Fresh juices with the options to spike were very nice. Love the outdoor open feel of the space and random couches used as seating. It's very ecletic and laid back perfect for any occasion from grabbing a quick bite to a long sit down dinner.Bottom line:  The service is impecable and a great choice for the al fresco feel without worrying about inclement bad weather, very true for Chicago. Definitely come here for the beautiful garden-like, relaxed ambiance."
I came here for late night before and liked the sense of Healthiness of the restaurant.  Came back for brunch the past Saturday.  It is very nice that it took reservation for brunch. The green power juice tastes very healthy but the celery is too heavy.  They serve intelligentsia coffee. Buy it does not taste as strong as the one u could get in Intelligentsia store.  The potato salad deviled egg is a fresh start.  Potato salad is very smooth and u can taste Yolk . House made waffle came in four small ones and they are  cute . The egg taste is very strong.  Chicken tinga  is spicy and tasty. A little bit too tasty for early morning but very delicious.  Gold has brown is crispy. My friend loves it .
"I've held back in writing a review on this place because I wanted to keep it my secret. Well apparently my secret is out. Beatrix not only has incredible food for breakfast lunch and dinner, but the ambiance and wait staff are just as incredible. It's like a coffee house meets a tropical oasis blended with a lofty living room feel. I can't help but to order the quinoa cakes with poached eggs. The tsakune and kale salad are hard to beat. Oh and don't forget you can order bullet proof coffee. You've gotta get here early to get a table - but sitting at the bar with Michael is also hard to beat. A must try. Over and over again."
"Food was great, very quick even with our 10 people party! We were celebrating a 21st birthday and made sure to take a picture of the waiter checking her ID!"
"This place is great. The decor is fantastic. I would say to be sure to make a reservation because this place can get crowded. I came on Friday afternoon with a group of 6. Fortunately, we only waited a good 15 minutes for our table. Their slogan is ""when delicious meets healthy"". I had the herb chicken sandwich which had quinoa stuffing and a cranberry preserve. I also had a side of fries instead of the apple salad that it normally comes with. Unfortunately I thought the chicken was really dry. The fries where really good though. It's a really good spot for a reasonably priced lunch in an area that can cost a pretty penny."
"I LOVE this place. The Caramel Pie is literally what I dream about when I go to sleep at night. I've had their kale salad, the roast chicken sandwich on the lunch menu, and chicken wellington when it was a special one night. I would order all of them again, starting with the chicken sandwich, because it tasted like thanksgiving on a delicious bun. I would highly recommend Beatrix. I love it."
"Skip the bar food and check this place out! We randomly stumbled upon it on a Saturday night and were incredibly impressed! The atmosphere is dim, the noise level is so that you can still have a conversation at the table, full bar with a nice wine list and some signature cocktails, as well as a nice choice of coffee and tea drinks. The food was incredible. We got a few things to share amongst the three of us, but they do have full dinner size entrees. We enjoyed the potato salad deviled eggs, Quinoa cakes, kale salad (the best ever) and some chicken kefta kebabs. As well as a cinnamon bun in the end!  Everything was perfect. They have a full pastry bar as well as a large dessert menu as well. I felt perfectly full and yet not gross after eating our meal. The server was very knowledgable about everything on the menu and wine list. She was very attentive and prompt. I highly recommend this place and can not wait to come back!"
Great lunch fare.Enjoyed the outdoor seating. The smaller portions allowed a broader sampling of unique dishes. Very nice.
"I love me some Beatrix! We always have great (fast) service when we come. I love that you can get the fresh juices spiked with the alcohol of your choice. I really enjoy that refreshing drink with the freshness of the food. Try the hummus. I hate hummus, in fact I loathe it... and I always eat the whole plate when it comes. It is quite delicious - they serve it with some weird tomatoes, but I prefer it with the pita. I also love the burger and the pot roast... I cant pick my favorite. there is too much good here to pass up.  The shakshuka is my favorite for breakfast as well. Make a reservation since its a trendy area, but its actually a really good value for the neighborhood it is in. If you need to try something new with food with a twist, check out Beatrix"
"this place.  My best friend took me here and I fell in love.  Menu and service was great.  What I loved the most about this place, was that they served #lacolombecoffee and they also carried #bulletproofcoffee.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  Please note that Bulletproof Coffee is a meal in itself. They are opened late night and they support Chicago Roasters if you're a coffee lover.  If you are in the area, please stop by.  The food is delicious and healthy.  They will not disappoint.  Although, the Bulletproof Coffee needs to be blended more to make it more frothy."
"Great time overall. Hostess was very pleasant, wait was not bad at all, and the food was great. They have a unique selection of pastries, didn't have one but they looked delicious. Had the egg white omelet with cubed avocado, tomatoes, and toast - very good! Enjoyed it all around. P.S. Bathrooms are in the back down a hallway."
"The ambiance is sophisticated and modern. The dinner menu has a little bit of everything and they also have a gluten-free one. I tried the potato salad deviled eggs, the chicken bebe and the pot roast ragu (with spaghetti squash. YUM!). I had the Blackberry Lemon Drop cocktail, with vodka and lychee lemonade - I'd never have guessed how awesome this combination is. I have been to Beatrix twice for dinner and had a great experience. I can't wait to try their brunch!"
"Came strictly for desserts/coffee. They serve Intelligentsia and Metropolis coffee blends, and their recent addition is La Colombe in pour over. I undoubtedly went for the La Colombe, as I've enjoyed their coffee in the past. Unfortunately, the blend they carry is an ultra dark roast,  with a dirt-like taste (wouldn't be surprised if It's a French roast). Spiced chai latte: pretty good, and semi-sweet.Dessert: pecan praline brittle: 5Chocolate chunk (massive) cookie: 5Large, open space. Clean. Perfectly sized, and comfortably spaced seating. We grabbed seats at the bar (best seats!), and soaked in all the energy and life from Beatrix."
Good food. Waiting staff is friendly. Their brunch menu is kind of limited and they do not have many dessert options.
"Breakfast place in the city, located in the same plaza as the hyatt. We accidentally walked into the hyatt lobby and for a couple of seconds thought we were at the restaurant because breakfast was being served in the hotel lobby. It was pretty funny. But we went on the weekend and it was packed! We got seated right away. Its very hip and i would say theres of a younger crowd. To start we asked for Mango/orange juice but when we got it it was just regular orange juice. But the waiter realized and brought us what we asked initially and let us keep the orange juice she brought us initially. We had Belgium waffles with strawberrys and hash browns. Was not a big fan of the hashbrowns because they were really stuck together like a bar. The waffles were good i was expecting one huge waffle but instead it was 4 small waffles per order!"
"""Where's a good place to take a woman on a blind friend date in River North that isn't too expensive?"" I yelled from my desk one afternoon. People yelled back Beatrix, but not before asking about what strange circumstance I'd found myself in, going on a blind friend date (but that's another story).I made reservations because I make them anywhere that will take them (I recommend you do the same).This place has kind of a multiple personality disorder, in a good way. It's part of the Aloft, so it's part hotel restaurant, park coffee/pastry shop and part bar. All these things work well together, and if you weren't really observant, you might not even notice the different areas.There's a bunch of fresh juices, and you can add whatever booze you'd like to it. There's also some pretty tasty cocktails. I tried the vodka dew, which was a melon and Ketel drink.I had the pork shank, which had some delicious carmelized sweet potato and apple with it and, I think some kind of polenta as well. Very tasty and tender. Decent portion.I had an angel food cupcake for dessert, which I though was really blah. The frosting on it was kind of grainy.Overall, I think this is a three and a half star place. I wish I would've tried an appetizer or a different dessert. I liked my meal but I wasn't totally wowed. I'd definitely be willing to try it again. The service was good--the waiter was kind of flirty, in a positive way."
"I've been to Beatrix once for lunch and really enjoyed the meal, especially the tsukune  and the chia pudding, so I decided to try dinner with my husband. He got the beet carpaccio to start (the only complaint being that the portion was too small) and the crab cake special for the main course. I got the spring pea soup to start (delicious!) and the burger on whole wheat toast (really good).  We thought the food was very good although the service was kind of slow. The restaurant seemed particularly crowded and I missed the relaxed vibe I experienced at lunch."
"Another Melman family success! After the sticker shock from the nine dollar coffee, I ordered the Caesar salad and the burger with all the options ticked; avocado, bacon, fried egg, undercoating, floor mats... I'm an up seller's dream customer! Perfectly fried egg, delicious avocado and thick juicy and crunchy bacon. Washed it all down with a banana and dark chocolate latte (which was surprisingly only $5).  After all that caffeine and red meat, I went home and walked the dog. Then I washed the car, cleaned the carpets, painted the house, reshingled the roof and swam across lake Michigan.   Tonight I will dream of bacon burgers, and nine dollar coffees :)"
"Service was great, ambiance and atmosphere was lovely. I ordered the Egg White Omelet and it was good but unfortunately no omelet. All the ingredients were on the side. Additionally the ""avocado"" mentioned in the description seemed to be 1 piece the size of the dime. I would never say the food was bad, but in no means was it good. I'm sorry to say I would not come back here for brunch."
the pancakes are the best I have ever had anywhere.  great service.  great food.  As good as a breakfast can get.
"I rarely go back and raise my rating but after my 4th visit to Beatrix I just had to. I love this place! We went today for lunch and everything was perfect.  I had the special of the crab cake with corn salsa and salad.  It was flavorful and light. Perfect summertime lunch! My partner had the pot roast sandwich. He declared the best sandwich he's ever had.  It was filling though so it's not on the lighter side. Our server, Anthony, was super and spot on with everything. We ended our meal with a couple of cafe freddos and a slice of the caramel pie.Beatrix surprised me on my first visit and each visit afterwards, they just get better. That is a sign of a great restaurant and why this is one of my favorite places."
"My wife and I came here 2 days in a row.  Our hotel recommended it and it was close by.  Had the pancakes both days.  Tried the Quinoa Cakes one day and the Egg White Omelet the other.  Their regular coffee as well as the chai tea latte are quite tasty as well.  Service was excellent both days.  I'd recommend reserving ahead of time for weekends.  Breakfast came to about forty dollars each day for us day so it's not cheap, but oh so worth it!"
"This place is absolutely amazing!  I've been there for breakfast , for coffee and pastries, for lunch and absolutely everything has been fantastic every time. Today was especially great as we had the best server - Taye. He had such a great attitude and really added to our experience. We will definitely be back soon and often!"
"You will not be disappointed by coming here. Great service,  nice atmosphere, and even better food. Unique juices including the blueberry basil which was perfectly sweet and refreshing. We had the kale salad, ahi tuna ""snack,"" and strip steak. All were delicious!"
"Thanks Yelp for directing us here. For the money, this was the best meal we had in Chicago so far. The service was excellent, and we were able to sit outside, which we love. Nice job!"
"Came here with a few friends mid-week.THE GOOD: The space is nice, and there are some interesting and unique options on the menu. They appear to have an amazing selection of pastries and cookies. THE MEH: I have to say, I was a little underwhelmed with the actual food. It wasn't bad, but it just felt very assembly-line, prefab to me - in presentation and in taste. I admit that I haven't been at many Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, and I don't know if this is a thing with them or just this kitchen. It was overall a decent meal and evening. I may give this one another shot to see if it was just an off night."
"I have been here for a private event, with a large group, and just with a girlfriend and all of these experiences have been quite positive. Everything tastes fresh and light - healthy for restaurant food without compromising on taste. The fresh juices are great and you can even make them boozy if you want. :) The staff are always super friendly.If you really want to indulge, the mountains of baked goods should suffice. Overall a great little spot in River North that is reasonably priced."
"We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted a late night drink at a laid back place.  Beatrix looked to be the best option for this.  We picked a spot at the bar and promptly ordered some drinks.Beatrix is a very aesthetically pleasing environment.  The drinks were served in a quick speed and our bartender was just great.  We made plans to come back the next day for brunch, but sadly did not make it.  I can't say anything about the food, but if you are looking for a classy and friendly late evening beverage, consider Beatrix."
"After hearing good reviews I decided to check this place out earlier this week. While the atmosphere is nice...the food is lacking. I ordered a pasta dish and it was bland. Every single bite tasted the same! My dinner mates were not impressed either. While the food needs improvement, the juices and desserts are nice. I ordered a blueberry lychee lemonade that was delightful and a chocolate ginger cookie that was nice as well.Another aspect that bothered me was that when we asked our server for recommendations he really didn't seem to have any and just went down the list describing each one...I can read the menu if I want to know what is available!Dessert and drinks 4 stars. Meal and service 2 stars."
"I came here for brunch last week and for lunch today.Will consolidate reviews.Today, my wife had the Cavatelli and I the Pot Roast Ragu. Both very good and of good size. The roasted beets snack was also nice. Good Bloody Mary (spicy) and lychee-blackberry lemonade. Waitress was the same as last week. Very friendly and accommodating (we needed a place to put the stroller and they were very helpful both times)."
"Warning: This review could be slightly inflated because the special of the day was an AYCE chilaquiles bar.This review is for brunch only.  Beatrix is a cute location to visit for brunch in the area and you don't have to pay ridiculous hotel restaurant/River North prices. Reservations are definitely recommended, else they'll stick you right by the kitchen where your view is of the expediter finishing the garnish on your plate.Besides the chilaquiles we also got the lemon pancakes and the typical breakfast platter of eggs/hash browns/toast and instead of bacon/sausage you can substitute salmon for an extra $2. Good deal.  Everything's just a tad on the oily side.  The lemon pancakes were a tad too wet, but had nice lemon flavor.Our server was very sweet. I would come back to try dinner."
"I came here for breakfast on a Friday morning with my parents, and it was just what the doctor ordered.  I get so sick of the usual breakfast options, and Beatrix has many more unique offerings.  Beautiful, casual design - sort of like eating on a fancy California person's back porch.  The Shakshouka was terrific - eggs poached in tomato sauce with feta and kale.  Hard to decide as all the dishes sounded tasty and inspired!  It was healthy, light, and fresh.  I also got a power greens juice and some turkey sausage to eat later in the day when I knew I wouldn't have time for a bite, and it was terrific.  That juice is amazing!  The celery, mint, and pineapple make it really special.  I'd come back here anytime for an affordable breakfast that's way better than the usual eggs 'n' bacon 'n' pancakes fare!"
"Another weekend in Chicago, another excuse to brunch! I love to brunch, and my latest stop was at Beatrix in Chicago's River North neighborhood. Located next door to the stylish Aloft Hotel, this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant was the perfect place to warm up with a hot cup of coffee (followed by a mimosa) and catch up with friends on a cold, wintery day.First impressions are super important and Beatrix definitely made a good one, both inside and out. The façade is very clean and modern with wood panels warming it up a bit. Inside, the exposed duct work, concrete pillars, and light-colored wood beams made the space feel large and open while the bright pops of color kept it welcoming and familiar. There were a few odd features here and there, but overall I really enjoyed it! Nearly every table was filled so I guess I'm not the only one!After first taking care of drinks (obviously) it was on to the brunch menu. The first thing that caught my eye was the Braised Pot Roast & Egg Sandwich with aged white cheddar and jalapeño relish. With temperatures hovering in the mid 20's, this comfort food option was exactly what I was looking for! The rich and flavorful pot roast with the airy focaccia and the slight kick of the jalapeno relish was delicious and this is definitely what I would order if I returned!As for the rest of the table, we had the Pecan Praline French Toast,  Steak Chimichurri, and Eggs Your Way. In the end, plates were cleaned and everyone was happy, so I'd say we had a pretty successful brunch outing here at Beatrix!"
"I met a friend for brunch at Beatrix on the first Sunny Spring day we had a couple weeks back. We were striking out every other place that had outdoor seating and decided to check this spot out. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the delicious looking bakery. We had previously stopped at Firecakes to fuel our one block walk here, so we passed on the sweets.The brunch was just okay, but maybe we should have ordered something else more exciting. We both had the Prime Burger on whole grain toast with aged white cheddar cheese. The burger didn't really have a flavor to it or maybe it was a lack of seasoning. I also thought the fries it came with weren't that great. Although I always compare any fry I have to the truffle fries at Rockit...so there already going up against some tough competition. We also tried the Ginger snap fresh squeezed juice which was Carrots, Apple, and Ginger. I thought it was quite tasty and not too sweet. This place seems to have gotten decent ratings so I plan to revisit it and explore a different food option and to try out the bakery."
"Beatrix reminds me of khaki pants...dress it up, dress it down, it is a reliable staple.  Gotta have it.Beatrix is located in the Aloft Hotel, but is not your typical hotel coffee shop-ish restaurant. It's a cute little place without screaming Cute Little Place. The atmosphere is family-friendly but date-appropriate, too. The menu is familiar/comfort food-y with a twist...for example, potato salad deviled eggs and turkey, sweet potato, and greens meatloaf. Both of which are quite tasty, by the way. They have awesome fresh juices (and not just for breakfast) and yummy desserts and pastries. If you like caramel, try the caramel pie. If you can,  try to score an angel food muffin. On both my visits, I found our servers to provide the perfect balance of ""knowledgeable/let me tell you about the menu/personable/do you need anything"" and ""I'll leave you alone"".Really, like the khaki pants...I think it's hard to go wrong here.  Beatrix will be a part of my regular downtown rotation."
"Had dinner here during restaurant week.  Food was good, not great but very tasty.  Two of my friends opted to do the restaurant week menu which includes a salad/soup, entree and dessert.  I opted to just order off the menu because what I really wanted wasn't on the restaurant week menu, our bill pretty much came out the same.Two of us ordered the Enlightened Caesar Salad, DO NOT order two of these for two or even three people, the salads are HUGE, definitely enough for three people to share and they don't tell you this.  The salad was very good, they put the dressing on the plate and then the greens on top, it might be too much dressing for most people so beware if you're counting calories even though it's a greek yogurt dressing.  One friend got the butternut squash and apple soup, she said it was very good, it smelled fantastic.We also got the Kennebec Fries, very tasty with the crispy lemon and chiles. For entrees my friends ordered the Pot Roast Ragu with spaghetti squash instead of noodles, a very good option if you're Paleo with the exception of the little bit of cheese on top.  It was very tasty and would have been my choice as well but I have a firm rule about everyone at a table ordering the same entree. :)  I ordered the Slow Braised Short Rib, YUM.  Comes with a balsamic steak sauce, whipped cauliflower instead of potatoes and brussels sprout leaves.  Cauliflower = delish, brussels sprouts = meh.  I for one am ready for the brussels sprout fad to END, much like the kale fad.  It's a bullshit vegetable unless you fry it, in my opinion.My friends got dessert with their menu but I did not order one.  The Oh My! Caramel Pie was very tasty, nice flavor and crunchy crust.  The Tall, Dark & Handsome Chocolate Cake was good but not great.  I'm not a big chocolate dessert fan but the cake and the pie put together was very yummy.Drinks were good, a few craft cocktails on the menu were very nice and seasonal.  The Cherry Chia Mojito was very good, nice and tart with the chia seeds at the bottom.  The Wow! Black Cherry Sangria was also nice, a little too sweet but a nice tart flavor.  The Blackberry Lemon Drop was also good, nice flavor.I'd definitely recommend Beatrix but it's pretty loud in the restaurant as it's adjacent to the hotel lobby.  The tables are SO close together I felt badly for the waitstaff and for us when we had to hear every word of the suburban housewives out on the town's conversations at the table behind us."
"Beatrix has a very open feel to it. The space has a bar on one side and flows into the Aloft hotel lobby opposite. It's clean, modern and pretty. There's also a pastry display on one wall with beautiful cookies, cupcakes, croissants, etc. At that display they also have a board advertising juices and bulletproof coffee ($9 a cup). We had breakfast there a couple of times during our week in Chicago and dinner there once. Their menus are not large, but they are thoughtful and offer a variety of choices. Most tastes and diets would be satisfied here. Our servers were all competent and pleasant. The meals came out promptly, particularly the breakfasts. The food was as described and ordered, although at the last breakfast, toast was black along the edges and the requested lightly poached eggs were not runny, just soft. That was the only meal where I wondered if the person(s) preparing/plating the meals cared what they were doing."
"Vey good. We started with the power greens beverage which has kale, romaine, celery and apples. Very energizing. The eggs white omelette was light and filling. My partner had the lemon pancakes and he was extremely pleased. We also had some fresh fruit and berries with the ten grain oatmeal. The ambiance makes for a quaint yet contemporary experience. The waitstaff were attentive and extremely welcoming."
"SUPERRoom Service Quick and Easy! Faster than any room service I have ever received ANYWHERE!Friendly!EfficientCHEAPLIKE How are they making money CHEAP.SUPER SUPER Breakfast Sandwich with plenty of TOMATO (the most under appreciated breakfast component in the USA.YUMMMThank you.Please I am not sure if this place is local, chain, franchise etc - LOVE."
"I went to Beatrix for my birthday (which is on New Years Eve) and really enjoyed the food, relaxed atmosphere, and service. They have a few tasty vegetarian options which is a bonus since my husband is a vegan."
"I came here in a party of 8, right as Beatrix opened on the Saturday after Black Friday 2014. A friend found Beatrix on Yelp! and we were perhaps 15 minutes early to their opening hours. Someone opened the doors for us and told us that their brunch service wouldn't be open for an hour, but that we were welcome to warm up and have a coffee. Complimentary pastries found their way to our table. Already, the service was excellent.Eventually, about an hour after Beatrix opened, we were hungry and began to order. Most of us ordered mimosas, and their three mimosas they were offering were absolutely fantastic. Fresh squeezed valencia orange juice, strawberry juice, and blueberry juice combined with basil were the three juice options to be combined with their champagne. All three were absolutely fantastic and delicious (and they didn't skimp on the champagne).Our server/waitress was very friendly and didn't seem bothered to talk to a somewhat buzzed to almost drunk party of eight. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, providing her personal recommendations and giving opinions on other dishes when asked. She also took a group photo for us. I personally ordered their lemon pancakes. I don't recall the exact name of the dish but the result were these heavenly, light, mild pancakes that were filling yet not heavy in the stomach. Fresh candied lemon rind, lemon syrup, and fresh blackberries alongside, it was a wonderful breakfast after hours of walking around Chicago for Black Friday.The atmosphere is very modern, yet rustic, and lends well to any situation. It can be a romantic setting for couples, a friendly setting for families, and a quiet respite for anyone who needs a cup of excellent coffee and their newspaper. I don't normally make my way to Chicago for food, but I will definitely return here and must recommend it to anyone in the area. Gluten free options, vegan options, so on and so forth. Inexpensive and well sized portions, as well as a full bar round out this excellent dining spot in River North."
"Big fan!!   **dinner review**Friend made resos here.  Not sure why but my impression prior to going was ""meh"".  Trendy, smallish plates places have seriously sprung up like rabbits.  There are a handful of other places I thought I'd rather try first.   Well.  I was wrong.  This understated, gem of a place is fantastic.  Did I mention they take resos??  Yessss.Food:  A1. Quinoa Cakes: ANot my cup of tea, but they were delicious & great texture2. Straight A Salad: BSolid greens & taste.  Nothing to write home about, but exactly what I'm looking for when wanting to add a lil greens before the main deal.  Tasty & light.  (Shared w/ table)3. Skirt Steak Chimichurri: ASo... I originally wanted the slow braised pork.  They were sold out?!  I begrudgingly got the steak.  Ohhh God was shining kindly upon me.  B/c it was AMAZING.  Perfectly cooked (medium rare), strong, wonderful flavor.  Fries were crispy.  4. Caramel Pie: A Coerced by all the other yelp reviewers.  Ohhhh twist my arm!  Not usually a fan of pie, but love caramel  Really captured the caramel.  If you like caramel, this is a must try.  Other people got:They would prob rate higher (I'd prob not order the below)  So, grain of salt.  =)5. Turkey Neatloaf: B6. Egg & Truffle Pasta: B Drinks: B+  (p.s. I don't drink sweet) =)1. Carrot, apple & Ginger juice + Rye whiskey, served up w/ extra ginger juice.  A.  2. Vodka Martini w Twist: A  (hey!  I'm picky about this one & they did gooood)3. Blueberry Tom Collins: B  Too sweet, but my GF's loved it.Atmos/Service:Walked in & was a little put off (kind of reminded me of juicer or corner bakery).  I.e. looked more like a lunch spot than a dinner one.  But the rest of the area was nice. Connected to a hotel, which actually added to a cool vibe. Wouldn't bring a 1st date here though.  Was the first to arrive, so bee-lined it to the bar.  Bartender was great!  Patiently explained the drinks (you can add booze to freshly squeezed juices) & let me try a few.  Always wondered why more bars didn't pick up on that sooner (boozicing).   Service was good.   Summary: The dinner food is really, really solid.  The price point is amazing for the quality of food.  If I lived closer, this would become part of my regular rotation.  Needless to say, I'll be back.  Their motto: ""Taste over trend"".    Sold!"
"Great spot, great food.  Didn't love the spaghetti squash that the pot roast was served upon (it was undercooked), hence the 4 star.   The roast was very flavorful and feel apart!  I've been told the pot roast is best on the brunch menu as a sandwich so I'll have to try that next. Really fair pricing on wine, and a nice selection of craft cocktails.  Highly recommend the beets for a starter!  Can't wait to go back."
"I was in Chicago for the weekend and needed some sustenance after a day of shopping. I called in around 4pm and the place was only a quarter full. I ordered the hummus plate to start, one of their delicious salads for the main and finished the meal off with a cup of coffee. The setting, food and service were excellent - I will be back!"
"My fiancé and I recently went gluten free for health reasons and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to dine out as frequently as we had been accustomed to. After researching GF restaurants, we found a lot of great reviews on Beatrix. Not only did they have a variety of GF options, but everything we tried was flavorful and delicious!"
"I find that the food is spotty at Beatrix.  I loved it like crazy the first 4 times I went, but last night, the kale salad was incredibly underdressed and too dry.  The papaya was mealy, and the drinks were blander than the last several times."
"I had previously been here for a business lunch. It was very enjoyable-- ""hip"" vibe, interesting menu, healthy food, big windows in front that open up so there is a lot of light. Incredibly accommodating and attentive with food allergy limitations/questions... The manager even sent me a ""thank you for visiting"" card since I'm LEYE gold card holder.  Today I came for brunch. Huge disappointment!! Firstly, their coffee grinder broke. (wtf, go to bloomies and buy another) Then they were out of 2 things on the menu (mind you the menu has about 12 items on it for brunch). Then they were out of the juice I wanted.... ""Oh sorry we had a busy breakfast.""  (Why do restaurants not expect to be busy for Sunday brunch? This I will not understand...)  I ended up getting the chilaquiles, which was at a ""serve yourself"" station near the back. Why it was serve yourself I don't know. Fun? Not really, all my peeps got their food and I was the weird one given an empty plate, having to leave the conversation to get my food, to walk past the hostess/people waiting with that awkward empty plate, and back to the busy service/kitchen area for the small spread. (BTW the open kitchen was wayyy too messy looking.) The buffet table needed to be wiped down, and even there 2/6 toppings were empty. Ugh.This being said--- I still really like the menu! The location (decently easy street parking). The food is excellent and fresh. Waitstaff and hostesses are quick and nice. So, I will probably be back, although gritting my teeth/blood pressure up.It also looks like it's a nice place for groups (big tables), but beware it is SO (almost unbearably) LOUD."
"Food was excellent, drinks were fantastic (the whiskey sour was one of the best I've ever had), service was swift and professional, and the price was very reasonable. We will definitely return."
"I've been here twice because I really wanted to love this place. It's adorable and it's a lettuce entertain you place, so I was optimistic going into it! Both times were just ok. Service is average. And again, I wanted to love the service too! Server was nice. But, when I asked what options existed for gluten free items, there just wasn't much effort put forth. (Both times.)  And that doesn't usually happen. Most servers are so helpful around this topic. So, I think the ambiance is cute. And if were meeting someone for coffee, I'd consider going here again. But, I'd probably pass on a meal. Not sure about the pastries cuz i didn't have any. They look awesome, so I suppose worth trying if that's on your diet. I'd probably go somewhere else for breakfast. And if by chance my path crosses this place again, and my experience is better, I'll update my review!"
"Totally surprised by what awaited me at Beatrix.  First, the decor and atmosphere is A+.  Beautiful, two bars, understated televisions (in other words, it doesn't look like a sports bar), huge open windows, so you feel like you're outside on a cold Chicago day (including THIS summer).  Very simple menu.  Both of us had the salmon dish -- my salmon had a black sesame seed crust -- YUMMY!  Was like a blackened crust, with a kick.  We had a delightful Temprenillo wine.  Everything that the server, Angela, recommended was excellent. And she was a great server, everything was just perfect.  I would return to Beatrix time and time again.  Service and food were excellent."
"Beatrix is awesome. We've been here a dozen times since moving to Chicago and love it. The flavors they bring out in the food is incredible. I don't understand how someone cooks a pork shank so perfectly.Absolutely love their fresh juices paired with alcohol. I usually get the ginger, apple, carrot with whiskey and its delicious. BUT if theres a drink you want that isn't on the menu, they are more than happy to whip it up for you - and it'll be really good. Love the kale salad, the pasta, pork - always excited to see the menu change during the seasons. The pricing is good, the environment is great - and the staff is always super helpful. ALSO - they gave us a free slice of caramel pie once, and it was.. stupid how good it was. I've never had caramel pie before, but damn. We just went to the girl and the goat, after waiting a month for a reservation (literally) and i have to say, I would eat a thousand times at Beatrix and never again at the girl and the goat. Beatrix has flavor, perfectly cooked meat, and amazing everything else."
"I don't think I've ever left a restaurant completely ""amazed"" but I definitely did here. My boyfriend and I were looking to get a bite to eat before a movie on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait long to get seated. I've had there lunch that was pretty tasty but their dinner was just awesome and the service was even better! Our waitress was awesome and made sure our food was just right! I'm pretty weak when it comes to spicy food so she talked to the chef and he made a different sauce to go with my meal. Overall, very impressed and we had a very pleasant experience."
Amazing!!!!  Perfect place for a business lunch...  Beet salad was to die for (pistachio pesto... YES please)!  Service was great and food was beyond good!
"Had Easter brunch here and it was great - we had the freshly made juices, the excellent coffee, the healthy and delicious oatmeal and less healthy but not any less delicious meat and egg sandwich (something like short rib) - AMAZING, then lemon pancakes - unbelievably good and soft and even though I did not think I could eat anymore - I ate the whole plate of them; then we also had yogurt with fruit and granola - thick and fresh with vanilla bean seeds - so yummy.  Everything was perfectly made and presented.  Service was excellent too - I would highly recommend."
"Awesome.We ""had"" to sit at the bar for brunch, and had The Best Bartender Ever - but while you may not got the seven-star service that we got, you will certainly get the seven-star brunch/lunch/whatever . . . this is a destination place, no matter where you're staying.Great! Fantastic! Wonderful! What - you're going to go to Shake Shack? Fugeddaboudit! Beatrix is where you want to be!"
"Came here with coworkers for brief meeting and light dinner. Loved the atmosphere, decorations, and food.  Server is making sure that you have water filled in your cup the whole time.  All around good place to come with a loved one, family,  or friends."
"Sub-par breakfast...Came here on MLK Day for the first time. I had the eggs your way and my friend had the waffles. We both tried the mango, orange and pineapple nectar. The juices were fantastic. You can tell they're fresh squeezed and they're perfectly blended.The food, on the other hand, was just okay. The hash browns taste like they come from a frozen bag and the turkey sausage was nothing special. My friend's waffles were also just okay. The place itself is cute... I really wanted to like the food, but it was pretty underwhelming. Would go again to try out their dinner, but would probably skip brunch and instead go to one of the many great brunch places in the area."
"Cheers guys, Pat S. Here.The other day my mother, Frinda, and my father, Skinny Pete, offered to take me out to dinner. Of course I accepted their generous offer. I suggested we go to the new Let-Us-Enner-Tain U® Restaurant, BEATRIX. My dad became furious, and after a brutal spanking I was grounded for four weeks.Four weeks later, Frinda and Skinny Pete approached me with the same offer. I again suggested BEATRIX and was once again banished. I am 34 years old and lost my job because of this. Another four weeks passed and I no longer had a job and having my parents pay for a meal was more important than anything. I again suggested BEATRIX. Apparently my father was in a pretty serious para-sailing accident while I was grounded. Reservations to BEATRIX were booked!!The major problem with BEATRIX is that it isn't actually a restaurant, but a hotel lobby. They trick you. I'm not sure what they're trying to go for here. You got big globe lamps and chairs that are hideous colors and also shaped like eggs. Maybe this is where the chef lays his eggs. There are TVs showing ""news"" and idk 3 stars"
"I've only been here for dinner, but everything was delicious.  I started with deviled eggs, which were unique and tasty.  For dinner I had the caramelized pork shank, which was reaaaallly good.  The sauce was perfectly sweet and savory, and it was cooked perfectly.  I wish I'd had room for dessert!  Maybe next time.  I really liked the ambiance as well."
"Very very good!! Came downtown on a Tuesday night and had reservations for 6:15, which were not necessary-there were only a handful of people there when we arrived. Nice location inside the aloft hotel, and loved the homey-yet-modern feel. They have a nice little cafe for coffee and pastries with seating in the back of the restaurant. Our waitress was very friendly! She also recommended their new roasted beet dish, which had a nice pistachio pesto to compliment them. cool combo of flavors. For dinner, I had the turkey neatloaf accompanied by braised kale and mashed potatoes. The neatloaf was cooked together with sweet potatoes and served with a vegetable gravy, and was a delicious, lighter, take on a classic. The kale had a great flavor-not bitter at all. Mashed potatoes good, but were not particularly special. Would have loved to try dessert, but we were stuffed! A nice restaurant with healthy options and a great menu! Would love to try their brunch menu!"
"Love their kale salad. Very good. Also a good seasonal item is their chicken kebab served like a gyro. Get it while you can! Noelle, the server, is also super nice and accommodating.Update: the more I frequent the restaurant, the more and more impressed I am with the food and staff. Strong level of quality control (the food is done well every time, all the time), and their entire wait staff is friendly. Management even reaches out to check in on guests and maintains a high level of hospitality."
"Lettuce Entertain You's Chef Susan Weaver, Chef Rita Dever, and Chef John Chiakulas combined their efforts to create this trendy hip and fresh neighborhood food spot all created in Lettuce Entertain You's test kitchen. This place should inspire other neighborhoods to have a similar place for its quick order to go coffee and breakfast to the fast one hour lunches to the lively causal dinners. Did I mention that Beatrix is Aloft Chicago's hotel restaurant? Maybe other hotels across this country should take some inspiration as well. Their coffee bar is made from one of the two best Chicago coffee roasters: Intelligentsia and Metropolis. Their daily freshly baked pastries should keep the likes of Panera Bread and (former Lettuce Entertain You brand) Corner Bakery on their toes. Lunch has been great every time plus they seem to know I am always there bringing clients and co-workers by making sure I keep my lunches within an hour. I never feel pressured or rushed at any moment. If you go there as much as I have, you should see slight changes of their menu due to new menu items to what is fresh at the time. I have had their Three Grain & Arugula Salad with Miller Farm's Chicken, Pot Roast Sandwich, and Prime Burger. Their freshly made juices from fresh fruits and vegetables is a must. Even in the middle of a cold Chicago winter, you will feel like you just were transported to warm summer day in Chicago with their cool refreshing juices. For dinner, this place becomes a relaxing casual place and this is when the wine bar opens up with their sample selection that feels like it was stolen from the wine cellars of Wildfire. Their Caramelized Pork Shank and Chili & Chocolate Glazed Salmon are amazing. The service has been amazing through and through. So why the knock on service? I have tried many times to setup an event as small as 16 people and they seem to not want the business. I have reached out to Events Manager directly and thy failed to get back to me in a reasonable time. I have even dined and asked for that person. I would be told they were there but they never stop by my table to speak to me. This is where they forced me to take some of my small events to other places like The Pump Room. The serving staff and food will keep my coming by with small company. So for parties, steer clear. From clients to dates, this place is made for it. Get a working lunch done. Come back for after work drinks. Then come back once more to have your dinner date. Maybe you will need a room at Aloft Chicago on the other side of the restaurant to close the night.Food - 5Décor - 5Service - 4"
"Good food, good wait staff and bussers, but terrible host stand .  Several open tables still a half hour wait."
"This place is very friendly. The music, food and service are all relaxed and fun.I had the gazpacho and pot roast. Have you ever had in your mind what you wanted and then tasted and experienced it? That was my meal. It was exactly what I wanted.The pot roast was rich in flavor and not full of fat or gristle. The kale and cauliflower were delicious as well. The gazpacho was light but not lacking flavor."
"I continue to go back there and be impressed by the food and the service. Everyone is so personable and it seems as though they really enjoy working there.I am not a fan of things pretending to be something they are not, which is why I don't often like vegan dishes with meat-like proteins. However, their green tacos, veggie crab cakes and quinoa burgers are flavorful and not pretending to be their meat counterparts. It makes it super easy to try to eat like I care about my body at least a little without sacrificing taste."
Beatrix is awesome I really love the coffee bar specially getting Tropiano Machiattto  with nonfat foam. our waitress was awesome. Lauren And baristas Sissy and Mason rock as does hostess Jackie.  We really enjoyed the friendly staff and the green enchiladas. Sandra rocks too!
"My husband and I went for dinner and overall it was a great experience. We started with the chicken meatballs which were extremely delicious. I had the pork shank for dinner which was fabulous. The portion size was huge and the taste was excellent. My husband had order envy (it happens a lot). My husband ordered the strip steak which he said was fine but nothing ground breaking or memorable. The environment was nice, the doors were open all around and created a great feel throughout the restaurant. We were going out for drinks after so we didn't try any cocktails here but we definitely made a note to go back to try the drinks. As many have noted, Beatrix makes all of their own juices in house and they have lots of cocktails made with their juices. Our meal was a bit pricey but generally on par with the other restaurants in the area. We would go back for a date night or to take guests out to a nice meal."
"Love it here! The food is great (especially the weekend brunch and coffee!), the waitstaff is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and cool. (For example, ""The General"" by Dispatch circa 1998 is currently playing.) There are two different bars and seating areas, that mash up well in the center. It's attached to the Aloft, but it doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant. It's on it's way to becoming my favorite neighborhood stop-in."
"My co-workers and I threw a surprise shower at Beatrix yesterday and really enjoyed the experience. I made a reservation on Open Table and noted we would be celebrating, they were kind enough to give us a very large table and to set it back away from the hustle and bustle toward the front of the restaurant. For our appetizers we went with the fries, quinoa cakes, and two hummus plates. Everything was really delectable and I appreciated the portion sizes of each appetizer. Our group of 8 was more than satiated with four appetizers among us. Everyone also seemed to truly enjoy their meals, people tried the chicken sandwich, chopped salad, salmon, and ahi tuna and there were no complaints.My only negative on Beatrix is that it took quite some time for our waiter to come over to take our drink and appetizer orders. I would've appreciated him being a little more proactive, especially considering his section did not seem overly full. Overall it was a positive experience and I really enjoyed the ambiance and food at Beatrix."
"Ambiance: huge space.. place was busy on a Saturday morning, which is to be expected for a popular brunch placeService: wait wasn't terrible.. but after we got seated, the waiter never came by to take our orders-- or even give us waters... we notified the hostess, and the manager came by and apologized and offered to pay for our breakfast, which was nice.. Im still giving it 4 stars since they tried to make up for that Food: Got the lemon ricotta pancakes-- fluffy and delicious.. came with blackberries and a syrup to put on the pancakes-- not too sweet either..  Latte was perfectly foamy"
"Went here for brunch with my sister yesterday for the first time. Delicious, nice decor, friendly service...I'll definitely be back!It was Saturday brunch time, but we got a seat pretty quickly. Highly recommend the ""Blue Boost"" juice: blueberry, white grape, & basil. Might sound a bit odd, but it was yummy!The egg white omelet was good, but it was the addition of the turkey bacon and their little tomato-avocado salsa that made it really good. (PS, Beatrix, this Jew thanks you for using turkey bacon!)My sister had the quinoa cakes, which were also very, very good."
"Oatmeal+brown sugar bacon=DELICIOUS. I came here twice in the same week on vacation. I love the ambience, the food, and we had a wonderful server both times, Chris, who just started here. My husband tried the bullet-proof coffee is rich and tasted good, but not $9-cup-of-coffee good. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!"
"Beatrix is amazing. Just ate here for the first time with my parents the experience was fantastic. We started with the deviled eggs and kale salad (one of the best salads I've ever had). Both delicious. Dad got the pork shank, mom got the chicken and I got the fish. They were all wonderful. My fish did come out cold twice but I couldn't resist eating it the second time and finished the plate. The staff was aware of the temperature issue and did more than just compensate the meal which they didn't need to. First off at least 3 people made sure to let me know that a new fish was coming and apologized. I honestly wasn't even mad but they made me feel like they cared so much. Cassandra the manager not only came to our table to apologize but comped the fish plate and gave us two of their amazing home made desserts (recommend the caramel pie!) Over all this place beat my expectations on service, atmosphere and food. I can't say enough how the customer service blew me out of the water. Thank you Beatrix staff I will be back for brunch in the near future!"
"Stopped in for coffee and dessert.  The caramel pie was deliciously decadent, and I loved that it was served alongside a huge dollop of fresh real whipped cream, some of which I proceeded to put in my coffee!  Also, I was sitting at the coffee bar and the server was wonderfully attentive; she refilled my coffee like five times without me ever having to ask.  Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu."
"I'm real into this restaurant! The service and the food were great! The fresh juices were delicious and all the food items are equally creative, healthy, and delicious! Loved it!"
"Fresh healthy choices. I am getting the spicy chicken tinga.  Fresh juices like blueberry, white grape and badil.  I tried the ginger snap and it is great. Michele got the watermelon strawberry and she's enjoying it.  The music is good and it's not terribly noisy in here yet it is a huge industrial space that looks like it could seat 150 people and it's full.Stop by the Anti - cruelty one block west and save a life.  They'll be very grateful."
Dropped in for lunch on Tuesday. No problem getting in.  Service was very good.  We loved the pot roast sandwich.  Fries with it were quite good.  The hummus was decent--the pita (on the menu they called it naan) was good.  The tsunke with chili sauce was good--greagt sauce. I felt the chicken meatballs were a tad bit greasy.  The blackberry-basil smash was delightful.
"Caramel Pie. Delish!!! Also, you can get fresh juices there for breakfast. And Bullet Proof coffee. Wonderful place."
"I came to Beatrix because I was looking at places to meet a friend near the mart. A co-worker recommended Beatrix, plus I've never had a bad experience with Ley. So we gave it a shot.We had no reservations but were meeting for dinner on a Wednesday night at 6PM, so I didn't think there's be any trouble-- there wasn't. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very attentive. Although he spoke really fast, he was knowledgable! He gave us his recommendations on appetizers, entrees, fresh squeezed juices and brews. I ordered the crunchy kale salad with chicken and my friend ordered the burger. She said it was good, but I didn't try it. Looked pretty decent though. My salad was great, although I didn't necessarily like the crunchy kale part. It seemed a bit too saturated in oil. As long as I picked around those pieces, the mixture of dates, papaya, pumpkin seeds, parmesean, kale and green was really pleasing. We didn't get desserts, but everything look pretty good.Not too expensive for a River North restaurant, good service and healthy options. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but would definitely go back!"
"We stopped in to meet other friends in town and the braised short-ribs with roasted Brussels sprout pedals and a cauliflower puree was delicious. We thought we would just grab something quick, but turned out to be pretty good, overall."
"Another Lettuce venture that works. From grade level parking lot to fine purveyor of turkey burgers, this spot is comfy, friendly and conveniently located downtown. Not sure what the sauce is but is a sweet and sour-y treat. Kudos for offering that tasty, moist quinoa salad as a French fry alternative. Lunch at the bar is a treat and be sure to check out that hunky server with the bedroom smile. And those huge chocolate chip cookies at the dessert bar. Nom! :-)"
"I went to Beatrix over the weekend for brunch and the place is packed. We had a reservation for 3 people, but  they won't sit us until everyone got there. Otherwise, I would have given them a 5 star. I had the waffles and they were cute and delicious!"
"We had the pork shank, AMAZING! The caramel pie was the perfect ending to the night. The music was good, a cool vibe. Cocktails were good too!"
"Wow. This place was really, really good!! Food was top notch.  I found this place via Yelp ;) because it was within walking distance of our hotel (The Godfrey).  It's listed as new American, so the menu is ""normal"" food you would find but with a twist.  The menu is pretty small, but, complete.  Upon entering we were greeted and taken to our seats.  Mine was part of a SUPER comfy couch which was a welcome relieve after walking around downtown Chicago all day.  I ordered a pot-roast and my sig-o picked the chicken dish.  The pot-roast was ah-mazing.  Perfect portion size and cooked to perfection.  It melted in your mouth and fell apart with the fork.  I ate the whole thing!  I had a piece of chicken and it was super moist and very flavorful.  We took the chocolate cake to go.  It was soooo rich and delicious!! Very cool and hip interior.  Had some neat exposed wood beams and lots of mood lighting.  Since this is a new age place there was a ""wine"" bottle contraption with water on our table.  Various employees would fill our cups as needed, which I personally find awkward though it is good customer service :)If I came here again I probably would bump it up at 5 stars!  YUMMY!!!"
"Came here in the middle of the brunch rush on a Sunday morning and had a great experience. I made reservations ahead of time and was so happy I did. It's big enough that they move through the line of people waiting for a table quickly, but all the better to avoid it!I had the quinoa cakes with poached eggs. Almost all protein. Very delicious and very healthy, a perfect meal for getting back into the swing of things in January!  My friend had the chilaquila buffet, and said that was fantastic, also.Overall, the crowd was a pretty standard Chicago brunch crowd. Mostly trendy 20 and 30 somethings, but also a teenage girl's birthday party and a few families with children. Drinks are available, but it was a little more polished than the boozy brunches you're likely to find in Old Town or Wicker Park. Quiet enough for chatting, but enough going on for good people watching."
"Went here last night for the first time with some girlfriends and had a great time! This place is very hip. People still say ""hip"" yeah? I got there early for reservations and had a lovely malbec at the bar. Bartender was very friendly and attentive. When my friends arrived we were promptly seated, and our server was great. I got the chicken bebe - yum! It's got this wonderful parmesan/lemon breading going. Although it doesn't come out crispy, only minor complaint. Tastes amazing though, and is served with asparagus. We then split a slice of their chocolate cake. Oh, man. SO good. Overall a wonderful experience. A bit pricey, yes, but being downtown and getting great service/food, you get what you pay for. Will be back for their brunch!"
"Creative healthy food is an interesting concept. Tried the cauliflower Milanese, something I've never tried before, and it was quite a pleasant surprise. The outside was nice & crispy and the inside was cooked perfectly. Avocado salad was nice but a tad overdressed (read:oily). Friend's gazpacho was refreshing and silky smooth. The apple strudel dessert was fantastic: perfectly flaky and warm. I'm usually not a healthy eater but this place I'd happily return."
"Loved my girls' brunch here last weekend! They seem to cater to those who are interested in healthier foods, and I think that's great!I ordered the quinoa cakes and the green juice and was SUPER pleased with both.  I was expecting a type of pancake when it came to the quinoa cakes, but they turned out to be fritter-like patties and were really filling and flavorful.  The green juice was really fresh and make me feel healthy and light. Yummy. The only knock I have on this place is that it's a liiiiiitle pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
"Those Melman Bros sure are taking over Chicago's restaurant scene. Light meal options, love that. Crispy Kale salad is great, light, just the right amount is flavor & a generous portion. Quinoa app was good but a little spicy so beware if you don't want spice. Atmosphere open and comfortable. Feels like a large trendy diner in a way. They had a great list of healthy fresh juice options that looked really refreshing. Great place for lunch and ok for dinner. We wanted a light dinner so it worked out perfect for us."
"Beatrix is A-OK.  The good:  the lunch food is good (although the portions can be small for the price).  The drinks/juices are great.  They have lots of healthy options, if you're into that kind of thing.The great:  THE COFFEE BAR.  What a great idea for a restaurant!  The coffee area is a great place to grab dessert (with Lettuce Points) after dinner.  My fiance is obsessed with their triple chocolate cookies.  A+The bad:  portions are small for the price.  Otherwise, totally fine.  The food is not mind blowing, but certainly not bad either."
"Mediocrity at its best! I don't intend to write a scathing review here, but talk about disappointment and the most hum-drum dinner! For the glitz, glam, hype, and location, I figured Beatrix would hit the 4-star mark automatically. And while you could argue my experience might have been influenced by high expectations... no, this was legit boring: food, ambiance, service. We were a party of four sitting at an eight-top that was amendable for sharing. No big deal. There was a movable mini-wall to separate the other party next to us. Now our issue with the server was not her personality, but lack of knowledge. For their specialty fruit juice cocktails, you can add a shot to ""spike"" these non-alcoholic drinks for $5. She didn't know exactly what vodka brand was their standard shot and didn't know if it cost more if you wanted premium stuff like Grey Goose. Part of me said to myself, ""Well, it's only been a week since they opened,"" but part of me said, ""No. No. You need to be on top of your game from day 1."" So I'm half-forgiving... For round two of drinks, she didn't know what ""neat"" meant in ""whiskey neat"" when our friend ordered it. It came out on the rocks, and when the bill came at the end of the meal, that ""whiskey neat"" was $21. (See below.)The fresh juice cocktails which look appetizing on paper were not exciting. I'm pretty sure Trader Joe's makes better fruit juices. My watermelon & strawberry cooler with vodka tasted like a drink I'd make at a house party. And yes, it's ""fresh juice"" but come on, take out the watermelon seeds. I sincerely hope it wasn't placed there to make it look ""all natural."" My boyfriend ordered a blackberry & lychee lemonade with vodka. Also banal.The food: I really hope their first 30 days is a trial run deciding what works and doesn't work. We ordered kennebec fries with the soft poached egg mayo for a starter. The fries were... fries. It was barely enough for two people. The mayo was pretty good though; a slight lemon essence. All of us agreed there was no purpose for that poached egg in the middle of the fries. Did they put that there just to make it more exciting since a lot of people like eggs? It didn't contribute to the flavors anyway. We ordered the quinoa cakes. Boy those quinoa cakes were so small I'm pretty sure a child would still be starved after downing those. These weren't ""starters."" These were hors d'oeuvres for a supermodels' party. The grape tomatoes were practically the same size as these cakes. The chicken n pudding was probably my favorite of the three dishes. I liked the quiche-like leek bread pudding and the chicken was nicely fried, seasoned well, and boneless! I do wish the portion was larger. The poached farm egg & truffled pasta was cream sauce overkill. The brown butter asparagus was lovely, but that brown butter combined with the massive amount of thin parmesan shavings just made me feel gross after three bites. Flavors-wise it was good, but it was just too rich: egg yolk, cheese, cream sauce, brown butter, dense pasta... ooof! The chili & chocolate glazed salmon was alright. We agreed the salmon was a tad overcooked. The flavors were fine... the chocolate was very subtle. And while the presentation encouraged taco-making, the tortillas (again with their ""food accessories"") were out of place. Desserts: there's a pastry and coffee bar. The pastries (though some looked good like the honey bran muffin and lemon sugar cookies) looked like something I could get at Panera. All desserts on the menu are gluten-free. We ordered the flour-less chocolate cake and chia seed pudding. I was ABSOLUTELY ready for this chia seed pudding after seeing a beautifully photographed presentation from the Yelp photos. When it came out, it looked nothing like the lovely photo. Instead, it looked like salsa verde with the texture of a poorly made tapioca pudding. It was just not very nice to look at... and the flavors didn't make up for its unappetizing presentation. I felt duped! The cake was fine and they used good quality chocolate. We also heard the table next to us complain about the cinnamon roll being dry which says something about their pastries lying out all day. The bill: As you read earlier, they did not warn our friend of the $21 whiskey neat price. When he raised concerns to the server, she said ""Maybe because it's not on the rocks that's why it's more expensive?"" It's the same portion of whiskey whether or not it's on ice. Again, nice server, but that was absurd. They rightfully adjusted the cost knowing that was a bit obscene and mispriced. Beatrix is wonderfully appointed (nice browns and tans on the furniture... green ferns... unique lighting...) and they opened the windows last night since its summer. But it was a little too chilly for them to do that. In sum, I hope others who try Beatrix find it more *positively* memorable than we did."
"My husband and I had the privilege of dining at this fabulous restaurant last night and everything we ordered was top notch, which is pretty rare for us to say. To start I ordered the ginger sangria which was sweet and refreshing and a unique take on traditional sangria. As an appetizer we shared the tuna crudo, which was incredibly fresh and delicious and the chili sauce added the perfect amount of spice without too much heat. I just wish the portion wasn't so small!For dinner we had the branzino and the chicken. My fish was buttery and topped with a perfectly browned brioche crust. Oh.my.god. I don't even get excited about fish but now I'm thinking about how I can make this at home. My husband's chicken was tender and juicy and the parmesan breading was an excellent combination with the garlic white wine sauce. We both finished every last bite and we joked that if he gave us a few more minutes, our waiter might have found us both licking our plates. Because neither of us seem to have any self control, we ordered dessert! When it arrived, the caramel pie is not exactly the prettiest dessert. It looks a little brown and sad. But just forget about that and take a bite, because whoa....that was an incredibly rich and smooth caramel bite. And the crust! I'm not a pie crust fan, but this crust was made from shortbread cookies and I couldn't stop eating it. The house made whipped cream on the side balanced out the sweetness of the pie and there were several bites where there was only the whipped cream on my fork. Yum.We'll definitely be back! This place has just made my top 5 list."
"Rounded up to 3.5 stars.  I was surprised by the mixed reviews for this new LEYE restaurant, but decided to try it anyways.  I went here with two friends and we decided to share everything. This place (like most LEYE) is not your typical trendy small plates sharing type of place.We started with the tsukune (meatballs) which were DELISH. Good portion too for snacks. Came with 4 meatballs.Then we shared the special which was a cauliflower milanese with roasted red peppers, peppercorn aioli, and a nice salad with arugula and avocado. The second dish was ""neatloaf"" with turkey, sweet potato and kale. This was so different and really tasty. The potatos served with it were awesome. Great consistency. The last dish was the chili and chocolate salmon. This was awesome--different! Served with tortillas, lime and a great green salsa. Since this was a birthday celebration, they brought me a carmel pie. It was INCRED. However, I took it to go and they didnt give me the whipped cream to go with it. BUMMER. Solid new LEYE spot. Focuses on healthy food and seems like food you could recreate at home which I really liked. Service was quick."
John is awesome! The food and drinks are so fresh and delicious. Our new favorite spot. Great music too.
"Quaint and modern, Beatrix is a wonderful breakfast spot.Our table of 4 arrived in time for our reservation and were seated immediately. We noticed it was still quiet; however, it was an early Saturday morning ~ 10:00am.Service was fantastic, catering to some specific needs for the blended juices and mimosas.  We ordered the egg white omelet ($11.95), waffles ($10.95) and the MOST fluffiest and lightest pancakes ($10.95). They were delicious, yet not over filling and the lemon flavour was perfect. When I saw the large plate I thought I could never finish....but had no problems. The lemon syrup kept drawing me in!We were impressed with Beatrix and a spot I could visit every weekend."
This is my first time going to this restaurant and it's a part of lettuce entertain you restaurant. The restaurant is really nice from the outside and inside. The food was good but the portion wasn't enough compare to the other brunch places I have gone to. The prices was reasonable but not enough to eat for what u would pay for. I don't think I would come back here unless someone who I know have never try it want to try it.
"Fantastic food, phenomenal service!Cavatelli w/ slow-roasted veggies - Delicious, has a subtle kick to it, perfect vegas optionBrioche Crusted Branzino - 2nd best dish all night. The fish is light and paired perfectly with the accoutrements. Slow-braised short ribs - A bit on the dry side, but the whipped cauliflower and balsamic steak sauce fixed that problemCaramalized Pork shank  - best dish we had all night. The meat falls right off the bone and is seasoned to perfection. Caramel Pie - GET THIS. Our server described it as transcending... and it was. Chia pudding - VEGAN!! and delicious. The coconut milk is fantastic. It's almost like a tapioca pudding substitute, but so much better.Service - amazing service. I wish I remember the name of our guy. We had a group of 10 and he made us feel more than welcome. Very personable without being overbearing; which is a very fine line!"
"Brunch was a great choice at Beatrix. We enjoyed the vibe, the decor and most of all the food. We were seated by the kitchen where we could see them baking all the fresh pastries that smelled AMAZING. The nacho buffet (not sure if that's the name), was delicious, but many of the menu items were great too. I knocked my review down one start because my steak (steak and eggs) was prepared well-done even though I asked for medium rare. That was quickly fixed, but still."
"We ate here while on vacation for a weekend in Chicago. This was my first time to the city and I've read about all the great restaurants in town. Landed on Beatrix because of the menu and also table availability (reserved last minute). Atmosphere fit our style. Casual in the sense that you could dress up or down and not really feel out of place. Wait staff was excellent. Our waitress was really busy and got tied up with other tables right when we were ready to order. The bartender noticed and brought us the drinks we had ordered and then took our orders. We shared the Caesar salad to start. I had the pork shank and she had the salmon. All three were very tasty but the pork shank really stood out for me. I wouldn't definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a big cut of tender flavourful pork. We didn't get dessert because we were too full but it looked like they had some good choices for a sweet tooth. The reason why I'm holding back a star is because of the drink menu. They seemed to have house made juice as their thing which just doesn't jive with me for dinner. The didn't have any draft beers, only bottles of somewhat typical Chicago beers and the house cocktail menu was fairly short for the lady. I recommend giving it a try. If they rounded out the drink menu I'd likely bump it to a 5 out of 5."
"The meatball starter and salmon entree was delicious. The apple streudel was heavenly! However, what made the meal better was Jose's exceptional service! Thank you, Jose for being a pro!"
"I came here with my sister for dinner last Friday. There were a lot of people but we had a reservation and were seated within 5 minutes. The decor was really cute, very hipster and Our waitress was so nice. We ordered Butternut Squash and Apple Soup, Tsukune meatballs, and the Prime Burger. Everything was so good and since we told our waitress we were splitting everything they were nice enough to split it ahead of time, which was very helpful, especially for the soup. For dessert we got the Warm Apple Strudel. It was so delicious. The only downfall to this place was when we first got there, there was not enough room to wait for a table and we kept feeling like we were in the staff's way, but to their defense there is a juice bar behind the hostess table where you can go and get drinks while you wait. Also, they text you when your table it ready. I will definitely be coming back here."
"Friends and I went to Beatrix for a Sunday brunch. I made a reservation through Open Table for 1:30 for 4. I had some joiners and our party expanded to 6.  The hostess was very accommodating and did her best to quickly find us a table.  As it was late in the day, we were disappointed to find that several of the items on the menu were no longer available. My 3rd choice item was a spicy chicken dish, which was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Our waiter was attentive and when my friends mentioned it was my birthday, he brought us a piece of decadent chocolate mousse cake. He even made sure it was gluten free, as one of my friend's is gluten intolerant. The only complaint from my table is that the portions were on the small side and several people left still hungry. Next time we'll order some muffins or sides to accompany the main course.  Overall, the atmosphere is great, the food is good, and the service above par, I will be sure to get there earlier next time so we don't miss out on any of the better looking menu items."
"Finally, I made it to Beatrix.  Its been on my short list for awhile.Anyway, I really like the space.  What a cutesy little breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, or dinner place!A LEYE addition to RN...shocking, I know.  Hahaeasy opentable reservations!  what a variety of freshly squeezed juices!lots of ""healthier"" options.  we had two salads and both were fantastic.  i will say that my 3-grain w arugula and chicken was a little small for $13.50, BUT what do you expect with a LEYE, in RN, attached to a hotel?  exactly...just what i got.caramel pie was amazing...there goes the ""light and healthy"" lunch option...sighservice was good.  the chick was super knowledgeable about the food options on the menu and the daily special.  cheers to that!overall, great lunch spot in the area...and it was bumping at 1pm on a tuesday so take advantage and do the easy peasy online reservations :)"
"Can I just be honest and say I'm burned out on ""industrial chic?""  Maybe it's because I work for an industrial supplies place ... but the whole exposed pipes and ducts and lack of soundproofing just doesn't make an impression any more.The food here similarly didn't hit the mark.  Yellow gazpacho had a creamier texture, more like a salmorejo (i.e. thickened with some bread and olive oil along with the tomatoes?), but in that dim industrial lighting, the color tended to remind me of some odd baby foods.  The taste was fine, but it could have used a bit more acid and less olive oil.The theme of too much oil continued into the evening's special, a wild salmon with a pistachio crust on a bed of arugula, with a golden beet slaw on the side.  The salmon was mildly flavored, and the pistachio crust virtually unnoticeable.  The arugula and greens were overdressed with oil, which contributed to the salmon's crust softening up and an overall oily taste to the dish.  Spouse's chicken fillet was acceptable, but felt like something easily findable in any decent suburban restaurant ... lemon chicken breast.  Nothing special or memorable.  There was nothing ""bad"" about the meal, but nothing to distinguish Beatrix from othre run of the mill places.  If you're looking for a safe, kind of bland place where the food won't challenge you, it's a fine bet.  I won't be back ... too many River North contenders with chefs taking a more inspired route with their food."
"had a delicious dinner here... crispy kale salad, pork shank, pot roast served perfectly. a tip to check out their plentiful bar seating if there is a wait; we scored two seats in the bar area right in front of the kitchen... the plus was getting to see every dish prepped and brought out before we ordered. it was like our own private preview of the menu....although we heard ""order"" being shouted every now and then ;) the minus is that service in this part of the dining room was quite slow. we waited 15 min to get our water refilled after asking twice, leaving us disappointed... and thirsty!overall, a lovely meal. delicious food. would return."
"Fast paced, good quality bistro. This was a business lunch, so I wasn't on full review mode. Usually when this happens, I remember mostly the high and low points. They are quite proud of their juice selection - various concoctions and flavor mixes. I got the Cherry Chia and it was difficult not to down it all at once. Their special on this day was crab cakes - also very good. Service was efficient and friendly enough. I'd go again."
"Beatrix, you broke my heart.I've been walking past this place on a daily basis since they opened - constantly wanting to check it out, but never quite made it there. It wasn't until the restaurant landed on this year's Bib Gourmand list did I try it out. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.Service: Good. Our waitress was nice, knowledge and attentive without being annoying. Our food and drinks came out quickly.Decor: What is going on with this place? Part lounge, part diner, fake plants like a tiki bar with purple lighting? I don't even know. Food: What a bummer. I had the Brioche crusted Branzino and he had the Braised Shortribs. The Branzino was cooked great, but with a sad beurre blanc and even more sad vegetables.His braised shortribs were a little tough, with mashed cauliflower (probably the best tasting thing of the night) and brusselsprouts. The entire plate kind of looked like a TV dinner.Overall the food screamed early 90's steakhouse, and kind of had prices to match. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner. I may give it a second try for brunch. Maybe."
"This was my second visit to Beatrix...they redeemed themselves. Great food, I had the Turkey Loaf with Sweet Potato with a Mash and Kelp Salad...it was the best I've had. The Burger was also exceptional.Great service this time. Katrina was on par, and knew her Menu."
"I've already given Aloft hotel a 5 star review, and Beatrix was a huge contributing factor. This restaurant ROCKS!!!! Their menu is amazing & I was pleasantly surprised to see such creative & health conscious options that are sure to appeal to anyone. The space is pumping and is super trendy. When we came down on Sunday for brunch, the place was PACKED and the wait was about an hour. My recommendation would be to make a reservation ahead of time if that's the time you want to dine here. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area...it's REALLY worth it!"
"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. The place was completely packed with a few waiting outside in the drizzle. We were 15 minutes late for our reservation, but were seated immediately. Overall, we liked the decor, but the tables are little close together.I ordered the steak chimichurri with eggs and my girlfriend got the 3-grain arugula salad. The salad was fantastic, well dressed, quite filling and lots of chicken. Unfortunately, the steak chimichurri was disappointing: the toast arrived cold and a little soggy, the poached eggs had a completely set yolk and, in my opinion, a steak chimichurri should actually be served with chimichurri. (Okay, so maybe my preferred ratio of ~500mL chimichurri/standard sized empanada is a little more than standard preferences would dictate, but a smattering of wilted chopped parley barely visible on the surface of ~4oz of meat does not a steak chimichurri make.) The hashbrown tasted strangely of whole wheat bread, something which I cannot otherwise explain.And I was hungry at the end. =(The service was speedy considering the crowds, but the waitress did a poor job of explaining the specials leading us to believe that the salsas displayed prominently at a nearby table were complimentary, when they were in fact they were part of a $13 buffet option. Maybe I was just addled by hunger and a need for additional sauces to fill the horrible void in my heart that is no chimichurri.The total came to $40 including tip and two coffees, which seemed a little excessive. (Or maybe lolcat salaries are just not what they were in the '00s, because the guy at the adjacent table with a Rolex seemed perfectly content.)TLDR: Meh, meow meow meow. Time for a McDouble."
Went for lunch today. Completely overwhelmed and satisfied with my experience. Cannot wait to go back.
"Ate here for lunch with a co-worker and really enjoyed the food.  Had a really tasty turkey burger with a quinoa,  kale, and cranberry salad on the side.  Everything tasted really fresh and very flavorful.  I tried a couple fries too and they were awesome.  Not too soft, not too crispy.Really cool atmosphere too.  It was a nice day out, so we got a seat in the open doorway and had some really comfy leather chairs.  Our waiter was very attentive too.Prices seemed pretty reasonable for the food as well."
"Visited this place for a weekday dinner and loved all the dishes we had. We started with the Tsukune with chili-cilantro sauce ($7.50) which is really just a yummy chicken? meatball. For my main I had the Poached Farm Egg & Truffled Pasta with butternut squash, brussels sprouts, and shaved parmesan ($15.95). It was heavier than I'd expected, but delicious. The dessert was my favourite - the Oh My! Caramel Pie ($6.95) - amazing a must. Atmostphere - it was nice for a weekday though it was a bit corporate. Would be a nice place to take clients."
"The fresh green juice and oatmeal was a welcome breakfast after a big meal the evening before. Love the ambiance, style and menu.  Classy but casual. My service and food were very good!"
"A little steep ($44 with tip for 2) for a weekday brunch but the service was delightful and the meal sublime. We split the quinoa cakes & pot roast with eggs, then took 3 melt-in-your-mouth cookies to go. And now they're gone   The atmosphere is more evening-chic than brunch-swanky, but it translated to a mellow, cozy spot to loiter on a chilly day."
"This place was so promising with sleek atmosphere and friend hostess, greeters, and manager.  Our waitress, Vanity, left all lot to be desired.  We even had a hard time getting our drinks or even water!  Well she did have a lot to do, like folding napkins right next to our table for 20 min.  Don't even get me started about the specialty item of Chilaquiles, which were available via a buffet.  A majority of our group order them since they sounded so good.  Horrible idea...It took them over 40 minutes to replenish the tray after we brought it to their attention.  I felt bad for the guys we were with since they were interested in getting more, but after 40 minutes who would have interest.   Overall...won't be back."
"Great meal! We've been to many of the Lettuce spots, and this is one of the least ""Disney-esque."" Unlike the other Lettuce places, this one doesn't feel overly themed. Great food and excellent service. We'll be back."
"Lovely brunch place. Feels very homey, and while the portions are smaller than I am used to for brunch, it's still really filling and is fairly healthy (I think?).We ordered the egg white omelette and quinoa cakes. Both were very delicious, though the quinoa cakes came with poached eggs with mayo on top. Mayo did not taste right to me, but overall very satisfied with my meal and experience.They have a pastry bar!!! Yay! Try it out if you can."
"Another Lettuce Entertain You restaurant for the win!I had a girls dinner here last night, and each of the 5 of us really enjoyed it.  Despite a smaller menu, the food was the star of the show.  We had the crispy chicken, the neatloaf, the pot roast, and the salmon, and everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I had the chicken which was a great portion.  It was crispy and moist, and came with mushrooms, polenta, and some sort of broth.  It was the first time I really enjoyed eating polenta.  The cocktail and wine list was also great, and made decisions difficult.  This restaurant is part of the Aloft hotel.  I was seated facing the bar and windows, so I didn't notice it as much, but one side of the restaurant is compeltely open to the hotel which doesn't make it feel very separate.  The restaurant area itself did have a nice atmosphere, and for once I wasn't freezing in a restaurant.  It was quiet enough to carry on a conversation which was nice.The service was a little bit slow which was totally fine for our group since it gave us time to catch up.  The waitress was very friendly and asked us if we wanted separate checks without us even asking which is basically unheard of elsewhere.  I would definitely come back, and hopefully leave room for dessert since the dessert menu and pastry window looked amazing!"
"One a quest to try somewhere new and to kill time before birthday dinner reservations, we came across Beatrix for some pre-dinner drinks.  The vibe is cool, the staff was friendly, and the dinner menu looked intriguing.The drink menu was limited and, unfortunately, so was the alcohol.  The SOs whiskey sour was less than impressive and my pineapple-habanero margarita was minimal habanero, way too much pineapple.  I was looking for some caliente and this left a cold taste on my palette.  No bueno.And on a side note, what was up with the super obnoxious patron sitting at the bar hootin' and hollerin' all up in everyone's grill?  The bar was not that crowded and screaming was certainly not necessary.  Didn't your mama ever talk to you about 6 inch voices?  SERIOUS BUZZKILL.  Maybe he distracted the bartender from pouring strong drinks for us?"
"I came here for lunch with the boy this afternoon. We ordered the burger and truffle pasta. I don't know why he ordered the truffle pasta when he doesn't like truffle much. Anyways, the burger was good. I asked for it medium rare, but it looked more rare. The truffle pasta was interesting because the poached egg was inside rather than outside the pasta. However, it was super drenched in truffle oil and a bit too salty. Also, the giardiniera wasn't spicy at all. As a matter of fact, I couldn't find any peppers at all. Isn't giardiniera supposed to be spicy?Service was standard. Nothing exquisite but nothing horrible. I wasn't particularly impressed with the food, even though the scenery is very nice. I've had better burgers. Maybe I should have gotten the neatloaf instead."
"My first time at Beatrix but definitely won't be  my last! The perfectly prepared food made from high quality, fresh ingredients is only surpassed by the friendly and helpful staff.  Ok...maybe the caramel pie is better than all of that but you still need the excellent servers to bring it to you. Fresh squeezed juice combinations are made more adult by adding the alcohol of your choice.  What could be better?   Oh yeah...the caramel pie! :-) If you haven't been yet, come visit Beatrix and see what I mean. Have I mentioned the caramel pie?"
"I work around the corner and was turned on to the restaurant by my boss.  I love the atmosphere, their pot roast sandwich is so tender and flavorful and very filling.  I'd definitely recommend it to those who like a hearty pot roast that melts in your mouth.  The servers are very friendly and courteous. All around a great place to go for a good meal that's reasonably priced.  Definitely one of my favorites!"
"My wife and I came here on a weekday evening and enjoyed the warm, relatively quiet dining experience.  I started with the tomato soup, which was very average but good nonetheless.  My wife began with the ""Straight A"" salad and loved the ingredient combination.  When my skirt steak arrived, I was a little disappointed in the small portion size given the price of $23.50.  It was decent, but I felt the chimichurri was unbalanced and could use a little less parsley.  The peppers that came with the dish were very bitter, likely because they were out of season.  My wife had the ""Neatloaf"" (turkey meatloaf), which she really loved.  I thought the included kale tasted like chicken soup, which isn't really good or bad, just interesting.We had impeccable service from our waiter, Jason.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert on this night, but the dessert menu did sound wonderful.  I was struggling between 3 and 4 stars but decided that my wife's love of her experience combined with our great service was enough to push the rating to 4.We'll likely try Beatrix again in the future."
"We came away from Beatrix very impressed with the food, the service, and the restaurant itself.  We can't say we came in with overly high expectations - no offense to hotels, but you just don't expect a very good restaurant to be in one.  But that seems to be changing more and more nowdays, which is a great thing.  Beatrix is located inside the Aloft Hotel and has a great open floor for their restaurant.  The high ceilings and exposed brick lend itself to the restaurant and make you feel less like you are in a hotel.Onto the food.  We really enjoyed everything we had, though nothing knocked our socks off, hence the four stars and not five.  The tuna and beet appetizers were good, as was the Straight A Salad.  Our entrees were pot roast (probably the best), steak, chicken salad, and a burger.  All good, though nothing I would call life-changing.If you're in River North and want a nice little meal come on in to Beatrix.  Is there better?  Yes, but it's still very good.Sidenote:  they have great juices, and a really cool coffee bar, so don't think this is just a dinner place.35/365"
"Wonderful food. We had salad with whole grains, chicken and arugula. It was amazing. The strange thing was we had to ask for bread."
"Went here with a group of friends on a Friday night.......wow, absolutely AMAZING!!! The food was delicious (the pumpkin cavatelli-I died and went to heaven), but honestly it was the service that put us over the edge! Milos, our server, was sooo personable and honest.  He told us what to order and even surprised us with an additional dessert (the carmel pie, I highly recommend) AND fresh bakery to-go!  As a former industry employee, I know a great server when I meet one...... and Milos is nothing short of amazing! My friends and I all agreed we definitely come back soon in light of our phenomenal experience.  Ps...... Best wishes to Milos on his new career! You will be missed."
VERY good food and the music!!  Try the Spicy Chicken Tinga for breakfast! Great bloody Mary's and staff is super friendly and fun.
"Drinks are great...loved the michelada. They have cool mimosas as well- red, orange and blue! The menu items all look delicious. I had the poached eggs and quinoa cakes and it was amazing! My boyfriend got the burger and it was equally delicious. Great place. Great staff!"
"Stumbled upon this eatery over a Labor Day weekend.  Brunch was still being served and had some great egg white omelettes w salsa.  My son had the lemon ricotta pancakes which were perfect with a lemon syrup.  Needless to say, when we are back in Chicago we plan to do dinner as the drinks look interesting."
poor brunch both for a not puffy pancake and a very none-tasty burger....highly not recommend
"In spite of the predictability of ""eggs your way"" and Caesar salad, there are some adventurous offerings that are definitely worth a try. The Shakshouka (spicy tomato sauce, poached eggs, feta & kale) and the poached farm egg truffle pasta provided for taste bud salsas. ( FYI I'm a fan of everything poached except for parking spots and game).Hip atmosphere, comfy seating, great lighting and fantastic food make this a LEY spot worth frequenting especially for variations on the poached egg."
"Reservations for 9 am on Saturday morning and the place was already starting fill up. Menu has lots of great options for all types of diners with restrictions. The Ginger Snap juice was delicious and my husband had the Bulletproof coffee (coffee with butter and coconut oil) which was surprisingly tasty.   If you are there for brunch make sure to get a side of Brown Sugar Bacon and potatoes.  I would recommend getting a reservation, the place was incredibly crowded by the time we left. Atmosphere is great, but not ideal for having a super leisurely breakfast or brunch."
"Love...love...LOVE!! Everything I ordered was simple yet delicious and the atmosphere was just perfect! Maybe the 40 degree sunny weather on a Saturday helped it out too but everything was great! I had the egg white omelette and turkey bacon. I was trying to be healthy, I usually don't like egg white but this was delicious with the fresh tomatoes and avocado. My friend ordered the steak and eggs and the meat was pretty delicious. Most amazing part was the fluffy lemon zest pancakes!! To die for!! We needed something sweet to top it off and it was just perfect, not too sweet, perfect fluff with a fresh lemon zest taste to end it. Definitely going back and ordering everything else I wanted! Oh yeah service was bomb too! We sat at the bar because it would have been 30 minutes wait for a table for 2. Bar area was perfectly fine! This is a great brunch spot to go with a big group too! Everyone will love it!"
"Excellent dinner with great service. The dinner menu is one page, not overwhelming, yet packs a punch with great flavors. Fresh ingredients and creative details make the meals delicious.  Freshly squeezed juice all day long that can be turned into cocktails. Try the well made whisky sour, refreshing and made with bitters."
"We were in Chicago college shopping. We wanted to go to Frontera Grill but I didn't pay attention to dining times. Walked down Clark and found BEATRIX. Ordered gazpacho, excellent. Also had the hummus it was excellent also. Ordered vegetable lasagna, tai fish & chips and quinoa burger. All three excellent. EAT HERE!"
"I've never been a harsh reviewer, but this place was a true disappointment.  I decided to pick this restaurant for my friends birthday and she wasn't happy.  We had to wait for our table even though we made reservations.  No one in our group of 7 enjoyed their main entrées.  The prime burger didn't have flavor, the chicken had a bad aftertaste and steak tasted plastiky.  I guess the only  thing decent was the fries, but that's a stretch.  I picked this place because of it's great yelp score and because it's been featured in a couple of top 10 lists.  It is not worth it.  They even charged the birthday girl for the slice of cake! Definitely not recommending this place. You are better off at Hub51 for sure."
"Came here for the first time for a Monday night dinner with my girlfriends and was blown away by the food and service! First off, the ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for our group: trendy and upbeat, modern decor and lighting, and hip music. We were seated right away and our waitress was knowledgable on the menu, courteous, and always made sure our drinks were full. The food was excellent. The restaurant lives up to it's ""taste over trend"" motto by offering new spins on classic dishes that were full of vegetables, colorful, and very flavorful. I loved that they had menu items such as quinoa and hummus for those of us who are health conscious! It was a refreshing change of pace to the dining experience. We were even lucky enough to try four desserts, all of which were delicious. The Oh My! Caramel Pie is a MUST try. The Tall, Dark, and Handsome chocolate cake was rich and decadent, and best of all, gluten free for those who are looking to indulge without having to worry about flour restrictions.Overall, we had a great night and a very memorable dinner. Thank you to Steven and the rest of the Beatrix staff who were all so friendly and accommodating, we'll definitely be coming back soon!"
Tried to get in to eat there twice but the wait was soooooo long.  Got two lattes that were tasty: banana chocolate and a cinnamon one.   Not bad not bad at all.
Green chile chilaquiles were amazing if you like a mild spice in the AM. The Bloody Mary had too much lemon in it. Was not my favorite.
"I couldn't get an earlier reservation than 2:00pm, but we needed it to be closer to 1pm. They were able to seat our large party of 9 and were super friendly and helpful about it. Another place, Mercadito, was the opposite and completely rude. Our experience at Beatrix was so pleasant and we all loved it. The food was great, the server was great and they actually seemed to love their jobs. They even brought out free dessert for our bachelorette! The food and drinks were delicious."
"I have wanted to eat at this restaurant forever and was so glad that I finally did. The room is really nice and warm, with a modern vibe. I, as always, had perused the menu before arriving so I knew exactly what I wanted. I ordered the butternut squash soup and the kale salad. Both were fantastic. I know that sounds like a fairly boring order, but neither dish was. Both were tasty and full of flavor and texture. Probably one of the best kale dishes that I've ever had and I eat a LOT of kale. My parents went the very next night on my recommendation and also had nothing but good things to say about it."
"A nice addition to the River North scene, Beatrix offers a blend of that local neighborhood spot vibe with modern and trendy to fit the actual neighborhood it is in.  Beatrix is a good option if you're looking to grab dinner in River North and don't feel like dealing with the pretentiousness (or the prices) of most of the River North dining areas, but still looking for a unique and high quality dining experience.The cuisine is contemporary American with Asian influences on certain items.  My main complaint is the menu is somewhat limited, especially if you are a pescetarian or vegetarian.  I'm assuming they operate with a rotating menu, but a few extra options or maybe more than just one nightly special would be nice.They offer interesting fruit drink options that can become alcoholic beverages at $11.  It's a nice concept but the drinks were a bit overpriced for what you're getting.  I can get a mind blowing cocktail at Violet Hour for $11, so tequila with cilantro and honeydew is less impressive.The service was excellent and we had a very helpful server who was not shy about giving her opinions and helping us decide.  For the 4 of us, we went with the kennebec fries and tsunske meatballs to start.  My friends raved about the meatballs and I thought the fries were great - they come with a poached egg mayo on top that was delicious and unique.  For our main dishes, I went with the tomato soup and the crudo tuna.  My husband got the ""neatloaf"".  The crudo was a smaller portion (as crudo typically is) but paired with the tomato soup it made a very filling meal.  The neatloaf dish was a hearty sized portion with kale and mashed potatoes.  The theme is ""healthy"" and Beatrix does manage to deliver a healthier dining experience while still classy and original.  The crudo was fresh and very tasty but the tomato soup was more on the average side (though I did appreciate that it wasn't doused in cream like most places).  Beatrix doesn't yet rank as one of my favorite or most memorable Chicago restaurants, but I had a very pleasant first experience there and will be willing to try it again once the menu has changed a bit."
"Had a memorable dinner here while my husband was working in the Chicago area. We arrived without a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated at a fabulous table beside the windows. The food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the manager came to our table to say hello. By the time we left the restaurant, it was packed with beautiful, happy, high energy people enjoying a wonderful meal in a wonderful restaurant. Highly recommend Beatrix!!"
"I adore this place and stop in often, sometimes for a full meal, other times just for coffee or a fresh fruit/veggie juice to go. Beatrix serves both Intelligentsia and Metropolis coffee and the baristas are friendly and competent. Their pastry counter is filled with delicious baked goods. My fave is the cinnamon roll, warmed up a little. Yum!For dinner I like the pot roast plate and for breakfast, Beatrix serves a pot roast and egg sandwich, which is delish. I also really like the 3 grain salad with arugula and chicken. I've tried a number of other menu items and haven't been disappointed. The food is fresh and well-prepared. Service is friendly and efficient. The restaurant is clean and spacious and the ambience is cool yet comfortable. I notice management present whenever I'm there, which I really like. I can't say enough nice things about this place. I love it!"
"So happy to have found this marvelous brunch spot.  Service was excellent, the food was great and the atmosphere was contemporary and has an upscale feel.  I had the green chile quiche which was served with chile-cilantro crema and a very lightly dressed spring salad.  The light salad was the perfect accompaniment to the heavy (but very delicious) quiche.  My dining companion had sunny-side eggs with maple bacon, hashbrowns and toast.  We split a lemon-glazed angel food muffin.  Check out their pastry selections, which change daily, because they all looked fabulous.  Coffee was rich and seemed to be high-quality.  I would love to come back and try a meal other than brunch but my visit to Chicago ends tomorrow.  I'll definitely keep Beatrix in mind for my next visit to Chi-town.  Bravo Beatrix!"
"I almost don't want to review this place because it was crowded enough as is, but it was so irresistibly delicious that I have to share the news with the internet.  We made brunch reservations, and good thing--it was very popular on the weekend.  I tried a tequila & pineapple breakfast margarita and was really surprised by how much I didn't hate the tequila in it.  The bloody mary was spicy and wonderful, and the green pressed juice was also tasty.  I tried the spicy chicken tinga, which was served with warm flour tortillas and two eggs on top.  It was so flavorful & delicious that I finally joined the clean plate club.  We also shared desserts: the angel food cake from the bakery bar was delicious, as was the caramel pie.  I got a chocolate cookie as big as my head (no joke) to go.  The service was fantastic, responsive, and friendly.  The decor was warm and comfortable, and the noise level for such a crowded place wasn't bad.  Best of all, the brunch prices were all $15 and under, even for the steak dishes!  I'll definitely be back."
I had a burger cooked medium well with Wisconsin Swiss. For a drink I had spicy Bloody Mary it was understated with just a lemon olives and celery stocks. For dessert I had the tall dark and handsome chocolate cake that had dark chocolate sprinkled on top of it and a white lightning latte that had a  hint of Coumadin and to give it a spice on the back of your tongue one drinking it. I would recommend this place for somebody looking for a good meal.
"We stopped by again last night after a brief, very cold stint outside. We were very much looking forward to warming up and warming our bellies. This time around we sat in the front part of the restaurant (near hotel part of the building). There were just a handful of people to warm the place up, it was so cold! The sliding-door windows are not meant to keep heat in during the winter. I ended up sitting with my jacket on, as did a few other guests sitting next to the window. However, again our waitress was so hospitable. At one point during our dinner she brought over some warm water with lemon! It was so nice and perfect to warm me up as we ate. This time we ordered the Potato Salad Deviled Eggs. As deviled eggs fans my boyfriend and I enjoyed these immensely. You get three small half eggs (what do they do with that last half?) filled to the brim with a yummy yolk-mayo filling. We then ordered the Poached Farm Egg & Truffled Pasta (if you read my last post and other reviews, you know my obsession with truffles!) It was good, but lacking the over vibrant truffle taste from last time and had more of an egg flavor. Still warm and satisfying on a cold night. My boyfriend ordered the new menu item, Crab Cakes. The plate has a nice size portion of crab cakes with lots of crab and veggies. He licked his plate clean.  For having to endure the cold room, at the end of our meal our waitress brought two complementary pastries from their coffee bar! We did not expect this or request it and was a very nice afterthought. P.S. the pastries were delightful!"
They have my favorite veggie burger.  Mushroom and quinoa burger.  Very consistent and good food.
"I had a meal at Beatrix, because it is in the area and also happens to be a LEYE restaurant.  I had $40 in rewards to use when I went.  I have to say they were very accommodating.  We had reservations for 10 pm and we got there about 5 minutes late.  Their kitchen closed at 10 that night but they allowed us to get seated and still made our meal.  The juices were amazing and fresh.  The burger I had was served with gidenera, but it was lightly pickled so that was still nice and crisp, vibrant and slightly spicy.  I love that the food is created with a eye towards being fresh and health concious.  Combine that with the nice ambiance, and you have a good place to go to in an area where so many restaurants disappoint you by trying to be night clubs."
"Boy!  Was I wrong about this place!  Somehow I had it in my mind that this was a coffee shop in the A Loft hotel.  Well at least I got the location right- it is attached to the A Loft hotel.  But that was where any thing I had in my minds eye ended.We went for dinner on a Friday night.  Make a reservation as this place was hopping!  Not a seat in the place but I was able to find a seat at one of the two bars to sit and have some wine while I waited on my friend.The ambiance is a bit crazy- mis matched ceiling fixtures, a hodge podge of tables and chairs, tables seemingly stuck in wherever they could find room . . .and all the while you kind of feel that you are sitting in the lobby of a hotel (um, you are, kinda)Our server, John, was great!  If I could paint a picture of a perfect server it would be him!  He was friendly, knowledgeable, quick and went out of his way to make sure that we had a wonderful evening.  He even validated my parking and took the ticket out to the valet for my convenience!    He was so nice I felt like he would have driven me home if I had asked him to!All kidding aside- the food was what surprised me the most here.  Sure- my thinking had been partially right- they do serve a breakfast menu- but also a lunch, brunch, dinner and gluten free menu as well.We started by splitting the ""Straight A"" salad- arugula, asiago, avocado, Asian pear and almond all served up with a light dressing.  Large enough to split as a first course and delicious!  This is a must have!We also had the ahi crudo served with fennel and something else that gave it just the right amount of kick.  This is a smallish portion, probably not the best thing to split.And then on to the entrees.  I asked our server what his favorite thing on the menu was and he didn't hesitate for a second to suggest the chili and chocolate glazed salmon.  And let me tell you that this was amazing!  It is served with small corn tortillas, and an almond coleslaw that when combined, make a wonderful flavor explosion in your mouth.  It was so seriously good that I ate everything on my plate!My friend had the skirt steak- and while good- it was clear that the winner at our table was the salmon.The other thing that was nice was that if you are tying to eat ""gluten free"" as I am right now- there are plenty of delicious things (including the chocolate cake) that are gluten free.  I love when a restaurant makes things easy and tasty.  But given this is a Lettuce Entertain You venue- they are pretty consistent in doing things the right way.If you drive-remember to get your parking validated as it is $14 with validation, $22 without.  Definitely worth the effort to ask if it is not offered up.  Dinner for two ran just a little over $100 including appetizers, entree,and dessert.If there is a lesson for me to be learned from all of this is not to go with first impressions.  For if my friend hadn't pushed to go here- I'd still be thinking this was a coffee shop in a hotel.  Trust me  . .it's far from that!"
"The green chile and chicken chilaquiles were the family-style selection this past Saturday, so I went after it, and for $12, this is a great deal.  The chips were crispy and greasy and fresh (aka ""perfection""), the guac, spicy red sauce and fresh salsa were good, and there was a reasonable amount of cheese on these to boot.  The space was nice and very un-hotel-lobby-restaurant-ish, if that's a term.  (Being in an Aloft hotel helps.)  My cocktail--something with chocolate liqueur and ""freddo"" in the title--left a lot to be desired, a lot.  But my three dining colleagues got healthier options and all of them seemed to be pretty happy, including one that I think was called the Power Shot that was a hit amongst two of my friends.  I would go back, if someone else was dying to go, but I would put this in the solid-but-unspectacular category."
"Remember the hotel restaurants of yore--overly formal, overpriced, mediocre food?  Beatrix is NOT that.  It's hip, fairly priced, and the menu, though limited, has some really good options.  Tried the sweet & sour meatballs--a really nice version in a cilantro and ginger sauce.  These are chicken meatballs and they're quite tasty.  I wanted to sop up the sauce with some bread.  Guess what?  No bread. No bread in a restaurant?  Go figure.I also ordered a straight A salad--all the ingredients start with A--arugula, assiago, you get the idea.  Very nicely done, not overly dressed, and enough for 2 peopleFor dessert, pastries are displayed on the long coffee bar.  I was happy to see apricot and poppyseed hamentaschen.  I ordered both.  Delicious.They do something with fresh squeezed juices here, it's like a specialty.  I had the Vodka Dew--vodka and honey dew juice, and found it way way too sweet (to my taste.)  I switched to martinis and they were fine.There are at least four seating areas in the coolly designed space.  There are two bars, regular restaurant tables and low lounge tables.  So pick where you want to sit for the experience you want to have.  This is not your parents' hotel restaurant."
"So, I received a LEYE certificate to use at any of the restaurants. I received this message below:Hi Joe, I'm happy to hear you received the Beatrix certificates. The Lettuce Entertain You certificates are generated separately, but you should see them arrive sometime soon. For your reference, the company wide certificates can be used at Brasserie Jo in Boston, or at any of our restaurants in Vegas, California, Chicago, etc.Thanks, The Beatrix TeamI just went to Brasserie Jo in Boston, called ahead to make sure they accepted the certificate, went in, racked up a bill, then the manager came over to tell me they are not part of LEYE and do not accept this. I asked him to check, he went and made a phone call, and said they do not accept it and apologized. Then he said ""you should call ahead to make sure [maggianos] accepts it"", after he told me they were part of the business.ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. It's not about the money, it's about the principle of the situation. Beyond frustrating that I have this certificate that I don't plan on using since this place chooses to serve food nearly an hour after the order, overcooked, and with foreign objects in it."
"Very hip, open & airy restaurant.  There is a lot of movement going on in here, and I like it.  While having a glass of wine at the bar, my very friendly bartender suggested the special for lunch.. A Crabless Crab Cake.. It is made with Hearts of Palm.  I didn't even look at the menu (I wish I would of for future reference) and ordered that for lunch.  It was amazing!! I would highly suggest it and the restaurant if you are in the area.  Everyone I encountered in the restaurant was very friendly. You can valet your car with the Aloft Hotel.  It was $14 with validation."
"I took my mom here for Easter weekend raving about the Turkey Neatloaf.But they CHANGED the Turkey Neatloaf. It was my favorite thing on the menu. Now it has twice the amount of sweet potato in it, which changes the flavor and the texture completely. Also, my beer was warm. It came in a can.Also, our waiter disappeared and we sat with empty drinks for a long time. He disappeared again and we sat with our credit card in the receipt book for a long time.Mom wasn't happy and we didn't even stay for my favorite thing - Chia Seed Pudding (unless that changed too?!)I might be done with Beatrix."
"I met a colleague here for a business lunch and couldn't have picked a better impromptu spot! The menu offerings are healthy yet playful. My favorite was the tuna crudo appetizer. Our server Milos (pronounced Mee-loshe) was incredible!! Very attentive and made us feel very welcome. He made some great salad suggestions (I went with the Caesar salad with chicken) and even treated us to a post-lunch gluten-free triple chocolate cookie which was amazing, even if it was more of a brownie than a cookie (this gooey treat will definitely get stuck in your teeth)!!! He told us about the fantastic brunch cocktails as well... they have red (strawberry puree), orange (Valencia orange), and blue (blueberry) mimosas. I'll be coming back for brunch and/or dinner very soon! P.S. I had the ginger sangria with lunch and it was truly delish ;)"
Came here for coffee/drinks and stayed for dinner.  Surprised and glad to see it is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant.The turkey meatloaf I had contained pieces of sweet potato and kale mixed in.  It was very tasty and made me think I was being healthy.  I would come back here again just to have the meatloaf.I definitely recommend trying Beatrix out.  Pleasant surprise given it was connected to the Aloft hotel!
"A wonderful restaurant with great service!Made a reservation on open table for 6 on a Thursday night and was really looking forward to it.  When I arrived we were waiting for another party to get up and they were taking their sweet time.  Well, after 20 minutes of waiting the GM, Michael, came over to apologize and offer us some appetizers and drinks on the house.  How nice?!?!  I was really impressed by that and took him up on his offer! :) For apps, we had delish Kobe meatballs and fries, with a poached egg.  For dinner I had the AMAZINGLY tender pork shank that was enough pork for a family of 4 :).  This was by far one of the best pieces of pork I've had in a long time!  The place has great cocktails as well - order the refreshing blueberry Tom Collins.  And lastly, if you need a nice after dinner caffeinated drink, they have a great coffee bar.  Oh one more thing, our waiter was awesome as well (didn't catch his name but he had a great mustache)!I really like this place.  It's got a very warm and friendly feel to it, round tables for groups which I love, and a great staff.  Can't go wrong with this place for small groups, quick drinks or date spot."
Super cute spot. We went for coffee and treats (I got the dark chocolate and banana latte.. yum!) but I'd love to go back to the wine bar or for lunch or dinner.
"My favorite restaurant, thus far, in Chicago. I tend to eat healthily and this place makes eating clean and eating well a shared experience. I had the short ribs the first time and neatloaf (not a mis-spelling) the next. I also had breakfast there - shakahuka (probably mis-spelled). The dinners were great and the alcoholic drinks were refreshing. The breakfast was good, but small. The Bulletproof coffee got the star back. I have sampled off other plates and have never been disappointed!"
Yelp directed me here for lunch today. The food was great and the portion size was ideal. I had the 3 grain salad with chicken and it was full of flavor.
"Spicy Chicken tinga is my go to, this is my regular brunch place, and handily beats out Yolk dishes and haven't yet had to brave ridiculous lines. Great value, healthy, good scene."
"Great juices, delicious salads, and excellent service. We even saw the mayor here during our visit!"
Good service and decent menus. I had their only pasta dish. It was OK. It didn't change my life. The place has great ambiance.
"Do you want a phenomenal brunch in river north? Look no further, this place is awesome. Best bloody I've had in Chicago. Server was awesome, he was actually bar tending and serving and we felt very well taken care of. Coffee was delicious. Food came so fast. Enjoy!"
"This brunch place is pretty cute, but let me break it down...FOOD - Not that great. The portions are small, and I actually sent back the oatmeal it was so bland. Don't go here if you're super hungry for a big breakfast. I had the Tinga and it was DELICIOUS, but again, pretty small. The caramel pie is as good as everyone says!SERVICE - AMAZING!!! Jason was our server and he was super attentive and nice, he definitely made the experience for us."
"A very different type of place - part bar, part restaurant, part coffee shop. Per the waiters guidance, we had the fries to start, and the chicken bebe and short rib dish for main dishes. Everything was absolutely amazing. For two, we left feeling very full. Everything was very tender, not dry, and had unique flavors. I will definitely be back."
I went here for lunch and had the pot roast sandwich. Best pot roast sandwich I ever had !The place is very friendly and our waiter was very professional and courteous. I will definitely eat at Beatrix again !
"Absolutely wonderful. I was in Chicago for work and was looking for a place to dine for 1. Beatrix was a few blocks from my hotel. I ordered the carrot, apple, ginger snap juice. It was VERY refreshing after a long travel day. I had the pork shank for dinner. Cooked to perfection. The menu is small but they have a variety of options that would fit any taste.I will definitely be coming back next time I am in town."
"This place could teach every other Chicago restaurant how to accommodate a food allergy -  they check on what you can and cannot eat, and rather than simply removing things from your plate, they suggest substitutes that turn out to be absolutely delicious. Really impressive service and great food and atmosphere too."
"I discovered Beatrix in May 2014 and have been hooked ever since!  I have done brunch, lunch, and dinner here.What I really love about Beatrix is the atmosphere.  It's so comfy and welcoming.  During the summer, there are sliding glass widows that are opened along Clark St., which lets in the sunshine and the breeze.  I really like sitting near the open windows when the season allows because I really get the experience of eating outside while eating indoors.The menu at Beatrix is absolutely exquisite!  What I really like about their menu is there is something for just about everyone, regardless of dietary preferences and restrictions.  There is always a vegan or vegetarian special that changes from day to day.   Here are a few things off of their menu that I really adore:- Potato Salad Deviled Eggs - Crispy Kale Salad- 3 Grain and Arugula Salad w/ Miller's Farm Chicken - Pot Roast Ragu - Spring Pea Soup (seasonal, springtime)- Tall, Dark, and Handsome Chocolate CakeWhat I really like about the menu is that the food is filling and the portions are ""just right"".  I really like that the owners of this concept value where their ingredients come from and put emphasis on organic food.  It's one of those places I can go and indulge, but not feel guilty or overly stuffed afterwards.  I think it's the perfect balance between quality of ingredients, indulgence, and just the right amount of ingredients on your plate.In addition to their great menu items, there is an awesome coffee bar and bakery.  Its always fun to stop there to get dessert for later on.Overall, my experiences have always been positive at Beatrix.  This has become one of my favorite places to eat in River North!"
I loved this restaurant and will go back soon. Great food - had the chicken bebe. The staff was super friendly and accommodating.
"I typically go here for brunch and have several times. I went once for dinner and wasn't crazy about the options.Great atmosphere (would never know it's attached to a hotel), very cozy and consistently great (brunch) food. I LOVE the pot roast and egg sandwich with jalapeno relish!"
"Neither the portions nor prices are huge, so it's just about right for me.Some items are just ok.  But some really stand out.The last time I went, I was most impressed by the chicken bebe which was so succulent, the chia pudding which was like a coconut tapioca pudding and right up my alley, and the oh my caramel pie, which I stole a bite of and plan to go back for.  It's not too sweet, with fresh whipped cream and truly deserves its cult following.And to top it off, the service was very nice."
Came here for lunch with some colleagues. Food and service were good. The space itself is light and open. If I was from out of town Beatrix would make we want to stay at the Aloft next door.
Ended up here after seeing a line at bub city down the street.  We were able to get a table as soon as we walked in which was awesome because it was a Saturday night and there was an hour and half wait at Frontera. Great food at a REASONABLE price...extra emphasis on reasonable because it can be hard to find in the river north area.  The restaurant flows into the lobby of the aloft hotel which actually adds a cool vibe.  My first choice was the pork shank but they were all out so had the pot roast.  Very flavorful with a nice a compliment of sides.  Definitely recommend the caramel pie!  I will be back for brunch.
"This review is for the BRUNCH:I went here for brunch and was not impressed. I do enjoy they have a gluten free menu which is why I came but the food was scarce. I had the egg white omelet with avocado and tomato salsa, GF toast and turkey bacon. The bacon was delicious. The eggs were good. the ""avocado and tomato salsa"" which is the reason I ordered the meal was highly disappointing. It was some cherry tomatoes chopped in half and about 3 small pieces of avocado. I left hungry, and for the prices, I don't want to leave hungry. I do want to try this place for dinner but will not be back from brunch. I would give 5 stars for the atmosphere."
"The energy in this place is amazing! When I first sat down, I was thinking this was at least a 4-star kind of place, but through the course of my two meals (yup, went here twice), I settled on 3. Aside from the awesome energy, it's incredibly convenient. Especially if you're staying at the Aloft Hotel (Beatrix is in the lobby). In addition to sit-down dining, they have a coffee bar! The service was attentive and friendly both times, but they didn't exactly get things right. Forgot something one time and didn't ask both of us the next, resulting in two trips for the server and a delay for us. Food was good but not great. A solid 3-star eating experience that you should definitely try."
Came here for a recent breakfast and was impressed by the food and service but a little taken aback by the price. Breakfast for two ended up at just about $50. The dishes were fairly small and needed quite a few sides to amount to a full sized meal. I had the quinoa cakes with poached eggs and a side of tomato and avocado. There's some pluses and minuses here of course. Breakfast ended up being pretty decadent feeling without leaving me feeling overstuffed or weighed down for the rest of the day but that's balanced against the hit on the pocket book.
"This place is super healthy and delicious, and has a really cool summer / Californian vibe going on. I had the Blueberry and Sage smash juice, which was phenomenal. For lunch, we split the hummus app and I had the Straight A salad (arugula, avocado, asian pears and asiago). A really light, healthy meal. Our waitress kind of gave us a marathon speech of what's on the menu (which I can read), but she was perfectly friendly."
"I was just hanging out on Saturday looking for a place to eat breakfast and passed by this place in the river north area. I wasn't too enthused to go in, as I know these places can be a little on the expensive side. I looked it up and it wasn't too bad, price wise. I was greeted by a very friendly host and only waited about a minute before I was seated. I had the watermelon and strawberry juice (amazeballs) to start as I just looked over the menu. I asked my waitress what was the best thing to get and she basically said the steak was pretty badass, not in those exact words, but something like it. I ordered the Steak Chimichurri and eggs. I got over easy eggs, with medium rare steak, and it came with hash browns and toast. I must say that the steak was one of the best I have had in a while. I also must say that the hash brown was WHACK AS HELL SON!!!!! It was the only thing that i ate here that i didn't like, especially after the waitress was talking about how good it would be. Great food, great staff, decent price...shitty hash browns."
"I sought out gluten free brunch hot spots before my weekend trip to Chicago and Beatrix topped the list. I was not disappointed!! Many choices on the menu unless some places and all seemingly delicious. I kept things simple with eggs, hash, bacon and g-free toast. All served to perfection. Next time I hope to try one of the juices or specialty coffee drinks. Great ambiance for brunch that surely carries over to afternoon and evening meals too. Check out Beatrix, you're in for a treat!"
Very nice place for breakfast.Enjoyed the selection that as a different takes on the classics.
"GREAT food! (For vegetarians and carnivores alike) We started off with the quinoa cakes, meatballs and hummus platter and everything was gone in minutes! (Which was really impressive since the men in the group scrunched their noses at the idea of quinoa - and then they all said it was good!!!) I got the turkey meatloaf, which was EXCELLENT.  comfort food and yet new at the same time, and totally delicious. I fear I'll be getting cravings for it again over the next few weeks.  Others got the salmon, burger or steak... And everyone cleaned their plates.  (Which I wasn't sure we'd be able to do because their portions are quite generous for the entrees.) Drinks were great too - loved the black cherry sangria!The ambiance was great.  Nice and trendy without being snooty.  Service was attentive and the space wasn't too loud.  Can't wait to go back!"
Best French Toast special I've ever had in my life. Awesome interior.
"Recently came here for brunch with my girlfriend and we both loved it.The wait on a Saturday at 10:30 was only 20 minutes for 2 people and the food was worth it. The lemon pancakes and the egg brisket breakfast sandwich were both incredible. Would recommend. The iced coffee was so so but the fresh squeezed juice was awesome - fresh, cold, summery.The service was great - when we finally flagged down our waitress. The only thing that wasn't exceptional about the meal was that we had to wait for about 10 minutes before the waitress came by to give us water and menus. Overall, a great brunch, especially on a nice summer morning, and it's great for couples or small groups. Larger groups may have a bit of a wait."
"Came here for lunch menu. Potato deviled eggs: meh, just tastes like a lump of potato salad. Not bad but nothing impressive.Tomato soup: very good but hard to butcher.Chicken sandwich: tasted like a Starbucks focaccia bread Sammy with a Dijon sauce. Still confused on what the sauce was.Arugula straight A salad: well, it's like a whole foods plastic container serving of arugula. Not bad but also could have made it  at home.We has the sawtooth Riesling just to say I had a wine from Idaho.I'd try to come back here for dinner menu. It's not great but definitely easy for group casual dining."
"Great brunch spot. Friendly service, excellent atmosphere, interesting menu. Got the poached eggs/quinoa cakes. Perfectly poached eggs, beautiful presentation, and I appreciated the unique dish.""Amazing omelet"" was a little dull."
Inside the Aloft hotel where I stayed- I had almost every meal here because it's just so good. And there are many foodie choices around here that I would normally try to explore  during a stay. At dinner got the short rib; lunch another day had the pot roast sandwich. Fresh juices and egg white breakfast sandwich. Can I live here?
"For a big empire as LEYE, I love that it cares so much about customer service.  I reached out to management to let them know that we would be visiting this weekend, and that we would be joined by my niece who also happens to be named ""Beatrix."" To say that they went above and beyond to welcome our party would be an understatement and I appreciated that the brunch menu was small, manageable, yet managed to have something for everyone.  With our large group, we were able to taste just about everything on the menu and ranged in variety from burgers to lemon ricotta pancakes and chilaquiles (a personal  favorite!).  Brunch cocktails had classics but also included less common options such as Micheladas.  Refreshing fruit juices combined watermelon with strawberry and blueberries, white grape and basil.  So glad to have Beatrix as an addition to the brunch options in the city and knowing that it will keep its commitment to phenomenal customer service, they will have a regular in me!"
"LOVEd it, can't wait to try the other dishes on the menu !"
The food was absolutely amazing! I did not think breakfast food could get any more better until I tried this food. The bacon and chicken sausage is so flavorful and the hash browns were to die for! Our server Milos was exceptional!
New Years Day brunch was amazing from the food to the service! All of the people here were incredibly friendly and welcoming throughout the entire meal. The food/drinks were also superb and we will definitely be returning for a dinner service very soon!
"Beatrix has a great twist on comfort food. The service was great, my only negative with be the noise level with the music in the back ground. It is a little loud for dinner. The only reason for the 4 stars."
"Came for dinner on a Friday night. Used the reservation system on Yelp. When my friend got there before me, they would not seat her even though it was empty because it was only 5:30. That was the only downside. We had excellent service.  The beet salad was delicious as was the carmelized pork dinner. Don't miss the caramel pie. I'll definitely be going back for that. I'd like to try brunch as well."
"Meh. Given all of the fantastic reviews for brunch, I expected more. As with a couple of other places I've dined for lunch/brunch in Chicago, this place was high on concept and atmosphere and low on food quality. My turkey burger was mediocre and oversalted and the mealy tomato and heavily buttered roll didn't do much to help it out. The side of quinoa, almond, and cranberry salad was ok but nothing stellar. Hummus side was fine, but the over baked store-bought pita that accompanied it was a definite disappointment. BF's pot roast and egg sandwich was only ok. Looked like a good place for a group, but if you're expecting top quality original food i would look elsewhere."
"Loved my trip to Beatrix!  Wish I could have dined here again on my short trip to Chicago.There were so many options on the menu that i wanted to get...I ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes on a chilly windy night (much more pronounced after several days on intense hot weather!) it was perfect.  The cocktail list was interesting and tasty, and they also have fresh squeezed juices...I tried two of the cocktails: ginger sangria and blueberry Tom Collins.  We sat in front of the bakery case, which I'm sure is popular for breakfast in the mornings...the baked goods looked so tasty.  We ordered the oh my caramel pie that was really sweet but delicious.  Located on a corner spot on the ground floor of Aloft hotel, it was cozy but modernly decorated and open at the same time.  The service from the hostesses to the servers was friendly and casual."
"In town for work and staying around the corner. Came for a late lunch with the boss, who isn't as adventurous of an eater as I am. Online the menu looked great. The hostess was friendly as was our waitress. She was helpful with our questions and offered to split the soup for us to share.I had the carrot-apple-ginger snap juice. It was a full glass, since it's not served with ice. It was really refreshing. My boss had the strawberry watermelon. Looked good, but diluted with ice, which made it seem over priced. We shared the golden beet carpaccio, which was really yummy. I wanted to eat it all myself! We also shared the spring pea soup, which was also very good. I could easily have also eaten a whole bowl.We had coffee after our meal, and it was really good coffee. My only complaint is that I didn't want the tortillas that came with the salmon, but there was no equal swap item and she didn't didn't discount anything from the bill. That said, the chili glaze salmon was really good. It was perfectly cooked and a nice portion size, unlike most restaurants who give you way too much salmon. The roasted almond slaw was really good, as well. I think the juices and entress are overpriced, but it's downtown Chicago. For a really well-prepared healthy meal, I'll take it. I'd definitely go back again and again to try different items."
"I very much enjoyed Beatrix. The dinner menu may be small, but Beatrix is definitely an example of the concept that a small menu guarantees that everything on the menu is delicious!The service was fabulous, as well. Our waiter was wonderful, and gave us great suggestions for both drinks and for our entrees."
"I was surprised how much I liked this place. It's a bit of everything- hotel bar, coffee shop, bakery, cocktail joint, and apparently great spot for brunch. After work on a Monday night, it was easy to find a table for two. The blueberry Tom Collins was refreshing and not so sweet that you could get a 12 year old drunk, the way a lot of fruity cocktails are concocted. It was also nice to see a dinner menu that offered many healthy but delicious-sounding options. I think we could all use a break from frying everything in duck fat garnished with pork belly and truffle oil. Instead you'll find quinoa, edamame, fresh hummus, organic chicken and pork, and fresh squeezed juice. So if your friend needs to stick to her latest cleanse diet, and you're looking to drown your work week sorrows in a martini, this is the place to please you both!"
"I really enjoyed my experience at Beatrix. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and it made for the perfect lunch playdate. I've also had friends come here and say it's a great place to sit at the bar and have a drink. The coffee bar is great. I had the Spicy Chicken Tinga which was good, but I'd probably would try something different next time."
"Beatrix, you're awesome...and surprisingly located in a hotel!  We all know that hotel restaurants can be hit or miss, but with the help of a good staff, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants...and the Hyatt Place/Fairfield Inn and Aloft hotels, this place is a slam dunk.I dined here today with a fellow foodie, Kate and we had a very enjoyable time.  We had a few drinks... all made with their fresh made/fresh squeezed juices.  St. Germain and fresh OJ... oh my!  Our waiter was Anthony, who was excellent ... and someone we'll be requesting wait on us during subsequent visits (oh yeah, we'll be back).We had the lemon pancakes and the chicken tinga dish, which we split.  The pancakes were uh-mazing!  The chicken tinga was a little mild side as far as spice, but we jazzed it up with some extra hot sauce.This is a solid spot, and I look forward to going back soon!"
"My new favorite brunch spot! The atmosphere is lovely and open. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We got our choice of table, and the waitress even changed the TV channel to a football game we wanted to watch. The modern American food is absolutely delicious. So far I've had the egg white omelette and burger, and the burger was out of this world. Will be back there soon!"
"A really good date night. Making a same day reservation on a Friday was simple (booked with OpenTable via the Yelp app) and there was no wait to be seated on arrival. The cocktails, apps, entrees, service were all very good. Creative but not outlandish offerings. Overall reasonable prices (particularly considering the area). The only reason that I would give 4 stars and not 5 are:1) The music was a bit loud and clubby; not to my taste. Maybe par for the course in River North, but it seemed out of place at 7pm in a restaurant.2) There was a TV off in one dining area of the restaurant. Repeat: the restaurant. Not over the bar. Just oddly sitting there playing some random basketball game on a Friday night during dinner. Admittedly this is a pet peeve...but I do find it distracting and a bit odd. Let people go to Bull & Bear if they want this. My 2-cents.Summary: very solid place on all fronts with only 2 nitpicks. Would strongly recommend to locals and tourists alike, particularly for date/couples nights. We'll be back no doubt."
"Beatrix is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I could come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The ambiance is great, the service is great, and the food is even better. My favorite is the 3 grain salad with chicken. The cookies, don't even get me started. Sea salt butterscotch or the magic cookie, it's rude to even make me choose. Also a great place for business meetings."
"Review of brunch only.Came here on a recent Sunday, looking to shake up our standard brunch go-tos of Meli Cafe and (especially) Sable.  Suffice to say that neither of those establishments are threatened by Beatrix.I did the AYCE chilaquiles bar.  Award points for very fresh pico and cilantro.  Deduct points for the low level of attention paid to this station - the serving utensils definitely needed a scrub.  Washed it down with a red mimosa, which was passable.My companion got ""A Wonderful Egg White Omelet.""  Her take: ""I thought an omelet was supposed to have some stuff in it.""  She wasn't impressed with the flavors, and the presentation was nothing special either.The waitstaff leans toward the casual side - friendly, if not overly polished.We stopped by the bakery counter and walked out with a big ol' chocolate chip cookie and a pecan-coffee-cake-muffin-thingy.  Both were amazing, and the high point of our visit.Based on this one experience, I'd say Beatrix is helped tremendously by the traffic generated from the Aloft.  Were it a stand-alone, I don't think it would have much of a future.  Definitely try the sweets, but everything else they do is done better somewhere nearby."
"Beatrix was surprisingly good. The restaurant space is very chic and classy.Though the menu was very limited, the food was delicious. We went for my wife's birthday and they brought out a chocolate cake (with a candle on it) for her at the end of the meal which was awesome!RATINGS:Tsukune - Chicken Meatballs - 4/5Chicken & Leek Bread Pudding - 3/5Tall Dark & Handsome Cake - 5/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5"
"On entering Beatrix it looked like it had potential.  However, in spite of a friendly server it soon became clear this is a place to avoid.  Most importantly, our food was delivered cold.  This being the case I am not sure I can truly evaluate the food, but blah comes to mind.  There were seven of us and not one person's meal was above average.  Two of us ordered the shakshuka - it wasn't.  It might have been a good dish of poached eggs with kale, but first of all it definitely wasn't shakshuka and second of all the cold eggs meant it was pretty much a disaster.  The omlette was fair.  THe picy chicken tinga was a bit too gruel like.  You get the idea.  Oh, and I forgot, just like they did, to bring a side order of chicken sausage until being reminded half way through our meal.  (And, they were cold, mealy, and fell apart at the first touch.)In addition to poor food, the acoustics are atrocious.  The coffee was weak.  The bloody mary was pretty good, but it comes with a celery stick the size of a baseball bat, so the glass was actually about half full when the celery was removed!Chicago has so many great places to eat, skip this one."
"Great  work lunch spot.  They had a great selection of lighter food options.  I tried the caesar salad that was made with greek yogurt - didn't exactly taste like a caesar salad but was very tasty!  My friends had the chicken sandwich and the cobb salad, both were delicious as well.We absolutely loved the decor.  It was a cool mix of textures including exposed wood and industrial-type lighting.  Definitely a good spot for my next client lunch."
"Per the recommendations I had seen online, I visited Beatrix for brunch with a friend.  The weather could not have been nicer, and we were lucky enough to be seated near the large window that was open to the street. This was such a pleasant dining environment that I probably would have been happy with an Egg McMuffin.But the food was nothing like McDonald's, I'm happy to say.  I had a spicy egg and pulled chicken dish, served with warm tortillas, avocado, and cilantro.  I also had the beet salad side and a tequila sunrise to drink.  The food and drink were both excellent, perfectly satisfying brunch options. I high recommend Beatrix to diners in the market for delicious, reasonably priced brunch fare."
"Brunch. Braised pot roast breakfast sandwich was awesome! Every aspect was full of flavor and not overly filling as I expected. The jalapeño relish gave just a little spice without overdoing. Even those who cannot take heat will enjoy, plus it comes on the side. The aged cheddar was a great touch! The steak chimichurri was bland, do not recommend. The meat was flavorless. Hash browns great on the other hand, very crunchy outer while maintaining a soft inside. Also randomly tried the deviled eggs. Deviled eggs ok, just not a fan of the mixed potato salad concept, I'm sure others would like. Blue mimosa was a great balance of fresh juice without being too thick."
"I went here for the first time with two of my oldest friends who were visiting from out of town. The food was exactly what we wanted. We shared the hummus plate, arugula salad, kale salad, chocolate salmon, and parmesan chicken. Everything was delicious.  The staff was also incredible! We were hesitant to try the acai pomegranate juice, and our waiter gave it to us on the house! My friend mentioned to him that we were celebrating being friends for 21 years, and he also gave us dessert and coffee on him. Thank you, Ty! I moved here in August and can honestly say this is officially one of my favorite places I have tried! Will definitely be back soon."
"Beatrix had been on my ""restaurants to try"" list for quite a while. So, with restaurant week in play, why not? I gathered up a couple of friends, made some reservations, and jumped feet first.Overall: A hipster chic restaurant with good a food and wine selection, above average service and unique architectural concept. Worth a try. I really enjoyed the rustic chic feel (lots of unfinished wood and metal, with leather accents throughout). Except for the entry, they've literally packed tables in every single corner of the place, which made it somewhat difficult to maneuver to/from the bar. Oh, yeah, they have two bars (three, if you count the coffee bar). There's a wine bar and a liquor bar on opposite ends of the place. Choose wisely. The bakery/coffee bar (and also almost in the mid-point of the restaurant) was an interesting twist.Ok, on to the good stuff....My friends went with the restaurant week prix fixe. One ordered the Straight A salad (arugula, avocado, asian pear, almonds and asiago cheese) followed by the organic chicken (great). The other ordered the ceasar salad (very citrusy) along with the turkey ""Neatloaf"" - one of their signature dishes. Both of them really enjoyed what they ordered. And yes, the neatloaf was pretty amazing.I ordered the pork shank from the regular menu. The meat looked superb and literally fell right off the bone. The glaze enhanced the flavor just enough to not overpower (good job). My only gripe was that it was a bit tough and may have cooked just a hint too long. It may have been that particular batch but I'd definitely recommend it...as it was a truly tasty selection.Good wine selection. Dinner and two drinks without gratuity came to be about $60/person.  I'b very much like to try bruch (8a-2p Sundays). Oh yeah, did you know they're Lettuce Entertain You?"
"Honestly, dining at most LEYE restaurants, you know what you can expect with service and quality of food. Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing I notice is that this place has a great coffee bar. Seated dining is to the right and there is a bar area to the left as you walk in. The restaurant basically flows right into the hotel lobby and front desk area which I thought was a nice touch. We ordered the Quinoa cakes and the straight ""A"" salad to start off. I wasn't as big of a fan with the Quinoa cakes as I was with the salad. Adding pears to any salad really puts salads in a different category. Portions were decent enough and were willing to also put it on separate dishes since we were sharing. Next, we ordered the Vegetarian dish of the day wish was Truffled Pasta. The pasta dish was large enough to finish and great portions!We tried the PINEAPPLE-HABANERO MARGARITA  drink and the Blueberry Tom Collins. Drinks were okay, I didn't think much of it. The best part of Beatrix, they serve Intelligentsia Coffee! Honestly, you can't beat that.I definitely will have to make a trip here for brunch someday especially based on the reviews I have read about it."
"Had Belgian waffles with friends for brunch. They were absolutely delicious. Don't need much syrup as the waffles themselves taste so good. The place itself is also very lovely, and had great service. Can't wait to go back!"
"Found this low lit and beautifully designed restaurant from Yelp! I'm visiting on business, it's close to the hotel, and got great reviews. Did not disappoint!Annie, my server, was so well-timed, friendly and knowledgable. She helped find a suitable vegan option in a heartbeat.  Gorgeous arugula, avocado and pear salad with a tomato, red pepper and beet juice. Delish!Thanks!"
"I went to Beatrix yesterday, which was their first official day of business (hey, we share a birthday. Woo hoo!). It's located in the new Aloft Hotel in River North. The space is open, with wood beams, exposed ducts, and it's bright and cheerful. Since it's located in a hotel (as well as being near several others), it's aimed at being an all-day, full-service restaurant, offering breakfast, lunch, dinner, as well as a quick-service stop to get coffee and a pastry in the morning, or just a cocktail at the bar.The concept is ""elevated"" comfort food, using fresh ingredients, simply prepared. It definitely leans towards being healthy. They've got small plates and entrees, so you can enjoy a full meal or just a snack.We each started with a bowl of yellow-tomato gazpacho, garnished with crunchy, diced vegetables (cucumbers, tomatoes, celery). It was served in a chilled bowl (nice touch!) and was so refreshing. I liked that the soup itself was smooth, and the texture of the fresh-vegetable garnish gave it a nice contrast. And it was such a beautiful color! I adore gazpacho in almost any variation and it's inherently healthy so I can never feel guilty eating it. I would get this again in a heartbeat.We also split an order of ""potato salad"" deviled eggs, which was three halves, so a perfect amount to share so as not to spoil our appetite. I've never had deviled eggs like this before (and I've had a lot); the yolks were mixed with some potato and the sauce has some crunchy celery and dill mixed in. It was definitely like eating the love child of potato salad and deviled eggs. So different.Next up was an herb-roasted chicken sandwich, which we also shared. The chicken was shredded, and served on a ciabatta roll with avocado, tomatoes, and some tarragon mayo. It was flavorful and delicious. On the side was an arugula salad (my favorite green) with matchstick apples, sunflower seeds, and very lightly tossed with a tasty dressing. That salad would be excellent on its own.And of course we could not pass up dessert, and this is where we splurged: the ""ooey-gooey"" chocolate cake. I was expecting a warm, molten cake, but this was chilled, almost like a flourless cake, and the topping was the consistency of a cross between a ganache and pudding. So yummy!Perhaps my most favorite part is their beverage menu, and I'm not just referring to their cocktails (which also sound fantastic; in fact, there's a blueberry Tom Collins with my name on it); they also serve creative, house-made, nonalcoholic drinks, perfect for those of us that can't/don't drink during lunch. Yesterday I had a watermelon and strawberry cooler, which was ideal on a summer afternoon. But honestly, any one of the beverages sounded appealing: blackberry and lychee lemonade, cucumber- mint soda, orange and turmeric tonic. Don't those all sound terrific? And they'll happily add a shot of booze to any of those if you want to turn it into a real cocktail. Win.Service is of course, totally polished. Managers walk the floor and check in on guests; the wait staff knows the menu backwards and forwards. There's no ""let me check with the kitchen"" or ""I'll have to find out from a manager if we can do that""--these folks are well-trained and knowledgeable. This is an area in which LEYE always excels. Say what you want about LEYE, but you have to admit that they're quite adroit at opening new restaurants, with none of the missteps that seem to befall other spots. They've got it down to a science."
The Oh My Caramel Pie lived up to the hype. One of the best meals I've had in Chicago. Highly recommend!!!
"We had dinner over the weekend at Beatrix for my friend's bachelorette weekend. Our waiter, Ty, a former chef from Texas, immediately noticed that this was a special occasion. He was very helpful and knowledgeable and made it easier to pick between dishes. I ordered the Branzino, while my friends ordered the salmon, truffle pasta, chicken, and pot roast. If I were to return, I would definitely order the pot roast! It was exceptional, the clear winner of the dishes. Beatrix squeezes all of their juices fresh, which makes for a great mixer. Our table loved the blueberry basil! The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for a night out. The doors onto the street were all left open and it felt like we were eating on the patio, instead of inside. I would describe Beatrix as chic 'farm to table'. The best part of the evening? Ty brought us complimentary dessert-the tall, dark and handsome chocolate cake as well as the out of this world caramel pie. If toffee and caramel mated, the caramel pie would be the offspring. I would go back for the carmel pie alone. Highly recommended!"
We had the weirdest service here.  Our waiter seemed disinterested in everything about life.  He spilt drinks all over the people at the table next to us and barely apologized or reacted.   Didn't come around much.  My boyfriend ordered potatoes on the side of his breakfast and they came out 15 minutes before the rest of our food.  I ordered a side of bacon and it came out 15 minutes after the rest of our food.  Really odd dining experience.  The french toast was tasty.   Perhaps I'll give it one more try to see if a different server would make a difference.
"Went here for dinner on a snowy night. Cozy and inviting. The food was ok, nothing to write home about but nice for a chill evening. Reminds me of the food at Summerhouse- just ok. Drinks were fantastic though. We got to pick dessert from the bakery case- always a plus!"
"I called early Saturday afternoon to snag a table for 4 near one of the few TVs visible from the actual dining room, to watch the Blackhawks game, and was promptly booked. Goal! I went with other Yelpers/foodies and we all kind of had a similar consensus. We all loved the fact that the food was sourced and prepared healthy yet so deliciously! However we left on a down note, when they didn't offer to rectify a food sanitation issue any further than simply remaking the dish.Right on par with the healthy theme is the decor which is fresh, young and hip, with earthy tones of brown and green complimented by wood furnishings, lots of curvy surfaces, with an upscale cafe type feel. The windows were open that evening and it was really nice! There are parts of the space where you can just pony up and get a beer and then there are parts like where we sat in the main dining room where it feels like a proper format for a real sit-down meal with friends.Our server was fantastic. She knew the menu inside and out despite only having been open for 2 days, and made great recommendations. She was attentive, kind, and patient while we ordered dishes ala carte in succession but not all at once.We split the following dishes amongst us:1. Kennebec Fries with soft poached egg mayoThese were like normal fries with a poached egg, nothing special. It kind of lacked flavor. Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time or money with this dish, they're just fries.2. Tsukune chicken meatballs with a chili-cilantro sauceThese are so delicious! Me and my fellow diners are Indian and agreed it tasted very Indo-Chinese inspired. It's a bit on the ginger-y side but it's not too overpowering. Definitely one of our favorites! And you get 4 for $7.50 so it's a pretty good deal and easy to share.3. Poached Farm Egg & Truffled Pasta - rustic road farm egg, brown butter asparagus, parmesanThis was my personal favorite. It's kind of like one big 4in. x 4in. ravioli stuffed with gooey egg that spills out once you cut it, mixes with the butter and parmesan and it just so creamy, smooth, and delicious! A must try! I'm craving this one again already!4. Stuffed Vegetable Peppers - stuffed with quinoa, a bit of cheese, and maybe some other thingsOnce we finally got it, it was a nice dish to finish off on. There are 2 red peppers and 1 green pepper stuffed that come with this plate, so very filling.Unfortunately the first time we got it there was a hair on the dish. They apologized, brought the manager who took it away, but then took a long time to bring out another. Despite causing us a delay (to say the least, I mean a LONG HAIR, yuck!), and major error on their part, they didn't do nor even offer anything to make up for their shortcoming.We all agreed without question that that was not OK, and really to be frowned upon, especially having been open only 2 days. The only other real problem with the service was that if you ordered a beer, it took way too long to come out (~10 minutes), so they need to work that out. We were in no hurry so it wasn't a big deal to us, but that's beside the point.One final plus side is that after sharing 4 dishes and some drinks, the bill was still very affordable."
"Consistently great food and service at Beatrix! I've dined in a couple of times, carried out a couple of times, and was here for one cocktail reception. The food was awesome on each occasion and service was always helpful and friendly. Favorites include the 3-grain Arugula Salad, the Turkey Neatloaf, and that insane caramel pie..... Oh, that caramel pie.  Plenty of options for the gluten free crowd as well.  Five stars for Beatrix."
"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service.Must-haves: Caramelized Pork Shank with Cider Reduction, Potato Salad Deviled Eggs, Tsukune, Ahi Tuna CurdoAlso-good-to-haves: Slow-braised Pot Roast, Poached Farm Egg & Truffle pastaYou-are-out-of-your-mind-if-you-don't-have: CARAMEL PIE (although the Tall, Dark & Handsome Chocolate Cake is pretty fantastic, as well)"
"Love the decor - modern, clean lines with a lot of vintage flair and warm details (i.e. dark hardwood tables and mismatching cognac leather-backed chairs)I participated in Restaurant Week and I found the portions to be very generous - with the exception of the deviled eggs, which we ordered from the regular a la carte menu. There were three halves! Where does the fourth half go?  I'm sure the chef eats it (Skip this item: I'm sure you make better ones at home - I know I can with my eyes closed)The food was very good. Not exceptional, not amazing, but exactly what we have all come to expect from a Lettuce Entertain You establishment; you will leave satisfied but you certainly will not be intrigued or challenged or educated by any of the food.  It's a menu of safe and obvious choices that are albeit well-executed (not you, Caramel Pie, you're my boo) (see below).The salads were delicious and very generous portions - the yogurt dressing was very nice and light.  My pot roast was extremely tender (no knife required) and the sauce had a lot of richness and body.  Wish they could have added a vegetable besides pearl onions.  The mashed potatoes were....mashed potatoes. Ok, now for the real star of the show: The Caramel Pie.  What. The. S**t.  I cannot remember the last time I had a dessert that delicious, and I certainly have not had one since.  I mean...wow.  Just wow.  I dined at Beatrix about a month ago and I still lie awake at night, thinking about this Caramel Pie.  What's he doing right now?  Does he miss me?  I should call him...."
Great food. Would recommend trying.
"I was here on a Friday night and it was great! The decor is interesting, industrial feel broken up by ferns and a couple of trees. Pretty cool. I had some sort of fish special (I can't remember the name but it was a filet of fish made with a piece of brioche on it) it was good! Too much butter but the size of the portion was great! My fiance had the Turkey Neatloaf. That was pretty tastey! We finished dinner with 2 cappuccinos that were really great and a piece of the Caramel Pie. HOLY CRAP! If you have to choose something to be your last dessert before you die, eat that Caramel Pie! Seriously. Do it. Our server was a cutie patootie blonde woman, she was great! We sat by the expo line so we go to see a lot of delicious looking dishes go out, and we were close enough to the coffee bar to smell the delicious coffee our entire meal. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I think there are better Lettuce Entertain You places out there. But it's really great and I would recommend it!"
"We wanted a pre-dinner drink, and Beatrix happened to be the closest place.   So we stopped in and were blown away by the service.  Our server was genuinely interested in helping us choose the right drinks and took his time to explain the ingredients and their stories.  Since all the cocktails looked delicious, I asked my friend to order for me as I went to ""powder my nose.""  He chose a fresh juice blend with acai and pomegranate mixed with vodka.  When I returned, the server came by and explained that with the vodka, the blue boost (blueberry, white grape, basil) would pair much better, so he took the liberty to switch it out, and he was right.  Light, refreshing, and healthy as you can get with alcohol.  They also offer ""Bullet Proof Coffee"" which is advertised as a muscle enhancing, fat burning coffee with none of the side effects of regular coffee.  For $8.95 a cup, it's pretty pricey, but does have a buttery smooth finish.  While I'm not sure if I have any more muscles or less fat after that, it was a delicious treat."
Went for happy hour so I can't review the food.  But drinks were fantastic.  Def get one off of their drink menu. The open air seating in the bar is great.  Very nice atmosphere & service was fast & friendly.  Def will come back to try the food.
"Food was tasty, kale salad, mushroom burger, quinoa salad, all standouts. Super service, can't wait to go back."
"I'm usually not a big fan of lettuce entertain you restaurants but Beatrix definitely was different. Great food, great vibe, great location. They make really good fruit juices too."
"Came here for brunch - had the egg white omelette and Belgium waffles, fresh squeezed orange juice. The restaurants got a good selection of fresh squeezed juices. In terms of decor and general ambiance - the place's got a great feel - spacious, modern/ contemporary, clean.  Also attached to aloft hotel. Gave the place 3 stars though bc didn't think the brunch food was that unique or spectacular. It's a good meal but I think the restaurant wins more on ambiance than food."
"Great, delicious food and a good drink selection, however the food seemed a little bit pricey for what you get. Still worth a try though!"
"I've recently attended for lunch, coffee, and dinner.I would say on all visits, the food was great. Standouts for food were the salmon tacos, rosemary focaccia bread, & Caesar salad.I also enjoyed the juices as well as their wine selection.The service has been varying on each occasion, but never above average.Great spot for ambiance and good food."
Went with my family for Sunday brunch and I have to say that the food was  good and the ambiance was lively and busy. We had a reservation and they had our table ready so we didn't wait at all. On the other hand I think the service fell short. We had to wait around ten minutes before a server approached our table and gave us water and the server did not notice that we needed another glass so we had to ask for it. When she brought the coffee we had to ask for teaspoons. We ordered our brunch and it came rather fast. After that our server never came to ask if we needed or wanted anything else. Muy husband wanted to try one of the delicious muffins and had to get up and order one from their  dessert bar.  Very basic and minimal effort put during service.
"Always love eating at Beatrix when I'm in town.  Today I tried the special chicken kabob with humus and tzatiki.  While the flavors are great, the portion size of kabob was very small.  Three small pieces surrounded by a lot of bread and filler.  Disappointed for the first time."
Please try the Brioche Crusted Branzino entree if you go for dinner. You really won't regret it.
"I still am not so sure that Beatrix deserves five stars, but I am finding a hard time deducting for anything given my first experience here for brunch.My friend ordered the Blueberry Mimosa. I ordered the Blueberry Tom Collins. Both were delicious and refreshing. We both ordered the ""two eggs your way,"" with hash browns and toast. She ordered hers over-medium with a side of chicken sausage. I ordered mine poached with a side of the maple/pepper bacon. We devoured both dishes.Finally, we decided to split a slice of their caramel pie that I had heard so much about.  My friend said it best when she said, ""There are few things I have eaten in my lifetime that are better than that.""The dining room is spacious with lots of natural light. Staff was attentive and helpful. Our waitress, Nicole R., was just fantastic. I would come back here if only for a slice of that pie!"
Came here twice in one weekend while in Chicago. Brunch was amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection. The cocktails are tasty. Service was great and the prices were very reasonable.
"This review is for dinner. We were quickly seated outside on a Saturday night. It was late and many tables were open. Overall not a bad spot, with interesting people-watching and a decent sized tabletop. But my dining companion was within inches of the bus staff's cart, which meant our conversation was frequently interrupted by clattering dishes and silverware. So not so good.First we ordered drinks. No complaints about the wine, but the white sangria was loaded with sugar and tasted strongly of something that shouldn't be in sangria. Maybe ginger, or pear, or peach? Whatever it was, it wasn't good. It didn't taste at all like wine. We started our meal with the fries. They were average and needed salt. For my entrée, I tried the cauliflower Milanese at the waiter's suggestion. It was horrid. The cauliflower was flattened a bit but still very thick, and the breading was oddly spiced. The roasted red peppers and capers were extremely sweet, and the sauce just didn't go. The side salad was merely a heap of arugula with a few pieces of cheese and avocado dressed with oil. It was tasteless. My friend ordered the chicken. She shared it with me because I couldn't eat the cauliflower. I thought it had good flavor but was very greasy. She thought it was mediocre and agreed my dish was terrible. Service was actually good, and a bright spot of an otherwise disappointing meal, but it would have been nice to get the cauliflower comped or at least a free desert. But we got nothing. The highlight of my dinner was the creme brule cupcake that I purchased from the Chicago Cupcakes truck while walking to Beatrix. I pushed away my meal and pulled that cupcake from my purse to satisfy my hunger. Here's a tip: if you like cupcakes and vanilla, find that truck! We will not go back to Beatrix. I suggest you eat elsewhere."
"I came here a few weeks ago on a Sunday for brunch and made reservations before. When we arrived we were seated right away. Very cozy atmosphere, the server was nice. I tried the quinoa cakes with the poached eggs. When it first came out, I thought it was a tiny portion size, but surprisingly it was just enough. I love the sauce that it came with. One of my girlfriends wanted the French toast, but it was out.. Prices are average for the city. Overall, I was happy with the quinoa cakes with poached eggs!"
"This place was nice. Our table had a couch on one side. It was a fake candlelit dinner.My fiance and friend got the Local Option, Blood ov Kings. The waiter (who was really funny) said it was hoppy but they said it was way more sweet than hoppy. My other friend got the vodka dew and liked it a lot.Here are reviews for the food:Pork shank w/ cider: The pork fell right off the bones as the waiter described. There were small pieces of sweet potato and apples on top. It was pretty good! Very filling!Salmon w/ chocolate glaze: the menu did not clearly describe this as such but it turned out to be fish tacos. My fiance liked it.Prime burger: my friend said was goodTruffle Pasta: my friend said was really good but it didn't even fill his stomach half way. For dessert, my friends got a chai latte and honey cinnamon lattes. They were pretty big and they liked them.My fiance got an irish coffee, he said was good.Dessert Time! They have very large cookies that we could not turn down. Between the 4 of us, we shared aCaramel pie - this was very good. it was very rich, but so tiny! More of a 1 person dessert.Chocolate cake - it was flourless so it kind of just tasted like mousse. it was pretty good, also very rich and so tiny as wellSnickerdoodle cookie- very big, good but would have tasted better warmOatmeal butterscotch cookie- very big, pretty but good but also would have tasted better warm.Overall, decent experience.__________________________________________________­__________Came here for a second time....I got the truffle pasta this time. It was super delicious but super small. It was literally two pieces of ravioli type noodles on the outside, filled with 2 poached eggs. But there was this delicious buttery sauce that made it amazing! Since I knew it was going to be not filling, I got a side of appetizer chili lemon fries. They were pretty good!I got the strawberry watermelon drink... it was ok... nothing special.We shared the caramel pie and OMG it was even better than I remember! Just straight up caramel, YUM!!!I would definitely come here again to try more things on the menu!3rd time: We got the Prime Burger cooked medium with fries. The burger itself had really good texture and was cooked perfectly; however, there wasn't much taste to the burger. It definitely needed more seasoning or sauces. The fries were good.  I got the honey cinnamon latte which was very good. My hubby got convinced to get the ""amazing"" nitrogen coffee... but it tasted like watered down coffee. We would highly recommend you do NOT get that."
"We both ordered the Eggs Your Way and shared the Belgian waffles for Sunday brunch. Pretty basic stuff. Well, I was pumped for hash browns and disappointed when they came out: they reminded us of grade school cafeteria breakfast, a thick square that wasn't crispy and didn't taste good. The waffles were tasty- vanilla bean creme on top hit the spot."
"Eh, this was just ok. It seemed to be standard hotel food--the brioche crusted branzino was little more than toast atop Chilean sea bass, nothing special. I highly recommend that you check out their fresh squeezed juices, and add liquor to them as you see fit. Spacious dining, decent service. Good to eat at if you are staying in the hotel."
"Since I'm writing this review, Beatrix gets 4 stars, but if my husband were writing it, he'd probably give it about 7 or more if he could.  He loves the chilaquiles bar for brunch and nearly every weekend he requests to go here for them.  I've never gotten it but have stolen a bite or two and it is excellent--I'm not sure why more people don't seem to get this since it seems like an awesome value (especially for a guy with a big appetite, he likes that he can go back for more).  I think the food is excellent (and I like taking a peek at the pastries in the coffee bar area and ordering one as a starter....Angel Food Cake muffin topped in chocolate...mmmmmm).  It loses one star for me because when I go there and look at the main menu, there is never anything that wows me or jumps out at me....I usually end up liking what I get, but nothing gets me even half as excited as my husband gets about his chilaquiles."
"I had such a delicious slightly to the left meal which I really really enjoyed tonight!Went here for an early dinner tonight and I was feeling a little adventurous so I started with the pineapple habanero margarita.... I had no idea what to expect, but it was really nice and smooth with the sweetness of pineapple (and a slice on top) with just a hint of spice. A big hit!We then shared the chicken meatballs with chili and cilantro sauce. They were pretty tasty, but there was only 4 small meatballs for $7... so I probably wouldn't get them again.Now to the home run entrée. wowweeee, I'm glad I was on an adventurous streak... and what's more adventurous than the chocolate & chili glazed salmon?! It was so well cooked, and who would have thought that chocolate on salmon would taste so nice. It was not sweet at all, justa good flavour and worked so well with the chilli (on the side - of course for me, it could always be hotter) and then a really great  almond and radish slaw which was great with the lime juice to cut through the chocolate. It also comes with corn tortillas. SO YUMMY. I definitely got the star meal, the BF got the roasted chicken which he said was good, but it wasn't a huge dish and he was still a bit hungry after.The only reason this place wasn't a 5 star (for my meal anyways) was because it was a pretty empty so was lacking a little in atmosphere... not really their fault given it was snowing outside and was early dinner on a Sunday night. I really did like the set up of the place and ambience, and I feel like I need to come here for a long boozy lunch with the ladies. Maybe once I do this they'll get bumped up to a 5 star (also it wouldn't hurt to have some cider on the drinks menu, as well as some more reasonable red wine options, the cheapest was $9 and the most expensive $18 a glass!!)I'm looking forward to coming back here soon!"
"Deserves more than 5 stars for their food, drinks & exceptional service. My girlfriends and I went for dinner last night and can't say enough about the front of the house staff...sat us on-time, table was perfect & server was knowledgable & friendly. Most likely the best L-u-E rearaurNt to date & I love them all. The roast beef & mash - PERFECT, the burger - PERFECT, the Sangria - DELICIOUS!"
"Coffee bar review only:I live and work fairly close, but walk out of my way to stop in here for an Intelligentsia iced latte and a pastry. Definitely my favorite in the city (next to Sacred Grounds in Water Tower, which is another LEYE spot)."
"The food is great and create a great combination of fusion / organic. The venue is open with many tables, perfect for group gathering. Recommend the chicken and beef here."
"Super cute lunch place with really good food and drinks. We ordered a bunch of different things: quinoa cakes, tomato soup, straight A salad, and poached farm egg and truffle pasta. Everything was delicious! The quinoa cakes are a must-order. The straight A salad was refreshing and light but flavorful. The truffle pasta was comforting and delicious! Will definitely come back the next time I'm in chi town!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by Beatrix being that it is a brand new restaurant. Beatrix is part of the Lettuce Entertain You group so I knew the service would be outstanding, everyone from the servers to the bartender to the owner came by to say hello and offer recommendations. The drinks you can tell are made with fresh ingredients and fruits. I had the Caesar salad and it was so unique and delicious. My roommate had the three grain salad and she loved that as well. This place here focuses on health conscious meals with fresh ingredients, I want to come back for breakfast!"
I have eaten here three times in the last 2 days and I haven't had anything that was less than amazing. Their egg white sandwich are scrumptious. The lemon pancakes are one of a kind - absolutely amazing with their light airy texture. Dinner was similarly good with turkey meatloaf that was healthily stuffed with veggies but still very tasty. Definitely recommend trying out this place.
"This is a review for the coffee bar only! I stopped in this morning after reading how good the honey butter cinnamon roll was, and I was not disappointed. It was covered in vanilla bean-y icing, and had a good crunchy outside and soft cinnamon inside. It would've been good warmed up, but the icing would probably melt everywhere.They also had some other really yummy looking pastries on display, so I will definitely be back to try them. Some of their fresh juices looked delicious, too.The interior was very cute and comfortable, and it looked like a nice place to brunch or have dinner with some friends."
"Great food and great service! We tried several dishes, the pot roast ragu and the meatloaf, both dishes exceeded our expectations. Beatrix is a healthier version of comfort food but kicked up a level. This isn't your mom's meatloaf, it's a fine dining level meatloaf. I also recommend the Carmel pie with shortbread cookie crust and the fluffy pumpkin pie with the ginger snap cookie crust...OMG. You will not be disappointed."
Brunch outside at Beatrix was everything I wanted for a Saturday morning.  Lots of healthy options and the fresh juice killed it!
"This place is very fancy. I only go here for business breakfast/brunch/lunch. My last visit, i ordered a turkey burger. And they cooked it perfectly. It was juicy, moist, a good size as well."
"I can't say enough good things about this place. I have been here for brunch and lunch. Their food is excellent, portions are perfect- no doggie bags necessary. Coffee is fabulous, staff is super friendly. Perfect place for a date too. Reservations are definitely recommended for the weekends."
I've been here five times now and each time we have had a great meal. They have great cocktails and lots of juice options. The pork shank and chicken bebe are my favorite entrees. The turkey meatloaf is good but not as good. The salads are awesome and pretty large. For brunch the burger and the short rib sandwich are hard to go wrong with. The angel food muffins are really great. Sometimes the seating can be a little tight at peak times- like please don't seat me next to that mini fridge a staff member was opening every two seconds again - but that is the only complaint. The menu is fun and delicious.
"The breakfast menu says ""taste over trend"" at the bottom. I guess this is what they mean when they say something is ""ironic"" these days?The obviously hung over and grumpy waitstaff should have been a clue, but we stayed anyway. I'll forgive many transgressions, but the coffee in this place was the worst I've had in a decade. Seriously guys, re-using the grounds for a second pot is not cool. It was hard to pick something interesting from the kale-infused menu, so I ended up with the oatmeal with ""sun-dried sour cherries"". The cherries were plural, but only barely. Three cherry halves? Really? There weren't many oats to be found either--perhaps they think ""oatmeal"" refers to any generic hot cereal. Made me wish I had a horse to feed it to."
"Beatrix has redeemed itself. they sent me a gift certificate after talking with me in detail. which i used to order food again. this time, it came well prepared and as expected.  i have to say, their customer service standards have improved and/or are better than i expected."
"Such a huge fan...I can't wait to go back. Booked a last minute reservation last night via OpenTable at 7:30PM. I needed to push back the time a bit, so I called and they were very accommodating over the phone and were happy to push back my reservation to 7:45PM.When I arrived, I was greeted immediately by one of the hostesses. I took a seat since I was waiting on one more person and observed the scene around me. This place was poppin'! Once my friend arrived and we were seated, our server came up to our table within a couple minutes and thoroughly explained the drink menu, food selections and specials to us. She seemed very knowledgeable of everything they have to offer which was much appreciated. I ordered the Prime Burger medium rare with Havarti, and my friend ordered the Skirt Steak. We ended up ordering dessert as well - Chocolate Cake. Zero complaints from either of us! I'm looking forward to going back for breakfast and lunch soon."
"Food was fresh & excellent! I had the hummus and the kale salad...great! We were jn hurry to get to a show, they were accommodating! Weird music selection for a restaurant,., I'd recommend the place rather than endure standard bar food somewhere."
"My friend made a last minute reservation on Thursday which they accommodated us on, which was great.  The witness was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu dishes and very patient. Never had to ask for more water and she checked up reasonably throughout our time there. We started with the kennebec fries. Nice and crispy with a tasty dipping sauce. After asking the waitress a few questions I went with the brioche crusted branzino. This dish was so good I ate all up, no leftovers. My friend had the special which was a twist on beef stroganoff, which I did try and it was good. We did not have time for dessert. I plan on going back to try something else and a dessert. The waitress did recommend the caramel pie. I also want to try their bulletproof coffee. I look forward to my next visit!"
"Had the pleasure of 2 breakfast meals here. First up was their egg white omelet with spinach and the Acai/Pomegranite shot. Wow, that shot did some amazing things with my sleepy head! Next day I enjoyed the pot roast breakfast sandwich with jalapeno relish. The relish was soooo good. I mentioned how nice it was, and the manager gave me the rough recipe! Customer service was spot on. Thanks!"
"I had the prime roast sandwich on a white cheddar bun... find me a cot after eating that sandwich, it was soooooo good, I had to finish all of it... HAD TO. Also tried the deviled eggs which were pretty good and make sure to get the fries with the aioli and not sure what the green ""chimichurri"" look alike was, but it was great with the fries.  Also, being Indian, I had to try the vanilla bean kulfi... kulfi is basically an Indian version of ice cream.  It was served with this orange and pistachio sauce... I converted my peers into kulfi fans with this dish.  It was dang good.  Our server was great, even noticed when we were engrossed in a conversation and waited for the ""dull"" to interrupt... weird that I noticed it, but it was worth noting.  I like this place and want to come back for breakfast, which I heard was great as well."
"This is a fun new restaurant and a very welcome addition to River North. I came here for lunch and got the chicken meatballs (tsetsune), they were delicious. Had the supernatural salad (special) which was filling and fresh. The hummus was sadly on the bland side, and the hamachi crudo was a little fishier than I like, but the other great dishes and the fun atmosphere more than made up for it. For dessert we got the kulfi (Indian ice cream) and it was delicious.Great new spot and I will definitely be returning!"
"Had dinner with a friend here Saturday night and had a great time.  I loved the idea of being able to spike the coolers with whatever alcohol you like, as a person who hates whiskey, I loved this.  I had the skirt steak which was cooked perfectly (actually medium rare!  Yay!) and the fries were yummy.  My friend loved her salmon.  Our server was friendly, and the room was lively but not deafening.  Will definitely return."
"Went early on a Saturday night. Classy and hip. The arugula salad was good. We had a blackberry and lychee lemonade that was delicious. The burger was prepared well and tasty. The vegetarian meat loaf was  tasty too. My son had the braised ribs which he liked. Service was very good. Heck, we'll give it 4 stars."
"Over the summer, I was in Chicago for the weekend and ended up coming here 3 times, once for dinner, once for breakfast and once for a grab and go snack.  I love farm to table places and this place was so unique and well priced for the area.For grab and go, they have vegetable juices ready to go (kind of my new obsession).  The food  is delicious and feels very clean and light. For dinner I had the turkey meatloaf which was very filling and a good size. Their menu changes frequently, so it is a great place to go frequently and check out their new creations."
I crave Beatrix!!! It is so yummy! I work close by and try to come eat here as much as possible for lunch. The mushroom quinoa burger is my favorite in the city! The atmosphere is fantastic too. I recommend also trying the deviled egg appetizer and getting a fresh juice.
Service was great- waitress Nicole R was on the same wave length as my dad and understood his jokes! The habanero margarita was delicious! The lemon blackberry pancakes were the most fluffy things I've had in my life and my dad's mini Belgian waffles with Vanilla syrup and vanilla whipped cream were extremely scrumptious. To die for.
Salad was yum.  The cookies were beyond words.  Must have.
"We came for Brunch: This place upon arrival is super trendy and clean looking. To start I ordered the honey cinnamon latte, it was super creamy and lovely. I ordered the poached eggs and quinoa cakes. They looked beautiful, however my eggs were undercooked so I ate the plate with caution. My friends ordered the lemon pancakes and french toast which were both amazing. (wish i would have ordered those). The negative is the waiter, he approached us with out a smile or welcome. He acted annoyed when asked for drink refills, and when I told him I had received my food yet when everyone else was already eating. Overall, I would come back for maybe the bar scene, but I'm sure there a way better places in the area to have breakfast. Oh yeah, don't order the chicken sausage, my friend was sick all day upon eating it. :("
"My husband and I eat here on Saturdays, we love it. We always have great service, we usually always get a table very quickly, we talk to the wait staff who are extremely friendly and always in a good mood. Beatrix has great food, I have almost tried everything on the brunch menu, we love, love the brown sugar bacon, so delicious. The fresh squeezed juices are really good too."
"This place was very good, but the service was SLOW. It was also a bit more pricey than I usually seek out but the quality is good as they try to do the organic/local fare thing. I got chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a juice spiked with vodka, and we shared the hummus app. It was my birthday so they gave me a honking slice of Tall, Dark, & Handsome cake which was amazing. I would be back here, but bring the credit card...it adds up quick!"
Love the salads and juice! Wish they would add the chopped salad to dinner and brunch so I could order it all the time. My boyfriend said the burger was fabulous
"So looking for a brunch spot for the morning after our wedding, the most logical choice started at Beatrix, on the corner of Grand and Clark, connected with the Aloft hotel, where we'll have a block of rooms.   I had been there for dinner a few months ago and were pleasantly surprised.  In the end, you can look at the menu and you probably won't get too excited.   The room is nothing special.  It's essentially a hotel restaurant which will give it a few knocks already.That being said, for what Beatrix is, they do everything extremely well.  Fresh ingredients, simple but interesting recipes go a long way in terms of food.   And since we were there doing some wedding research, some free perks are always welcome....What's nice is we walked in on a Sunday around noon and there was essentially no wait, pretty rare for a solid brunch spot in the city these days.  The menu had a good choice of sweet and savory options, along with a few lunch-style items.Their juices are fresh and a bit different - there's a watermelon-strawberry, a juice with kale, pineapple, celery, and mint (which sounds oddly intriguing), and the one I got - the ""ginger snap"" - carrot juice, balanced with the right amount of apple and ginger to give it a hint of sweetness.As for the meal, well every Sunday (and apparently Saturday too) they set up a chilaquiles bar, buffet style.  Anyways, the chilaquiles was a nice blend of eggs, tortillas, cheese and pulled chieken - slather some on your plate, and add some extra queso fresco, salsa, pico de gallo, lime, and fresh red and green fresno chiles.   In the end, a great mix of pretty fresh ingredients - the peppers and green salsa gave a good amount of spice, and the pulled chicken was extremely tender. My dining partner  decided to go sweet with her dish, getting the lemon-ricotta pancakes.  These were some of the best 'cakes I've had in the city - again, nothing fancy, just perfectly cooked, they had a nice fluffiness to them and the right amount of lemon made them flavorful without being overpowering.Pretty stuffed at this point, the staff decided to send over some extra pastries to try out - you know, since we may be hosting an event here this summer.  The pastry bar at Beatrix is pretty impressive and if you're in the area in the morning and need a quick bite, I'd recommend stopping here over a Starbuck's or Caribou...I posted this on my blog - eatinginchicago2014.word… - check it out!"
"This was my first time visiting Beatrix.  I went for lunch with some friends.  We tried the stuffed peppers and mushroom quinoa burger.  I would highly recommend either of those dishes.  The burger didn't fall apart as some veggie burgers can, and it was not overly ""mushroomy"".  Great combination of flavors in the stuffed peppers too.  For the three of us, sharing these two dishes was perfect.  The service was good.  Timely and we didn't feel rushed."
"Returned to Beatrix Sunday with my wife and our friend.  Our first experience was not so great as we ended up sick.  The management was very nice and sent us a few gift certificates to try the restaurant again and seemed genuinely concerned.  It's been several months since we were here last so this time we returned with our friend and had a great experience.  Food was very good, we enjoyed the shank and halibut which were both prepared well.  Our friend is a vegetarian the the menu offered her plenty of options.  She went with the special which was stuffed peppers.  We started with the crudo which was very tasty.  Overall our experience was great and we would return without concern.  Wait staff was pleasant and we all enjoyed some well prepared cocktails such as the Blueberry Tom Collins and the Jalapeno margarita.  Caramel cake was excellent as well.  They appear to have a great selection of baked goods."
"While they might not like it this joint is currently being dubbed the lettuce entertain ""test kitchen"". This place is amazing.  The menu is fun and whimsical.  Nothing on this menu tastes bad.  It's a good place to try thing outside your comfort zone.  Also save room for dessert and get something to go from there pastry bar. Zucchini chocolate bread???? Sounds crazy tastes amazing."
"We've eaten here several times and have had consistently decent food. Repeat appetizers: deviled eggs (yum!), tsukune (meatballs), fries with egg. Beet carpaccio - small portion. Why skimp on cheap beets? Tomato soup average and ordinary. We've tried nearly every entree on the menu and have never been unhappy. Caramelized pork shank particularly yummy. They serve up with the consistency of a Lettuce restaurant. The only complaint is the atmosphere. You're really just sitting in half of a cavernous hotel lobby through which you must pass to use the loo and through which hotel guests sometimes inadvertently pass on their way to the front desk."
Wonderful little breakfast/brunch spot. The Pot Roast sandwich is the best. I would have given this place 5 star had we been seated next the window as we requested but were denied even though it wasn't very full. Service was OK & we wished it open earlier bc sometimes 8am is not early enough.
"Great food, good drinks, and good service. A few friends and I came toe Beatrix for breakfast, and we were all very happy. I had the waffles, and they were delicious, especially the vanilla whipped cream. A couple people ordered the lemon blackberry pancakes, and they were some of the lightest, fluffiest, yummiest pancakes I've had. I would definitely get that next time.We also ordered some mimosas - trying the red, blue, original, and with the mango nectar. I'd stick with the original.Service was good too. I'd definitely come back here!"
"Wow! Just had an increditable breakfast here as I checked out of my room at the attached aloft. It was there special this morning and seriously it was special! Pouched eggs over a bed of spicy red sause, kale and feta.  Yum!  Servers are great! I mentioned I was a little short on time and they really catered to my needs. I'll be back when I'm back in town"
"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Great prices for being downtown. The service is great, very attentive staff. Our waitress made excellent recommendations in both food and drinks. I had the pork shank, which was delicious, just fell right off the bone, didn't even need a knife. My husband had the skirt steak, which looked good and was cooked perfectly, but i felt the chimichurri needed some salt. The Effen black cherry sangria is pretty good, whiskey sour was awesome. The only thing i did not like was having to go through the whole restaurant to get to the hostess stand. You have to valet with the hotel, which means you have to use the entrance in the back of the restaurant. Also the bathroom was in the hotel lobby and the two times i went i had the janitor knocking on the door to get in and clean."
"Loved it!  First time here today.  My friend and I did a share -  the turkey burger was so juicy & flavorful and the chili chocolate salmon?  Fabulous!  The dessert was just OK - the blueberry cobbler type dessert really should have been served much warmer.  (My friend doesn't like caramel and that was the reco for the dessert :(.  Since I rarely have dessert, I won't base much of the review on that.  Can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
"Favorite Lettuce Entertain You restaurant.  I lived in Chicago for  two+ years and only found out about Beatrix a month before moving away. Now I make it my first stop when traveling back for business. Unlike other restaurants attached to hotels, Beatrix has a local vibe as well. Fabulous GF menu options-I still have friends ship me the vegan, GF choc chip cookies to me in NYC.  Beet salad and quinoa cakes are fantastic. Caesar salad with salmon is fabulous. Service *****. Atmosphere great for drinks, dinner, late night. Fabulous wine bar. can't get enough!"
"Had a really wonderful brunch here. The atmosphere was vibrant, but not too noisy. Lots of open air and it felt really clean. The food was really good, I had a hard time deciding what to order because lots of the options seemed great! I also enjoyed that they had a great juice offering. It was exactly what I was looking for when I had no idea where I was for my first time in Chicago. Thanks for an amazing experience!"
I went to Beatrix and ordered the lemon pancakes. They were not bad and a side of turkey bacon which was also not bad. I guess I was expecting the food to be so much more since I've heard great things. It was just okay
"Paige was great. Super nice and highly knowledgeable server. She did a very good job of giving us an overview on the food and the concept. She made my friend able to manage our expectations accordingly. But aside from service, oh and the amazing gooey caramel pie, it was pretty displeased.I get the whole healthy comfort food concept. An oxymoron at its finest, however it's not worth it. My friend had the truffled pasta with chicken and everything was just too delicate. Nothing warmed you up, as pasta should. The sweet potato was the dish's only saving grace.I had the ahi crudo. Super pretty, twas edible art. However, NOT A MEAL!! Not only was it the measliest portion, the flavors were subpar. Could barely taste the lime, there was no kick, and the ahi wasn't fresh. At least it's pretty.Kennebec fries... nooo taste. The egg on top just sorta plopped to one side. They should've poached the egg and put it in a saucer in which to dunk the dry bland potato, that sorta passed as fries.Thnks caramel pie for making the meal not an epic fail. Gooey, sweet, crunchy crust. Great end... Cause the cocktails sure assisting. blackberry lychee juice w/ tequilla - yea tasted like water."
I went here for lunch during a work day.  I really enjoyed it and it was a good place to have a business lunch. I would go back for dinner for sure.  I tried the turkey loaf and really enjoyed it.  Worth a trip if your looking for something new.
"The best way to describe my overall experience is:  eh.   Loved the atmosphere and they have very attentive staff.  The menu was somewhat limited, but I liked the healthier options available.  The kimchi chicken was good, but not offered with enough BBQ sauce.   Tuna appetizer was also good - our favorite dish of the night.  The fettuccini with egg came with two poached eggs, a lot of butter, and a few drops of truffle oil.  It lacked overall in presentation, taste and flavor.  If I were to return, it would definitely be for brunch."
We were just walking around before calling it a night in our hotel and ran into this place... and man were we happy we did! The food and service were equally amazing! The flavors in the dishes we ordered were delicious. The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable. When are meal came out they explained the ingredients that actually made up the dish so you knew exactly what you were eating. Wish I didn't live 2 hrs away because I would be hitting this place up all the time! Might have to make a special trip just to enjoy this amazing place!
"This place is incredible!  Visited Chicago over a long weekend and my husband and I kept going back.  Good service, nice ambiance, delicious food.  Had their waffles and enchiladas - both amazing!!  Needed to have an entree tweaked due to dietary restriction and they were so kind and took great care of us.  Would highly recommend!"
I love this place. It was perfect for a lunch meeting. The atmosphere was laid back and stylish. I'm a big foodie so the menu was exciting. There were so many dishes that I hadn't tried before (but definitely want to soon!). Definitely a must try for anyone looking for a hot spot in River North. Great for large groups or just a date.
"Staying one night at Aloft and had an early dinner last night. Fries with lemon were incredibly crispy, loved the lemon aioli it came with. I'm usually a ketchup and fries gal, but I didn't even feel the need to ask for ketchup. Pot roast was flavorful, fell apart under my fork, and contrasted nicely with crispy-chewy kale and mashed cauliflower. Had a carrot apple ginger snap juice that was quite refreshing. Best part, everyone was so friendly and welcoming. I forgot my credit card at the table (I'd been up since midnight) and the front desk called up to let me know. When I went down. the server saw me and made sure I had gotten it back.Now I'm having the honey cinnamon latte and a lemon-glazed angel food cupcake. Both are amazing. The latte has subtle flavors and is not too sweet, and the cupcake is light and fresh tasting. Will be back next time I'm in town."
"Great place! Trendy, affordable and delicious food. I've been here on brunch twice and completely enjoyed the experience. Giving it four stars only coz the cappuccino could've been stronger."
"Lunched here recently with a friend and had a pretty good experience all around. Made a reservation for 2pm on a Friday and am glad I did because it was actually very busy! Only a few tables were open. Not sure if that's because it's in the hotel (which I didn't know beforehand, but besides when you go to the restroom it doesn't feel like a hotel lobby restaurant) or due to long Friday afternoon work lunches. Our portions were pretty large, definitely enough to have leftovers to take home....even though we didn't because we ate everything, ha. Service was friendly and I actually liked the look of the place."
"Healthy tasty options! The salad with chicken was really good! They have really good drink/alcohol options, too. I also tried their green juice, which was good. Their pastries were way too sweet for me (cookie, angel cake, and cinnamon bun). Nice open windows, which are a big plus."
"I went here with a large group for my birthday and they were extremely accommodating. The food was EXCELLENT! I had the ""neatloaf"", which is one of their recommended dishes. It was sooooo good! The cookie bar is to die for. Ask them to warm up the cookies for you, you'll be in heaven."
We were staying at the Aloft and walked over for breakfast the first morning.  The restaurant has a nice décor.  They are famous for the Honey morning bun and it's to DIE for.  The Braised Pot Roast & Egg Sandwich was amazing.  My husband had the Spicy Chicken Tinga which was very well seasoned.  We just loved this place.
This was nice place for breakfast.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  The service is a bit slow as we had to wait quite a while to get our check so we could leave.
"Beatrix totally redeemed itself when I went for dinner a few weeks later. I had the turkey meatloaf and it was delicious. Also had the pot roast sandwich days later for lunch. Seriously was the best pot roast sandwich I ever have had..including my own and I make a damn good pot roast! So, felt it only fair that update my review since Beatrix now is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants :-)"
"This is the best breakfast place in Chicago!Delicious, creative food, fresh juices and my server Raymond was unbelievable!"
Food was pretty good. We waited an extra 45 min after our original reservation which was slightly annoying. But great ambiance and the service was especially nice after we made clear that we were unhappy about the wait time.
"We went there for dinner, this place was great! Ambiance was nice and the food was amazing. You definitely get your money's worth. It is not that pricy and everything we tried was delicious. You have to try the tall chocolate cake - to die for!"
"My friend and I came for dinner and it was crowded and lively.  The decor was interesting. One 1/3 of it looked liked a coffe bar/ breakfast place with cute breakfast displays, the next 1/3 looked like a upscale nice bar with back lit stacked liqueur bottles, the last section looks like a lounge/club with soft neon lights with cool lounge chairs (think it is probably part of the hotel next door).  Their menu included tons of YUMMY fresh juices that you can request to add alcohol. We ordered tons of snacks/appetizers and split the special which was vegetable lasagna as an app as well. It was super filling and I was in trouble when I got my main entree which was carmelized pork flank cooked in a cider reduction. It was huge and can probably be split among two people. It  was tender, juicy, absolutely delicious. The meat just slid right off the bone and every bite was a delight.  I just wish I could have finished it completely!  My friend go the neat-loaf and had to get it to go since we were stuffed.  It was yummy and flavorful cooked with tons of veggies and made with turkey.  We were soo full that we had no room for dessert. I have to come back for their brunch since their brunch menu looks amazing!"
"Straight A salad was perfect. Salads that have flavor but aren't too heavy are a rare find, but Beatrix nailed it. Also got salmon on the side, and it was perfectly done. Caramel pie... was incredible. Atmosphere is lively and fun, only complaint is the music is like Top 40 and just doesn't fit vibe. But everything else is perfect"
"I really focus on eating healthy, and knowing I was having dinner in restaurants three times this week (which can often lead to going off the rails, especially if I splurge on a few cocktails), I was very happy with the choices at Beatrix.I really like the big space, with a variety of seating options offered to us when we checked in (regular table, high top, or comfy lounge).  We opted for a regular table and promptly ordered the quinoa cakes and the hummus to start.  The quinoa was light, flavorful with a slight crunch, served with olive oil drizzled grape tomatoes.  The hummus was fine, also served with grape tomatoes and extra olive oil.For dinner I chose the 3 grain salad with chicken which was fantastic!  Lightly seasoned with shaved cheese and blueberries.Having made wise choices, I split a decadent slice of the caramel pie.  So. Damn. Good.Server was excellent, fun attitude and attentive.  All around a great experience for a relatively new place, will definitely be back."
"This is a ""must try"" for summer. I did enjoy my experiences (solo, with a friend, working, or with a group) at Beatrix and would go back. Environment - 4 stars.Service - 4 stars.Food and Beverage - 4 starsLocation - 5 stars. Environment - comfortable bar when waiting on a friend. Dining area for a group is lovely. We felt a bit strange with a group, with another party butting against ours. Other than that, it was comfortable. I love the open air environment. The restrooms feel a bit misplaced and are hard to find. I love working from the breakfast bar area.Food - I recall having a meatloaf dish and sharing a plate of deviled eggs. We shared mac and cheese and a chicken dish as well. The salads were good.Service - Friendly. Was stalled a bit a few times during the meal, but was mostly quick. Sitting at the bar is always a good experience. Bar tends are quick and attentive.Location - Perfect spot. You can easily walk here from anywhere, or easily hop on a train or grab a cab."
"Really like this new restaurant.  Like the open feel, and nice decor.   Came here earlier this week for a co-workers birthday/team lunch.  Got to see several of the items on the menu.I got the prime burger which was delicious, and had a chance to taste the carmel cake dessert that was also very good.  The only person who didn't enjoy their food had the pasta.  I didn't even recognize what it was when they brought it to the table, as it was two huge lasagna sheet noodles laid out on the plate which parmesan grated on top.  It was strange, small, and hard to eat.  I will absolutely be back here.  It's a fantastic addition to the area."
"Ate at Beatrix with a group of friends, i was dying to try the poached eggs truffle pasta but they were out of it so i ended up ordering the neatloaf.... It was delicious! I will have to come back for the pasta...."
"Not usually a fan of hotel restaurants (attached to the A loft hotel), but Beatrix proved a pleasant surprise.  This review is for a Thursday night dinner, but, based on other reviews, it sounds like this would be a good spot to try for brunch.  It was busy considering it was a week night which contributed to the vibrant atmosphere.  Decor and menu were simple.  Not overly trendy.  A little of something for most.We ordered:Tsukune meatballs (shared)Chili & Chocolate Salmon (mine)Caesar salad with Greek yogurt dressing (guest)Caramel Pie (shared)Cherry SangriaEverything we had was cooked to perfection and delicious.  My salmon was probably the best salmon filet I have had in quite some time.  Don't be afraid of the chili/chocolate crust...embrace it.  It's amazing.  And oh.my.god- that caramel pie.  This was a first for me.  My mom is Asian so caramel pie was far from the dessert repertoire we grew up with.  It's very rich.  I definitely recommend sharing.The only thing knocking this down a star was our service was a bit slow.  I know our server's section was slammed, but a check in between courses here and there would go a long way."
"We went based on location and menu.  We were there for dinner and ordered the pot roast with spaghetti squash, meatloaf and salmon as our entres.  We also had the soup and crisp kale salad which we shared. The food was wonderful and I cannot say enough about the service.  I the waiter was helpful in our ordering so that we could share tastes yet not order too much food.  My only disappointment was the chia pudding, but the caramel crack pie made up for it. Now I want to experience their brunch!"
"Great spot for brunch! Solid menu, not too crowded, delightful space."
"Just had the most disappointing lunch at Beatrix. Came here for work and wanted to come back with my spouse who likes to eat healthy. We were greeted rudely upon arrival and told we had to choose, lunch or dinner menu. A more appropriate way to go about it would've been to give us both menus and let us look. The waiter was nice enough but advised that the pasta I wanted was creamy and rich with some gooey cheese mixed in. He explained it as a layer of pasta with egg on top plus another layer of pasta on top. I'm thinking like a bowl of creamy pasta or a mostaccioli dish. No. This was a sheet of lasagna type pasta topped by two eggs with another thin strip of the lasagna pasta on top. Not mixed together at all. The sauce is oily, not creamy, so it slides right off the pasta.  Cheese is congealed on the ends of asparagus (no tips) and not part of the pasta dish. This was the worst meal I've eaten in a very long time, especially at what I thought was a nice restaurant. I cannot believe they would serve something that is so poorly conceptualized. Even the nice poaching of the eggs could not save a dish that simply makes no sense, particularly when it was described as something else. And The waiter did nothing about it. I would not recommend it.  I will not be coming back."
"My husband and I stopped in here after a long walk around Chicago and we were looking for some place for dinner. Overall, I was very impressed. For drinks, my husband got the pineapple habanero margarita - good and very strong! I had the honeydew cilantro lime drink with some vodka, also good.I was a little scared by the name of my entree - the ""neatloaf"" - but the description sounded good, so I ignored the strange name and ordered it anyway. It was a turkey meatloaf made with sweet potatoes and greens inside. Fantastic! It came with some really delicious braised kale too and buttery mashed potatoes. My husband got the skirt steak with fries - also tasty, but of course I liked mine better. The dessert menu sounded good but we were way too stuffed to try anything. And the bakery case also looked phenomenal, I was ready to sneak a few angel food cake muffins out for another time but my otherwise full stomach convinced me not to.I can definitely say we'd like to come back sometime and try some more food on the menu, I would love to have a taste of the caramelized pork and some of those desserts."
"Well, they have it all. Breakfast, brunch, and diner. Wine bar, full alcohol bar attached to a coffee bar and pastry case (say what!?). I highly recommend coming here for the brunch option. The pot roast breakfast sandwich is to die for, and if you're in the mood for something sweet you can check out the pastry case where you will find cookies as big as your face. To wet your whistle they offer intelligentsia and metropolis coffee as well as fresh squeezed juices that are tay-sty. There are also gluten free and vegan options let everyone feel included."
"This place was recommended to me over Sunday brunch, and I made it down that same night for an early dinner. Overall I was very happy with the food. The make-it-yourself Salmon tacos, burger and fries were all ""5-Star"". The burger and fries were particularly good -- which is noteworthy as I feel like it is tough to differentiate a ""no-frills"" hamburger from all the restaurants on/around Hubbard.The hummus and roasted chicken -- on the other hand -- were only so-so (according to my dining-mates).The fruit juices and adult-beverages looked better than they tasted. The creative concoctions struck me as overly-sweet and less-than-strong.No complaints about the service, although the scene (a trendy-yet-simple layout in the aLoft hotel) was kinda weird. The place was also empty except for a couple hotel guests at 6pm on a freezing Sunday night.Overall, I think Beatrix offers a convenient high-value alternative to many of the other River-North eateries. I'd particularly recommend it for breakfast or an early - quality -weekend snack and drink."
"Great cocktails and tasty good. A nice variety of dishes at very reasonable prices, especially for downtown/ River North. Outstanding whiskey sour. The gazpacho, chicken meatballs, three-grain salad and turkey ""neatloaf"" we're all delicious. Service was attentive and efficient. We can't wait to go back."
"This is a local favorite!  We come here so often whether it is for brunch or dinner. The caramel pie is out of this world and the rest of the menu is pretty guilt-free, yet delicious."
"My wife and I come to Chicago frequently to see our daughter who resides in Lincoln Park.  We have eaten at probably close to 40 different restaurants. Chicago is not short on amazing places to dine! We ate at Beatrix recently and I have to say Beatrix has moved to the top of our list of 40.  Upon arriving the atmosphere was festive, the decor chic, the hostess greeting warm and friendly. There were no available reservations until 9:30 but they graciously  found us a table .  The menu has so many intriguing dishes to choose from that it was difficult to make a decision.  Our choices were all right on the mark....deviled eggs...kale salad...Chicken with asparagus ..short ribs with mashed cauliflower ...branzino ...Everything was delectable!!!! The fish was nor quite warm enough so we asked to have it warmed. The staff was beyond apologetic and accommodating . Several different staff apologized and were so sincerely upset.  They obviously have exceedingly high expectations for pleasing their patrons.  Our waitress  Jennifer was top notch...attentive...engaging ... The manager , Cassandra,  is well deserved of the position as she went above and beyond ...apologizing for the temperature of the fish...insisting on taking it off the bill...and treating us to two of the restaurants awesome desserts.  I observed Cassandra constantly on the move ..attending to so many patrons...filling water glasses....clearing dishes...greeting guests...checking to make sure that everything was perfect for the  dining experience! She was setting a great example for her staff!!!Overall a wonderful evening at a restaurant we will highly recommend to others and return to soon."
"It's been a while since I've been inspired to Yelp a restaurant, and to do so at 5 stars.  The evening with wife was near flawless.  Seated us earlier than rez on a Friday night.  Seated on a table that had one part of it on a bench with pillows.  Wife loved that!  Service was attentive.  The Red Blend (from Walla Walla) excellent choice and not too expensive at $54.  Appetizers of Potato Salad Deviled egg and the Avocado/Pumpkin Carpaccio were both fabulous.  Server explained his dinner favorites and was helpful in narrowing down our choices.  We chose the Pork Shank special and wife chose the Branzino.  Hers was a 5 and mine a 4 (pork a tad dry), but the quinoa and accompanying vegetable were great.  Tall Dark handsome chocolate cake to finish was great (and gluten free).  We took a couple gluten free cinnamon rolls for the next morning.  Wow!  Upon remarking what a great meal this was, we noticed it was a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant.  Now it all fits together.  How does LEYE continue knocking out great concepts like this??"
"Love this place! Met a girlfriend here for brunch Saturday and was very impressed. The brunch menu is fabulous - healthy/delicious options, fresh juices, etc. Gorgeous/cute interior, open windows for dining inside/out. I will definitely be back!"
Loved this place!  My husband and I met a friend here for breakfast while visiting Chicago.  It was amazing!  He had the lemon pancakes and I had the egg white omelette.  Definitely my favorite breakfast we had in the city.
"Had the chocolate salmon tacos. Salmon cooked perfectly - crisp on the exterior, soft and moist inside. Served with fresh corn tortillas and a crisp slaw. Had the chiffon pumpkin pie for dessert. Fresh and served as the perfect finish. Good value, too."
"We went for dinner last night. The menu is fairly simple(ish), but executed well. Nothing stood out as amazing or awful, but we both liked our food. Drinks were good. Juices very fruity- liked a lot. What impressed me most was the amazing service. Both servers (server and busboy) were incredibly helpful, fun, easy to talk to, very very helpful. You HAVE to check out the pastry bar. Angel food cake muffin, hello!?"
"Reliable and good food. They have many options in terms of price, vegetarian, healthy vs. indulgent. It is a crowd pleaser and good for groups. Beatrix is much different from any other ""hotel restaurant"" I have been to in the US. Definitely worth a try!"
"Went here with a co-worker for lunch while traveling to Chicago for business. The service was great and so was the food!  The two of us shared the potato salad deviled eggs and golden beet carpaccio. I had the supernatural chopped salad as my  main and it was absolutely delicious. The lettuce was fresh, the dressing was light and the portion was ample. To drink I had the acai and pomegranate boost which was good, but I wish the server would've mentioned it comes as a shooter because I was expecting a full glass.  Would love to come back here again next time I'm in town!"
"Healthy, upscale and affordable!"
"We ducked into this place as we were walking by and hungry for brunch. A nice very clean place, excellent service and unique tasty food. We each had a bloody mary and found them delicious. The service was quick, friendly and straight forward.  The menu was small but covered most bases and just different enough to be interesting.  I would suggest this for anyone interested in a higher class of food for a medium price. I would definitely like to try more of their food."
Went here for dinner with a group of 6 people on a Wednesday night. Service was great. The food left something to be desired. I was kind of disappointed for a LEYE restaurant. Go for drinks & appetizers. That was the best. The fries were amazing. So was the ahi
"One of the best brunches I've had in Chicago. Great atmosphere, great service and most importantly great food."
Beatrix offers a wonderful and healthy brunch. The service was great as well. I would recommend making a reservation!
"I really, really liked Beatrix. I'm not sure if it was the friendly host staff or the sweet waitress, or maybe it was the very tasty food, but all of it combined for a lovely earlybird date night for my sweetie and me. The decor is lovely, all open, with nice seating arrangements. There is a bigger communal table toward the kitchen side. Speaking of which, I was able to witness a member of the kitchen staff cut up an inordinate amount of herbs the night we dined. Seriously, good knife skills, guy.We started with the potato salad deviled eggs (because, duh, deviled eggs) and gazpacho, and were off to a great start. Both were perfectly on point for a lighter starter for a warm summer evening. I especially loved the gazpacho, as it was delightfully zingy and not at all like cold tomato soup. The diced veggies on top were a lovely tough to add some texture to the soup.I went with the 3-Grain Salad with Miller Farm's Chicken and quickly became a member of the clean-plate club. On the lighter side, the grains were lovely, the chicken was perfectly cooked, and the blueberries, in season, added nice little sweet bits to the savory. Good stuff. My husband enjoyed the pork shoulder. He's a fan of all things pork, but was drawn in by  the buttery mashed potatoes. He also joined the clean plate club.We rounded out our meal with a cappucino (nice foam art) and the chocolate cake. Delightful. Also, two thumbs up to the fresh juice cocktails. While temporarily abstaining, the watermelon and strawberry cooler did the trick. I barely missed a shot of my favorite poison.I'd definitely go back. The food was fresh, the service attentive, and the space lovely."
"Had an excellent brunch here on Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend. Our server, Jake, who was also running the side bar at the time, took great care of us. He had great recommendations and was very accommodating of my girlfriends 'particular' drinking requests. Excellent food and atmosphere here, but, as with most great spots, it was the people that put it over the top. Will definitely be back."
"Shocked. A (new) Lettuce Entertain You Enterprise restaurant serving something other than mediocre, over-priced food? Yes, it's true. The restaurant's interior is nice enough for date night, but casual enough for catching up with a friend. Plenty of different styles of seating are available to fit your mood as well: bar, table, high-top, dining room, etc.Service was good: attentive, friendly, quick to make detailed recommendations and sing the praises of their favorite dishes. Went with the ""NEATLOAF"" -- their take on ""meat"" loaf but made with turkey instead of ground beef and stuffed with chunks of sweet potato (!). Very, very, very good - it was essentially moist comfort food without being heavy. Would definitely get again.For dessert, they have a classic menu with pies and cakes, as well as a pastry counter with sweets too good to be true. I ended up grabbing two recommended cookies (chocolate chip and peanut butter sandwich) and have no regrets about them. One of THE BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. Gives New York's Jacque Torres a run for his gooey chocolaty money.Drinks are made with fresh-squeezed juices. They also have an all-American wine list. I settled with a bloody mary and it was one of the best I've had. So, kudos.Beatrix for the win."
"Great place for brunch. Besides the restaurant they have  a small coffee counter with pastries and great color juices (green power: kale, celery, etc... blue: blueberry, etc)"
"Visiting Chicago this past weekend, I was eager to try Beatrix as I'd heard good things. Met my parents for brunch there on Saturday and it did not disappoint! Service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious, light and yet very satisfying. I highly recommend sharing a plate of the tsukune--wonderfully sweet and savory meatballs. I also enjoyed the spicy chicken tinga, and my mom's chimichurri steak and egg dish was beautifully done. In the end, I ended up sampling something from everyone's plate, and everything was delicious. We definitely will be coming back on our next visit to the city."
"This is basic food done well and with a bit of flare. Due to food allergies, I stuck with oatmeal. It was excellent! And how often can you say that? I would also recommend their fresh squeezed juices. The combinations made for a tasty meal. Even if you're not able to get seated at a table outside (my preference), the building has accordion doors and slide completely open so the restaurant is open to the elements. This was wonderful! I felt the service could improve. It appeared many servers were working their tails off, but our guy was a bit... Dumb. Will return again!"
"We went here for dinner on a Friday and loved it. The food - we loved everything we ordered. We ordered the pappardelle with eggplant special for our appetizer (delicious), and the salmon and pot roast for dinner (both incredible). Everything was so flavorful. For dessert we had heard their cookies are amazing so we asked for a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and hot fudge on top. It's not on the menu, but our server had them make it for us and it was awesome.The service - very good. Probably the best server we've had in a long time. He was very friendly, welcoming, attentive, knew everything about the menu, and had a dessert made for us that wasn't on the menu.The atmosphere - nice, very lively. Made for a fun Friday night.Overall - we left very happy and will definitely be returning!!"
The enlightened Cesar will have you second guessing any other salad you've ever consumed. Tuna tartar & tsukune were delicious as well. So happy to live up the street to continue trying to rest of the menu!
"I went back to Beatrix this weekend, this time for brunch. The food and drinks were all good and, although I had qualms about the service las time I was there, we had a great waiter this time around. 3 people at our table got the pot roast egg sandwich and I got the quiche special; everyone was satisfied. We had another person join our party last minute and they were very accommodating about moving us to a larger table right away. Definitely had a better experience this time around and would go back again for brunch."
"Went here with a group of 7 for restaurant week.  Of course, a little math and we all realized that the restaurant week deal saves you about $2, at the expense of a much smaller menu.  So despite that being the impetus of our reservation, we ended up all ordering off the regular menu, which I think was a great decision.  We shared a number of apps, and my favorite was definitely the tsukune, which is a 4 little meatballs in a great Asian sauce.  We also split the vegetarian special of the day - gluten free mac and cheese - as an app and it was outstanding.  If they have that when you go, order it!  For my entree I got the neatloaf, which was surprisingly awesome.  It comes in a delicious gravy that's awesome on everything on the plate.  The potatoes and kale are perfectly seasoned, rather than just being bland side items.  And bonus, the next morning I mixed my leftovers together, sauteed them and topped with a fried egg and it was amazing!  Definitely get a doggy bag if you can't finish it!  For dessert we LOVED the tall dark and handsome.  The caramel cake everyone raves about was so sweet it was hard to eat, and the chia pudding was a bit odd, and not nearly sweet enough.  But the tall dark and handsome is worth going back for!  Overall great experience, I would definitely go back if I were in the area, or maybe try brunch."
"Unique restaurant interior, feels cozy and outdoorsy within a new hotel in River North. The menu seemed like there were plenty of healthy options to choose from. We had a ceviche special (wasn't a big fan of the chips it came with, but very flavorful nonetheless), Straight A salad (was tasty and basic, but wished there was more avocado and asian pear), and the pasta with a poached egg (different and very good, it came in a great light white sauce)."
"Great food, great ambiance. I was very pleased with my brunch dish and would love to go back simply to grab a specialty coffee beverage from their bar!"
"Restaurant Beatrix is located on busy Clark Street in River North.  As my wife and I walked in we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess.  She sat us at a lovely table facing Clark.  I was struck by the huge, open windows.  Though we were seated inside, it was like dining al fresco.  The atmosphere was open, warm and inviting.Moments after being seated, we were greeted by a dapper, mustachioed server.  He told us about the fresh juice cocktails, and my wife ordered the Wow! Ginger Sangria.  It was a bit sweet for me, but she loved it.  I prefer a drier aperitif, so I browsed the wine menu.  I was surprised to see all the wines were from American vineyards.  Being Argentine, I'm partial to Malbec, so I chose Clayhouse from Paso Roblas, Ca.  And it was good!We began our feast with the Enlightened Caesar.  Being a bit of a foodie, it was nice to see the dressing was homemade.  I noticed the capers, which gave it away.  The dressing was nicely done and light, yet flavorful.I wanted a light dinner, so I ordered the Hamachi Crudo.  My wife ordered the Skirt Steak Chimichurri.  Chimichurri, of course, is also from Argentina.  It is a delicious condiment made of parsley, garlic, olive oil and vinegar.  Hmm, perhaps this American Restaurant borrows from its immigrants?  Either way, the Hamachi was delicious, light, flavorful and pretty to look at.  My wife loved the skirt steak and Chimi.  It had a nice char and was seasoned perfectly, but the Chimi is the exclamation point.  I will also give a thumbs up to the Kennebec fries.  You can't beat freshly prepared fries.It was a relaxing dinner, but an attentive one.  The mustachioed wonder was always nearby, but didn't hover.  One of the managers, I believe his name was John, introduced himself to us.  But the topper was when one of the Executive Partners of Lettuce sat down for a few minutes with us.  We were treated like VIPs.  I loved the open air feeling, which provided some great people watching on Clark.  The service was phenomenal, and the food, though eclectic, was delightful.  We capped the night off at the Bank of America Theater, where we saw, ""The Book of Mormon"".  It was a great show, but I couldn't get that Hamachi out of my mind."
"The interior is nice, the food is ok, and the juices are a waste of money"
"Beatrix exceeded my expectations. The ambiance was warm and inviting. The service was great and the food was well prepared and delicious.  We had the hummus starter, and split the three grain salad and the burger. We will definitely be back!"
"I was lucky to be able to attend the preview of Beatrix, and I was very impressed! I wish this place was in my neighborhood, but then I'd probably end up eating there all the time. At this price point, though, I might actually be justified.First, the space: it's interesting without being overdone.  It's got a casual, laid-back vibe, like you're hanging out at someones well-appointed home.  I could definitely see coming in here for coffee and a snack during the day as well.  It's a space you want to spend time inDrinks: The cocktail list was comprised of classics with a twist, like a pineapple-habanero margarita and a blueberry Tom Collins - perfect summer cocktails.   I had the whiskey sour, which was delicious and refreshing.  They have a decent list of wines by the glass, too, and plenty of sparkling options - my favorite!  They offer fresh juices, which I didn't get a chance to try, but they sounded delicious.  I appreciate having interesting nonalcoholic beverage options for those times when you're forced to abstain from imbibing.  There's even an option to add a shot to any of the juices.  Plus, Metropolis AND Intelligentsia coffee?!  How will I choose?Food: Yum!  The food was so fresh, interesting but accessible.  I could take my finicky-eater sister here, and also a ""foodie"" friend and they would both be happy.  The tomato gazpacho was so fresh, it tasted like it had come from the garden.  The 3-grain salad was a favorite...who would have known that the combo of chicken, grains, arugula and blueberries could taste so sublime?  The turkey neatloaf was the epitome of comfort food.  We had the chocolate cake for dessert, which was everything dessert should be.  I can't wait to go back....again and again."
"My experience at Beatrix was absolutely great. From the service to the food,  everything was worthy of five stars. The first sign that this is a great restaurant is that there is valet. Granted it's for the hotel attached (Aloft). But it was still a plus especially since it's located on a busy corner. I went with four of my friends for Saturday brunch. Our waiter came by and took our drink orders while we waited for the last two people in our party of five. I got the watermelon strawberry juice and an iced coffee. Both were delicious. The menu is small, but has basically everything you would want for brunch. It even includes a list of mouth watering sides that includes brown sugar bacon (crispy and slightly sweet), hash browns, berries and melons, and potato salad deviled eggs, which sounded interesting. I don't really remember waiting for our food because I was enjoying my drinks, but I can't imagine it taking too long. When placed on the table, every dish was hot and looked mouth watering. Even the vanilla greek yogurt with granola and berries had a gourmet touch. I got the light and fluffy lemon pancakes with blackberries. They were indeed light and fluffy. Each of the three cakes in my order, not bigger than the length of a dollar bill, were not overly filling like typical pancakes are. I had plenty of room for my side of brown sugar bacon and a bite of each of my friend's meals. For my second visit, I would definitely get the poached eggs on quinoa cakes. My bite of the dish had great texture with the salty quinoa and the eggs were perfectly runny. And I don't usually like runny eggs. The thing that allows my review to have 5 stars is the service. The waiter was knowledgable of the whole menu, let us taste one of the vegetable juices, checked on us often but not to the point of being obnoxious, and when my friend's dish showed up not even five minutes later than the rest of ours, it was comped from our bill. Then on our way out, we stopped at the pastry bar, obviously. My friend couldn't decide which muffin and cookie to get. We took the manager's recommendations, and then he told us one of them was on the house! Two pastries for the price of one! I will definitely come back here. I want to try the dinner and lunch menu. I would also come here for a cup of coffee and a small snack. Has a low key, casual atmosphere, but still very trendy without having to try."
"Had a business lunch here yesterday and really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the service.  I enjoyed the rare meatless sandwich--the Green Club--and my coworkers raved about the Gazpacho!   Parking's a bear but go if you're in the 'hood."
"2nd time was much much better!  This time we were all seated right away in the front with a view of the street.  Great people watching!  My only complaint is the variety.  If they had more snacky foods then we would have had a starter.  The menu is a little sparse.  But what they do have seems to be excellent.  The server was great - he even joked with us which I love.My boyfriend and I both got the truffle, poached egg and pasta dish.  Very rich and comforting!  My friend got the meatloaf like dish and he loved it.  His girlfriend tried the special which was Korean chicken BBQ.  She thought it was wonderful.  For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and the caramel pie.  WHOA - that pie was outstanding.  I'd come back just for that.  The cake was rich and good but really didn't stand a chance next to the caramel pie.So yeah I'd be back.  I would choose Hub 51 over Beatrix b/c they have those nachos and other shareables.  But this is a nice change up."
"The first time I dined here, it was great. Service was great, food was great.Second time, they messed up my friends juice, and two of my friends orders. They took forever correcting our orders. They never cleared our plates out. We were celebrating a friends bday. The manager came by and apologized for all the mishaps, and TOTALLY COMPED OUR WHOLE CHECK!Thought that was really nice of them to do that. We didn't even complain much even though we were bummed about the experience. I am glad to see that they noticed they had made so many mistakes and they went out of their way to take care of everything.Despite all of the mishaps of that dinner, I'll definitely dine at Beatrix again.The food is fantastic after all, they just need to tweak their service."
"Had lunch here today and everything was fine -- the menu is definitely going to appeal to vegetarians and people with gluten allergies (all the desserts are gluten-free). Everything is designed to be light and relatively healthy so you don't leave stuffed. I had a Blueberry Tom Collins, which was delicious. All the homemade juices sound delicious and you can get a shot added to any of them to make them into cocktails.Food-wise, I started with the gazpacho, which was delicious (and for a $7 bowl of soup, it should be!). Then I had the special, which was an egg salad BLT. This was just okay, nothing special. Could have used a little more seasoning/salt to elevate above a sandwich I could make at home. The side salad of romaine hearts with capers and lemon vinaigrette was actually the star on the plate.  My friend wanted the neatloaf, but only after he ordered it did our server say they were out of it. This is a pet peeve -- you need to tell guests what is 86'ed BEFORE they decide what they are ordering.  He got the salmon entree instead and enjoyed it, but wasn't wowed.  It did take a long time to get a check and then there was some confusion about the gazpacho we got to go, but a manager intervened and solved the problem with grace. It's early days so maybe once they've worked out the kinks, it will be a 4 or 5 star LEYE joint, but as of now...it's okay/good, could be better.Decor was fun/trendy, though the mismatched chairs felt a little random since nothing else is mismatched (plates, table decorations, silverware). Just my opinion, but obviously NBD.Oh, final note: the valet service was $14 and not very professional. The three guys argued for 2 minutes about who would get our car, and then one of them got into some kind of altercation with a guy from another valet service in the neighborhood...that stuff shouldn't happen in front of guests!"
"I wanted to like Beatrix more, mostly because our server was very nice. But they just did not have it together. From the wobbly table, to the condensation dripping on us from an exposed duct that they had wrapped in aluminum foil (cannot make that up), the ambiance that started out very open and nice became annoying. More so were the food runners who were plopping plates on top of our full app plates while we were eating and expecting us to figure it out...when there was plenty of open space on the other side of the table. The food did not help. The kale salad had no kale but romaine lettuce, nobody bothered to tell us, I guess they assumed we wouldn't notice. The fries were definitely not frites. The quinoa app was overcooked. Everything essentially disappointed, with the exception of the chocolate cake. So many better choices in River North."
"We had a great meal tonight, and want to give a special shout out to Steven the host! Last night we tried to get in but couldn't score a reservation. We stopped by for dessert and made reservations for this evening for our family. Had a great time and a great meal: tenderloin ragout, steak chimichurra and pork shank. Our table enjoyed the pork shank the most and LOVEd the Oh My caramel pie. Thanks for the nice night, we will be back and congrats on the Bib Gourmand!"
"Love the food, (the branzino and the short rib are both incredible), love the drinks and love the atmosphere!  Great place for a date night!  I come here at least twice a month.  Definitely recommend!"
"I really enjoyed both the atmosphere and food at Beatrix.  My friends and I went for lunch and although the place was jammed, it's large enough that we got a beautiful table with no wait, and the service was excellent.  Lots of tempting items on the menu, including both lighter and heavier fare. After a lot of dithering, I got the pot roast sandwich on a cheddar bun, which was really rich and delicious.  The side of fries, which I usually consider something of an afterthought, was also extremely tasty.  I definitely want to return to try some of the other menu options, too!  If you're a fan of sweets, the caramel pie is not to be missed.My one gripe is the one that I often have with downtown eateries...I'll let you get away with an $11 cocktail, but it really irritates me when local craft beers are priced at $9.  That is some nonsense, right there."
"Brunch experience was... exceedingly above average in all respects -- service, food, cocktails, baked goods, etc.  After sampling 4 dishes with my diningmates we all concluded everything was excellent.  Spicy bloodmaries were a hit and services was perfect brunch pace.  Brunch competition in Chicago is stiff and Beatrix, while not a tier 1 place, is right up there."
"Food was better than expected. I'd say a solid 4 stars for the food and the potential to go up even from there. The concept for the place seems a little vague but think if it as Lettuce Entertain You's take on farm to table in concept if not literal execution (my fish was from Spain, not exactly local but delicious nonetheless).It also has a sort of health bent to it with lots of grains and so on used in various dishes. Everything we had was creative, light and well done. The atmosphere is nice but certainly not original. I am so tired or recycled wood and Edison bulbs. I think every place to have opened in the past 5 years showcases Edison bulbs and Beatrix is no exception. It's boring now guys... Almost feels dated in fact. Anyway the reason I'm removing a star is partially because the concept is somewhat tired but more because of some service issues. Our waitress was super nice and friendly and yet we never got our appetizer. We had extensive conversations with her about it and chose one to split... But it just never came. When our entrees came I pointed this out and she was very apologetic and yet offered no explanation. I assume she never put the order in which is unacceptable. Sure, mistakes happen, not a huge deal but some acknowledgement would have been nice. I sort of assumed that they would comp dessert which is kind if standard in this case but they did not. Nor did they comp a drink or make any effort to make up for the error. Finally this food would really benefit from having bread. They do not have any. They should have awesome house baked bread, even if they charged. They have zip. I asked if they had bread and was told I could have some naan bread (they have it as part if an appetizer) but not only is that odd for what we were eating but we were also finished at that time. So good food, nice if repetitive atmosphere, oddly loud or at least very hard to hear those at your table, and in need of better training for the staff in how to handle mistakes. 3 stars for now though we may give it another shot."
"This review is for LUNCH.Beatrix is fabulous, everything from the apps to entrees to desserts were impeccable. Another Lettuce Entertain You success!Apps:Hummus: Pretty good, very standard. Good hummus to pita ratioChicken meatballs: Amazing! The sauce is fantastic - a must try.Kennembec fries: FANTASTIC. Egg on top is great and the homemade aioli is delicious. entrees:chili chocolate salmon: everything about this dish is great. Perfect portion size. Freshly made corn tortillas and great. The asian almond slaw is refreshing and provides a great crunch. A good addition to this might be some sort of pico de gallo. Salmon perfectly cooked and the mole is fantastic. Desserts:Caramel pie: WOW! Not too sweet, incredibly thick and creamy. Served with homemade whipped cream.Chocolate chip cookie: high end chocolate, a little chewy, crispy sides. They should offer this warmed up with a glass of milk. I will certainly be back... everyone i was with loved it. Something for everyone - highly highly recommend. Only downside: Dear Beatrix - PLEASE TURN DOWN the music during lunch. it was REALLY LOUD"
"Great breakfast, the fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing, and the best bacon I've had in my life. A+"
"This was a pleasantly surprising find for a pre-show dinner Sat night enjoyed by everyone at our table.  They have 5 fresh juice cocktail drink options, great for the summer and always good to have creative nonalcoholic options (although I think you can add a shot to them as well).  Loved the cucumber mint soda the best.We ordered: the burger, 3 grain salad, neatloaf, poached egg and truffled pasta, and chicken and pudding.  The restaurant is going for the concept of locally sourced, healthy meals.  I'm not completely sure how all of these fit the healthy concept, but they were all completely delicious.  Personal favorites were the 3 grain salad (love grana padano) and the poached egg truffle pasta (the name alone should do it justice).  Our dessert:  the tall, dark and handsome chocolate cake.  this SHOULD NOT be shared between 5 people.  I think flourless chocolate cakes should probably be on every single menu everywhere; this one was particularly wonderful.  Service - impeccable.  they got us in right away for our reservation, our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient.  she overheard me mentioned to someone at our table that we were trying to make a show and she definitely took that into consideration and got us out in time.  There are a few confusing things about the actual concept - they seem to have a coffee shop/ pastry place during the day and simultaneous dinner restaurant - any time a restaurant is going in too many directions it makes me nervous, but we loved our meal."
"So I recommend this place HIGHLY FOR LUNCH/BRUNCH.  Dinner is still good, but they shine during the earlier hours of the day.  The POT ROAST SANDWICH is delicious.  Salads are good too, for those who are into that.  Desserts and coffees and juices are tasty too.  Service isn't always great, but you can't have everything!  Decor/vibe are really great, too.  Wish I still lived up the street, but now we'll just have to make a special trip :)"
"I was staying at the Aloft and needed a quick meal. Ordered the burger, which was a big mistake. It was way overlooked (ordered medium), the toast was burnt and it came with fries, that were only okay as well. The place is really cute, but not so sure about the food. Perhaps I ordered wrong!"
"A friendly place with refreshing menu. We went to Beatrix for dinner. Service was good, and the food light and refreshing. We had the Quinoa cakes, Spring pea soup, Truffled pasta, Chicken bebe, and Turkey Neatloaf. Will try their brunch next time."
"I like Beatrix.  I've tried them for brekkie, lunch, and dinner.  Plus they're part of the lettuce entertain you group and I'm a lettuce whore.  Usually means good service, good food, and free points!Atmosphere is pretty laid back.  Reminds me of a healthy-ish hipster place in San Francisco.  They have large open windows which are nice when the weather is warm.For Brunch, I tried the fluffy lemon pancakes.  While the flavor was good, they seemed underdone.  They told me that they're supposed to be a souflee texture.  And I get souffles are fluffy, but these were thin so I wouldn't call them fluffy, more wet.  When they explained, I said I would keep them and try another bite but they got me peach waffles instead and comped it (totally not necessary but was a very nice gesture).  Waffles were good but not amazing.  I liked the peaches on top.  Friend had the shortrib sandwich on foccacia which looked good and I think the hubby had an omlet which looked good.  Another friend had the quinoa benedict thing and she cleaned her plate.My favorite meal I had was the chicken thigh for lunch.  Very very tasty.  I've also had their salad.  Salad was fine, nothing to write home about. Tskune appetizer are also amazing.  They should probably give a description of what it is but they are tasty Asian chicken meatballs-definitely a must have.  I had a salmon special one night and it was pretty good, nicely cooked.  Another fave is the Kulfi dessert.  It's like a very frozen vanilla ice cream with candied orange around it.  Very flavorful and refreshing and doesn't feel like your arteries are going to clog from it. I like their fresh juices, you can also add a shot of whatever booze you want and make a nice summer cocktail.  I like the blueberry basil smash with gin.  My hubby got a mimosa with the blueberry for brunch one day, we decided it's best to stick with the traditional orange.My biggest critique honestly is that their menu is a bit small and seemed on the wintery side for summer.  If they added a few lighter dishes, I would like it even more."
"Went to Beatrix for brunch last weekend. The quinoa cakes were amazing--similar to an eggs Benedict with the most amazing poached egg mayo sauce (even better than hollandaise!) and perfectly poached eggs.The green juice was delicious. You could taste each of the ingredients, but they were perfectly balanced so no one thing overpowered anything else. Refreshing and nutritious!I snuck a couple of fries from my Aunt's burger. They were so good, I can't wait to go back and order some for lunch!"
"LEY has the river north restaurant formula down. I came for dinner with a girlfriend a month ago. We both had drinks, split fries, and each ordered an entree (turkey neatloaf, baked crispy chicken). Service was great, food was solid. I loved walking over to the coffee/dessert counter after our meal to choose a dessert to take home. Overall a really nice experience."
"Great service.  Skirt steak was seasoned perfectly. The french fries were just okay.  After reading the rave reviews about the Oh My Caramel Pie, we decided to indulge.  Skip the pie!"
"This is a review for dinner.I had great expectations based on the open-air and comfortable look of the place, but ended up being let down. While nothing was particularly bad, the juice just wasn't worth the squeeze (cough, cough, money). I enjoyed the clear dressing Caesar salad but wasn't impressed with the meatloaf and virtually everything else, wine included, was just so-so.Loved the atmosphere, but it's not enough to bring me back. Sorry Beatrix."
"Eggs were cold, toast was soggy, coffee was weak, they don't know what shakshuka really is. Pass on this one! Waitress was sweet, but that's not enough of a reason to eat here."
"chic-casual...is that a legit descriptor?  went with a large group for restaurant week.  our server handled our table wonderfully.  we found it a bit strange that the chocolate cake was no longer available after several at the table ordered it for dessert; it wasn't that late into the dining hours AND it was only day 1 of restaurant week!loved the straight a salad, liked the gluten-free/vegan mac and cheese and my teeth hurt after one bite of the caramel pie--wow was it sweet!  the crust was the best part (although also sweet) so after i picked at that, i put down my fork before i made myself sick.i'm a bit annoyed that the mac and cheese was both the GF and vegetarian/vegan option.  why lump the 2 together?  plus, it's not an item found on the regular menu so i felt like i wasn't getting a ""true taste"" of the restaurant's repertoire.  that said, the regular menu didn't seem to have much in the vegi category but i'd return for that salad and some vino (i enjoyed the grenache and red blends...wished i had taken note of the names)."
love the layout and the table and chairs at lunch were perfect.  It just opened and they are already hitting on all cylinders for the most part which is a feat in itself.  Really liked the pot roast sandwich and will try a few others over the next few weeks
"Their motto says taste over trend, but I'd say the trend factor was a 4 and the taste was a 2.5. Nothing stood out as exceptional and i was with a group of 8. Nothing was bad either. Cool atmosphere and above average drinks are the reason for a visit."
"Came here last night for VDay dinner.  The place was fairly swanky and packed.  Attached to a hotel so they get hella business from the tourists.  Valet parking was as easy as can be but took a while to get the car. Food:  3 starsThe portions of everything was hella small but filling and delicious.  We ordered; - kennebec fries, soft poached egg mayo (standard fries taste, but the green sauce was delicious)  = 3/5- tsukune, chili-cilantro sauce (Japanese chicken meatballs, Very tender and flavorful) = 5/5- Skirt Steak Chimichurri w/a side of kale (tender and flavorful, deliciously cooked, oily kale) = 5/5- blackberry & lychee lemonade (sweet and lemonade-y) = 5/5- Vanilla bean kulfi (sweet enough for most people. My date enjoyed it) = 3/5- Tall, dark, & handsome chocolate cake (huge! sweet, chocolaty, pretty good, not memorable) = 3/5Interior: - 1 starThe interior appeared very open because of the high ceiling, concrete floors and columns, and dark interior.  They had a variety of chairs.  Seemed as if they used whatever they can find at an outlet shop.  We sat near a window next to the bar.  Our chairs were absolutely not the proper type of chairs for dinner and conversation across a table.  They were hella low, laid back lounge chairs.  So the whole time, I had to hold myself upright to be able to converse. They had bigger/lounge seating areas for bigger groups as well. Customer Service: +2 starAll the staff members we encountered, hostess, server, bussers, manager we very polite.  Our server was very attentive, friendly, and detail oriented. Demographic: It varied.  Ranged from upper 20's/low 30s to....60s. Everyone had a casual, classy, attire.  Not as dressed up as I expected everyone to be on Vday.  It's a decent date place.  Overall:I would go again but request different dinner appropriate seating.  Service was great and food was so damn good."
We had a nice meal last night. Food and service was very good. We work in the area so we'll be back.
"I heard about Beatrix through a speaker I had in class.  It was the VP and Managing Partner, what better way to get all the dirt?!  I went that night, after hearing his favorite dishes and found they were better than described by the man who chose the menu, himself.  I had the farmhouse poached eggs and truffled pasta and my boyfriend had the shank of pork, oh my gosh, it fell right off the bone.  We had the chia pudding, my goodness im drooling as i type.  Such an interesting array of dishes!  I'm one to try new things, and Beatrix exceeded my expectations!"
I have had multiple breakfasts and lunches here and they have all been absolutely superb. Their baked goods are out of this world. The food has a wonderfully refreshing spin on classic takes. The salads are super yummy too!
We had the 3A Salad and the Poached Egg & Truffled Pasta!  Best meal I had while in Chicago!  Both were delicious!!
"I have eaten and done cocktails at Beatrix on three separate occasions. It is a very cool space and popular with locals and visitors alike. It abuts the Aloft Hotel by W and gets a fair amount of hotel traffic as you would expect. It is part open air seating inside with a few tables on the sidewalk.  The bar area is pretty narrow and seats probably 9 or 10 people.  I had dinner at the bar on my most recent trip and it is great to chat with the knowledgeable and fun bar crew.  I had a dirty martini and the cool thing is they default to olives stuffed w blue cheese. Good in my book.  I had the pot roast which was amazing. Whipped cauliflower, grilled kale and pearl onions accompanied the tender pork in a fantastic marinade/sauce. This dish was a home run. My lunches here have also been quite good. The only critique is the wine list. It is all domestic. Not one French or Italian wine which is disappointing as the list is laden w Cali wines - just not up to snuff.  A half dozen craft beers on the menu do the job but they could use a chimay or another comparable import to round out the list.  I had the Founders IPA and it was good.  Stop by - you'll be glad you did."
"Lettuce, you've done it again. We popped into Beatrix around 12:30 on a Saturday for brunch. I would recommend making a reservation, as the place was packed. We went as a group of four and started out with cocktails, because Bloody's & Mimosas are a must at brunch. The Bloody's were alright, but nothing special. The Mimosa's on the other hand, were incredible. They offer three types: Orange, Red, & Blue. The orange was a standard mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice. I believe the red was a fresh squeezed strawberry/raspberry combination, & the blue was blueberry. All were delicious. The blue may have been my favorite but since it's a bit on the sweeter side, I couldn't imagine sipping on more than one. The food was good too. I ordered the steak chimichurri & eggs and it was good, but just that. 3 stars for my dish. But everyone else's was delish! I was in the mood for breakfast food when we ordered, but after seeing the Prime Burger that our friend ordered, I wished I could exchange mine. My boyfriend ordered the eggs your way and everything was cooked to perfection. We enjoyed Beatrix thoroughly and will definitely be back for another brunch."
"Came here for lunch and had the tomato soup and gluten free mac n cheese from the restaurant week menu.  Started feeling ill almost immediately after lunch and by dinnertime, was vomiting everything from lunch.  Pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place.  It's the next morning and I am still not eating..."
By far the best brunch place I have been too and I'm sort of brunch junkie from NYC! Hands down the best french toast ever!! The service was very nice and they even gave us free coffee because there was some confusion with our order. Definitely will be going back there!
"Beatrix has perfected brunch! We made a reservation for 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  They were very busy, but we were promptly seated upon arrival (which rarely happens at brunch anywhere).  Our server Anthony was FANTASTIC! Very knowledgeable, made great suggestions, and really seemed to care about making sure we had a great experience. Amazing ambiance, fantastic staff, coupled with delicious menu items makes for a great brunch experience! Try it!"
"I stopped in for a quick lunch, and was pleased by the menu--health conscious, fresh food that's interesting, but not unappealing, and fresh juices! The service was great, and I'd definitely return to try their dinner menu."
"We had a lovely dinner at Beatrix, but what really made the place shine was the service.  We brought our toddler with us for an early dinner, and as anyone with children knows, dining out with a little one can be difficult.  Our waitress was charming and sweet, and the hostesses were very gracious and helpful as well, which really helped us have a nice time.The children's menu is great too--I tried some of my son's chicken fingers and fries, and they were great!  All the kids' meals come with apple and jicama, which is a nice touch.  My husband and I had the deviled eggs, and the kale salad to start--they were both quite fresh and simple and nice.  My chicken dish was good if not amazing, but the caramel pie we had for dessert was to die for!  The sangria was pretty good too--but a lot stronger than I expected!  Beatrix is a great place for a casual dinner."
"I was really looking forward to dinner at Beatrix, however, my excitement turned to disappointment.  I ordered the steak chimichurri and was disappointed to find that everything was BLAND.  I tried adding salt to my entree, but,even the salt was BLAND.....no matter how much I kept shaking, the taste of my meal never changed.  And it seemed to be a consensous amongst my friends who also dined with me.  I've never seen so many people keep asking to ""pass the salt"".  So, my advice, if you are looking for food that gives you a party in your mouth....DO NOT dine here.  It's such a shame."
"This place was pretty good. A lettuce usually never fails. I liked the atmosphere inside. We went for dinner on a nice night, so all of the windows were open. Service was great. Cucumber mint soda was very good and fresh. Same with the hummus. All food tasted healthy and very fresh. My mom liked her pot roast. My brother said his chicken was just ok. My salmon was pretty good. Caramel pie was too sweet. Overall, a good experience and solid place."
"Honey Cinnamon Soy Latte is delicious! I have one every time . I swear by the lemon pancakes and brown sugar bacon; however, the last time I went I opted for the baked egg sandwich and I am officially a convert. Can't wait to go back. Thanks Beatrix!"
"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The three grain salad on the brunch menu was top notch. I would recommend slightly less dressing, but otherwise it was terrific. Also, the bloody mary's are unique and so tasty.  Sour and tart, but wonderful. I really enjoyed Beatrix, definitely check it out."
"Top notch for dinner. Another Lettuce Entertain You winner. Excellent food, service and value. Novel dishes, definitely worth checking out. Can't wait to go back."
"Went there a couple times on a business trip.  Everything I tried was very good, with the ""triple A salad"" and burger both being the best I've ever had in those categories.  Between those two items, the excellent dessert and superb service, I'm looking forward to returning on my next trip to Chicago."
"We wanted to have a champagne lunch on the day we were wedding dress shopping.  This was a lovely place to have a celebratory lunch.  The food was delicious and the menu was great.  Their champagne selection was reasonably priced,  We all ordered different salads and they were delicious.  We highly recommend the oh my caramel pie for desert.  It is well worth every calorie. Our server, Michael, was very nice and conversational. He gave us many recommendations and suggestions about the menu and added to our splendid time."
"Just had dinner at Beatrix. Just in town for a couple day and went here because of the positive reviews on Yelp. I totally agree! Excellent everything food, service, decor. I had the braised pot roast a simple dish done exceptionally. I know there is a lot of good food in Chi town but this definitely ranks high. Thanks for great meal"
"They made great last minute accommodations for me and my friends. The specialty drinks were very tasty. I even like that they have raw juice, perfect for a hangover. The menu was not only refreshing, but also unique. They have a bar if after you are done eating you would like a few more drinks you could sit down and enjoy the rest of your sunday, or you could sit by the fire and have a nice cup of coffee."
"I was here for dinner a few weeks ago and had a wonderful experience.  Our server was gracious, the atmosphere was lovely and the comfort food totally hit the spot, especially during this bleak winter!  I highly recommend you try it out!"
"I had the pleasure of dining at Beatrix for dinner right when it opened.  As soon as I walked in, the atmosphere was comfortable, trendy and the hostess greeted my party with a smile.  We had a reservation and were seated quickly.  We started with drinks and I had the watermelon and strawberry cooler, which was amazing!  The waiter suggested the blueberry Tom Collins and I'm so glad he did....it was delicious!Next was appetizers (snacks) and we ordered the kennebec fries with poached egg mayo, the potato salad deviled eggs and the hummus with veggies.  All were excellent!  I was the one that chose the kennebec fries and they were perfect - the poached egg mayo was such a different, but great, idea and it was delicious.  My parents and sister-in-law scarfed down their snacks, too and raved about them.  For dinner, I chose the truffled pasta.  I'm a pasta-lover and I adore truffle, so this was perfect for me!  It was a nice-sized portion and after I didn't feel stuffed - it was the perfect amount.  I love how the entrees are different and unique - you can only find them at Beatrix.  My sister-in-law ordered the skirt steak and I tried it - WOW!  I will definitely be ordering that next time (well, it's between that and the burger, which also looked amazing)!Dessert - my favorite part of any meal!  Beatrix had such an interesting menu of desserts and I was thrilled to try a twist on some favorites - cute banana split and tall, dark and handsome chocolate cake.  OH MY GOSH!!!  I died and went to heaven with both of these desserts.  The cute banana split had maple syrup, ice cream, and banana.  The banana and maple syrup were warm while the ice cream was cold and it was so tasty.  The chocolate cake was out of this world - so rich and delicious!  I would happily order either one again, anytime I'm at Beatrix.The food was delicious and I was equally impressed with the staff.  Our waiter was attentive, offered great suggestions, and was able to answer any questions we had about the menu.  A manager came by, as well, to check in and see how our meal was, which greatly impressed my family.  I loved the ambience - sort of like a comfortable loft with a great design aesthetic.  The wait staff had cohesive uniforms that weren't stuffy or boring, but instead trendy (with bright shoes) and still professional.  The restaurant was PACKED that night, so I'm glad we made a reservation!I can't wait to go back to Beatrix for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Looking at all the pastries made me drool and I'm pretty sure if I lived downtown, Beatrix would be my ""go to"" place for a morning drink and pastry before work.  I also picked up the peanut butter dog bones for my dog.  He LOVED them and I can't wait to get more for him during my next Beatrix visit.  Great job, Lettuce Entertain You!  You've created yet another amazing restaurant that I can now add to my list of favorite places to eat!"
We went there a while ago. I had the enlightened caesar salad and my boyfriend had the prime burger. I am not a greek yogurt fan but absolutely loved the salad and the greek yogurt dressing was delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger. The staff was very wonderful and our server was fantastic. I highly recommend sitting at one of Nicole's table. She was very responsive to us and knows the whole menu. Definitely will be coming back and sitting at her table.
"I have stayed at  Aloft hotel in the burbs, but this was the first time I visited the one located in the City Centre...my date recommended it. A typical Aloft Hotel offers a small self-serve commissary/snack bar and a modest, but swanky XYZ cocktail bar, but the Aloft in the City Centre was amazing!. I was very surprised by the plentiful seating accommodations of Beatrix.  Although the dining area was crowded, it was Saturday evening, we only waited for approximately 5 minutes.  We ordered bottle of the Cabernet Sauvignon...my date insisted on the one from California and not Washington state.  The wine was pretty good, not as smooth as others I have tasted, but very low in tannins, which was good.  For our appetizer, we ordered Potato Salad Deviled Eggs, which were to die for!  For our meal, we ordered the Straight-A Salad and Millers Farm's Chicken, which was juicy and delicious!    Needless to say, we had a great time and I will certainly visit again."
"This place needs work. We were scoping this place out for a group event, and it graciously removed itself from the running. I told the server that we were considering having a medium sized group come in, and she made fun of me for a couple of minutes and wouldn't tell me if they had a room to accommodate parties. Then water dripped all over the table from the ceiling. Server again made jokes but didn't do anything to fix the problem. I had to ask specifically to move to another, drier table. Food came, salad was as described, but pasta came out like a soup. The kitchen clearly didn't drain the noodles, of which there was barely any. Maybe their way of making the portion look bigger? Below average food, flat out bad service, what else can I say? Much better places in the area."
"I've been to Beatrix three times now and the food is consistently phenomenal: interesting flavors, perfectly cooked, and generally light on the stomach (which can be hard to come by at some of the more trendy Chicago restaurants). The wait staff is incredibly attentive and accommodating. Also, its nice that they have enough tables and space that you don't have to wait a million years for a table and aren't sitting on a stranger's lap. Overall, this is one of my favorite Chicago restaurants."
The 3-grain arugula salad (or whatever they call it) was absolutely delicious!
"Came here for restaurant week. Cocktails were good. Bloody Mary had a good amt of kick.  Pineapple habanero margarita was sweet and not spicy at all.  First course, straight A salad was yummy!  They did not skimp out on portion (entree size).  Second course, neatloaf was light and tasty. Third course, tall dark and handsome choc cake was good and rich (perfect for sharing since I only had a few bites). Overall, good food and was a reasonable price $33 -3 course dinner (not including drinks)."
"Great food in a casual kick back and relax kind of atmosphere.  Hostess and server were AWESOME!  I eat out a lot and can say I rarely trust a server to give advice during the entire meal, but I trusted our server to help us narrow down our options on the refreshing drinks. appetizers, entres, and desserts and she NEVER let us down.  Not sure if she was so great because of her skill or because everything on the menu was FABULOUS!  Look forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu.  Btw, my faves were the mint and cucumber drink, escarole and pear salad, pot roast and the to die for chocolate cake."
"Awesome brunch food, great mimosas, and stellar customer service.  We ordered the ""family style"" or something to that effect - where you get a plate and help yourself to a certain dish served buffet style.  They were making a new batch and it took about 20/25 minutes for that dish to be available, and we were so surprised when they took both our entrees off the bill due to that delay, after already apologizing several times.  Both dishes were super tasty - a mexican style chicken & egg deal and lemon pancakes.  Everything else on the menu sounded great, too.  We sat outside on a beautiful day, but the inside looked fun, too - lively but not too loud or crazy.  As a sidenote the pastry bar looked to die for.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fantastic brunch.  Should also note we live in San Francisco, so we know good food!"
