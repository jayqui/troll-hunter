Luella’s Southern Kitchen
"My husband & I were out biking last night and saw that this place had good reviews. We pulled up to check out the menu and were welcomed by the Aunt of the Chef/Owner, who happened to be sitting outside on the sidewalk enjoying the cool summer night. We were definitely not disappointed!We started with Fried Green Tomatoes, which were pretty near perfect with a light cornmeal crust and light remoulade sauce. I ordered the Gumbo, which was as good as any I've had. My husband ordered the Brisket Mac & Cheese which was AMAZING. I'm pretty sure I stole a third of it from his plate while he may/may not have been looking.It's BYOB, but since we didn't BYO, we ended up having some of the interesting southern pops they serve. I had a Cheerwine (yum) and my husband had a Blenheim HOT Ginger Ale (which is an experience for sure).Luella's is very casual -- you order up front and they bring the food to your table. We will definitely go back."
"Visited this place on Saturday evening.  We were pleased to see it wasn't crowded on a Saturday evening!  We went in, ordered and sat right down.  The Chicken and Waffles I ordered was PERFECT in every way possible.  The syrup was really good!  The iced tea served in mason jars is really what seals the deal.  We had the strawberry shortcake for desert, and it was AMAZING.This place is small, but the service and food are fantastic.  I'll be back to try other things on the menu."
"Had the chicken and waffles, catfish tacos, soft shell crab po boy sandwich, fried green tomatoes, and beignets. We'd definitely return to try more.I liked that the chicken was boneless and made of dark meat and the waffles had a nice hint of bourbon. The tacos and seasonal crab sandwich were fresh, flavorful and cooked just right. The fried green tomatoes was mediocre, so I'd recommend passing on it.We got good service from the lady at the counter and notable great service by the Filipino woman that took serviced our table. Everyone was very accommodating, especially to my two younger children.I had asked who Luella was and the Chicago native/owner took the time to come out and personally explain Luella was his great grandmother from Mississippi and her relocation to Chicago."
"My mom and I met here around 11:45 on a Tuesday. There was only one other person there when we arrived, but by the time we left 45 minutes later, most of the tables were full. You order at the counter then take your drink and number to your table and they bring your food to you. The service was excellent - the guy behind the counter was able to give us a few recommendations and there was a girl walking around cleaning up, taking empty plates and making sure everybody was OK. My mom got the brisket mac and cheese - it was really tasty. It also wasn't an overwhelming amount of food that we had any to take home either, so that was nice! I went with the catfish tacos. The pieces of catfish were pretty big, the sauce and slaw on it was really good. Overall, we both left happy and full and would definitely recommend the place!"
"Took advantage of this amazing weather by taking a stroll around Lincoln Square. This cute little neighborhood needs more recognition than it is currently getting, so what better way to attract more attention than a couple of new restaurants joining this German influenced area. Luella's is one of several new places that will bring great things to Lincoln Square.Nothing like some good ol Southern cooking to end the long week. While on my stroll, I noticed this cute little place was swarming with people, so I had to check it out for myself. The concept of this place is simple, just 3 easy steps. 1. Order in the front and get a number.2. Want water? Get it yourself. Water station to the right of the order station.3. Grab a table and wait for yummy food to come. Service: Work on the flow of the kitchenWhen my friend and I approached the front, we figured, Southern cooking = southern hospitality. Boy were we wrong, we got Southern bluntness. The server taking the orders simply told us orders were temporary suspended as the kitchen was currently backed up, in the meantime, take the menus, grab a seat, and they would let us know when they were back in business. This was the first time I have ever heard of such a thing, but being that they are a fairly new place, they haven't gotten used to the dinner rush yet. Food: Mediocre Luckily we weren't super hungry, but after about 15 mins, the server came to our table and led us back to the front to order. We got a little bit of everything: kale salad, bbq brisket mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, oyster po boys, and beignets. My favorite was the kale salad, which is kind of sad because I don't think kale salad is very Southern or even a part of comfort food. - Kale salad - all time fav! The citrus was so refreshing. Those candied pecans and coconut chips gave it a nice crunch. If I am not mistaken, I think they used Dang chips, which if you haven't tried it yet, definitely do yourself a favor and get some! - BBQ brisket mac n cheese - second favorite. Brisket could use more smokiness but the mac and cheese was delightful.- Oyster po boy - The taste is easily forgettable, and nothing special. The fries were pretty awesome.- Fried green tomatoes - Definitely not worth getting. Tasteless.- Beignets - Probably the most disappointing part of the whole meal. Definitely not how I remembered it when I went to Cafe du Monde. Incomparable. It wasn't very soft, just some ol fried dough."
"Chicken and waffles are on point. I bit into it and I literally thought (damn okay! That's really good) like ""I don't live all the way north but would make a special trip just for the chicken and waffles"" good.I ordered the shrimp and grits which was my first rime having them and I loved them. I also had a side of biscuits which were delicious and came with a very flagrant maple syrup I think.Nice little spot will come back soon."
"First things first....they don't serve the brisket mac and cheese during brunch. I was verrrrry sad about that. That said, what a nice lil gem this place is! We had the chicken and waffles, which was delightful. The chicken was perfectly golden, tender and juicy and the waffles were, I'm pretty sure, homemade. We also had the brussel sprouts which were out of this world! Perfect amount of spice and just simply delightful. The blackberry hand pie with ice cream??? Just get it. That's all I have to say.Service was fantastic as well...from the sweet lady at the counter, to the awesome servers who brought us food and cleared our dishes. Im pretty sure the one guy reeaaallllyyyy liked my husband haha. We will most certainly be back to try that mac and cheese!"
"****ITS A BYOB------------ITS A BYOB****My sister actually told me about this place and I was hesitant to go because its so far from me, but the food here is amazing. I had the chicken and waffles and beginets and my bff had the shrimp and grits, we both had the tea. The food was great. The chicken was so moist and that waffle was crunchy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside. Those beginets were wonderful and they were dusted with the the right amount of powdered sugar. You order at the counter, the waiter brings your food, eat, enjoy, repeat. This place may be 3 million miles from me (not really, maybe a 50 minute drive), but I am willing to take the drive."
"Southern cooking this far north and done right? Yes, this is the place. BYOB,  good service and value for your money? Absolutely. I immediately got a family owned, really warm and inviting vibe when we walked in. I was amazed at what they did with the interior. The Mediterranean Grill before was an eye sore compared to this.  Now it has hardwood floors and natural wood paneling on the walls adorned with art from which I think was Ernie Barnes which immediately reminded me of the cover art for the hip hop album Camp Lo - Uptown Saturday Night. Nice touch to whomever the interior decorator is. The music playing was a mix of old r&b and soul. I always dig a place that places careful attention to detail and in this context it's fitting. The service is pretty simple and straightforward. Go up to the counter, order, get a number, get silverware and water.. then sit down. They'll run the food out to you. We ordered the Sorghum flour biscuits, Fried Green tomatoes, Chicken and waffles and Pimento cheeseburger with fries. The biscuits were light,fluffy, delicious and bursting with flavor; served with a small side of honey. The Fried green tomatoes were greasy in the right way, yet the fruit inside was firm and fresh tasting. The Chicken and waffles were subdivided into slivers of four which is perfect for those who want to do tapas style dining, especially if you're a first timer. They were sweet, salty and tasty as hell. The burger was spot on, served with a mountain of spiced fries and what I suspect is house made ketchup. It's on par with burgers you'll find at Au Cheval or Little Bad Wolf. As good as it was, it was my least favorite compared to the others. The southern items are where it's at.Overall, this is fine southern cooking with the right amount of portions. Speaking of which, for those who say the portions are not big enough.. It's possible that you're not small enough for the portions. The food is fried and dense. If an app and a main entree doesn't fill you up then go to Popye's or KFC if you want to complain about ""value"". This is not fast food. This is obviously steps above it. I'll be back for brunch. I'm very pleased that a place like this is in the neighborhood and I hope they do well. Judging by the buzz and crowd that was there Tuesday night, I think they will."
"Where do I even begin with Luella's? Simply, it is an amazing restaurant with some of the best food I've ever had. My friend and I went on a Wednesday evening and it had a steady flow of customers. I loved the open seating and the fact that you had to walk up to the counter to order. The staff was great, so friendly and welcoming. We started with the fried green tomatoes which were perfect. The food was quick, hot and fresh. Next we split the mac & cheese and chicken & waffles. WOW these items did not disappoint. I think the waffle was one of the best waffles I have ever had and the chicken paired PERFECTLY with it. The mac & cheese was everything I hoped for and more. I don't know why we thought there would be any room left in our stomaches, but we ordered the beignets. Best decision ever. Fluffy, fried and covered in powdered sugar. As we were eating, live music started to play and I was sad to leave. Overall, I will head back to Luella's to try the rest of their menu!"
"I love southern food. But often I walk away from it feeling overwhelmed and weighted down. So when my wife wanted to try Luella's, I was reluctant for this reason. What a Delightful suprise! Everything was great southern taste but light and refreshing.The Shrimp and Grits were creamy with a light roux or gravy that set this dish apart from all others I have had before. The Fried Chicken and Waffles were crispy, warm, lightly, sweet and simply the best tasting waffles I have ever had. Very well flavored. Kale Ambrosia was filled with plenty of candied pecans, fresh fruit, toasted coconut and a wonderful vinaigrette that tied it all together.Our only disappointment was with the Beignets. They were not the light airy pasteries I have elsewhere, but flat, heavy and too bready. With everything else hitting out of the park, I don't understand how they got this so wrong. Go back and try again and get it right. Everyone was very attentive and helpful and friendly. We mentioned the flat Beignets and the cook sent us another serving properly raised. Better, but I still would change the dough and add some dipping sauce."
"You make the call--in my mind, the place is not A-OK1. Very nice new clean place2.  Huge effort going on3.  Everything is home made (i.e. ketchup)4. Price points are modest for Lincoln Squre5. Self serve (which i like)6, Had a BLT--total mess      brioche/challah  bread was too buttery/greasy      tiny tiny amount of bacon      the best ever fried green tomato      a drop of tasteless arugula served out of season      a ton of fries with some horrible seasoning on it7.  Chicken with waffles looked good @$128.  All other portions seemed tiny9.  Took forever to get the food10, Terrible stomach ache from all the buttery excess in the food"
Never have I been to a restaurant and been given so much attention. I drive by here quite often I used to live in this neighborhood. Every restaurant in this space has moved. I hope that doesn't happen here. I had been to New Orleans before Katrina and know it's changed a lot. This place reminds me of the food I had there many years ago. The Gumbo is not very chunky like someone else has said here but it very flavorful. I ordered more than I can eat (yay leftovers).   First thing I had was the fresh brewed tea and they bring water to your table. Delicious with or without sweetener. I was there early and it started filling up fast. The Chicken and waffles was delicious! I also had the biscuits and ordered another to go. My friends had the Brussels sprouts which were excellent and the Brisket Mac and cheese flew off their plate so I had  to order that to go too. The beignets were soo yummy I had a hard time sharing but I did. Overall i will be back to try everything on their menu I can't wait to return.
"With much anticipation my hubby and I tried Luella's today for the first time, but it was a mixed experience. Much like other reviews, we were also a bit confused about the set up when we first entered; some signage or greeting would surely help with this. We caught on pretty quick though, ordered, grabbed our silverware & water, and found a seat by the door.The wait was pretty long for what we ordered (approx. 20 mins) but once I tried the boneless fried chicken & mac n' cheese it was worth it. On the other hand, my husband's burger was overcooked/not that flavorful, and the fries did not taste fresh. The food inconsistencies could just be a product of an off day, but I think the main thing is that we didn't feel very welcome or at home. The menu and concept could make this place extremely special, but the service and the way they do things don't necessarily reflect that. Plus, as my husband pointed out ""it was not an $11 burger"". I hope they do take some of this feedback and make some improvements. I would definitely give them another chance!"
"Oyster Po' boy!Having lived in New Orleans for 3 years, I gained a strong appreciation for southern cuisine. The Oyster Po' Boy is one of my faves!  I have yet to have one I enjoyed since moving to Chicago until Luella's.  Awesome batter, great bread, tasty remoulade, and outstanding fries. I really enjoyed this meal! Keep up the great work!"
"My daughter and I went to Luella's for Mother's Day Brunch the day after the restaurant had been featured by Steve Dolinsky on ABC7. So it was a bit crowded. We waited in line for about 30 minutes before being seated. I will admit that I didn't fully understand the concept of getting seated at a table, then getting up to  wait in line at the counter, and then go back to your table for a waitperson to bring out your food.I had the Bourbon Chicken & Waffles which was prepared and plated in a unique way. It was very tasty (must be the bourbon!)  My daughter had Shrimp & cream cheese Grits which were out of this world!  We finished our meal with an order of beignets which were piping hot and (according to my daughter) as good as the beignets at Café DuMonde in New Orleans. Its BYOB which has been mentioned in some of the other reviews. We forgot to bring a bottle, but had time to dash up Lincoln Ave to grab one. Worth noting that non-alcoholic drink options are somewhat limited at Luella's (Tea, water, coffee and ???)Luella's is named for Chef Darnell Reed's grandmother and her cooking inspired  some of his dishes   Heartwarming and inspiring story. I gave Luella's 5 stars because the food was magnificent, prices were reasonable, ambiance was modern and welcoming,  staff was friendly and overall it was an very enjoyable experience."
"This is more 3.5 stars. Finally got to try this place for carryout. I had the pimento burger and I got to try some of the brisket mac and cheese.The egg on the burger was perfect...but that was kind of it? Burgers were too very thin patties that were well done (kind of had to be at that thin). And I couldn't really taste the pimento cheese, which made me sad. But I still ate the whole thing. Fries were tasty.The mac and cheese sauce was perfect and tasty and all the good things. The only thing I wish was different was the brisket was shredded more. It comes in big hunks, which makes it a bit harder to eat. But I'm all for getting this to-go and just shredding it myself."
"I was really excited to try this place out, but have to say that it fell short of my expectations. I don't mind having to order at the counter before sitting down, but as my friend and I were ordering, a HUGE party came in and literally look every available table. Sooooo then we were stuck waiting for both our food and a table, hoping a table opened up first... Luckily a couple left. My friends food came out first and looked amazing. A large portion of fries with her fried green tomato BLT. Then my catfish tacos arrived. The corn tortillas were about half the size of a normal corn tortilla. I seriously could not believe how TINY they were. The catfish looked like a tiny fish stick with some sauce and a few pieces of cabbage on them. Maybe if they had been delicious I could have over looked the fact that I was still going to be hungry after dinner, but they were extremely underwhelming. It was pretty bland and left a lot to be desired. My friend thought her sandwich was ok, but certainly didn't rave about it. It wasn't a bad experience in all, but I wouldn't have any reason to return."
"This place is incredibly accommodating and super friendly.  We were greeted right away by who I assume is a manager at the register.  She was very helpful and was joking around with us.  It's clear they are very intent on making the diner's experience as enjoyable and comfortable as possible.My friend and I ordered a few different things.  The oyster po' boy, shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles.  After we ordered, I had a little emergency to attend to so my friend asked that we got everything wrapped up to go.  They were more than happy to accommodate us.  Just in case anyone who was working last night reads this, I'm sorry I left!  It had nothing to do with your establishment or anything.  I want to come back to Luella's again and again and I just couldn't do that without making sure you knew how wonderful I think this restaurant is.Everything was amazing.  The remoulade on the po' boy  was so flavorful and the batter was great.  I loved how big the shrimp in the shrimp and grits was.  And how many there were!  I definitely finished that off no problem.  And holy crap.  The chicken and waffles were amazing.  The waffles seemed to already be infused with maple syrup and the chicken was crispy and juicy.  I had leftovers for breakfast this morning!I can't wait to come back to this place and try everything else on the menu.  Thank you so much!"
"Folks don't seem to understand how this place works. You order at the counter, take a number and then find a seat and they bring it out to you. Lots of places do this - think about Smoque. BUT I think the food and presentation is so good here that people get confused and expect it to be a traditional sit-down spot. Maybe also because the counter is towards the back. I think maybe if the owners put a divider / rope near the counter, that might cue people to form a line and that you need to order at the counter.BBQ Brisket Mac and Cheese is incredible. Chicken gumbo is also excellent with a nice presentation. But really, everything I've tried is so damn tasty, and I have plenty more I want to try. Really glad this place opened up in Lincoln Square!"
"The hubby and I went for brunch with couple of our friends on a Saturday and had an excellent experience! We ordered a little bit of everything to share like it was recommended by the staffs and by far here are our favorites.  1- the banana pancakes. It was delicious, soft and just the right amount of maple syrup and banana on top. 2- the hubby had the chicken gumbo, at first I was a bit apprehensive since I'm not much of a fan of anything gumbo but when it came out, it was by far the best chicken gumbo I've had! I love the spices and it had just the right amount of hot pepper. 3- the French toast! Now there's something wrong with anyone who thinks Luella's French toast aren't good. The hubby and I don't order French toast from many place because not many restaurants can make it right. Our usual and favorite go to place for French toast is Mexique but we were really surprise and please with Luella's French toast. It tasted just like the one we were used too! It was so delicious! We finished it so fast like no one's business!4- the fried chicken. The chicken was buttery, soft and was well seasoned! It left us wanting for more! Oh and did I mentioned the sauce for the chicken was a great compliment to it! We grabbed some hot sauce from the counter thinking we will need it for the chicken but nope, we didn't. The sauce was a great compliment!5- the Mac & cheese. When we ordered it, our expectations were low, thinking it was going to be like any other but boy were we surprise. It was moist, well seasoned with chunks of ribs and very cheesy, and to top it off we love the fact that they use the soft shell pasta.6- The milk chocolate bread pudding. This should be put on the regular menu and not just the brunch menu. If you're a dessert lover like me, there's no meal without a dessert. Love the fact that it's soft, not too sweet, just the right amount of ice cream and strawberry cream sauce!I'm giving this place a five start cause it met all my expectations on the food, not only that for the fact it's counter service, they spaced out each dish to arrived at the perfect time so that we were not overwhelmed. The staff were awesome and very friendly. Lastly, not sure what others experience were but the silverware were rolled and the portions were well proportion. We also read a little about the chef and he came from a background of fine dining at the Conrad, so the portions will be a bit smaller because the quality of the food is better then what the average restaurant use. Plus don't forget this place is a counter service and the dishes are made when ordered. Also, the place had a very rich and homie ambiance and to mention we love the design, it was perfect for the southern theme. We definitely will be coming back again!"
"This place is delicious and has great service!  I ordered the Southern Benedict, but when it came out the you'll was hard. I hate complaining but this happens sometimes and so I said something. They took it back to the kitchen and made me new one. The cook, the manager and waitresses came out and apologized. It made all the difference. The Benedict was delicious! Thanks guys"
"I LOVE Gumbo, and saw this place on the news the other night.  I was dying to try it out, and finally did.     I tried the Gumbo.     For the record, the Roux was tasty and good.  They do a good job with that, that is what the 2 stars is for.     However, what I got I would not consider their Gumbo in any way, shape, or form a meal.  What I got was a cup of very watery soup with 2 (small) pieces of andouille sausage and maybe, just maybe a tablespoon full of rice floating in it.  This is a side dish at best and not an actual meal.  So, if you are going there expecting a meal, or even something remotely filling, be prepared to spend your money on an additional entree item to do the trick.     If you like New Orleans flavored ""soup"" then this will be right up your alley, but calling it an actual Gumbo is stretching it pretty far."
1st. This place is very casual but it's nice. We walked in and went straight to the counter to order 1st then we were seated. It wasn't that busy so our food came pretty fast and was hot. This was our 1st time so we ordered a few different things and we all ate a little of everything. Our order:Catfish tacos... greatShrimp and grits... amazingButtermilk fried chicked... ok to goodFried Green Tomatoes ... ok to goodBBQ Brisket mac & Cheese ... amazing (get this!) Desert: Beignets... greatSo... the star of the show was the BBQ Brisket Mac & Cheese. it's made with huge macaroni noodles and a delightful array of cheeses (I'm so grown and fancy) with smokey and delicious brisket cubes. The brisket cubes add a smokey goodness that's sure to make you not want to share and the bread crumb topping makes it that much better. The surprise of the evening were the catfish tacos. I really don't know how to describe them... just try them. BYOB makes the joint even cooler. The service was great. I felt welcomed and we will be back. The menu is Ala carte so the bill can get a little high for what you're getting but it's worth it.This place takes credit cards (of course) but you can only tip in cash.Check them out.
"My girlfriend and I were hungry and quickly becoming fussy.  Walking down Lincoln Ave, we were tired of burgers, pasta, Tai, etc. With their door open like at Grandma's house, we walked in. I always give the Mac and Cheese a try at new restaurants. This place does it right with five cheeses. Plus, the included brisket, no knife needed.  My friend ordered the Catfish Tacos. She's a hard one to please and cleared her plate. We exchanged our canned lemonade for fresh sweet tea which was the perfect treat. When you go be sure to appreciate the artwork.  If you grew up watching the show Good Times (and still now in reruns) you'll recognize the artist. The owners and brother team are friendly and their staff attentive. Finally, something ""out of the ordinary"" in the 60625."
A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Really enjoyed everything I've tried here. I grew up in NC and this little southern gem is true to its origins yet manages to raise the bar with skillful execution. And very reasonably priced and welcoming!
Food was outstanding!!! Best shrimp and grits I have EVER had! And when I asked... Sure we will make you Chicory Coffee!!! Can't wait to go back!
"I will start off by saying that we went on Mother's Day with no reservation so this may have contributed to our experience.When we arrived there was a sign on the door that stated that they were closed until 4:00 p.m.  No big deal as that was only about a 30 minute wait.  So we left and came back.When we walked in we were told to get in line and place our order.  However, as I looked around I saw other people securing seating first but we decided to listen to the hostess.  After we placed our order, we were told there were no seats available. Ugh.The manager came out and took one of the ""reserved"" tables and gave it to us great.  Well then we waited another 30 minutes for the food to arrive.I had the Gumbo but the portion was extremely small but tasty.  My brother had the shrimp and grits.  Which by the way they ran out of, hence the reason I HAD to order gumbo.It was an okay experience.  I might try it again."
"Amazing addition to Lincoln Square - quick, casual, yet very, very good southern-inspired comfort food. The pimento cheeseburger is a winner and I don't know what they do to the fries (old bay seasoning?) but they're impossible to not finish. Very friendly service, and I love the set-up!Highly, highly recommend!"
Simple yet stylish atmosphere - a lot of care into their food prep.... a big hit for Ravenswood
Wow...my friend and I went here as something different. This place is not tied with Thai Spice as my favorite place in Chicago!! The food is amazing!  The gumbo was so tasty!  The kale salad had so much flavor going on fantastic. Chicken and waffles yasssssssssss the burboun syrup just makes the dish. And the Mac and cheese with bbq beef brisket claims my ranking as best Mac and cheese in Chicago!! And then to top it off the Strawberry Shortcake with homemade vanilla ice cream was the perfect finish!!
"Out of work early on a Tuesday, this was the perfect place for a lunch stop. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Such a nice change from some of the other ""snooty attitude"" places around here. Check your attitude at the door, because (thank God) they've got no time for that mess in here! You order at the counter, then get assigned a table where your food is brought to you. You pick up your own silverware & water while you wait. I thoroughly enjoyed a STUFFED Oyster Po Boy sandwich - DIVINE! Great spicy/seasoned fries, and a yummy ginger ale that tasted refreshingly like ginger beer. It was a hard choice for me, because everything looked so darn good!! The weekend brunch looks FABULOUS - cannot wait to come back here with the Husband! BYOB if so inclined. And PLEASE - remember to drop a tip in the jar by the cashier station"
"Amazing.  I have been there a few times and have loved every dish, but look forward to trying them all!  Recommend the Beet Salad, Crawfish Etouffee, brisket mac n cheese, and the fried chicken on the waffles with bourbon syrup.  Great hospitality too!"
"Hubbie and I searched for a dinner spot and we found Luella's. We enjoyed the car ride to the location, we live south and it was not so bad of a drive. We did have a bit of trouble in the neighborhood, there was a festival of sorts happening.....traffic was crazy. Upon reaching the destination we had a 2 block walk and it was well worth it.We especially enjoyed the chicken and waffles...bought a serving home :).The ice tea was not sweet, but I was o.k. with that.I recommend taking the drive at least once to enjoy what they have to offer."
"Came here with my husband, sister, and cousin on Easter afternoon. We purposely waited until the brunch hours were over, smart move. Liked the BYOB and order & chill atmosphere... and especially liked the southern feel they shot for. Food was so bomb, my husband ate his shrimp & grits and then got up and ordered chicken & waffles... smaller portions of certain dishes but not all- my pimento cheeseburger was huge. They accommodated our vegan cousin with delicious mac n cheese.Finished with the desssert sampler- and daaahaaam it was good.Met the chef, total stud, with a good story & extremely proud of his family and business. Staff was diverse, from all over the place and seemed to work well together.We will definitely be back... if we can recover from this food coma."
"Happened upon this place while hungry in Lincoln Square. It was a pleasant surprise. The food was flavorful, the music was soulful and the casual nature was just right. My girlfriend had shrimp and grits which she swooned over and I had the pimento cheese burger with an egg. They gave a great amount of perfectly seasoned fries with ketchup on the side. Just for fun we ordered beignets to close out the meal and we were not disappointed! We'll probably be back again! The only reason we gave 4 stars was because there was a bit of confusion with the tables where we had to move and the waitress poured nondecaf coffee into my girlfriends decaf coffee. Minor issues compared to the yummy meal."
"I chose this restaurant based on the generally positive reviews. Visited on a nice Sunday afternoon pretty late in their brunch timeframe. Brunch ends at 3pm.  Despite the nice day and the pretty good flow of foot traffic the restaurant was reasonably empty and, hence, pretty quiet. We ordered at the counter. The cashier was quiet and a little disinterested. It would have been nice if she'd explained that the mains did not come with any sides. Our food took a pretty good while to arrive despite the ""fast"" food vibe of the place. My order of andouille sausage quiche was a good portion for one.  Unlike most quiche it was light on the egg (which I prefer) and had a lot of crust which was thankfully quite light and tasty.  The sausage was really flavorful and the highlight of all I tried. A mound of salad greens was dumped on top but a little removal later and the balance was about right. My wife ordered fried chicken. It was four pieces and a little bowl of gravy served on a plate with no edges. This led to the fried chicken grease making a run for the edges. The chicken was good but not great. The batter wasn't full of flavor but they got the temp right.  The chicken was properly cooked and pretty juicy. This is where an explanation of the portion and the lack of sides would have been ideal. Four pieces of chicken isn't a really great meal for one patron. A server bussed our table afterwards even though we were still awaiting an order of beignets. After a bit of confusion, that was sorted, and we were given spoons (?) and an order of three beignets. Unfortunately, they were a bit doughy and undercooked. Summary:Pros:Nice flavors.Simple menu. Reasonably quiet. Cons:Uneven portions. Counter service could explain better or ask questions of patrons. A little pricey ($31 for meal as described).All in all, with the wealth of great eating options in Chicago I doubt I'd return."
"As far as food is concerned, this would be a 5 star review. My bf and I were passing by and hungry, so decided to check out the place based on the posted menu. We had the chicken and waffles, the pimento burger and the fried tomatoes. All were fantastic. Specifically, the tomato batter was delectably seasoned while fried to a golden crisp, the burger is in the style of a thin patty (the bun was crazy soft) and the waffles were so good that I would happily eat them without the maple syrup or fried chicken (which is not to say that the chicken or maple syrup were bad, because I would also eat the chicken on it's own or drink the syrup)I'm dropping this down to 4 stars because the service was awkward. Friendly, but awkward. For example, we asked for a box, the server took the plate with the fries, which we thought he might be boxing for us with the rest of the food, but no, he tossed it (which was fine, just unclear what he was doing) then asked us if we wanted to keep the ketchup after he had tossed the fries. That said, the place is new so I'm sure they have kinks to work out, and as I said above, the food was delicious. We'll definitely be back, hopefully for dinner next time to check it out."
"I actually went to Luella's on their opening night. While the food tasted good, they need to fix their service and portioning. I went with a party of four and every single dish came out at different times, with a 15-minute gap between the first and last dishes served. While the food actually tasted pretty good, there was a huge discrepancy in the mac and cheese dishes. I ordered a $15 ""brisket"" mac and cheese. The flecks of brisket were so tiny we thought the server forgot the dish! Someone at my table ordered a $4 kid's mac and cheese which was served in the same sized bowl as my order.I think I'll try Luella's again in a few months. Hopefully their kinks will have been worked out by then."
"The first time we came here we got the catfish tacos and the biscuits with sorghum and we were honestly rather disappointed with the small portions and how generally bland everything was. Well, those may have been a miss for us but I am so glad I gave this place a second chance. I brought the family here for dinner on Independence Day and they were really taken aback by how delicious each and every thing was. We got the Shrimp and Grits, the Fried Green Tomato BLT, the Chicken Gumbo, and the Kale Ambrosia Salad with a side of the Roasted and Chilled Beets. They were all delicious....I hate beets and even they were really good somehow.The service is really friendly and I'm partial to the look of the place. The price point is just a bit high, but considering the area it isn't too bad. I will be back (just not for the tacos)."
"The restaurant was very pleasant, clean and friendly. The food was delicious and the blend of flavors was very pleasing. The mason jars provided an authentic southern feel and the tea was very good. The GM was nice and asked about our experience.  It is easy to find in a bustling neighborhood with easy parking.Kudos to the chef and staff and best of luck. I we will be back."
"Luella's really is as good as it gets! Had an amazing brunch!  Great service, fantastic food obviously cooked with love. The eggs Benedict may be the best thing I have ever eaten, and the fried chicken was wondrous. Will be back with a bigger group, so we can try more dishes!"
Delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles & a super friendly staff!The FC&W is like dinner & dessert all rolled into one.
"Delicious dinner! We came on a Saturday night and got the kale salad, sweet potatoes, chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. For dessert we tried to squeeze on room for the Mississippi mud pie. It was a bit rich for me but my boyfriend really liked it. Great little spot. Nice that it's byob. Also chef came by at the end- good personal touch!"
"The gumbo is amazing! Best I have had in Chicago. The bourbon chicken and waffles do the trick and the FISH TACOS, oh my God...you just have to try them.  Fair prices and food that DOMINATED my tastebuds...in a good way. Oh they also have glass bottles of Cheerwine. Delish."
"Saw this place on Good Day Chicago a while back and was waiting for the chance to try it.  I  was walking by on a Saturday afternoon and peeped in.  I saw some empty tables and in I went for lunch.  Well I was greeted at the front counter by the lady who after I ordered Chicken & Waffles tells me I can't order off the main menu until after 3pm, that only the right side (Brunch Menu) is availabile.  That threw me off after craving chicken/waffles.  (How can you not make chicken/waffles a brunch item? Waffles are breakfast, chicken is lunch??)People were behind me, I felt rushed to order so I went with the Fried Chicken.  I also had a can of Sprite and my tab was about $15.  Yikes!  The place is new, I heard it was good, so i didn't mind the $15 tab at first.  I sat down and the food did take a while to come out, even though the place wasn't that crowded.  But I do understand that its made fresh, and not sitting under a heat lamp!  Out comes 3 pieces of chicken on a plate with a bowl of gravy.  You don't get any sides? For $12 for chicken, one would expect a couple biscuits with it or something.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken was very good!  But for a $12 plate, one would think they'd include a side or something.  As I sat there waiting for my food,  drinking my Sprite in the glass, the bus boy comes by and begins to pour water in my glass!  oh man!  I dealt with it.  Then a while later again comes by and does the same thing!  Overall, i want this place to succeed.  I know it can!  The food is very good, but I just think for the price they should include a bit more.  Hopefully they may consider adding a side to some of the more expensive menu items!  That would be key!  I will probably be back as I live in the area........I still want to try their chicken & waffles!"
"Food is OK, but they're still working out service issues.  It's ok if you're in the area, but it's not worth a special trip.I came here for Easter with two friends.  There was a miscommunication with the chief hostess, but we eventually got a table.  The hostess had a poor attitude, but thankfully the lead waitress was able to calm her down.  The self service drinks and cutlery is an interesting quirk.  Food came out lukewarm, but it was tasty.  I specifically ordered a bread pudding to be brought out after I called for it.  It was rushed out to me and stone cold.  I walked back to the waitress and asked if the bread pudding was supposed to be chilled.  To his credit, the chef immediately rectified the mistake and brought out a bread pudding himself.  The server also apologized.Again, they have a good vibe and I hope they get things together.  However, as a native Southerner, this isn't a place I'd go out of my way to visit again."
"I was excited to try a new spot in the neighborhood. It was a diastourous meal.Went in for brunch around 1pm on a Saturday. A very limited menu, and we were told we could not order off the main menu until 3PM.No waiter service, we had to get our own silverware and water.We ordered fried chicken, biscuits, fries and a coffee.For $12, we got 4 small pieces of chicken. 3 dark meat, and a half breast..It reminded me of the fried chicken you get in a Swanson TV dinner.Coffee was $4! Biscuits (2) small ones, were ok and  the fries were under seasoned.We had to ask for ketchup, and butter for the biscuits.We spent $27 total for this meal. It was not worth it .I could have got a 14 piece at Popeyes for the same price, it would be better.Thank goodness Flirty cupcake is down the block. That saved my brunch."
"This location went through some very sad versions of a Mediterranean restaurant, it seemed like they would do well but never did. The long, skinny and mostly dark room just didn't seem to be very inviting. The new owners got rid of the tile and put some warm wood on the walls. And they make you use the whole space by walking up to the counter in the back and ordering. I think that might just break the spell of isolated diners, you have to use the whole room.I was here for lunch on Saturday. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits which I thought was a little pricey at $22 so, not to be outdone, I ordered them too. The portion looked small but the shrimps were very large. It was a perfectly adequate meal and I'm glad it wasn't bigger as the sauce was delicious and I would have kept on eating until it hurt. All the staff were friendly but yes, you will have to get your own silverware."
"We are lucky to be participating in Luella's friend's and family trial meal today. The official opening is Feb. 3. So excited to have this casual southern restaurant in the neighborhood (Ravenswood/Lincoln Square). Tried the Braised Short Rib Mac & Cheese, very cheesy and delicious, huge portion; Kale Ambrosia salad used baby kale and fresh fruit segments, toasted coconut added sweetness, served with goat cheese and toasted pecans, perfect lunch entree and large enough to share. Loved it. Crispy Catfish Tacos were heavenly. Corn flour coating was light and nicely spiced. Shrimp and Grits were amazing in a spicy New Orleans BBQ sauce. 2 huge shrimp and cream grits, perfect."
"As a southern transplant, I want this place to succeed, but to do so I want it to get better. The prices are a little high, the portions are inconsistent, and the vibe is a bit lacking. In particular, the chicken and waffles was a mix - great waffles but the chicken seemed almost completely unseasoned, like it had just been coated in flour and water. No pepper or savory component to balance out the sweetness of the syrup. The shrimp and grits was fine, but the presentation - in a very tiny rammekin-like bowl - undersells the volume of food. This could be spread out on a normal sized plate or bowl and nobody would complain about the portions but the presentation feels ""off.""The acoustics are terrible - very echoey walls create a ""jet engine"" effect. It's not a big place but it was surprisingly hard to hold a conversation even at 1/3 capacity. Missing are southern beverage staples like Cheerwine or cheaper treats like moon pies or goo goo clusters. Those are small additions that would go a long way to selling the vibe and experience. A decent start, but doesn't above a shaky ""three."""
Yummy Southern - style cooking. Came down for brunch and had pretty much one of everything. Looking forward to coming back to try the regular menu
"I hate to give this place two stars because honestly I expected so so much more from this place. I wish it was 5 stars and I wish it had blown me away. Decor:The place looks great! Honestly does open up the place, and feels like home! The music is also great! Creating a phenomenal experience. Service:Or lack thereof, It was a shame that it was counter service but that's fine. I couldn't see any drink options until after I had sat down at a table. I noticed the drink options were tucked away in a corner by the ordering station, it was honestly a shame. The person at the front, well while enthusiastic it would only last for a few seconds. I say this with great sadness that when I entered I didn't feel all that welcomed. There's supposed to be a southern hospitality that does hand in hand with this place that doesn't exist. At least not for me. While others received the most cordial reception and treatment during the meal. Food:I ordered three things. The Creole Fries, Chicken and waffles, and the Beignet.The fries, lacked that seasoning for me. These small dismal fries, started things off ehh. All the seasoning sank to the bottom of the bowl and frankly it was just black pepper and salt. That's all I got, and it was saddening. The Chicken and waffles, let me start by saying the waffles were great! They tasted great and were very soft, with a bit of a crunch. The chicken you would think would be equally as great.. wasn't. The cooking of it was great! The flavor lacked dramatically. Did you all add any seasoning to it at all? Something to balance with the sweetness of the syrup and waffle?The Beignet.... The staple of it all. Was well it was average. Lacked a special something. Really wasn't as great as I've had. It also lacked a certain flavor. The powdered sugar was all that stood out. Once The meal was over, the group and I had gotten up and thus approached 4 people to clean and clear a table... Mind you it was really only me eating and the others just tagged along for a talk. regardless, I hope to hear back and see if they'll work on what has been suggested by customers. Only then will I return to see if I update this. Thank you."
"Fantastic addition to Lincoln Square!  My husband and I ended up here on opening night.   The food was delicious. We had the buttermilk biscuits, shrimp po boy, and the catfish tacos. The catfish tacos took a while to arrive (half hour), but we're completely  worth the wait and so flavorful. Since you order at the counter, I expected there to be an opportunity to tip (kinda like the forced tip at Honey Butter Fried Chicken), but there wasn't. So if planning to pay with a card, bring some cash too for a tip because there is no prompt to tip on the card. Nailed it with the music too. Otis Redding followed by Al Green followed by Stevie Wonder. Some minor service issues keep me from rating five stars, but it was opening night to be fair and once the food timing is better, it will be easy to bump up to five."
"I really wanted to like this place but it fell short. They are new though so, hopefully, can make some tweaks. 1) The wait - In a small space, they need to figure out a system to seat people and accommodate waiting customers. We were standing in the middle of the floor for 20 minutes and the hostess finally moved us to the wall in front of the kitchen. This should be the system going forward.2) The portions are tiny! I ordered the catfish tacos and sweet potatoes. I am glad a got the potatoes as otherwise I would have been hungry in an hour. My friend order shrimp and grits and it was basically an appetizer.3) Flavor - Season your food better. A little salt and pepper can fix this problem. I put hot sauce on the fish and it made it more tolerable but for the price, this should not be necessary. The potatoes were perfect though.4) Roll your silverware. Picking it from a drawer isn't very sanitary.The staff was great so I will try it again but not on a Saturday night. I hope they can make some tweaks as this place could be a neighborhood staple."
"Very tasty. I got the chicken gumbo and an order of fries to go. When I got home, 15 minutes, fries were still good, so I am sure that fresh they would be excellent. The gumbo was a little too soup-like for my gumbo-taste. but! Very good flavor, I ate every last drop and 4 stars. The art on the wall and the music they played were great too. I showed up at close and they were willing to serve me."
"I debated between 3 and 4 stars, and ended up giving Luella's the benefit of the doubt with that extra star. Also, this is a newly opened restaurant and they have some kinks to work out, so hopefully they'll look at these yelp reviews and use them to their advantage.We went for dinner and brought our own beer. After we ordered at the counter, we grabbed a few glasses and some pre-wrapped silverware and sat down. Note - there are a TON of restaurants in Chicago that have you grab your own silverware. I don't have a complaint with this. I could understand if other complaints were because it was not well marked or stated by the staff, but they must have improved this process it because we were told exactly where and what to grab.The food came out within 10-15 minutes. The chicken and waffles were fantastic; the bourbon syrup glaze was phenomenal, and the batter on the chicken was light and crisp. We also ordered the short rib mac & cheese, which was good, the portion size was perfect, although could use some salt & pepper for a bit of seasoning. For a BYO option in Lincoln Square, this is hard to beat. Give them a few more weeks to get the kinks out and they'll be as golden as their sweat tea.TL;DR - get the chicken and waffles."
"We really enjoyed the food, though the service still needs to come together. We went for brunch on a Sunday. Not bad service, but seems like it was still a little disorganized. Will definitely come back and try some of their other dishes.The fried chicken was very tasty and they did a good job with the space. Hope they do well."
"When I found out that this location was going to finally be something other than a mediocre mediterranean restaurant I was thrilled.  That it's southern cooking, something totally new to the immediate neighborhood, it's all the better.  Last night we gave it a try and were quite impressed.We ordered up the Shrimp and Grits, a Shrimp Po Boy, an order of the biscuits, and an order of the lemon cajun fries.  For the record, the Po Boy comes with fries, so it was just a double-order of their fries that we ended up with there.  The fries are nothing to exciting, but the seasoning is pretty tasty and went well with the Po Boy.The Po Boy was quite good.  It had a good flavor, not too much sauce on it, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The biscuits were simply the best biscuits I've ever had.  I'm not from the south, so I'm not necessarily the best judge, but they were damn tasty and the texture was perfect.  The sorghum dip was a great compliment to it, and I'm glad they provided it on the side so it didn't end up being too sweet.The Shrimp and Grits are absolutely what you should order when you go there.  The sauce that they have for the shrimp is amazing.  My girlfriend was regretting that she didn't have enough room to finish it, but I was very happy to help finish it off.When you go in you order at the counter, and then they bring the food out to your table when it's ready.  You also grab your own silverware, napkins, etc, from a little cabinet near the register.  If you BYOB, you can just grab some glasses and take them back to your table and no corkage fee.  The staff was very friendly and we got to talk to the chef a little bit about his new place. Overall definitely worth stopping by.  I'm definitely going back soon, especially to try the brunch menu which looks delicious!"
"Had the brisket mac n cheese, the catfish tacos, and the beignets. So great to have a place that serves some yummy comfort food. Additionally, my friends were able to order healthier fare with the watermelon salad, the kale sale, and the beets. There was something for everyone."
"Great southern cuisine... I enjoyed the chicken and waffles.  The menu was filled with tasty items that makes me want to come back and experience the Brisket Mac Cheese, Shrimp and Grits, and Chicken Gumbo.  It's a BYOB establishment and I will be back during evening hours to experience the brunch on Saturday.  I was impressed with the sweet tea which is hard to find in the north..... REAL SOUTHERN SWEET TEA....Thanks Darnell Reed for the vision and passion to share with others your culinary skills and southern roots."
"A couple of friends and I ordered from here on their opening day and while the food was solid we weren't blown away. Now that htye have been open a few weeks we decided to try again and we were very impressed! Portions were large, the food was delicious, and service has always been excellent. We had:-Chicken & Waffles - The chicken is seasoned and fried well. The waffle is a touch sweet which I really liked, it helps to set it apart. The chicken does appear to be both white and dark meat for those that may not like one or the other. -Mac & Cheese - My favorite! Large portion, very creamy, and tons of short rib! You will not regret ordering this-Grits: Didn't have it with the shrimp and it is amazing without. They should add this as a side item for those that may not want shrimp or would just like to try the grits. I have never had grits from a restaurant before so I can't speak to what good grits taste like but these are very creamy with good seasoning. -Catfish Tacos - I didn't personally have these but my friend enjoyed them and the portion looked large enough. -Fries - were seasoned well but I like my fries really crispy which unfortunately they were not. May have been a one time thing though. -Chicken Gumbo - Fantastic! Very well seasoned. Maybe could use a touch more rice but otherwise it was great. Luellas is definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!"
"The food is very good. I was skeptical at first. I thought it would be a posh soul food place, but the they put together a nice unassuming place. I am fan of the mac and cheese and the chicken and waffles. The po boy is also a good dish. They make a very good kale salad too. If you like soul food with no frills and friendly service you will enjoy it here."
"My friend and I went to Luella's on Sunday evening and were highly disappointed. Let me first say that the decor was very nice and you can see that a lot of thought, and effort went into designing the space. Ordering: The ordering process is a bit confusing. If I hadn't read that it was counter service online I wouldn't have known what to do when we arrived. The posted menu isn't well lit so we were handed smaller menus and encouraged to sit, review them and then order. Once we ordered we were given a number and told that our sweet teas would be brought to the table. Nothing was said about silverware or napkins so we assumed they would also be brought to the table. When they brought the biscuits we realized they weren't bringing silverware so my friend went to ask for some. At that time she was shown a drawer where she could get everything. It was very confusing and not well marked. I don't normally start randomly opening drawers in restaurants. Food: Biscuits with Sorghum Drizzle $5I am from the South and can say that I have had a lot of biscuits in my lifetime. These are the worst biscuits I have ever tasted. They were gummy, not fluffy and light like biscuits should be. Honestly, the best part of this dish was the sorghum drizzle. Low Country Shrimp & Crab Boil $21I love a good shrimp boil and have made it often at home for my family and friends. I had high hopes with this dish and thought it was reasonably priced, until I saw the portion size. There were TWO, overcooked, shrimp, two tiny red potatoes, about a 1/2 oz of lump crab meat and 1/2 a corn cobbette in a little bit of what looked like soup. There were also two small pieces of bread on top of everything. For that price I expect more than TWO shrimp! The seasoning was underwhelming. It was seasoned but the flavors didn't pop. The potatoes were also bland. Forever Braised Short Rib Mac & Cheese $11This was probably the best part of the meal but that's not really saying much. The flavors were good but the portion was small for the price. Sweet Tea $2The sweet tea was good but where I'm from you get refills. This was definitely not worth the $2 price tag. Conclusion:The ordering process needs improvement but won't take much to fix. The space itself was pleasant and the staff was very friendly and attentive. However, the portions were tiny and overpriced. The food also needs improvement. Overall this was not a good dining experience and I will not be returning to this restaurant. I wish them the best of luck but I would say that the pricing, and portion size, are better suited to an area like the Gold Coast rather than Lincoln Square. If you're charging that much money for small portions every bite should be perfection. Overcooked shrimp, and under seasoned potatoes, just add insult to injury."
"Despite some underwhelming reviews citing service faux pas, our experience at Luella's   suggests that perhaps some initial wrinkles have been ironed out. There was simply nothing disappointing - everything that we ate was delicious. I recommend the catfish tacos, the beets, and the Mississippi Mud pie. I didn't think the portions were large, but I was stuffed walking home. The staff were extremely friendly and gave clear instructions in regard to the counter service situation. Completely excited to return for brunch. We also hear some intriguing news regarding an oyster po boy on Tuesday . . ."
"I loved the food. They are a new restaurant trying to figure out what works best. Yes there are things that need to be improved, but what restaurant doesn't? I love the colors and the open space. And the wood in the wall. The staff is very friendly and they tried to accommodate what you want. The owner was really nice and friendly I ordered the fried chicken with the waffle, and because I'm not a fanatic of sweet chicken I asked them to put some spicy to it. It came out so good! I loved it! I was with a friend that is vegetarian and they made something for him out of the menu. Something with beats, sweet potatoes, and cream cheese. he really liked it (however they forgot to bring a fork with it.However I'm not fanatic of the concept of getting up and ordering the food in front , but I guess that's the concept? In my opinion I think it will be better if there is a waitress."
"Lucky to have a place like this open up in our neighborhood!  My friend and I shared the Shrimp & Grits and Brisket Mac--both were delicious, and rich, and flavorful.  Fresh brewed sweet tea, comfy dining room--can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."
The shrimp and grits is soooooo delish! Any true foodie would enjoy! Mac and cheese is also delightful. I didn't care for the chicken and waffles together nor the burbon syrup. My taste buds didn't like.
Great food and fast with presentation you'd expect at those fancy places.  Kid friendly.  Real sweet tea.  Delicious fried chicken and incredibly friendly staff.  We can't wait to go back!
"Yes, amazing, so freaking good. This was the best shrimp and grits I've ever. The employees were so sweet and they threw in free chicken and waffles at the end! This was real southern cooking at decent prices and such a great environment."
Have been back since and they have really got their act together now. Such a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and it's an easy meal that can be as quick or as laid back as you want it to be. Chicken and waffles and French toast still awesome
"I really enjoyed the ambience of this place. Small and quaint, but intimate. The hostess came around to check on us a couple of times during the meal. Very friendly staff. I was a little disappointed in the number of  options present on the menu, but the options that they did have seemed to sound delicious. I chose the cat fish tacos. Absolutely delicious flavors. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. My biggest complaint however was the portion sizes. The tacos were so tiny. I finished my meal long before any one else in my group, and I was still hungry! My friend ordered the oyster po boy for around the same price (couple of dollars difference) and he had a HUGE portion size, which was odd to me. Luckily I could help him finish his plate. I would highly recommend this place! Delicious authentic southern food. Just a heads up that the cat fish tacos (though excellent tasting) are more of an appetizer size."
The atmosphere is cute and all the people who work there are very sweet. But the food is pretty forgettable. Have been twice thus far once for dinner and once for breakfast if your in the neighborhood give it a try but nothing to travel for.
"Very good.  4 of us came here for brunch.  Everything we had was good.  Overall, we tried the pimento cheese burger (good but couldn't taste the cheese), chicory coffee french toast, chicken and waffels (awesome!), sides of fried green tomatoes and creamy grits.  Will definitely be back!  Great service too!"
"Very nice place. The food is amazing. Prices are affordable. The staff are efficient and friendly. Nice location, right across from the Davis Theater and lots of interesting shops surround it. Can't imagine anyone not loving this place...."
I ordered the shrimp and grits.  It was amaze balls!!!  Saw this place on ABC Chicago's Hungry Hound and said I had to try this place.  It was well worth the drive from the south burbs!!!  I'll be back!!!
"Fantastic food, great and friendly service. The brisket mac and cheese is to die for."
Food was not hot. Flavors were off on the fried chicken and beignets. Southern food is my favorite. I was super excited to try this place out but sadly I was very disappointed.
"It was my first time eating chicken and waffles, and thanks to Luella's Southern Kitchen, it will not be the last! I was with a group of 12 and everything we ate was awesome. The fact that it's byob makes this a very affordable spot for an easy and satisfying meal. Definitely get the chicken and waffles,  brisket mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. Also, you can't leave without the beignets. Enjoy!"
The food is really good! My family & I went here for Mother's Day & it was very busy. The front of the house needs help with bigger crowds. Which is the only reason this place doesn't get a higher review. The Southern Benedict & the Shrimp & Grits was AMAZING!
