Charlatan
"the perfect dinner hands down. this evening we had a reservation for 6:15 and had the honor of Daniella, Sparkle Pony, waiting on us. PS. If you can request a waiter - choose her! she attends the table at decent times and knows the menu very well.we ordered two red wines, the cheese platter, smoked carbonara, and the rigatoni. all classics and all made perfectly. thank you for the wonderful experience Sparkle Pony - I will be back to see you!"
"The charcuterie board was great! Not going to fill you up, but a well out together starter. Decent cocktail creations, not limited to a specific genre or region. They apparently have a pigs head you can order in the menu. I never got it, but it is somewhat unique to this spot."
"Let me tell you a couple of three things. We are absolutely in love with The Charlatan. Anthony really does a great job of making everyone feel comfortable at his home.  He's quick witted and quite personable which makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Our server, Scott gave us amazing recommendations throughout the evening and used his best discretion in staggering out the meal. His attention to detail and intuition allows you to enjoy all the amenities of five star service in this charming space.  I could go on and on...Do yourself a service and stop by The Charlatan. TL;DR:Ambiance: ****Food: ****Service: ****Drinks: ****"
"After seeing droolworthy photo stream pics of meals here by 2 of my cousins on separate occasions, I decided it was time I trek over to Charlatan for some homemade pasta!Charlatan's got a date night-y/girls' night out vibe and some unique cocktails.  I enjoyed my citrus-y Civil Disobedience drink.  My eyes and heart were set on the black pepper rigatoni, especially after reading a handful of raving reviews on it.  It was good, but I thought my friends' black kale spaghettini was GREAT!  I will definitely get a full order of the spaghettini when I return.  So comforting and flavorful.Dessert was so-so.  My BFF ordered passionfruit sorbet, which I didn't have, since I think passionfruit tastes like how armpit/BO smells, but I did have my fair share of the chocolate donuts with caramel dipping sauce.  The choc munchkins were a little dense and flour-y, but the caramel sauce really made the dish, and yes, we ate it by the plain spoonful!I estimate the dining area seats 60 or so people.  Note: the chairs aren't the comfiest.  +100 on OpenTable."
"Charlatan is my favorite restaurant in this neighborhood. We've been many times for brunch and finally made it yesterday for dinner. Everything we've had is just spot on, they really know what they're doing back there on the kitchen. Standout items include any of the pastas. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly al dente. We've tried the carbonara, the mushroom rotolo, and the black kale spaghettini and they are all great. Flavors are all really well balanced. The trout we had was simple and yet not at the same time. The grilled octopus was cooked perfectly tender. All the dishes are seasonal and colorful which I always appreciate. For brunch, whatever you try just make sure you also get either a side of tots or the mushroom scrapple tots.Good drink menu as well. Bf enjoyed his old fashioned, and I got a watermelon wheat beer from a San Francisco brewery cuz it's #summer!The only thing I didn't like here was the dessert unfortunately. We got the tiramisu, and although I didn't mind that it wasn't a standard tiramisu, it was just kinda meh and there was way too much rum in the mascarpone. If you're gonna mess with a dessert as perfect as classic tiramisu, it should be amazing and unfortunately it was not.Still, I love the food at Charlatan and have recommended it to everyone I know and will definitively be back!"
"I thought Charlatan was fantastic.  That's not just because they have postcards of their taxidermied, mounted animal heads, though it doesn't hurt.  I should have scooped up more of those.  I need to work on my correspondence.  The cocktails were great, particularly the Jeppson's Swizzle, combining my many loves; carrot, passion fruit, crushed ice, and yes, malort.  It sounds questionable, I know, but it really was delicious.  Like a negroni or perhaps falling in love with a vampire, it has a bite that you get used to over time.The food was equally good.  They have either half or full sized portions of their pastas, and frankly a shared salad and a half size each for the two of us was plenty, but if you've got a big appetite, go for the gusto or share a bunch of little things.  We shared an escarole salad with peas, farro, pesto and some other things on it which I enjoyed.  We got the lardons on the side because my companion is veg. so I got to reap double the benefits of those.  He tried a black kale spaghetti dish which was gone in a flash, and I found the black pepper rigatoni with wild boar ragu to be incredible.  I also added a meatball which was dense and had a kick to it.  I didn't need that meatball, but yeah I did.  The marinara served with it was very nice as well.We were too crammed with food for dessert (and had a date with Miko's Italian Ice already) but perhaps on a future visit, which there will definitely be."
"My friends took me here for my birthday in March.  I like vaguely remember eating at whatever the previous restaurant was in this space, but I liked how the current owners transformed the place, including the industrialized decor.We ordered a lot of food and shared it family style!  Starters including the daily foccacia with the yummy roasted garlic butter and a little on the salty side with the Maldon, but still good.  The cheese plate was underwhelming, I wish the bread that came with it was better than just toast.  The Meatball had a definite kick to it.  the Grilled Octopus was standard fare, also a little on the salty side.  My favorite entree was the Black Kale Spaghettini, a nice blend of flavors and textures.  Second was the Black Pepper Rigatoni. Pasta was cooked right.  The 1/2 Guinea Hen was moist, but I didn't really care for the celery root gratin and the pomegranate threw me off.  For dessert we had some sort of caramel budino which was good, but not mind-blowing.I wish I had a chance to try out a cocktail since it looks like they make pretty good drinks and have a good selection of beers, but will have to wait until after the baby arrives.  Also, they have Fried Chicken and Waffles Mondays from 5-10pm! Who wouldn't return for that?"
"Brought some out of town guests to this nice spot. The service was great and the restaurant is beautifully decorated and very hip. We split 3 pastas, the cheese plate and focaccia bread. The pastas were all delicious and very unique/unlike any other dishes I'd had recently. My personal favorite was the kale pasta. I'll definitely be back!"
"This is the former West Town Tavern. The inside looks similar but even nicer. We were less adventurous than others and did not get the Pig Head or the Oxtail. However we did get the Focaccia, the charred Octopus, half orders of the Kale spaghetti, the black pepper penne, lobster risotto and several Old Fashionish, that's what they call it. Everything was really good! As others have mentioned, the pasta is hand made and fresh. 5 stars for Half orders. Service was excellent! My only 2 gripes - The food was a little oily and the location is not ideal. Overall 4.5 stars being upped to 5."
"For all the wannabe Bourdain's and Zimmern eaters in Chicago, Charlatan is the spot to PIG out starting with their signature dishes Pig Head and Oxtail, aptly named Heads and Tails.When I first read about this on the interwebs, I was so, so excited to checkout the Pig head! I'm all about weird eats and having eaten my share of pig offal, from stomach, tongue, intestines, feet, adding cheek, ears and eyeball to the list seems to be the natural progression.  It is not for the faint of heart, so I had to invite certain ""key"" friends to join me in tackling these dishes. You either love it or grossed out by it. And trust me, you need the help, these are large 14"" full cast iron pans. The Pig came with a side of fingerling potatoes. Oxtail came with roasted crusty bread. Both are succulent, gelatinous, rich, fatty beautifully prepared meat. The old, meat falls off the bone is absolutely true. It needs to be. I love the roasted vegetables that came with it all, all cooked in the fat of the animal. Apples, vidalia onions and turnips never tasted SO GOOD. Rustic upscale. We also ordered one of the pasta dishes. Their claim to fame is that it's all made in house. Fabulous pasta - al dente, not to mention really interesting dish - black kale spaghetinni. The only disappointing item was the grilled octopus - it tasted like burnt ashes.Decor was dark, moody with animal heads with pretty wallpaper and a few curse words to boot, but it's in a foreign language, so it's totally acceptable... even artsy! Love this place, and I love that they know how to make food is so foreign I wouldn't really know how to cook it myself makes this place so cool. Come hungry."
"It's small, intimate, with amazingly attentive service. meatballs = order the focaccia.  Actually, just order the focaccia in general.  You won't regret it.  But get them together.  Ah-MAZING.  Also, the meatballs are pretty fantastic. The Peas were awesome. I like peas--I like they don't kill the peas.  We got the diver scallops as an app.  Solid.Got the bolognese special. Again. Awesome. EVOO Salted cod ravioli?  F*CKING AMAZING.Eat here.  Drink here.  Be happy.  and get the damn bread."
"Went here last night with a couple of friends and we thought it was absolutely fabulous. The vibe is perfectly lively and trendy, the service is noteworthy, and the food is outstanding. Everything is great for sharing and we ordered over half of the menu items. I highly recommend the octopus, corn pasta, and grilled scallions. A great place for a fun date or dinner with friends!"
"From the cocktails, to the service, to the atmosphere, to the incredible food, Charlatan was a home run this past Friday night for dinner.  My wife and two friends joined me for dinner and we had a blast; the Old Fashionish cocktail was incredible, and the other drinks I tried (including the ""No Dignity, No Doubt"") were also money.  Between the meatball and the focaccia starters and the six pasta dishes I tried (basically, all of them), our table was blown away.  The rigatoni and the bucatini were standouts, as was the mint zucca, but the half-portion sizes were the real key here since that allowed us to try everything.  Even the prices fit for me--cocktails for $10, half-portions for $12, with entrees in the mid-$20s if you want to spend a little more cash.And our server (I believe her name was Daniella) was fantastic; reservations available through OpenTable so I don't have to wait two hours to get in; plenty of street parking as well.Can't wait to go back!"
"I've lived in the neighborhood for a few years and was a big fan of the fried chicken at West Town Tavern- the restaurant this spot used to house. In fact, I work with Alonso Sotelo who was the executive chef at WTT for 10 years! I am happy to report that Charlatan is an awesome restaurant and great addition to the neighborhood.We walked over on a snowy January Monday night for the 6PM reservation we'd made online. It got pretty busy so I'm glad we made that reservation! My girlfriend enjoyed her cocktail made with scotch, and the fact that two of the cocktails names begin with, ""Don't..."" She also loved her glass of red.For dinner we started with the beef carpaccio, which was excellently seasoned and complimented by crispy potatoes, and the grilled octopus, beautifully charred and given a hit of acid from romesco.  The big hit of the night, for me, the boring one, was the spaghetti and meatballs. The spicy red sauce and especially the meatballs were delicious.For dessert we had coffee, hot, and cold espresso poured over vanilla gelato- an affogato.  We ordered just about everything except the pig's head- 3 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 full size pasta entrees and a side dish, dessert, and 2 coffees, and the total was just $100. Everything was done very well- the coziness of the room, the flawless service, the high level of execution from the kitchen.  I can't wait to get back to Charlatan!"
"Awesome night at Charlatan with a couple girlfriends.  Started off with a couple cocktails.  The Dehumanizer was a perfect whiskey cocktail that I was surprisingly able to handle.  As for the food, we shared the following:+ Prosciutto appetizer:  loved the sweet & salty combo of the prosciutto and doughnut.  they were kind enough to add one more so each of us had one.+ Black Kale Spaghettini: light flavors and perfectly cooked pasta+  Black Pepper Rigatoni: hearty, meat pasta that all of us loved+ Scallops:  this was the special for the night and it was incredible!  the combination of the veggies, sauce and scallop was a party in my mouth.+ Banana Pudding:  dessert menu was extremely limited, so we opted for this.  it was light, but satisfying.  the cookie crumbles on top made the dish.Overall, we had a great experience.  As we were wrapping up, we were pretty much forced to the bar (with complimentary drinks) so other patrons could sit.  We didn't mind moving, but the delivery from who I assume was the Manager, could be improved."
"My husband and I were walking by here on Friday night around 6 or so and decided to try it out. The restaurant wasn't busy yet, with just a few tables full, but by the time we left, the place was hopping. We really liked the atmosphere and the feeling of the place. It felt special yet casual. We had the octopus, daily pate, daily Bolognese (half order, it was a squid ink spaghetti), and the pan fried trout. Everything was absolutely delicious. Normally, we always have a dish where we feel like it shined in comparison with the others, but we really enjoyed all 4 things that we ordered. The cocktails were also tasty. I had a civil obedience and my husband had an old fashionish. I also had a ""no dignity, no doubt"" and the first few sips felt a little gin heavy, but the drink really grew on me. Our only complaint would be that the cocktails were a bit slow coming out. We received some of our food before we received our cocktails. However, we will be back to try the pig's head."
"Great bar. They have a pretty nice wine selection, including several from Italy. Beer selection was good too especially with some craft beers from San Diego (Green Flash and Stone) so I was a bit biased but happy to see these guys here in Chicago.If you're not into beer or wine, they have several cocktails available too. And as for the food, not a lot on the menu, but they have some appetizers and some pasta. I started off with the Prosciutto plate. And you can taste the sweet and savory on this one. Great starter.They have some variety with their pastas and you can choose to do half orders too, so me and a friend also tried the Wild Boar and octopus pasta. They were pretty damn good. I came in on their grand opening and there were a lot of family and friends attending, but service was great and I met the owner Anthony who was very hospitable. The staff was super friendly and was pretty awesome in explaining the dishes and the different wines they had to offer.Plenty of street parking available. It was only $2 per hour. Can't wait to go back, the atmosphere here was pretty awesome."
"I had really high hopes for this place after reading the menu, some reviews, and checking out the pics - but I have to say it came up a little short. First though, I will say the service and atmosphere were both 4-5 stars. The staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. The owner (I believe) came over to check on my friend and I, and was very friendly and genuine. And the overall atmosphere was relax and friendly. I tend to have a problem hearing in restaurants but the music and ""level of noise"" was not an issue - which is always a huge plus in my book.As for the food, we tried the Diver Scallop Crudo, Meatball, Beef Carpaccio, Black Kale Spaghetti (1/2 size), and Mushroom Rotolo (1/2 size). The Crudo was my least favorite - the mix of scallop and chicharone was just a little strange flavor-wise to me. The Meatball and the Carpaccio were both a little one note, good, but just lacking something that makes it memorable. The Spaghetti was good when you got crumbles of cheese in the bit, but when you didn't it too was a little one note. The Rotolo was probably my favorite, I wasn't that familiar with the dish so I didn't quite know what to expect. It's on the subtle side but it has a good mix of textures and flavors so I really enjoyed it. I'd definitely go back to sample some of the cocktails and some other dishes before drawing any final conclusions (especially if the Black Pepper Rigatoni comes back since that seems to be the star of the joint), but after my recent experience I won't be chomping at the bit."
"What a delightful new spot! Came w/ a girlfriend for a Friday night dinner and drinks.  We were very pleased with every element of our experience!We did the entire menu sharing style.  We started with the foccaccia of the day which came w/ 4 flavorful pieces. Highly suggest this! Then we had the bruschetta, as the ingredients were very luring.  WE were pleased with our choice with that also!We enjoyed the black kale and scallops also!The drinks were delish and easy to take down!I look forward returning here! With the influx of trendy italian spots, this was a nice change.  You don't have to do the small sharing plates approach, but for us it worked well.  Its a cozy spot and not too loud."
"Make a reservation and go now! There are plenty of restaurants that are good and you have a satisfactory meal. But once in a while, you dine at a restaurant and are just blown away and inspired by all of the dishes. Charlatan is that place. I've always liked Three Aces so I was excited to try out Charlatan. Bring your adventurous-eater dining companion and order with no holds barred - they have half size portions of all their homemade pastas, which is helpful. K and I started with the grilled octopus appetizer - amazingly tender with fantastic char taste. Then the daily focaccia bread served with butter containing big chunks of roasted garlic and Maldon salt - I basically ate the butter that just happened to be on some focaccia. The daily bolognese was handmade celery root pasta with guinea hen topped with whipped ricotta - I don't ever recall tasting ricotta that delicious in my life. Finally the pig head - perfectly fall apart meat and perfectly crisp skin - served with perfectly roasted root veggies. This is a must get! Service was fantastic, cocktails delicious and easy street parking. Keep up the good work - K and I will definitely be back."
A+ food and drinks. We trusted our waiter and we were not disappointed. A must eat. The Civil Obedience from the bar was unique and delicious. The mushroom messinese  was the table favorite.
Went due to reviews about awesome food on Yelp. However. Noise level was so high we could not hear ourselves talk or think and while the pasta was good we left to get dessert elsewhere. And this was starting at 7pm.
"Solid pasta spot.I went to Charlatan with a large group of friends. We were able to easily find a reservation during a weekday and the restaurant was not too busy, which help keep the noise level low.The grilled octopus was quite tasty and the prosciutto with gnocco fritto was interesting despite being quite different from the traditional italian version.Among the pastas, the black pepper rigatoni was impressive, but the mushroom messinese was way too salty. We also ordered the oxtail, which was off-the-bone tender.Recommended if you are into carbs!"
"Have been to Charlatan a couple of times now, but mostly just for happy hour. The drinks have always been great and I look forward to trying more as the seasons change. On a recent visit, I couldn't decide on a wine, so the bartender brought me a tasting of 2 different ones to help me out. I really appreciated the service. The staff has always been incredibly friendly. I like the lively, but intimate atmosphere. Would be great for a date, girls night, and dinner with parents. Decor-wise, I'd say it's what you imagine an urban lumbersexual's home to look like, ha. Metered street parking is easy to find. The only thing I've eaten at Charlatan has been the farro salad. While I don't feel like that's enough to judge their food offerings, the salad was a decent sized portion and delicious!"
Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday. Super cute place. Very friendly and informed staff. Sampled several dishes but had to leave early. They were more than willing to oblige us. The steak was cooked expertly and the pasta! It's the news. They aren't afraid of flavor & spice here. I mean that in the best way possible. I suggest you make you way over. Ps our server Kevin was superb. Thank charlatan
"DELISH! We came here last Thursday night and had a great dinner! We ordered across the menu, and I was impressed with everything we ate. We started with the grilled octopus and farro salad and both were tasty. The grilled octopus, I thought, was cooked perfectly! I enjoyed the salad more than my friends, but I have a slight obsession with farro. Secondly, we ordered two pastas - the kale and the black pepper rigatoni and both were phenomenal. The kale was lighter than the rigatoni, but there was so much flavor to both dishes. Lastly, we ordered the Guinea Hen and this was amazing. You have to order this. The hen was much bigger than we thought it would be and the risotto on the bottom was a great accompaniment to the hen. The vibe of this place was great, too! It seems to be the perfect spot for date night, girls night out or even a larger party. I would HIGHLY recommend checking them out. I know I will definitely be heading back here!"
"Paleo lovers...this place is your enemy...Super cute space.  Hustling and bustling on a Saturday night.  Weird thing is you walk into the bar area...keep walking...you will see the host stand.Love homemade pasta...love that this place makes ALL of their pastas in house!  BOOM!  Spaghetti and meatballs, black pepper rigatoni, rabbit casoncelli...all amaz!  In order though rigatoni, spaghetti and then casoncelli...Focaccia was so delicious we ordered another order after we pigged on the first!  And the butter makes it...along with dipping in your leftover sauce...mmmm, yum.  Clearly, I am not doing the cross fit/paleo/low carb diet...ahem.Carpaccio was good, just a bit too salty for my taste.The dessert we ordered was meh...the pudding stuff...dont remember the exact name...but it was kind of disappointing.  I was expecting a thick creamy chocolatey pudding...it almost was a whipped cream consistency with a raspberry-ish jelly swirled in it...meh.  My sweet tooth was unimpressed.Service was fantastic.Its definitely a loud space...lots of tables chatting it up, but also the music was decently loud as well.  We liked it, however if you are looking for intimate, quiet, cozy, italian meal...look elsewhere."
"This was dinner #2/supplementary meal so limited selection but I am ready to recommend and return! Delicious grilled octopus but the the pasta was the standout. All made in house, our choice was the pork belly bucatini (half portion, which is a great offering). Rustic pasta, bursting with fresh green sauce from the bucatini tunnel, ideal meat-fat ratio in the belly, luscious 62-degree egg, I would get the half portion of the entire Rolled + Extruded section...and return with an army for the lamb neck."
"I dont know what to think of Charlatan. My boyfriend and recieved a gift certificate for the holidays and were both eager to try as it is in our new neighborhood. The food was pretty good, yet nothing stood out. The black peper rigatoni was very flavorful, full of pepper! We also tried the priscioutto gnocci fritto which I would not recomment, the pepercorn over powered the dish to the point where we couldnt finish it. The cocktails were also a bit off - we each ordered a martini and an old fashioned - the ratio wasnt on and the drinks ended up being unbalanced. I have great hopes for the Charlatan and we will be back, I just think there are a few initial kinks to work out."
"Charlatan is one of my favorite restaurants in the city of Chicago right now! Love it here. Located in West Town on Chicago Avenue, it's got a great view of Eckert Park, and in the summertime, they open up all the front windows to views of the greenery. This place has a perfectly laid-back atmosphere with courteous wait staff who seem to enjoy working there. I've never been when it's overly crowded, but it always has a nice little buzz. Great place to have a conversation or a date night, etc. because you can actually hear what your fellow diners are saying. The food here is truly superb. I love the spin they put on traditional Italian dishes, and I love even more than you can order a 1/2 size pasta portion! The carbonara is amazing-- a twist on the traditional style, they actually separate each ingredient out, and then you have the utensils at your table to mix them all in. Their drinks are also fantastic. GO!"
"I've been meaning to stop by for months because we're big fans of sister joint Three Aces.I came here with friends for dinner on a weeknight, and based off the food, I'm not sure I'd come back. We started with the prosciutto gnocco fritto (basically a little donut with some prosciutto mounded on top). Separately these items were fine, together they didn't mesh. Felt like two items just plopped together because they heard everything is better with pork products on top. The donut wasn't even that great--kind of tough on the outside and not that special. On the plus side, the dish came with two donuts and our waitress offered to bring a third so everyone at our table could have one (very thoughtful!).A friend and I each had the charred fennel tortellini. We got the full portions expecting enough to take home for leftovers, and were disappointed by how small they were for the price ($28)--the half portions must be minuscule. There were only a few tortellini and the large chunks of porchetta were very difficult to cut (I ended up picking them up and gnawing on them since a butter knife didn't suffice). These were swimming in a broth that made the whole dish reminiscent of ramen. The broth was pretty good, but this wasn't anything like I was expecting (wasn't in the mood for a soup dish, which is really what this was). I had a cocktail called ""Because Winter"" that was OK but definitely not worth $10.Decor is fun and dark. Service was friendly and accommodating (chatty bartenders!), so good on that."
"I decided to bring my friend to Charlatan for her birthday due to the raving reviews on Yelp and unique entrees on their menu.  I didn't know how the crowd would be like on a Monday night, so I made reservations for 4 at 7:30 pm.  When we arrived, I noticed this place wasn't too big and almost every table was occupied.  Thank goodness I made those reservations.  The restaurant itself is warm and inviting, but has a slight romantic feel to it probably due to the candle lit tables and exposed brick walls.   For food, you can either order individual entrees or make it family style.  We all like to try new things, so we decided to share:Grilled Octopus: octopus served with beef-braised baby carrots, marrow fried pan gratato, parsley, and romesco.  There was so much going on with this appetizer, but it seemed to work really well with each other. The bone marrow and the romesco gave it a rich and buttery texture yet a little earthy, the beef-braised baby carrots gave it an extra heartiness to the dish, and the octopus was cooked to a perfect slight chewy texture.Squid Ink Lumache (full order): snails, parsley pesto, mushrooms, and calabrian chile.  I have a special place in my heart for squid ink pasta because of its texture and unique flavor, but this dish was kind of a disappointment for me.  The entrée had a good flavor and texture combination, but overall it was extremely salty.  I had two tablespoonful of pasta and had finished almost 4 glasses of water.  I know that squid ink pasta have a mild salty and somewhat sea-like taste, but it was overly salty for our taste buds.  Although, I do appreciate there wasn't an offensive sea-like taste.Black Pepper Rigatoni (full order): wild boar rago, parmesan, and brussel sprout leaves.  This entrée was hearty and meaty with a slight heat to it, but nothing too overwhelming.  This was definitely a big hit on our table.Pig Head: slowly braised with apple vinaigrette, apples, and other seasonal vegetables.  It also was accompanied with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My friends and I are all the adventurous type (one of the biggest reasons why I love eating with them), so we decided to get the pig head.  Why not?  Where else in the Chicagoland area can you get a whole pig head?  (By the way, we were a little disappointed because we got half a pig's head instead of what we saw in pictures of a full pig's head)  The pig head was delicious and there is something very satisfying about cutting your own meat right from the skull.  The meat was tender that it fell off the skull like butter, the skin was crispy, the flavoring had a slight acidity from the apples and vinaigrette, and the veggies were bursting with flavor because they soaked up the juices from the braising.  Fellow yelpers don't be afraid to try this because it's so delicious. Bourbon Chocolate Chip Gelato: the creamy texture mixed in with the crunchiness of the chips and with the apparent bourbon flavor made a great ending to our meal.  We all left Charlatan with full and happy tummies.  Our server made our experience there an amazing one.  She was attentive and offered great suggestions to our meal.  Next time you are looking for something new to try, go to Charlatan.  You might find something there that you weren't expecting to like."
"Great spotVisiting Chicago on business and came here and it didn't disappoint. Awesome drinks, delicious food with a sense of comfort and refinement. I sat at the bar and the service was spot on.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the menu felt fall/winter instead of fresher spring options. I hope they revise it for the season cuz it could be delicious stuff coming out of that kitchen."
"I have never been so delighted by a meal in my entire life. My boyfriend and I were drawn to Charlatan to try the pig head for two, and lucky for us, we were able to secure the second (and last!) head of the night! It takes about 40 minutes to prepare after ordering, so we also got the focaccia to hold us over. It was truly delicious, and I heard a rumor that on occasion they make it with bone marrow...which I would love to try. They offer a nice beer selection and cocktail menu. I enjoyed the cocktails I ordered, but they didn't really stand out as I do not remember which ones they were. It is really nicely decorated and cute on the inside, a perfect date spot.But the pig head! It was perfect. The skin was crispy, the meat fell of the bone. Cutting my own meat off the skull was a fun and satisfying experience. There was not a part of the head that wasn't absolutely delicious. It was perfectly cooked. I would go back 100 times just for this."
"We were here on Saturday 7/18 at around 7pm. The 4-stars I give is for the food, beverage selection and for Devin, the bartender. Devin was fantastic, very professional and knowledgeable.  As far as the hostess and the manager goes, there was a lot to be desired. When we arrived at the restaurant the hostess told us we could not sit at the high tables by the bar as I requested because they were reserved for larger parties (more than 2 people). So my boyfriend and I sat at the bar. Right after we sat at the bar we saw the hostess sit not one but three couples on the high tables we had requested earlier. Very disappointing!  As far as the manager for that night, I saw him asking every table around how everything was except for us. I commend Devin as he is the only one that represents the restaurant image for high standards and also commend the chef because the food was fantastic!"
"Took about 15 minutes to get a seat at the bar.  Saturday night - 4 bartenders.  No less than 20 mins to get drinks.  Another 20 for food orders.  It was busy - We had 3 halfsies of pasta - I really love this concept.  Black pepper rigatoni Meatballs and SpagehettiniSquid Ink LumacheEvery bowl was flavorful, cooked to perfection, and had a perfect combo of flavors.  Why only three stars you ask?  We got the grilled octopus and it was so rubbery, overcooked, and bland that it was such a disappointment.  Any place can make pasta. But it takes some skill to make good octopus.We'll be back.  We live in the hood.  I thought the place was fun and I had a good time. They should just perfect their octopus a bit..."
"I had an inventive chicken parm sandwich with fontina, savory tomato sauce and arugula on a brioche.  The carbonara with pork belly was both understated AND satisfied my need for thick eggy noodles and a gorgeous piece of belly.  They do a lot of interesting things with poached eggs (the carbonara and the bruschetta feature egg prominently).  The tater tots area all over the menu, but I did not think they were as special as the other food.  They're good but, I mean, at the end of the day, its a tater tot. I will add that they make a great bloody mary."
This is a fairly new establishment and was curious about it. There is not really much going on in the area where this place is located. I liked that it had a neighbor feel to it but the vibe and decor was nice. I went on a Wednesday and was fairly quiet and most of the patrons hung out at the bar. We first started with the octopus and venison tartare. I really liked the octopus but not the venison because it seem a little bland for me. Then I ordered the cheese plate which very unimpressive especially since it was served with toasted white bread. Then we had pasta but it was definitely undercook. The drinks definitely saved the night. I would come back for the bar and possibly try some more food because I feel like they are still working out some kinks.
"I've now been to Charlatan twice in a two-month period and I can't wait to go back again.  Their flavors are amazing.  A group of us went most recently and ordered to share.  We tried the Daily Focaccia, Venison Tartare, Mushroom Messinese, Leek Casarecce, Black Kale Spaghettini, and the Suckling Pig Crepinette.  While every dish was really good and unique, my favorites were definitely the Venison Tartare, Leek Casarecce, and the Sucklin Pig Crepinette.  SO GOOD.  They also have a great drink list, which many tastey options such as my favorite, Civil Obendience.  The ambiance is somewhat rustic and be sure to get a good look at the wallpaper.  Also, a shout-out to the staff who were all very friendly and attentive!"
"I'm so happy to have Charlatan in my neighborhood! It's such a cozy and intimate spot. Most importantly, they have great food.Call me a snob but... pasta isn't worth eating unless it's made from scratch. Charlatan excels at creating homemade pastas that are somehow inventive and comforting at the same time. The comforting bit is probably from the carb gluttony but yeah. My favorite pasta is the one with kale-- I'm not kale-obsessed but they make the absolute best out of those flavors. I actually wouldn't get the boar ragu again, it was kinda like a stroganoff.Focaccia was amazing! I love the flavor and texture of the salt on the outside. The meatball was salty and fatty in the best of ways-- some meatballs fall flat as they are just ground hunks of meat, this one is not. Someone order me the pig head."
"It'll be a while before I get that Black Kale Spaghettini off my mind. I took my husband to Charlatan for his birthday last night and we couldn't have fallen any harder for this place. The decor is cool, vibe is easy going, and the food was excellent. As someone who is easily annoyed by noise level, I also have to give them props for creating a space that makes it easy to have a conversation with the other person at your table. The place was full, everyone seemed to be having a good time, yet I didn't have to strain at all to hear/talk to my husband.We will definitely be back! (I'm already there in my head.)"
"It took 40 minutes for a awful cocktail (with 5 people in the entire restaurant).  The bartender was a complete jerk, yet totally  intrigued in finding an iPad cord.  Don't waste your time in the bad service!  After a 40 minute wait for cocktails, who knows if the food is good."
"This is our hood and this joint fits right in. Opted for brunch as the menu prices for dinner seemed expensive. It was a good call. We ordered two pasta dishes since that's their speciality. The wild boar ragu was dynamite. Spicy, saucy, meaty and really authentic italian. We did spend $2 extra to brunchify the dish with a ""45-minute egg."" Very good. Also ordered the carbonara  pasta. What a treat. Came with a huge piece of pork belly and egg on top. Very authentic again and full of great pepper flavor. I'd know, I lived in Italy and ate everything there. One thing that would have been nice though - a bread basket for sauce sopping up. Come on, aren't we all italian enough for that? Coffee came in a personal french press, adding nicely to the already mature hipster vibe of the joint. Will be back next pay day, maybe for dinner if we can save the cashes clay. Welcome to west town, charl."
"Found this place after reading reviews about another Italian place. Based on the reviews, we immediately canceled our previous reservation and made one for this place. I'm so glad that we did. The food at Charlatan is excellent, on par with the food at Davanti Enoteca which I believe is the best Italian that Chicago has to offer. The place is very lively and was very full when we arrived and we had to wait 10-15 min before we could be seated (typical for a Friday night). We ordered the oxtail, black pepper rigatoni, and seared cinnamon scallops. All of the food was exquisitely prepared. I'm not sure if I can pick a favorite among the 3 as they were all so good. Although I wish that I didn't have to share the black pepper rigatoni. The ragu (wild boar) that was with that pasta was amazing and wish that I could have gotten an even larger order. The oxtail was also really amazing, coming in a large iron skillet with watercress and mashed potatoes and some buttered toast. Since I was with friends, I resisted the immense urge to pick up the bone and suck all of the meat off as I would normally do when I make oxtail at home. Stupid social decorum. The drinks and wine list were really good as well. Everything that the server recommended to us was spot on. I'd definitely come back here again."
"Tito's as the only vodka option?  Really?  It's awful if it is not YOUR vodka.  Why piss off your customer before they have even ordered.  My friend asked about gins and they said they had four or five.  I get the farm to table thing and it is well done, but Tito's is hardly at this point ""farm to table"".  Many better local pours (North Shore).  Food was good.  Trout good.  Bruschetta quite good.  Zeppolle was delish.  But just a bad start.  Service was excellent"
We had brunch here and it was delicious. The braised beef neck was fantastic. The plain Jane was also great. This is a really cute place and I can't wait to try dinner here!
"Charlatan is a restaurant you do not want to miss. This is definitely a hot, up and coming Italian restaurant, with some of the best Italian cuisine we've had in a while. We shared two marvelous appetizers, particularly the risotto dish which was outstanding. However, it got even better with our 4 half-dishes of pasta, which were all superb. Just being able to order half-dishes is wonderful, and it allowed us to try more of this restaurant's superb offerings. Our last course was just as good, and my cappuccino was made to perfection, just like in Italy,The atmosphere is super romantic, cozy and inviting with some ultra-modern twists and a very cool ambiance. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient, with some really knowledgeable servers who gave great recommendations and help.Again - do not miss this place the next time you come to Chicago, it's a winner."
"I recently went to Charlatan for my birthday dinner. I had never heard of it, so my expectations were non-existent. All I knew was: A. What up! It's my birthday! B. I'm very hungry! and C. Admittedly, a little hungover from the festivities from the night before.As a designer, I appreciate thoughtful attention to detail and a kick-ass visual concept. I am also always partial to dim lighting, so when I walked in I knew I had met a restaurant match. So now it was just up to the food to win me over completely.My boyfriend and I sat in the back, right underneath the large mounted Buffalo head, which we fondly named Albert. We hydrated with multiple pitchers of water (hangover guys, hangover) and indulged in the wild boar ragu (excellent), as well as the Oxtail (even more excellent). The Oxtail was a glorious bowl of beef, mashed potatoes, watercress and bread. And it was my everything. It reminded me of a homemade pot roast my mother made back in the day, but much better (sorry Ma!) So tender, so absolutely delicious. Pair it with the mashed potatoes and that's when I die on the table and go to heaven. Beware though, we were there at 6 o'clock and they ran out after we ordered (or so I believe I overheard). Worth every penny spent and every moment savored. I will definitely be going back again, and this may very well become a go-to. Thank you Charlatan. Thank you Albert. Thank you service for bringing out all of those pitchers of water. You made my birthday."
"A girl at the end of the bar was alone. She smiled her way through an order of pasta, every so often telling the bartender that it was ""amazing... perfect!"" I watched her put on her coat, her mittens, her earmuffs, and pause at the door for a moment to say the word again, this time only to herself... ""perfect."" For real. Then I realized while I was watching her, my husband was eating all the amazing, perfect pasta.That, and the focaccia, and the cocktails, is why I've been here once a week for the last month."
"While I don't think that Charlatan was a bad experience by any means, it certainly was massively disappointing. Sure, the server was nice (but not friendly), the decor and ambiance were charming and we had a nice table. However, the food was a MAJOR letdown. In a serendipitous chance, we even sat right next to a couple we know and they seemed to be sharing a similar experience - what went wrong?In my opinion, everything was so blaise. Even with less-than-thrilling dining experiences, you can usually walk away and say ""well, I didn't love that by any means but one dish stood out."" Not here. Started with the grilled octopus, which was under-flavored and had the texture of a shoe sole. The beet bruschetta was also plain and a bit boring. For entrees we had the black pepper rigatoni and the Squid Ink Lumache and both lacked any pizzazz.I am by no means a food snob, but I do enjoy experiencing world-class cuisine in this city, and do so often. In fact, I tend to overlook glaring inconsistencies or less-than-stellar experiences if the food makes up for it. Sorry to say that the Charlatan was easily the most disappointing meal/experience we had the second half of 2014."
"Went here last night without a reservation. Because it was a Friday night at 7, we definitely faced the consequences (long wait and ultimately dinner at the bar), but it doesn't matter. This place is ridiculously good!They book all their tables as reservations, so if you are a walk in, you wait for someone to not show up for their reservation or until the rush dies down and tables open. The host told us the wait would be about 2 or 3 hours (I think that's a little ridiculous, but that's how they run their restaurant and it seems to be working out well for them). We were somehow able to get some seats at the bar after about 10 minutes of waiting, which really surprised me, I think we just got lucky. Started off with some cocktails, I tried the dehumanizer, my wife got some fruity rum drink that was incredible and not overly sweet (as fruity rum drinks often tend to be). We also got some starters, which were all on point: Prosciutto, Beef Carpaccio and Focaccia. The carpaccio was outrageous though, I think I could eat that all day everyday and never get tired of it.Moved on to pasta, I got the black pepper rigatoni and my wife got the sweet potato agnolotti. They were both absolutely incredible. Finished up with the zeppole: doughnuts and chocolate, 'nuff said. This place is reasonably priced, but with booze I would say it's a little more than 2 dollar signs. We ended up spending a little more than we expected, but it was so totally worth it and I would definitely do it again. Words of wisdom to enjoy this place: make a reservation, unless you happen to get lucky and eat at the bar. Also, GET THE FREAKIN PIG HEAD. I didn't try it, but next time IT IS A MUST. OINK OINK!"
"I am obsessed with this place. So thrilled it opened in my hood and that I finally got a chance to try it!  Came here two weeks ago and tried a variety of items on the menu. Everything we had was awesome but our favorites were the homemade pasta dishes! I have been back two times since then for both brunch and dinner and the food is amazing! I loved the chicken parm sandwich for brunch.  Some of my other favorites are the black pepper rigatoni w/ wild boar ragu, smoked bucatini pasta w/ pork belly, and the mint zuca pasta. Check it out if you are in the area!"
"Charlatan is a beautifully thought out restaurant in a great location. Their friendly and smart staff have always been super cool to me each time I come in. Every dish that I've tried has been skillfully plated and accompanied by the perfect drink. Love the decor. Thanks Charlatan, for being a great addition to our neighborhood."
"There is a very strong chance that you will find me there sitting at the bar, ordering portion after portion of their house made focaccia bread.Shit is a game changer.And when I can't handle any more bread (HA!) - I'll switch to the pasta with the venison and the balsamic reduction.This place is going to be the reason I weigh 300 lbs in 2015."
Cool fresh ambiance with deliciously unique food. I would recommend the oxtail and rabbit dish.
"Oh, SO very happy the Three Aces guys chose my neighborhood to open their new spot! I'm rounding up to 5 stars from 4.5 because we went the first Friday night it was open, and while the timing was a tad off (and our waiter forgot to bring one of our appetizers), I'm cutting them some slack.  Plus, I'm glad he forgot to bring out that dish because we had more than enough food without it! The atmosphere is less raffish than it's predecessor and was wonderfully cozy and inviting the cold and rainy night we visited.  Exposed brick, nice wooden bar, tables that aren't so close-set that you feel like you can't enjoy a nice romantic date. I got the farro salad, which was chewy and fresh with well-balanced flavors, and then a half-order (a feature I love, btw) of the sweet potato agnolotti with venison.  I don't eat mammals frequently, but every bite of this dish, which came well-recommended by our waiter, was outstanding. All of the pastas are made in house, and are melt-in-the-mouth impeccable. My boyfriend wants to come back and get a full order -- I'd eat all the pasta, he would partake of all the venison medallions.  He got a steak, which he said was well-prepared and flavored, but relatively ordinary (then, duh, don't order a steak).  He also thought it odd that it was served in medallions (versus the whole cut), but the price (just $21) should have been a clue...We also split the daily foccacia, which was finger-licking good. The menu is very inviting and there is a great (and affordable) wine list, too boot.  I can't wait to go back, and they do take reservations, which will make it easy to do so when next I have a weekend at home."
"I've been here twice now and was blown away both times! Time to write a review.The ambience is really nice and relaxing with low lights and trendy decor (read: perfect date night spot). The first time I came here, we just got drinks and an order of the most amazing focaccia I've ever had. Seriously, if you just get that, your trip to Charlatan would be worth it. It also comes with garlic butter to add to the amazingness. When I got dinner here the wait staff was super nice and helpful and the food was to die for. I particularly flipped over the farro salad with squash. I would eat that everyday if I could! Living just down the street from this place is dangerous since I'm constantly tempted to pop in for a drink and some of that focaccia!"
"This place is great! My husband and I went for a date night and loved it! Definitely get the pastas, they are all made in-house and fantastic! We will definitely be back!"
"Let's talk about the experience I just had at Charlatan. I live less than a mile away and pass it on the bus twice a day to and from work. I've been meaning to try it since the day it opened and tonight was finally the night. I started off with a session ale from 21st Amendment (recommended by the server and it was delicious). Moved in to the cheese plate which had a fantastic blue as well as a smoked goat that were excellent. My friend and I were torn between multiple pasta dishes so the server recommended a half dish of the mushroom rotolo, the mint zucca, and the black pepper rigatoni. Best. Idea. Ever. All three dishes were spectacular but the mushroom rotolo was definitely the winner. Not only is the morel currently in season (a tidbit I learned from our server), but they were local and exquisite. If you were planning on skipping the rotolo, don't. It steals the show and you'll be jealous of the table next to you that makes the smart decision of ordering it. I paired the pasta with a red wine suggested by our server (forgot which one it was, sorry!) and it was perfect. I had full intentions of ordering an affogato for dessert, but I was just too full from the phenomenal pasta! I'll have to make a point of saving room next time because affogatos are always a good idea. If you haven't already left to go eat at Charlatan, you're wasting time. Go! Now!"
"After eating here about 10 times since the opening, I went back to Charlatan for the updated winter menu. I was really sad to see that they removed the Rabbit Agnolotti from the menu. Bummer.We had some old and new items - I've already left a dazzling review for some things (which were still delicious this time around), so this review is only about their new pastas.We  ordered the Celery Root Ravioli and the Mushroom MessineseCelery Root Ravioli - I'll be honest, I thought it was disgusting. Look through my yelp history; I don't use that word lightly. The pasta was slightly under al-dente. But the worst part was the Balsamic brown butter. I'm not sure if the brown butter sauce over-reduced, but it was essentially a glaze and tasted EXACTLY like canned barbeque sauce. It was really unpleasant and  utterly disappointing.Mushroom Messinese - The flavor was there, but the dish only had one texture: Slimy.We also had their house gelato. Brown Sugar. It was awesome, and one serving was more than enough for two people. I still live nearby, and will absolutely be trying this again...but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to a new pasta menu for Spring."
"I did not like this place at all. Prosciutto clearly domestic flavorless, under cooked octopus that lacked seasoning.  Risotto came out raw. Who do you think you're fooling with your short pours of wines by the glass. Maybe four ounces at best! Shameful rip off. Not to mention a tastless and vulgar signage in the back of the restaurant.  Just because its in Italian doesn't mean its ok. Also the sake wing was not fresh at all. Bursting of ammonia flavors. What a disappointment.  This place is awful"
Went here about 2 weeks after they opened and they are already a well oiled machine. Octopus is delicious and the handmade pastas unbelievably good.  I'll be back.
"We stopped by on a Wednesday night and were fortunate to snag the only two open seats in the house, which were at the bar. Their drink menu contained a good selection of beers, mostly Italian wines, and some cocktails. Of the latter we tried Because Winter and Old Fashionish, both of which were great. I'd recommend checking this place out, but come early if you want a table."
"Charlatan was a fantastic experience. My bf and I are fans of their other spot, Three Aces, and were super excited to see them opening a slightly more refined place.The ambience is warm and inviting, while very modern and tasteful. Service was outstanding. I'm like Goldilocks when it comes to service, and this place was spot on. If any comment, I just wish we could've kept the water bottle on the table. Guys, I'm knit picking.Now the food- To start, Carpaccio and House made focaccia. The bread was delicious. Crispy crust on the exterior and warm, soft center. The garlic butter was a bonus. The carpaccio was flavorful and the garnishes were bangin. I LOVED the mushrooms, and the chips were so great for texture. Good portion. Next, 3 pastas (1/2 portions). The black spaghettini. Unfortunately, this dish was on the salty side for us. Although, my cook bf said it was fine, so maybe it was me. Pasta was perfectly cooked, pesto was great, and I loved the blue cheese.Spaghettini and meatballs. Again, fabulous pasta. Sauce is rich and chunky. Definitely an Italian gravy. The meatballs were well seasoned, super flavorful beef. Tasted almost like short rib with all the flavor. Awesome.My favorite next. The chicken bolognese tagliatelle. Ok, I mean this in the best most mouth wateringly sinfully delicious way. This dish took my favorite hamburger helper experience when I was a kid, elevated it to a 5-star restaurant level and perfected it. The mascarpone made it wonderfully creamy but not too heavy. The mint gave it that much needed zing from such a heavy dish. Yet again, perfect pasta. I would go back and get that dish tomorrow for lunch and dinner. Expertly executed, and definitely a Matte Troost bolognese. We also got one entree, the guinea hen. While the hen was seasoned well and very flavorful, that wasn't the best part of the dish. The best part was the perfect parsnip risotto, and the balsamic glazed endive, which brought all the flavors together. I would've licked that plate. For dessert they served us their bourbon chocolate chip gelato (delicious, sweet, not very alcoholic), classic affogato with cannoli cookie, and butterscotch caramel custard thingy with pistachio streusel. All desserts were yummy, but nothing compared to the food. You will also find a nice wine list and great coffee program (from Sparrow roasters) at Charlatan. Highly recommended. Only WARNING- can get loud. Don't plan for the Charlatan for intimate date."
"Came out of Yelp hiding for this one. We've been waiting for Charlatan to open for some time now. Live about a block away. Braved the crazy hail storm to check it out last weekend. Man, oh man. So good. The place was crowded so we snagged a seat at the bar. Delicious cocktails, albeit small. Food was reasonably priced. Pasta dishes come in full or half orders. I recommend several half orders so you can taste a variety.Beet bruschetta: yummy, earthy, huge. bread was crusty and delicious.Beef carpaccio: interesting, again huge for the $9 price tag. came with these incredible fingerling potato chips on top. get it.Wild boar rigatoni: got this one because the dude next to me had it and it looked and smelled delish. it was. probably my favorite itemSweet potato agnolotti: sweet, tender, light. got the half order and wished we got the full order.Focaccia: tasty. garlic butter was the best part.I forget what our total was but it was way less than I expected and we were pleasantly full. There were at least 5 other dishes we were seriously debating so I'm already excited to go back. Friendly staff. Nice vibe. Close to home. Can't really ask for more."
"Excellent food! As a fan of three aces, my boyfriend and I decided to give Charlatan a try as well. I will say it took about 20 minutes to receive our first order of drinks, but after that the service was excellent. Our server, Scott, was so nice and accommodating, that I have to give a five star review regardless of the slow start. The food was amazing! Honestly, better than three aces. We started with the farro salad and focaccia. This focaccia is so delicious we asked for a second order. Next I had a half order of the black kale spaghetti and my boyfriend had a full order of the rabbit dish. We both ate every bite! I really appreciated the half order option as my boyfriend and I were able to order what we each wanted and not forced to share. I think the service kinks will work themselves out as time goes on, and I will definitely be back!"
"Great experience at Charlatan!  I was going to see a show with friends and this place was nearby. I'm glad I found it on Yelp. The decor, ambiance and food were excellent. Service was spot on and friendly. Perfect spot for a romantic dinner date. Hope to be back!"
"Alas, I have but one regret in going here: I didn't get the pig's head. So what a great reason to go back again. Actually, I already have plenty of reasons to go back again. Let's start with the black pepper rigatoni with the boar ragu. Or the black ink pasta. Or their focaccia. Or the... OK, you get the point.Want a meal for yourself? You can go that route. Want to share plates? You can go that direction, too. We did the latter, and every dish was a hit. So was the wine, and Charlatan has a solid list of vino. I was jealous of the couple that got the pig head two tables down because it looked and smelled fantastic. Ah well, if at first you don't eat pig head, try to go back again :)"
"We had a really nice time at Charlatan! It's a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and a great place to grab a glass of wine at the bar, or have a nice dinner with friends.The menu is meant to share and with three of us, we were able to feel satisfied by the portions. The Black Pepper Rigatoni with Boar Ragu was a favorite! The pastas were fantastic and half size was a generous portion. Our waitress did a wonderful job and was very informative about the menu. If you're feeling adventurous and hungry, you can order a Pig Head or a Whole Oxtail. I can't wait to come back!"
"We went on a Friday nite,  had reservations for 930. We got seated immediately, which was really impressive.   It was jammed. Not even a seat at the bar.  Decor is really nice, exposed brick which is always my favorite,  gives a warm touch.  After ordering a bottle of wine,  we waited quite a while for it to come.  Food took some time as well.  They have only been open 2 weeks,  so I'm sure they haven't nailed out all the kinks of new employees.  Other then that,  it was really good.  Big menu,  rich satisfying foods, good presentation."
"Went the day after official openingDecor and staff: staff friendly and attentive. Still (understandably) becoming comfortable with menu. More of an edgy rustic look to the interior. Lighting is soft. Music is just soft enough to comfortably hold a conversation. Drinks:  we had cocktails with dinner. They were a bit hit and miss. Dr. Feelgood tasted a bit like a coughdrop. But we enjoyed the old fashionish, dehumanizer, and because winterDinner:  started off with the straciatella. Accompanied with toasted bread and fried brussel sprout leaves, dish was a bit disappointing. Cheese was delicious but left me wanting an additional flavor such as a balsamic vinaigrette or honey. Next was the grilled octopus. This dish was very good. They sou vide the octupus before grilling leaving it suprisingly supple while maintaining the smokiness you expect with grilled octopus. Well worthwhile. We decided to forego entre's and instead share two portions of pasta. Let me say we were not disappointed.  The pastas were clearly the highlight of our dinner. We had the rabbit casoncelli and the black kale spaghettini. The spaghetteni was perfectly cooked with a touch of blue cheese to add complexity to the pesto dish. It was fresh with a suprising addition of texture and salt from the fried kale. The rabbit was probably our most favorite of the night. The casoncelli was perfectly al dente. The rabbit was a burst of flavor that was perfectly complimented when eaten with the raisins, sage brown butter, and chanterelles. Prices were very reasonable for the level of food provided. I am excited to welcome charlatan to the neighborhood. We will be back soon to sample the rest of the menu!"
Very cool space!  I only had time for one pasta dish and it was amazing.  The bartenders are fun and I look forward to going back for a full dinner.
"Great array of whiskey, including Blanton's -- my favorite! Nice ambiance and big ice cubes."
"One of the best new restaurants in Chicago. I have been here several times, and each time I leave happy and excited to return. One of my good friends works here, so of course I was excited to come and visit, and I was not disappointed one bit. It's the same folks who do three aces. I have been for both brunch and dinner. Cocktails are phenomenal, wine list is great, and service is always impeccable. I would highly recommend dining here, for brunch or dinner. Some of the highlights for food - brunch - beef neck, avocado toast, lemon ricotta pancakes, dinner - wild boar, carpaccio, and their specials are always wonderful. 5 stars, would give 6 if I could."
"Awesome brunch!Got the pepper rigatoni with wild boar ragu, lemon ricotta pancakes, and beef neck and polenta - all amazing. Def coming back!"
"Charlatan is a cool spot in Noble Square (near the I-90/94) that opened up in the last month or so.I was looking to try a new Italian restaurant with my dinner companion and was convinced to stop-in upon learning that Charlatan is owned by the same group that owns Three Aces in Little Italy.Here's what we ordered and how it was:1. DRINKS:  Beer and wine.  The drink menu here was pretty solid, but I think the prices are smidge steep for what's offered.  2. APPETIZER:  Beef Carpaccio.Awesome.  The description on the menu mentions mushrooms, but be aware that they load the plate with portabella and shiitake varieties.  This was unlike most carpaccios that I've had in the past, but very tasty.3. ENTREES:  1/2 order of Black Pepper Rigatoni & 1/2 order of Meatballs and Spaghettini.The rigatoni was flavored well, but the pasta tasted a bit stiff.  I'm not sure if this was due to the variety of the pasta (it looked like wheat) or incomplete boiling.  I would give this dish another chance and order again.We ordered the Spaghettini as a control to see how well a simple dish was prepared.This was a huge win.  The meatballs were flavorful and the marinara had a bit of spice, as well.The service was attentive and friendly.  I plan on visiting in the future to try another appetizer and another entrée.Cheers."
"Underwhelming. The place is cute, pretty good drinks, and good service. However, the food was not impressive. The menu is very concise. Overall, the flavors were off, everything was either over or under seasoned, and nothing was particularly good. The polenta was a big bowl of bland -- fine but completely forgettable. My friend's spaghetti and meatballs was over salted and otherwise not very flavorful. I would come back for a drink but not for food."
"Went there for some bites. Lovely place, nice vibe, welcoming host. Had the grilled octopus - very succulent! Highly recommened. Also had the squid ink pasta. Was very good too. Will def try more dishes next time!Will be back anytime."
"I visited Charlatan last fall and had a wonderful experience in the middle of the week, but a weekend visit was quite different.  While the food was good, the room was packed and the seating was unacceptable.  I was literally touching the back of the person at the next table as was another dinner guest.  Really?  You can't remove one four top table so you guest can eat in comfort.  Also, the room is extremely loud.  The wine list is marginal and the pastas were slightly over cooked.  All-in-all, not worth $160 a couple.  I'll hang at their other restaurant, Three Aces in Little Italy, more bang for the buck and they do what they do well."
"Came for dinner with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar and shared plates. We ordered the grilled octopus. It tasted a little burnt and tough but if you ate it with the red marrow it tasted way better. I absolutely loved the oil smashed potatoes. We also had the black pepper rigatoni, it was okay. The pasta seemed like it should have been cooked a little longer, it was hard. It was however still tasty. The bar staff seemed typical, nothing super personable. The drinks were very good, and they also had a good beer selection."
