The 3rd Coast
Cool spot with a great atmosphere. Food is delicious service fast and courteous. If your in the Gold Coast and want a great meal in a quaint and quiet place this hits the spot.
"- Food is almost always good, and the burgers are awesome! Brussel sprouts and the apple pie ala mode are a must try.- The feel inside is really unique, and at night the ambiance is classy-cool. Classic old Chicago building and located in a fairly quiet, historic area of the city.- Staff is nice, however my takeout orders have been messed up more times than not. They commonly forget one or two of the dishes ordered and once even forgot one of the buns on my burger (??). - The manager was kind of pretentious when she asked how our food was, and she seemed like she was more interested in telling us about her then actually caring how the meal was.Solid 3 stars for this place, but still worth checking out I'd say, especially late night."
"I came here mid/late afternoon after exploring a museum and was absolutely famished. My friend had looked the place up via yelp and said ""whatever I get, I'm also getting a scone on the side, so don't judge!"". I would NEVER judge a person for wanting a delicious breakfast food, and as soon as I passed the pastry case with them inside, saw they had raspberry, and that it was served with whipped cream, I had need for one as well!Their menu and pics posted by fellow yelpers made my decision all too difficult. Everything sounded great! I kept flipping the menu back and forth before I decided on a burger. I was pleasantly surprised to see that soup was a side option, as well as hash browns or a salad. There was the slightest inkling of a chill in the air so I went with a cup of their spicy garbanzo barley soup, the Baja Burger and the raspberry scone. The waiter working seemed to be the only one managing the register and all the tables. It wasn't super busy, but for one person, I guess it was kind of a lot. He dropped menus on the table that he'd just taken from another table, and by the first time he came around to greet us, it was already decision time for all the food. He came off as a little rushed and abrupt. We ordered food, and diet cokes and began our tortuous wait. I was a little disappointed to see that the pops were served in cans. AKA- no free refills. Bummer, could've used a little more of that caffiene!Food came out relatively shortly after, and everything was delicious. I LOVED the soup- mild spice, loaded with beans and barley... I'm definitely going to hunt out a recipe for it! The burger was juicy, a little greasy, had a decent amount of avocado on it and TONS of pepperjack cheese- Just what the doctor ordered! The scone was quite large, had a fair amount of raspberries on it, and was also pretty good. It wasn't a life changing experience, I'd say the soup was the closest food item for that. My friend ordered similar with an omelet meal, scone and coke. We left with leftovers and our total was like $42. I thought it was reasonable for what we got. I'd come back again."
"This is a solid four star restaurant.  I came here with my friend on a Wednesday afternoon.  There were a couple tables occupied and we sat ourselves right away.  I had the house omelet with a chocolate chip scone.  Both were delicious.  I never thought to serve a scone with whipped cream, but I'm sold.  The only thing that kind of bothered me was the server.  Yeah, he was the only server and he had a couple other tables to take care of, but I still don't think that's an excuse for rude behavior.  We sat awhile before he brought over our menus and even then he just dropped them on the table without a word.  When he came back all he said was, ""ready?"" Oh well, the great food made up for it."
"Came here for breakfast and the food was good, nothing extraordinary in terms of taste or presentation. Fine place to grab breakfast or coffee - perhaps a little overpriced for what it was, but reasonable considering the area."
"I really wish nobody knew about this place, because I want it to myself.I get there lox or polish sausage for brunch, or their Mediterranean salad for lunch. The dressing in that salad is out of this world. Not sure how life would be without this salad, and that has to mean something because I would choose a steak over a salad any day any time. Cheers!"
"Overall: Cozy and homey little cafe great for breakfast/brunch/lunch or a casual dining experience.The Good: Atmosphere is comforting and easy going. Service is very friendly and attentive, my coffee was always full. The food was excellent and portioned just right, and came out pretty quickly fresh and ready.The bad: Not much! Even the music was pretty good.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"
Love this place they have great lunch menu and desserts are awesome it's a hidden gem in the neighborhood recommended and nice ambiance for friends or a date. Prices are decent and service is good.
This place was extremely busy on Sunday brunch morning. The place isn't very large and it is very crowded inside. I don't know how the waiters maneuver around the chairs and tables! We were seated in about 30 minutes. We were waited on promptly. They have $5 mimosas and Bloody Mary's on weekends. I got the farmers omlet and substituted the mushrooms for spinach. It came with toast and hashbrowns. The food wasn't outstanding but it was a good and filing breakfast. This spots seems like a reliable brunch joint.
Recovering from a wrap up of The Grateful Dead three night run- this place was a stones throw from the Indigo Hotel- perfect meal! We had the cheese platter sampler that was just perfect and then I went into a Quinoa/Kale with Chicken salad.  Delicious. The vibe was cool and the staff were super attentive and friendly. Recommend it if you are in the neighborhood.
"I'd go hear if I lived within 5 minutes walking distance, otherwise 3rd Coast is pretty standard, if not a bit simple for what you're paying for. The clientele is older and more wealthy than you'd find at other brunch places, hence the moderate noise level which is nice. This would be a great place to meet a friend or have a small business meeting for a light breakfast/snack.I appreciate the ambiance inside, which has this upscale, old-time cafe feel to it. You get the sense that maybe a famous author wrote her books in the corner, or that politicians come here regularly to have a coffee while they scheme away. Speaking of which, Rahm just beat Chuy in yesterday's runoff. Shocker."
"Lunch time!! My colleague and I decided to try this place because it is close to work. I ordered the chicken greek salad and she ordered the BLT. 5 stars for service-- you can set up an order for pick up or delivery (they do deliver!!!) but we ordered pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes...awesome!!2 stars for food -- This is based solely on my salad, I will update this if I try other things. However, I was not impressed with the salad. It was $14 and tasted like a $5 salad. First of all, the chicken added to the salad is cold (I prefer warm chicken) and tasted okay. It was a bit dry and had to warm it up. They did give the right amount. The salad itself was very bland and not dressed up at all. I ordered the dressing on the side, Greek dressing very good! The BLT was on Texas toast, large and average. I will try this place once more but for now, I was not wowed (and I have been eating A LOT OF SALADS for the upcoming wedding :) ).  This salad is one of my least favorites that I have tried in the past two months. However, I suggest trying their breakfast menu, I have heard that it is very tasty and let me know :)"
I've walked by this place so many times and always thought it looked so charming. Finally I went for brunch with friends on a Sunday. We had a lot of fun talking and catching up. The atmosphere of this place is quaint and not to crazy which can sometimes be hard to find for Sunday brunch. We arrived just in time for my friends to be served bloody Mary's and they said they were great! Now onto the food:I had eggs Benedict and it was a little over cooked but still good and all my friends enjoyed their meals as well. The menus is not very big but I will be back to try something different! They have a small bakery counter with good looking scones and muffins so I will for sure grab one of those one day! I had a bite of my friends chocolate chip scone and it was perfect! Not to dry like scones can be. I can't wait to come back here again to enjoy another meal with friends.
"I was going to give it 4 stars because of the slow service, but the food was really tasty. Bought the chicken and penne in Alfredo sauce, opted for the spicy flavor. It wasn't that spicy but tasted great and there was a lot! Great ambience and perfect for a date."
"A good breakfast/brunch option in the Gold Coast.Personally, I prefer the faster service and more varied menu of the Original Pancake House on Bellevue and Rush.  But 3rd Coast is a solid choice.It has a very low profile.  When you walk by on the sidewalk, you think it's just a coffee house or something.  I've never had to wait for a table.I ordered the full stack of the blueberry pancakes.  They were good, but, you know, they were also pancakes.  I'm not going to wax poetic about batter and blueberries.They also sell ""sticks"" of bacon, which is just an obnoxious way to say ""bacon.""  Each strip is $1.50, but they were very, very good.Decor is a little tacky."
First time ordering from 3rd coast ever. Literarily just picked up the food..and this is what I get? #fail
"I like going here! Great food, music, cozy ambiance. CLEAN. We're often seated right away. Relatively quiet during Saturday brunch hours, which is a relief. Food is pretty standard compared to other brunch spots. I really like that the bar is this prominent, dark wooden structure, BAM in the middle of the restaurant instead of tucked in a corner. As for other aspects of the decor, I didn't find anything extraordinary or jarring.It's more expensive than you would expect at a neighborhood cafe / diner. At the same time, it is Old Town (Clark/Division), so I guess they've got to break even somehow."
I think the 3rd Coast is your typical American brunch food housed in a decently nice area which naturally increases the price for food. I got the Eggs Florentine with hash browns which was tasty but really nothing out of the extraordinary and nothing that screamed at me to return again. I loved the abundant amount of spinach on the benedict though! Ingredients tasted fresh but there was too much sauce on my benedicts which made the English muffin overly mushy and soggy. Seats are way too close together. It almost gives me anxiety. A very short wait for Sunday brunch so it's a good place to come if you're not up for waiting more than 15 minutes. Food is also served pretty quickly. Props on good service from the folks working there.
Great breakfast food and coffee.  The eggs Benedict was outstanding.  Gets quite busy on the weekends.  They also seem to have a good wine selection
"Very quiet today here. Friday at 11am. The service is very good. The restaurant is a decent size and very clean. Lovely menu items. Have to get the Scone. I had the blueberry. Yummy! Overall, everything was very good."
"I stop in to get something to take out.  The Menu price was ok for this part of town. I order the spinach  salad , lemon chicken and the muscles.  The server greeted me, and was very personable. Everything was clean the atmosphere was nice and mellow, and I will come back.Rob"
I love this place. Coffee is phenomenal as is all the breakfast options. I eat here way too much!!
"Food was good, service was extremely friendly and hospitable."
"This place is a sneaky, cozy, lil gem.  I met a friend for tea and coffee.  My girlfriend had the best cappuccino of her life and I was treated to a large glass mug of tea.  We did not eat anything but I will be going back soon and will definitly add more.  This place is great for getting work done, breakfast, or a quickHere's the breakdown:Service:Attentive, knowledgeable and very sweet.  Ready and willing to give advice and assistance.Ambiance:It has the full on diner feel. There were not too many people there when I went around 430pm but it began to fill around 530pm.Drinks:Excellent wine, tea, and coffee selection.Food:I did not order anything, but breakfast is served all day and they had typical American food.  They also sold plenty of pastries.  My girlfriend recommends the scones.Price:Very reasonable.  The tea was $3 and the wine was $7-$9/ glass. Food was on average $10 more or less."
"What a find!  We were looking for a quiet spot on a Friday night for a glass of wine, without having to get all dressed up. Stumbled upon this, just up the block from the Indigo hotel. The tables are a little crowded together, but everything else was perfect. We ordered a reasonably descent bottle of wine for $28 and an abundant cheese plate for $10. Included 4 cheeses, apple slices, walnuts, jam, and bread (which they replenished). More than enough for 2 people to linger over. We got a free desert for ordering the bottle. We chose the brownie sundae to share. How can that be anything but great?!Its not fancy, nobody comes there to be ""seen"" so it was just perfect."
"I would not recommended The 3rd Coast for groups larger than 4 - we had 6 and they had a hard time accommodating us. Because they don't have many ""larger"" tables, they estimated about an hour wait on Sunday morning. It ended up being about an hour and a half til we were seated.Once we were seated, it became one of those awkward situations where you start to wonder after 15 minutes (no exaggeration) if a waitress was actually assigned to your table or not. They were clearly ridiculously busy, but it was prime brunch time - come on people, staff up! When she finally came by, she did apologize for the wait but was not friendly.As far as food/drink, I got a latte and the veggie hash. It was decent, but not stand out. Thank god I did not order a regular coffee like the rest of my group! Because they didn't have enough trays (?), the waitress stacked each saucer on top of each mug to carry it all in one trip. As in, wherever the saucer was sitting when the coffee was poured (probably the dirty counter) was then put on top of where your mouth actually drinks from the mug. Gross!"
I always get the 3rd Coast Burger well done. Service is great and I never have any issues with my food order. Employees are very attentive and always check in frequently too make sure everything is good. Caesar salad is good but for some reason they do not serve fries..especially with the burger. Either salad or hashbrowns. Still would recommend.
"Decent food. Nothing special. Cozy environment except the annoying machine that makes this sound like someone is closing down one of those folding metal door each time it is used. Staff is friendly when they talk to you. She only checked back once after the food was served. Is coffee is not refillable? I wasn't even asked if i wanted another. My empty plate has been sitting in front of me for 12 minutes while I'm writing this review. And other servers pretty much just walk past me since they are not my server, I'm guessing. Still waiting for the check.Verdict: Not coming back. A lot of other options around."
"I'd say 4.5, I need to chill on my 5 star reviews. I just moved to the neighborhood a few weeks ago...LOVE it btw, and this is already one of my go-to's. I work crazy, odd hours, and love their 12 am closing time. I'm notorious for dining alone, but also need somewhere to take my daughter, or God forbid a date these days. This place can accommodate all 3. Its not the most stylish restaurant by any means, but charming. And you'll never feel like a douche dining alone. (Who does is a weirdo anyway. We are all adults and need to eat)I'm NOT a breakfast fan, so I can't comment on that, but their Asian noodle soup is amazing. I could eat soup everyday, and am picky about it, and this is great. Quesadillas are good, and my daughter loves the meatballs. I can't comment on the recognition of regulars. I've been about 10 times in 6 weeks and haven't gotten that super friendly vibe I get at Mario's. But I'll keep coming back."
"Great Neighborhood spot! Salmon, Omelet and Kale/Quinoa salad all good. Friendly service. Recommend for brunch or an easy sit down meal in the bustling gold coast.The only thing I found odd, was the chicken breast added to my salad was buried underneath the kale and everything else, kinda strange?"
"The diablo beef sandwich is a great take on the classic italian beef sandwich, on a great chewy baguette with spicy giardinera. Wine and craft beer list leave nothing to be desired. A favorite neighborhood spot"
Great place for breakfast. Food was delay and plentiful. Some of the best coffee around. Service was just ok but in there defense they were super busy with a wait to sit down. Will definitely go back!
I've been coming here for years and there is a reason it's been around so long: quality! Great neighborhood food and reasonable prices . Open late and also family friendly. Nice wine. Love the support of the local art!!
"Delicious breakfast, super fast and friendly service even during a really busy time. Try a flavored latte-the hazelnut one was delicious!! I got the banana pecan pancakes and hash browns and they were delicious. Would definitely return!"
"How many cafes can be perfect for writing the great American novel, for an intimate chat with a friend or to practice Spanish with a large group of amigos?That's what 3rd Coast is. It's one of those places that I've been frequenting for just about forever, and for a Swiss Army Knife of reasons.On occasion, I look for places to work or to write, and that was the reason I originally went to the 3rd Coast, more than 10 years ago. In the mid-afternoon or on a weekday evening, it was often nice to sit down in a plush banquette on one side of the room or the other, and put a few words down while sipping a nice cappuccino.Later on, it was a great, conveniently located place on a relatively-quiet street to sip coffee or wine and catch up on the latest highs, lows and mediums of my friends. (Not that any of them gave good enough advice to truly be psychic mediums, but it was helpful nonetheless.) The room is relatively quiet, with most people respecting that ambiance. The food is good and simple. I often get something light--the grilled cheese sandwich is excellent; tonight I just had eggs with hash browns and sourdough toast, along with their very quaffable house red wine. Hash browns are one of those things where, if they're done perfectly, they are very crispy on the surface and very soft & chewy on the inside. In that case, if they are truly unhealthy for you, it is worth losing a few days off the end of my life for them. Tonight they were and, consequently, it was.Lately I go here many a Tuesday night, because there is a group that meets to practice speaking Spanish. The waiters at 3rd Coast are wonderfully accommodating (let me give a special shout-out to Sado, who always projects a good, mellow mood and is always helpful), They even give each of us separate checks, which is made easier by us wearing name tags for the event and leaving at different times, so everyone doesn't pile up at the register at once."
"I use to frequent this spot at least once a week. Today is first time I've been here in about year. Much to my surprise, I was very disappointed. They had the nerve to send cold, stale, and dry bacon out with my food that also consisted of hash-browns that were not fully cooked and and eggs that were still runny because they couldn't seem to cook those properly either. Sorry 3rd Coast, but you just lost a long time customer."
"The 3rd Coast is my go to for dinner. The variety of food is great and the quality of food and service is always exceptional. Recommendations? This is tricky because i have so many items to recommend, between the soups, sandwiches, burgers, lobster ravioli, salmon and eggs Benedict (breakfast) The portion sizes here are rather large and the prices are extremely reasonable.  They have speciality cocktails under $10 and entrees come with soup or salad for under $20. I have never had to wait for a table, even on Valentines day! On Valentines day they have an awesome deal for $30 which includes a drink, appetizer, soup/salad, entree and dessert! SO much food! This is literally better than any restaurant week deal! The service here is always outstanding! So friendly and I have never had to wait for a table and I usually leave very full."
Solid place with a full spectrum of food.  Its basically a typical greek diner - very similar to ones you find throughout NJ and around Boston - but rather then a stand alone presence it's located in the base of a Gold Coast high-rise apt building.
"Stopped by here after a shred class and was craving something hearty/hot. I ordered the coconut oatmeal (comes with bananas, added raisins) was a little pricey at $9, but portion was large enough that I had it for both breakfast and lunch. Cafe was relatively empty and service was pretty friendly, so I ended up staying awhile and writing postcards and having a couple cups of coffee. This would be a nice place to catch up with a friend or enjoy some alone time and I will definitely check it out next time I'm in Chicago."
"Wow. Just wow. Had to give stars for the food but absolutely zero for service.Went in today (there were only two other tables seated) and had the most unpleasant experience with a female server I have ever had in my entire life. Walked in and didn't get a hi, hello or anything, just muttered ""Sit wherever you want"" I sit down. Again, no hi, hello, introduction NOTHING no smile ever. She just goes ""Are you ready?"" What is wrong with you, woman? My whole entire time dining she said maybe four words and did not smile once. What a miserable human being. Here's a tip: If you don't enjoy serving or working in the service industry, please find something more suitable for you. She was so unfriendly that I didn't even feel welcomed in the restaurant and uncomfortable as ever. I paid my bill and left immediately so I wouldn't have to deal with her any longer.  Have no idea who decided to hire her as a server but they definitely lost business from my friends and I. I live in the neighborhood and work at a hotel within walking distance and will not be recommending this place, ever. Their food is great but their service is awful, good luck."
Veggie hash was fresh and delicious!Chilaquiles dish was full of flavor and so good! Mimosas were perfect! A splash of oj for color. Just the way I like! Great vibe! Friendly staff! Very enjoyable! I will definitely be coming back soon!
"Third Coast is a very special place. I've been coming to this delish joint since I was 10 years old. Because it was in the neighborhood, parents gave us permission to get lunch and dinner with friends at Third Coast. We wrote the 5th grade newspaper on those tables, we gossiped about high school crushes while waiting for our raspberry scones to be warmed in our teens, and now that I live in New York, I also stop in to get a perfect cup of coffee or a glass of vino with some live jazz, and, of course, a trip down memory lane. I'm jealous of everyone who gets to call Third Coast their neighborhood hang out."
"Adorable little local spot. Great service. We popped in for breakfast. started with a hot hot Apple cider.I had a hard time deciding between the veggie hash or the coconut oatmeal.Decided on the hash it was perfect! Crunchy, hot, lots of broccoli, runny eggs. YummThey have gluten free and vegan options, locally sourced foods, organic ingredients."
"Quiet,  cozy little diner with a great Chicago Beef sandwich and caesar salad.  It's a little hard to find the place,  but once you do,  you won't regret it!  I just moved here and will be coming back to this place to try another sandwich!"
"I live in the Gold Coast and ever since I found out that you can do take out from this place, my life (in the neighborhood) changed for good. I always get the Cajun burger with a side of Ceasar Salad, even that simple Ceasar salad is amazing!!! Give this place a try."
"I was trying to find someplace cheap to go for breakfast food, but was close by my house. I stumbled upon 3rd Coast Cafe. I can't believe it's been here for as long as it has and I never noticed it. It's sort of attached to an apartment building. The two times I have gone here as a walk in and it took about 10 - 15 minutes to be seated because this place gets packed. I've had the Farmers Omelet both times with a pancake. The  food and proportion size was decent. This place was cozy, good service, and decent prices. I will be back to try the dinner selection and of course the desserts."
"This was my favorite place for breakfast/brunch when I lived in the gold coast. Hardly ever had to wait for a table, which is nice when you wake up hungry and hungover and need 'dat bacon asap. Plus their bacon... So. Effing. Good.  Also their coffee is fantastic as well! The only qualm I've ever run into is that the toast is sometimes too soft and not toasted enough. But I guess that's an easy fix by just telling your server to double toast it!"
"Fantastic, consistently good food, always. A great tucked away neighborhood place. Service is above average and kitchen is unbelievably fast."
"We were visiting family in Chicago and Heather suggested ""The 3rd Coast""- it was up for debate because most of us hadn't been there before. WELLLLL it was a huge hit. The Veggie hash- outstanding, Bacon- delicious,breakfast tacos-yum! I'll be back next time I'm in town- for sure!"
"I stumbled upon this place serendipitously while walking today.  I was getting hungry, and tucked in the middle of a residential neighborhood, I found my solution. Clearly a local favorite, the cozy under street cafe has dark wood accents and brown leather booth seating.  I started with a cafe au lait that was steaming hot and softly sweet. Perfect for warming up on a cold day.  Then I ordered the BLT and side Caesar.  The salad was the star of the meal, but the sandwich was butter toasted and loaded with thick, expertly grilled bacon."
"I love this place; mainly because of how many purposes it has served for me.  I've come to The 3rd Coast for morning coffee, lunch, dinner, wine, and a combination of the latter two mixed with some research/reading and work because they have free WiFi!  I actually haven't gone in for just brunch, which is something they're known for also. My favorite thing is coming here between 8 and 11 on any random night, ordering a glass of wine, grabbing some dinner, and doing a bit of work.The service is always great, the music selection is right up my alley (light and ambient electronic many times), and the food is always good.  Five stars for third coast for not only executing one food and beverage vertical, but many."
Excellent food here. Love the atmosphere and the quirky decorations. Very unique. I wish there was a bit more room inbetween some of the tables as I feel like I do not have my own space. Also you are constantly bumping people when trying to be seated or leave because of the tightness. Overall a great experience though and I will be back!
Came here at 9 on a Sunday morning and while it was busy it was not packed. A little unusual for a Chicago eatery with good reviews.I had the Mexican omelette and my wife had fruit and granola. Both dishes were excellent. Also got a peak at the food next to us and they said the same thing.Not sure about the things said about the coffee I thought it was great. Service and speed of food was excellent
This place never stops impressing me! Having the Salmon dill Havarti sandwich! Great!!!
"I have been here 3 times, and the first 2 were very good, the 3rd was very bad.My date sent her breakfast back twice.  At first it was over cooked, then so far under it was not safe to even try it. They did some gifting on the bill, but they have to figure out some things before I go back for trip #4.  Try the omelets they don't get these wrong from my experiences, but not the benedict and not the Chilaquiles, definitely not the Chilaquiles... Service was a bit slow after the meals were served but they did more once they realized things were going poorly.   A for effort after the fact is not an A.   Worth keeping on the medium list but other places to re visit first..."
"Very cute cafe. Ate breakfast here twice a few weeks ago when staying in the area. Breakfast sandwich was good but a little greasy. Banana pancakes were solid. Coffee was perfect and refilled regularly, without having to flag anyone down. That's worth 3 stars alone. Place got very busy on Saturday morning, around 10:30am, as should be expected. Thankfully we got here early both times and never waited for a table."
Bloody mary is awesome Eggs Florentine and mexican omelet was as excellent as other Yelpers said. Fresh fruits and stuffed french toasts are out of this world
"There's nothing quite like coming back to a place you loved years ago and finding it's only gotten better but your favorite sandwich is still on the menu!Whether you stop in for coffee and one of their gigantic scones with whipped cream or a more substantial meal, this cozy little spot is a perfect hideaway from the busy world. Try the coronation chicken salad. There's a reason it's a keeper. The staff is lovely as well!"
It was delicious. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I didn't think it was worth the price. $11 for small tacos with no sides is just a bit pricey for me. But I thought it was pretty delicious.
"1st time visiting this location. First impression: super cozy! They were really busy and although the waitress took a while to come to our table, she acknowledged and apologized.Food was delicious! We tried the Veggie Hash, Stuffed French Toast and cappuccino. Everything tasted great.I just didn't give 5 starts because I found the portions a little small for the price they charge. Besides this, great, great, great."
"Solid brunch food. The menu is not overly creative but everything they make is fantastic, even the scrambled eggs! No wait on a Sunday afternoon made my experience even better!!!I had the bobak sausage plate. My boyfriend had the veggie hash. Both were yummy. The only critique I have is their coffee. You can tell it's good coffee (they say it's a locally roasted specifically for them), but it's a tad bit too watered down for my taste. I need my coffee strong after a Saturday night out!Service was excellent. No complaints! :)"
"5 stars for The 3rd Coast! I live steps away from this cozy diner. No literally, I live in the building where this restaurant is located, and I frequent it about once a week. Sometimes more if I am feeling lazy. The food is nothing short of delicious!  The prices offered for the entrees and appetizers are great. The staff here is wonderful and attentive. The diablo tacos are my weekly ""go to"", but the baked chevre is delish! Also, the chicken quesadillas, the tomato rosemary soup (when served), the malibu burger (MMmmm), and the Mexican steak & eggs. Look, if it wasn't good, I would gladly walk somewhere else, as there are plenty of places close by. I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, as I usually get my food to go, but I like that they offer free wi-fi in the back part of the restaurant. I may go for breakfast next weekend!"
"I've been remiss in posting this. I've lived around the corner from this little delicious place for 4 years. It's truly a place where everyone knows your name. The food is pretty incredible. The menu has something on it for everyone. I often get the tuna melt and for real - they cook it to perfection. Their wine selection is also great. I've had breakfast, lunch and dinners here. If you're looking for a local place that's warm and inviting...with a great menu where everyone comes out of the kitchen tasting great, then 3rd Coast is your place."
I brought my office staff for a quick dinner and drinks during the week and this place was AMAZING. The entire staff was so great- Chris + Janet are amazing. The food was excellent! Must try the mussels ( Dane says he came up with the recipe but we're not so sure! =)The drinks were great as well!The Barbados punch is a MUST. All in all this place is fantastic
Kinda of an adorable place with great food. Check was slow and no one came to give change. Good thing I didn't need it.
Awesome eggs Benedict. Very classically American. Also some of the best hash browns in a while
"Casual, fun, cozy, warming, welcoming...I could go on with the humble positive adjectives. When it comes to brunch, this is a restaurant worth checking out. The staff is wonderful. I think the prices are pretty reasonable in my opinion. Service is top notch. Food is much better than your typical bar grub, that is for sure.  Key lime is a must try!"
"I had the lox Benedict, which was excellent - I really liked the salsa verde. The café au lait was good. My friend had the Greek omelette, which she enjoyed. Service was pretty good. Quintessential breakfast spot atmosphere. Would definitely come back."
"Just had an amazing hamburger. Served on pretzel bun, goat cheese, fresh spinach, roasted peppers and avocado.    Is your mouth watering....it should.  Trying breakfast tomorrow. .I don't think I'll be disappointed."
"Went here for brunch on a Sunday and walked right in with no wait. The place is small and simply decorated, nothing fancy. The food was good; I had a BLT and hash browns (BLT was mediocre but the hash browns were great) and my friends all got various omelets and pancakes which they said were good. Overall, I would recommend if you are in the area and need a brunch place without a wait, but I think there are certainly better/nicer places around if you are trying to impress someone or have visitors from out of town."
"Solid all-around breakfast place with simple cafe-like decor. Reasonable prices for the Gold Coast area. The menu is very traditional and the breakfast food is good, but nothing special or out of the ordinary.  Hashbrowns are excellent with crispy outside and soft and moist inside."
I have been here five times in 2 years. Does this make me an expert ? no but I do like the place and its vibe that it gives off.The last time I was here I ordered a large chicken salad which most people would not be able eat in one sitting. It's in the $12 range. Needless to say I was not able to finish it and it became breakfast :)The owner of this place is there alot and she is very attentive to the customers needs and also to see what the business needs so that it could be better. I have forgotten her  name.I once came here for a few hours to chill out with some of my cousins. We had breakfast items at 5PM...I had oatmeal and then we all chilled out while drinking malbec. The bottle was reasonable and under $25.Now that I look into it it seems they have quite a few wines bottles that you can share for under $25:3rdcoastcafe.com/3rd_Coa…This just means I will be there again.The coffee is awesome. Another fun fact is that since Ashkenaz closed there are not alot of places you can find a bagle with cream cheese and lox in the gold coast. Look no more. Because they serve this here for $13. I have not had it yet. I just think people who live in the neighborhood or at least within a 6-10 block radius would not mind knowing this fin fact.
Wonderful menu! Great Service! Good breakfast drinks! We had a great brunch here and enjoyed everything we ordered.Very nice environment. Great neighborhood restaurant.
"A great brunch place with little or no wait and better food and prices than the local competition.  I have lived in the Gold Coast for nearly a decade now and this is my go to breakfast place.  That is unless I want to sit outside...then I go to Tavern.The omelets are great, but you really can't go wrong here.  I have never disliked a dish.Good, relaxed atmosphere and service.  My only criticism is that the short brunette weekday morning waitress kind of has a crap attitude."
"Visited The 3rd Coast Cafe and Wine Bar 9/10/2013 and it was just what the doctor ordered after our walk in the beautiful 94 degree Chicago heat. Chicago's Old Town was very quaint. We enjoyed all the shops and peeking at the restaurant menus but decided to eat closer to our destination since we just wanted a beverage and snack as we had a big lunch when we met my niece, mid afternoon.3 rd Coast was a good choice. My dining partner had eggs and toast and I had one of their daily specials a ""Coast Soup"" ramen bowl with chicken broth, ginger and garlic and a couple hot peppers. The eggs were over easy as requested and the ramen and broth were delicious with a nice full bodied chicken flavor and more gingery than one finds in traditional pho.  Very tasty!I had a scoop of Homer's Cappuccino Chip Ice Cream to satisfy my sweet tooth. It was a great flavor and with Chicago's extreme heat that day a good substitute for a coffee.Service was very good. Chicago IS my kind of town!!!!!"
"Long ago in a decade called the 90's, this was our favorite go-to place for breakfast.  It was a charming coffee shop offering a good meal (loved their scones!) with friendly service. So, when a friend was visiting from London and staying at the Public Chicago hotel, which is just a block away, The 3rd Coast seemed the perfect place to go for breakfast. It's still charming and, at 9am, was fairly quiet. Just five other people were dining. (That changed quickly and, by the time we left, the place was crowded. So go early if you don't want to wait for a seat. ) Three sleepy-eyed, yawning girls stood behind the counter when we entered. No one greeted us. We asked if we could take any table and were told yes. The friendliest and hardest worker in the restaurant was the busboy. When no one came to take our order, he went and got us coffee and summoned a waitress, who'd been ""busy"" talking to the other servers at the counter. I'm guessing that no manager or owner was around because the service remained ridiculously slow and the servers showed little interest in working.  Our breakfast fare (omelettes) was fine. Nothing spectacular but decent. It's a cute place and, if the service was better, it'd be worth a return visit."
"Perfect brunch place - delightful cozy setting, delicious pancakes, super fast and friendly service."
"This diner was directly down the street from my hotel so I ate here twice. It was nothing phenomenal, but a step up from your regular diner experience.  I had the veggie scramble and the veggies were crisp but the cheese wasn't all the way melted (oh well I still ate it). I also tried the chilaquilies and it was not great. In all fairness Arizona has some of the best chilaquilies around so maybe my expectations were too high for The Gold Coast .The diner was clean and the service was good. Solid 3 stars."
"I came here for brunch on a Sunday.  I got there around 11am, and was shocked that there was no wait for two. Whee!!!The waitress and hostess were both so nice and sweet.  The prices are a little steeper than I would have guessed, but for the location..reasonable.  I was a little disappointed that there were no endless mimosas, BUT they had great ""eye opening"" alcoholic drinks.  At first glance, I thought their prices for the drinks were a little steep too, but once the waitress came out with them, I couldn't believe how great a deal in both quality and quantity they were!I got the salmon sandwich, which was great.  My only complaint was that it was a little too greased up for my taste."
"Would give 10 stars if I could based on:  food; ambience; service; location; weather; plus a bonus, Janet, the owner, is a doppelgänger for Lily Rabe and her enthusiasm and passion for what she does shows.--no attention to detail was overlooked; from the freshly painted coat room to the custom menu for our prix fixe menu. Charming and beautiful hostess not afraid to roll up her sleeves and lead her staff by example (nice boots too ;-).  Chris, (the other owner) is also very knowledgeable and accommodating. After a fantastic 7 course dinner--everything was indescribably excellent but the fish tacos were even more superb than excellent (I run out of adjectives for how great they were) Chris turned us on to a great B.L.U.E.S. Bar down the street.  So great, that despite having just had dinner, I am coming back for breakfast tomorrow as I hear their bacon is to die for (which is appropriate dice bacon is probably the worst ting one can eat while at the same time tasting like the best thing ever).Come here soon. Come here often.  You will not be disappointed."
"They staff is friendly and patient, the food comes out fast and fresh from the skillet or ya know, they have a nice selection on their menu but I would like to see more.  They are open pretty late and I never have to wait long for a table. Great spot!"
Solid brunch and breakfast.  Friendly staff!  Coffee cup was always full.
"Good solid breakfast for a good price. Had a basic breakfast of eggs, hash browns and an english muffin with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The portions were huge and did the job of keeping me full for my 6 hour flight back home. Service was a bit lackluster... waitress sounded very irritated or bored but we got our food and drinks quickly. Everyone else enjoyed their food too. The restaurant is very quaint and cozy too."
"Sometimes, I vant to be alone.  But I don't want to cook, nor do I feel like being cooped up in my apartment with take-out, how depressing.So, I meander around the block to 3rd Coast for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  I might even order breakfast for dinner, because that's how 3rd Coast lets me roll.Located on the ground floor of an old, probably historical, Gold Coast mid-rise, 3rd Coast appears to be listed as a wine bar, but it is so much more. They serve some solid grub, and I usually never fail to order one of their Bloody Marys, because they are huge and hit the spot.  Good food aside, I like the space.  It is an intimate room, but does not overcrowd.  You can choose a booth or a table. They have an old fashioned cash register. I usually enjoy their song mix, which is also set at a reasonable decibel. The servers are nice, efficient, and not overbearing. The bathrooms are clean. I get to pass by Hemingway's old apartment on the walk here. 3rd Coast: Greta Garbo would approve."
"Dat artwork. I know I'm supposed to focus on the food, but if you don't feel like bringing your omelette into the Art Institute to start chowing down in front of a Van Gogh, you can't find a closer second. We came on a quiet day, and service was good. Not super fast, but we had some time to appreciate the decor.We had the House and Farmers Omelettes, both of which were stacked to the rafters. Not literally. Shut up. They made for a great brunch with leftovers for second brunch (the fifth most important meal of the day).Prices are a smidge higher than I would like. Then again, I'd like everything to be free."
"I eat here every time I travel to Chicago.  The food is really great at an affordable price.  I look forward to coming back again soon.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner you just can't go wrong.  And I agree-the veggie hash is outstanding!  Their soups are fantastic on a cold winter night."
"Salads are huge and tossed in variety. The steak was juicy and flavorful. Honestly, there isn't a bad dish on the menu. This place serves amazing breakfast and amazing dinners. My favorite employee is the food runner, who is really efficient with his work. Will be back. Yep."
"My family has been going here for many years. Since my dad does not use Yelp he asked me to post this for him:""Having been seduced during our time as expatriates in Paris by the importance of neighborhood cafes -- the ""good places"" that provide the essential nourishment of mind, body and spirit -- I am a regular at the Third Coast, a quiet block north of Chicago's increasingly unappealing Division Street.Janet and her team provide all the ingredients of a desirable hang-out -- only lacking a sunny terrace on which to nurse the morning's second or third expresso.I'm there mainly for breakfasts -- all varieties of coffees and egg dishes, and hearty scones that make a meal by themselves -- and lunches -- with focus on choices of soup, sandwiches and salads. (I rotate between the Cobb and the California.)Perhaps one of the few locations to resist a row of sports-heavy televisions, the Third Coast instead features good sunshine from a row of large east-facing windows, and paintings and photography sourced from artists deserving the exposure.Clients are a mix of loyal locals and visitors from the neighborhood hotels -- which can mean full and enthusiastic occupancy of its 90 seats for the weekend brunches -- and calm and quiet the rest of the week. For a congenial place to spend unlimited solo time with books and papers, or to enjoy a friendly spot with family or colleagues -- the Third Coast is a vital resource."""
"I really enjoyed it!  I've had breakfast and dinner.  Both times, I wondered why I had never eaten here!  Each time, it was not so busy that we could sit immediately.  That's a big plus.  My husband will not wait for more than 10-15 minutes anywhere.  We live off North Michigan Ave, there's always another restaurant.  But Third Coast has great burgers, as good as The Local, better than Coq D'or at the Drake, as good as the bar burger at Michael Jordan's.  Breakfast is equally good and prices are good."
"I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, laid back and makes you want to sit back and relax with a coffee or nice glass of wine. I had the veggie hash for breakfast with cinnamon raisin toast. The toast was so good! I liked the veggie hash, but it could have had a little more flavor, I put hot sauce on it, which spiced it up a bit. Overall I really enjoyed my breakfast and the service was good."
"Food is excellent and portions are large, so I think 5 stars would normally be appropriate. However, the service was very poor, which is the reason for the 2 star review. My wife and I were looking for a quick, hearty breakfast on a cold Sunday morning. After living in the city for 8 years we finally decided to give 3rd Coast a try. When we walked in the restaurant was noticeably slow.  We asked a a larger table, but were quickly informed those are reserved for groups of 4. While I generally understand this policy, I can't help but think they could've accommodated our request. After all, the restaurant was not busy at all. They sat us in a very tight corner table. So close, in fact, it was difficult to have a private conversation. My wife asked what kind of muffins are available. Seemingly, a very simple question; however, the waitress quickly snapped, ""we don't have muffins, we only have scones.""  From the looks of the display case, the pastries could easily be mistaken for muffins. Our apologies for asking such a silly question!  We ended up leaving before we finished our food as we found it very annoying to share our conversation with total strangers at the adjacent table. When we left, the restaurant was less crowded than when we walked in. I find this level of service unacceptable. Despite the good food, we will not be coming back. Thank you for an unenjoyable morning 3rd Coast."
"I live across the street, so it might be a little too conveniently located. Okay food, nice spot to just go and relax with a dessert and drink. Staff is attentive and doesnt rush you out at all!"
"Walked by this place a million times & always thought ""we should check it out"" today we did with our twin babies in tow. Mid afternoon, it was half full which was perfect for us to grab a late lunch & let the babies socialize :) Hubs had the baja burger - excellent! I had the chicago polish sausage & eggs - deeeeelish! Had to also grab a giant chocolate chip cookie to go - so glad we did. As we walked over to the park, we decided this is going to be our weekly lazy Saturday afternoon spot! Food, service, atmosphere & price are all spot-on for us."
"For some reason the area around 3rd coast reminds me of upper east side in NYC, especially on a quiet Saturday morning. Met friends here for brunch. Quirky little space. When asked for recs, the waitress immediately said: veggie hash. I went for the farmer's omelet instead, but two friends got the veggie hash and started raving about how yummy it is after their first bite, so I'll have to try that next time. The omelet was delicious too, with a bit of caramelization on the outside and lots of filling. I was stuffed! Added bonus: no wait on early Saturday morning. I'm a fan!"
This place is so dope! Great food that is reasonably priced and wonderful servers surrounded by a cool atmosphere.
The 3rd coast is a hidden gem that I recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast place. The staff is awesome and very friendly! I had a breakfast sandwich that was out in minutes and a primosa which is champagne and pineapple juice! It is amazing!!
"Meh. With so many good brunch places around, this one just lacks character. It isn't bad or anything, just a teeny weeny bit 'boring'... The food as so-so. The waiter was a little too weird and made some ill timed attempts at sarcastic humor which were lost on us. The stuffed french toast that everyone raves about was a little too savory for my taste and I was quite disappointed as it had so much potential."
"Sunday brunch is dangerous for me. It can easily lead to a full day of debauchery during football season and eventually hating life on Monday morning. It's for this reason that I love a place like the 3rd Coast, which gives me the option of a Funday menu on Saturday. They do $5 bloodys and have an extensive menu pretty much all of which is priced under $10 a plate. I had CHILIQUILES that were a bit of a disappointment but it's still a pretty cheap and tasty way to work off a hangover.  Inside it's cozy and exactly what the doctor ordered if in need of an inexpensive and casual spot. Whether you're in need of a walk of shame breakfast or post church (as if I go there) brunch I think it's suitable for either occasion."
"I knew we made the right restaurant choice when every other customer was a regular (known by all servers). Breakfast here on Sunday morning was great...coffee, food, service. Eggs Benedict, great. French Toast (both sourdough & cinnamon raisin), excellent. Blueberry pancakes, great. Really!  If I had to criticize anything, it would be the hash browns; they were greasy. Ladies...added bonus...the full length mirror in the ladies room was flattering ;-)"
"Great service and food. Stopped in for a quick lunch during work day. The waitress was quick with our order so we could make it back to work in time. Cute rustic feel, would definitely go back to spend a little more time and enjoy the atmosphere"
"The best 1/2lb Angus beef burger on a pretzel bun with mushrooms and brie cheese I've ever had. Tender, juicy, full of flavor and totally delicious. Started with an excellent spinach caesar salad and  glass of wine.  Great service.   Highly recommend.  Also, heard their pizza is excellent."
"Had a very solid brunch here on Sunday! I was very excited to come in here around 11:00 and have there be no wait. Their menu is fairly small, but includes anything you could want for breakfast. Our waitress was attentive and came by frequently throughout the meal to refill coffee and see how everything was going. My only complaint is that some of the items were a little pricey. I had two eggs with bacon and it was $10.75. Even taking the fact that I was in the Gold Coast into consideration, that's a little much. My dining companion had banana pancakes that looked awesome. The full stack was pretty massive, I'd like to see anyone try and dominate that. Overall, great choice if you're in the area."
"I had not even heard of this place, but stumbled upon it before dinner at the Pump Room for a girls night. What a little gem! We didn't eat, but ordered a few bottles of wine and to our surprise, each bottle of wine comes with a free small plate! We had a great cheese plate that was larger than most and very yummy! The hummus was also very tasty! Definitely will be back! Think they could spruce up the inside a bit... it was very dark and the lights kept flickering for some reason but still a great time :)"
"Tasty, cute but small but great breakfast/brunch spot. (Apparently it is also a wine bar, but this review will focus on only brunch.) Portions were pretty huge, coffee was super good, and the spot itself gave off a very cozy, welcoming feel. 3rd Coast is hidden inside a hotel/residential building (not sure which one, but someone below probably knows). I tried it for a mid-afternoon brunch on a Sunday. It was not too crowded around 2 and was open for brunch until 3, a better time than some places. The food was so tasty I can't remember enough of it to describe. But I assure you, I enjoyed it!Something about 3rd Coast just gave off a great vibe. Even if the hadn't been terrific, I'd probably still give a great review. In fact, my friend had her order messed up a bit (ordered something off and it was still on), but the waitress was apologetic and the food still great (I was told). We also had our coffees taken off the bill because of the mistake, so that was good. And like I said, still would happily go back!"
Great place to go in Chicago for a quick bite to eat or late night snack.
Solid and upscale diner that serves wine in the gold coast. Omelets are tasty in the morning and rather satisfying.Service can be on the slow side though. An empty coffee cup sometimes stays empty longer than it should on the downside.
"Been there a few more times since my last review and want to add that I've had their Norwegian Lox and Bagel sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  Their lox was excellent, not salty, extremely tasty, and the preparation on the plate was very appetizing with vegetables.  I love their lox sandwiches. Quantity and quality of the lox was excellent.  There's no need to look in the city and drive all over looking for a good lox and bagel sandwich.  I think their lox is much better than other delis in the city and their bagels are much better too. Wish they would have chive cream cheese in addition to plain though. Service as always was excellent."
"The 3rd Coast is our best neighborhood place - the people are lovely, the food is wonderful and varied, the hours are incredibly convenient (early a.m. through late p.m.), and it's a cozy place to sit and work or to have casual meals."
One of my favorite brunch spots. The food is great. The friendliness of the staff is awesome. Why 4 stars? Service is a bit slow for my taste. I try to go there when I'm not on a tight schedule.
Awesome little find for us out of towners!! Brunch and drinks were great!! Highly recommend!!
Get the veggie hash. Everything else is out of this world!
"YUM! Cute little place for breakfast. Lots of locals dining there. Neighborhood favorite. I've been a few times, food was great, and service is good"
"A breakfast/brunch place on Sunday morning at 11am with open tables and no line? I've always thought those were magical unicorns, but apparently they DO exist...in The 3rd Coast.And I'm not quite sure why...the food is FANTASTIC. Light, fluffy omelettes, slabs of applewood bacon, thick slices of marbled rye toast, strong coffee...this may just be my new go-to brunch spot. Of course, the menu is substantially more limited than Yolk or Eggsperience or the new kid in town, Hash House, but if you don't need the choice of a gazillion types of omelettes, you'll be quite happy here. And they have pretty good chilaquiles, which are hard to find in Chicago. Service was pleasant and attentive and the vibe is very casual and laid-back. Think coffeehouse that serves stellar food. Prices are a bit steeper than other brunch places, and there is a $1.50 upcharge for egg whites only (sad face). But to save the ""waiting in line headache,"" it's a decent trade.  I'd never heard of The 3rd Coast before, and perhaps no one else has either. That's fine--I'd like to keep it that way, because we all know that waiting for brunch blows."
"Omigawww I'm in love with this place. It makes me want to squeal and kick my legs like a little girl. I'm trying my best to suppress these impulses since I'm writing this review at work. Anyway, here's why.Steak for $17, perfectly med-rare as requested.Beautiful hash browns and pan-fried potatoes.. how do they get them so crispy?!Option for spinach caesar, uh brilliant.Delicious new orleans burger, especially with those pretzel buns!Cozy spot just off the craziness of rush/division, could def be a regular here.The sweetest servers, ps I want to be your friend, guys.Casual but also kinda nice.. if that makes any sense.Artwork for sale I think on the walls.AHH love it. I've been charmed, and I think you will be too."
3rd Coast is linked inexorably to my college years. Straight up nostalgia boosts my rating to 8 stars.
"Stopped in here on Easter Sunday at about 10pm. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive, we felt bad they were working on Easter. Atmosphere is very laid back and the place has a good vibe. We got the cheese plate and hummus and took a piece of chocolate cake to go. Everything was delicious, will definitely be back."
"Being from Houston,Texas I think the name lured me in here the most. 3rd Coast, now I was thinking that their was going to be gumbo,crawfish,and all other kinds of shellfish, but was pleasantly suprised at what I found. This place is hidden on the bottom of what I think is an apartment complex and you can miss it if you doubt yourself. Now this also makes for a nice breakfast/lunch spot to have a nice quiet meal or a great conversation with a good friend. I had the veggie hash and it was pretty good and fresh. Oh and the restroom was SUPER clean!!!!! Kind of like a Buc-ees restroom, lol!!!"
Really cute breakfast nook with great coffee and food.  We had the vegetable hash with eggs and the breakfast sandwich.  Both dishes were great and the service was excellent!  I will definitely come back here.
"Love the breakfasts and lunch here! Can't go wrong with most on their brunch options: omelets, sandwiches, best scones ever.   I was a little less enthused by the dinner here but all in all love this place."
Great place for coffee and espresso
Awesome breakfast - so happy---2 friends loved the bacon-the perfect amount of crispiness! they said. The vegetarian said she ate too much- really? Wow! ...and as a meatitarian I was drooling over her meatless choices! Yum!!!
"Solid spot for brunch. nothing too new or fancy about the food, but good food and a solid menu. Great neighborhood spot!"
"I live in the neighborhood and end up at Third Coast fairly often when I want something close, but don't want to go to the typical Old Town bar. I've enjoyed everything I've had from brunch, to soup and salad or a sandwich. Most notably, I love their bacon whether it's with breakfast, on a BLT or in a salad. It's always pretty crowded for brunch, a little slower on week night evenings. Service is always attentive and the prices are reasonable for the neighborhood."
"1st trip to Chicago, 3rd Coast breakfast was our first stop off the plane.Great food and service with a sense-of-humor helped shake off the jet lag.The veggie hash was a novel suprise and the veggie sandwich on gluten-free bread happily satisfied my celiac/vegan ball-and chain. Don't miss the carrot soup, either.Look forward to stopping back on next visit!"
"WHAT? You want a place that gives you WHAT? Great service....fabulous hot  fresh food? AND Great Coffee!??READ THIS.........A late breakfast experience in the city on a cloudy day. Steamy fresh cups of coffee nestled in a saucer with real cream to lace it.Fresh fresh eggs ( I had mine a PERFECT Over Easy) and I love to be able to use that word!! accompanied by crispy non-greasy fluffy , yes fluffy, hash browns and a classic Maxwell seared split sausage link. The toast was thick cut marble rye..lightly crisp and warm. My tablemate had two wonderfully cooked sunny side ups with 3 Thick cut Bacon Strips cooked to crispy perfection. Yes and hash browns....and that delectable rye toast. Let me tell you...I know its Breakfast...but when you get something as wonderful to begin your day which is obviously prepared with passion and caring the way 3rd Coast presents it...it is never Just Breakfast. We are actually going back for libations and small nibbles later!! (they have a great ambiance at 3rd Coast and the cutest bar!)Ty 3rd Coast.......you are SO very worth it!**My shout out to Kelsey who delivered exquisite service,  was sincerely friendly, happy to see you and appreciate you being there!  TY Kelsey!"
"Dear the 3rd coast stuff -Thank you for the great service every time I come here for the Sunday brunch with my NYTimes... Alone... Thank you for no judging ... oh wait... there are plenty of solo brunch eaters here.  I have no guilt...  This place is kind of hidden, so there are not many crying babies, obnoxious bros/ladies, or clueless tourists.  It's just a regular people eating respectfully.  I like how they offer the choice of hash-browns and fresh fruit mix, and love the fact that the fruit mixes are actually fruit mixes like strawberries, bananas, pineapple, melon, etc. not ""assorted grapes (green&purple)"" or ""assorted melons (orange & green)"".Food is a typical diner style ...nothing too fancy but quite tasty!"
"Hidden, quaint spot. Great service with a smile. Mexican steak and eggs were authentic and tasty. I would take a bullet for their Apple pie ala mode. It is unbelievable."
What is all this talk about breakfast? The Malibu burger/turkey burger/veggie burger is awesome!  Lots of goat cheese and avocado on a lovely pretzel bun is not to miss.
"I've been to 3rd Coast a few times at this point. The food is pretty good for a little cafe. The first time I went I got a plain garden burger. That may have been the first time I'd ever had a pretzel bun so I lost. My. Mind. I'm sure if I had another at this point I'd think that burger was mediocre. I always seem to go with the same friends. One of them was absolutely fanatical about something really simple like chicken wings or something. The manager told him that they were a seasonal/temporary thing and that's why they aren't on the menu, but she said they'd be bringing them back. I'm not sure that that ever happened, but at least she seemed concerned.The cafe is quaint and quiet. Clean as far as the eye can see. I've seen everyone dine there from hipsters in groups to business men in suits to the elderly sitting alone to multiple generations of a family. It's food for everyone! I'm definitely planning on making many trips to 3rd Coast. Perhaps in the future I'll only visit in groups as they get the preferential treatment. I dined alone recently on a very slow weekday and after my food was delivered, I never saw my waitress again."
"What a hidden gem in the Gold Coast!  I came here Saturday morning for breakfast and got a table right away, unheard of for breakfast in the city right?  I love going out for breakfast, but I hate that everyone else does too and most places are really crowded.  I had an awesome breakfast of two eggs, sausage and hash browns and everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  The service was great, and they had many more things on the menu I'd like to try, including their Chai Latte's.  It seemed like this was a neighborhood favorite judging by the other patrons, casual, cozy, and friendly...my kind of breakfast spot!"
"It's not the most attractive venue, but it is cozy and the food is outstanding. For the area - it's unbeatable for value and quality.All breakfast items, especially the lox, are outstanding and the cajun chicken pasta is a great go-to other times of the day. It's not the trendy, faux-vintage cozy bookstore/coffee shop/neighborhood nook --- it IS that vintage place. Great service too."
A quiet spot and ideal for breakfast.  I would go here daily.
"this is our neighborhood cafe and wine bar! right down the street from where my boyfriend and i live, and this place never disappoints. so cute and cozy inside, great for a date night or just a good conversation over some wine and indie music.some of the dishes that make this place really memorable are of course their famous hash browns, chicken cesar salad (with homemade croutons), soup selections, burgers, the turkey brie sandwich, and my all time favorite....3rd coast's apple pie dessert with icecream...everything is just heaven in your mouth. the reason why i'm not giving 3rd coast five stars...is because of one experience my boyfriend and i had recently.we came in for lunch on a snowy day to find us getting served by the rudest waitress. we've never seen her before, so i'm unsure if she was new (since the rest of the staff are sweethearts) but this girl had a serious attitude problem.first i thought there was something in her eye from her rolling both of them so much...really? if your gonna roll your eyes at least not do it in front of your guests who are going to be tipping you.all this drama over requesting a dish that was so simple, yet not written on the menu. thankfully, the meal was a success and the 3rd coast kitchen staff saved the day doing a wonderful job by accompanying my request so well...but i'm not gonna lie... this was a VERY uncomfortable lunch experience for both my boyfriend and i.but we aren't gonna let this one incident stop us from getting our 3rd coast kick. would highly recommend :)"
Polish sausage breakfast dish is good
Have I mentioned I'm a tea person? Chai Lattes at 3rd Coast usually make my weekend.I've been here several times and a favorite is the granola with yogurt and fruit; soups are served piping hot and delicious. Eggs and pancakes are large portions and sure to keep you full for a good amount of time.It's a nice place with a vintage feel to it. Good for groups or if you want some 'me-time'.A shout out to the staff for the wonderful recommendations and smiles :)
Newly renovated! Best coffee in the city!
Love their French toast. Literally get cravings randomly and love that it's just a few blocks away. Coffee used to be really strong but lately has tasted a lot weaker otherwise awesome place with awesome service :)
"I went here with my dad last night and it was just like old times.We usually come here late night, so I can't comment on what most of the reviews go one about- namely their breakfast/brunch.  However, for a mellow place with a great atmosphere and lovely (often live) music playing in the background, you can't do much better than this place at 10pm. It's a nice place to be able to talk and think, and  not worry about being rushed out. even if you only order a few coffees.The food and beverage selection is good and everything is always tasty.  Their tea selection is awesome.  Everything is slightly overpriced for the quality, even considering the area, but the ambiance makes up for that to me."
"There's a waiter here who looks just like john cusack.  Plus, he says that joan and john cusack come here every now and then.  He has a picture of him and john together. He says John is taller and older (and fatter)."
"In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried to come here for dinner instead of a 0730 early breakfast, because I just wasn't terribly impressed with my texas french toast for breakfast.Love xoxo's description of this place, cuz quite apt. Dont' come here to this quiet locale in Gold Coast for noise, trend, cool, glitz. Ain't gonna  happen. Instead, walk a few steps down and walk into what is more like a dated conversation pit that was so in a few decades ago in living rooms....there's even an old-fashioned cash register that one has to press down really hard for it to make that clunkety-clunk sound that just adds to the overall feel. Apparently, at least 4 other parties were already well into their breakfasts.Though quite ample in portion, the toast was just chewy and 'limp'... don't know how else to describe it (I have had stellar french toast in my time....read Tower cafe or Bella Bru, Sacramento). Though dipped in egg and then pan-fried, the toast did not possess that great play in crisp and then soft on the inside...instead it was all completely soft somewhat tasteless. Would have been a nice touch had they just added a splash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the egg batter.Syrup is the other half that comprises a killer french toast experience: it was... meh. From the perusal of breakfast reviews, it's sort of hit/miss with this well-established place that is connected to the south of a condo building. The entree + grapefruit juice ran about $14 for breakfast.Just south of Goethe on Dearborn... had a wonderful, quaint, stroll through historic Gold Coast looking for the FLW Charnley House."
"Attention Gold Coast: this is the place for breakfast. Gone are the days of early risers compelled to make their own morning meal because every place is closed. Rejoice! For The 3rd Coast is open at 7:00 AM and is ready to serve you delicious breakfast in a nice atmosphere.What just made me FLIP for 3rd Coast is that their breakfast menu isn't overly laden with eggs. Nope. They have sandwiches too, but not like iHop or Denny's. No, 3rd Coast has quality food and atmosphere (there it is again!).I opted for the stuffed French Toast with a side of bacon. The bacon was thickly cut and crisp. The French Toast had brie, pecans, bananas, and banana liquor. It was SO yummy and filling. I hardly had half before I was happily distended.M had the BLT with a side of hasbrowns. She commented that she didn't like the shredded lettuce, but that she enjoyed everything else, including the freshly shredded potatoes in the hashbrowns.The service was great. At least three servers came by and offered to top off M's coffee. The only problem with the service is the long wait for the check once they got busy. We resolved that by going to the bar and paying ourselves.Did you catch that? Yes. They have a stocked bar. So Bloody Mary and Mimosa lovers can whet their whistles."
"Still five stars. Great service. I'm writing this update because I happened to walk in today. An older gentleman walked in alone- he must be a regular. It wasn't very busy, but the staff took time out to sit and talk with him. They were so kind and friendly. I don't know this man, but I imagine it could mean a lot to a person to have someone sit and listen attentively. It left such an impression on me. The food was- as always- amazing. And the people who work here- they are the best! (I also recommended this place to my friend's parents who were in town last week. They loved it! I recommend this place to everyone.)"
"Cannot say enough about this GEM. . HAD A PARTY FOR 22 and everyone was in Wow..  The staff is like family.  We miss them all when we are not here.. All those that were there will be back, for sure"
"We ate breakfast here and enjoyed the experience. Food was nicely prepared and tasty. We tried oatmeal, the breakfast sandwich and omelettes. All got a thumbs up! Attentive, pleasant service. Restaurant situated in a historic building with wooden tables and seats, and pleasant decor. Would not hesitate to visit again for breakfast."
"I've been to this place for brunch and dinner.it's very convenient to my house I wish it were open later.They have an amazing menu with fondue, cheesy tots and goat cheese.They have an assortment of sandwiches.and after 5pm they have chicken and pasta entrees and PizzasYou can also get breakfast at any time. BRUNCH is off the chain.they have so many great things. There wasn't a wait either which was nice. Amazing omeletsI got the STUFFED FRENCH TOAST!and it was delicious. too much almost."
"The 3rd Coast is one of my favorite neighborhood spots. It's a bit unassuming and I walked right past it many times before noticing it was there, but boy am I glad I finally did. The food is really good and very reasonably priced . Some of my favorites items on the menu include the crispy potatoes, all of the salads are great, and the dutch club is heavenly.Since breakfast is served all day, a few nights ago  tried the raspberry and the blueberry scones and they were super! Like Ahnold, I'll be back."
"I went here with 4 friends and shared a quaint booth in the cozy setting - you can feel the vibes of the antique atmosphere, but it is clean and properly updated inside. Now let's get to the important part.. the FOOD. Oh my gosh YUM! Everything was memorable and delicious, even down to the complimentary parmesan/pepper crackers. I had the NY strip steak and chose brussel sprouts (best I have ever had) and pan-fried potatoes (perfectly cooked). All fo the appetizers were great and everyone loved their meals (fajitas, burgers, sandwiches). You get a ton of food for a GREAT and very reasonable price, especially considering the central location. Loved it - would return in a heartbeat! Visited April 2013"
"The 3rd Coast is not short on charm -- the place is delightfully anti-trendy, resembling a cafe you might find in a small town train station, or the lobby of a Comfort Inn. It's so not cool that it's cool. It's a wine bar that also serves breakfast all day and has muffins in saran wrap in a glass display case. You can get a side of blueberry pancake with your burger. I can't say I've really ever been any place like it.The food is better than you would think based on the decor. The New Orleans burger I ordered was juicy and cooked rare, as I requested. Kudos for not overcooking that thin-ish patty, grill guy! Pretzel bun = genius. The Diablos beef sandwich is also great. The breakfast platters are massive.The wine list is perhaps not expansive or interesting enough to earn the title of wine bar. It's probably partially a marketing thing, to establish that they're not just a breakfast joint. The vibe inside is definitely more diner than wine bar.The servers are very chill and super friendly. They actually seem happy to be there, or at least not counting the minutes till they get to leave. Women, you have to use the ladies' room. It contains the most flattering full-length mirror in all of Chicago, I kid you not."
Veggie hash from 3rd Coast is good & greasy. The waitresses & waiters are all so nice here. You don't ever have to ask for a refill on your coffee because they intuitively know to refill when it's almost empty. That's a plus in my book ;)
"This was easily the worst meal I've ever paid for. Simply put, it's a restaurant you'd see on the ""before"" section of a Gordon Ramsay show. Seriously, just save yourself the cash and hassle, and go anywhere else.This is not a wine bar. To suggest otherwise is insulting. Of the 5 white wines on the menu by the glass, they didn't have one and couldn't suggest a replacement. Because there are wines on a menu does not make it wine bar.The decor is as sloppy as the food and hints at the detail they put into the whole operation. I went there for a Restaurant Week 3-course meal. The waitress didn't know or understand the menu. The artichoke bruschetta topping came from a can and the halved baguette it was on wasn't even toasted. And it was on a baguette. And it was bland and awful. But before we could have the second bite, the salad came out. And then we waited 40 mins for the entrees, which we didn't bother finishing. I got the wrong side, my wife didn't get a side, and they both were just flopped on the plate.It was ridiculously, hilariously awful from beginning to end. Easily the worst $80 ever spent on a nice evening out."
"Always a great place to relax and have some great food. It isn't expensive and has a really extensive range of types of food. If you're looking for a place to take friends, this is a great place. If you're also a wine lover, they have a really impressive selection of wines, none are bad and good prices.I had the salmon tonight. It was simple, delicious, fresh and a good price. I come here all the time. I think you'll love it.Try:Diablo tacosSalmonBloody MaryAny of the soupsWinesAmazing crumpetsCome for brunch"
"There are so many new and fabulous brunch places opening every weekend, that I'm concerned for the Gold Coast's oldest cafe. In fact, I'm pretty sure a handful opened in the 45 minutes it took between ordering our eggs and them actually arriving.I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a wait for a table for two at 11AM on a Sunday. My out-of-towner friend and I came looking for eggs and bottomless coffee and weren't disappointed. However, we weren't wowed. I'm a fan of the innovative ""classic"" brunch--that means fruity pancake flights,  potato ""hashes,"" modern European pastries I've never heard of, etc. The sweet options on the menu seemed pretty classic and safe, although I was intrigued by the brie and banana liquor stuffed french toast. The savory options seemed more adventurous, although there were a variety of pretty standard omelet options. I chose the Lox Eggs Benedict which replaces hollandaise sauce with Salsa verde. I enjoyed the dish, but the salsa verde pretty much over-powered the lox. My friend ordered the veggie hash and was pleased with the variety and quantity of the vegetables.I love bragging about Chicago brunches to visitors and promising an unforgettable dining experience. At the end of the meal, my out-of-towner mentioned the fabulous bruch she had LAST TIME she visited. Taking her to a Chicago relic seemed like a good angle for a visitor, but history doesn't excuse a ridiculously long wait for the food, lackluster dishes, and a rather musty decor.Come into the 20th-Century Third Coast!"
"Almost there. The food was OK, service was good. I had the lox and salsa verde benedict, it was OK, not sure what it was missing but it didn't blow me away, plus I was starving. Booze selection is limited. And as usual Chicago doesn't know a thing about the Bloody Mary. The cheese and olive is nice, but noone in this freaking city puts Worchester in their bloodies??? WTH? A bloody mary basic needs:Worchester or steak sauce, splash brine (usually from pickle juice), splash beer (preferrably dark like a stout), celery salt, hot sauce, lemon/lime pre squeezed,pepper! Shaken and then poured, and with a beer chaser coming standard! Chicago only puts tomato juice with vokda and hot sauce, sick!!! You are so close to Wisconsin and you can't get creative? We even do rosemary infused bloody mary mixes! Not the worst though."
"Went there for breakfast today. It's a cute place that was pretty full, so I thought we were in for a real treat. The service was prompt and friendly, and we were seated right away.My boyfriend and I shared the Salmon Benedict and Stuffed French Toast. French toast was pretty good- we got it without the whipped cream. The benedict was ehh, nothing anywhere near special. It comes with salsa verde (random?), which was spicy so we had it with the traditional hollandaise sauce, which was pretty tasteless. Both meals were cold.Definitely nothing special. I want to go back for lunch/dinner because of the reviews but not again for breakfast."
"My aunt was staying at The Indigo Hotel literally three doors away so we popped in here for some dessert and hot chocolate on a cold night. The three stars isn't for the quality of the food, the food was outstanding. The apple pie a la mode was outstanding and the ice cream was amazing. The hot chocolate were also quite decadent and delicious. The problem was the service. They told us to sit wherever we liked and menus were brought to us right away but that's where the problems started. No one came to take our orders. I eventually went up to the counter to place our order. Then the check never came so we left money up at the counter. I'll be back to try breakfast but I hope the attentiveness of the service improves. This place is outstanding and I see a lot of potential."
Best brunch in the neighborhood.  I recommend the eggs benedict with avocado. Less pretentious than many of the local Gold Coast brunch spots.One of my favorite neighborhood hangouts for happy hour/a lite dinner. Reasonably priced with great drink specials. Low-key; a great place to catch up with girlfriends or for a quiet date night. The dinner menu is not quite as broad but the specials always brighten up the menu. Try the cheese plate. -1 star because they always seem to be a little bit understaffed.
"This place is divine. My boyfriend and I had breakfast here, and it was amazing. The only downside of it is lack of space. The tables are so close together and you can eavesdrop on neighboring conversations. The portions are too generous, but that's fine by me. I ordered over had eggs with bacon and hash browns. I chose the toast as my side. The coffee was really good that I actually had a second cup. My boyfriend ordered one of their omelets, and it was huge, but he enjoyed it. My dish was delicious! The eggs were cooked to my liking, although there was a part of it that was a bit yolky. The hash browns were amazing. The bacon was actually the best part of the meal. They were like bacon on steroids: thicker than average and probably 5x unhealthy, but I ate them all. Because it gets so crowded, the waiters/waitresses can't keep track of who needs refills on water, coffee, etc, so you'll have to flag on of them down if you need something. Overall, a good experience and great breakfast foods."
"Discovered this place on a trip to Chicago many years ago and it still hasgreat food, atmosphere, and most importantly good service. It's menu is varied with both American and European selections and the prices are quite reasonable. When in Chicago, my wife and I both find it a welcome stop both for breakfast and for dinner after a busy day. The food quality and service has not declined in the slightest over the past 10 years-something most restaurants can't claim."
"The scoop:Plus - great coffeeMinus - everything else!!!!I came here three times  to make sure that I wasn't missing something since this place got pretty good reviews on yelp, but on all occasions I found my brunch experience terribly disappointing. My most recent visit was just flat-out horrible in all aspects, except for the coffee. I ordered the eggs benedict (what can go wrong with a classic benny, right?) with hash browns. The yolks were somewhat overcooked, but I can forgive this since the bearnaise sauce compensated for the lack of yummy, runny yolk. My hash browns, however, were just too overcooked and oily. It seemed like it was left on a deep fryer for too long of a time and turned into pomme frittes. I'll upload a pic shortly showing the napkin, which soaked all the oil, and remnants  of the pomme-frittes-like hash browns. I told the waitress about this, and she responded by schooling me on how has browns are supposed to be crispy. The great service doesn't stop here. They'll reward your patronage by teaching you in the art of patience since you'll be waiting ages for coffee refills. At the end of the meal, your server will most likely ask you if you'd like a refill on a cup that has been left empty since the beginning of your meal. Classic!Come here if you feel like getting schooled on how hash browns should taste like by your server or if you like chowing on greasy pomme frittes disguised as hash browns."
"3rd Coast Cafe and Wine Bar. WINE BAR? I think not. And that's too bad because I was looking for a wine bar last night in this neighborhood. We walked in and while there were wine bottles displayed around the place and a list that had wines on it (thus a wine list) . . .the 3rd Coast is by no means a wine bar. There were not even any ""nibbles"" on the menu that would lead me to believe that they could be snacked on while enjoying a glass of wine. And the ambiance is more coffee shop esque than wine bar. Now what it is, is a neighborhood restaurant that serves breakfast all day and has a variety of sandwiches on the menu to eat in their comfy, if a bit dated dining room. The burger and the turkey/brie sandwich ended up being our choices, but we had a beer along side them, not our much craved wine and cheese. But the food was good, at least. The staff was certainly pleasant. In fact, I think they even felt bad that they could not deliver on the wine bar part of their name. Parking in this neighborhood is a hassle. My suggestion? Bite the bullet and park in the very expensive parking garage located just south of the restaurant. They will validate your ticket at the restaurant so you only pay $10 instead of the $18.50 they take for the first 30 minutes. All in all- I think this was an expectation problem. I was expecting a wine bar given their name and the Yelp classification. What I got was a turkey sandwich in a neighborhood place surrounded by screaming kids and people pecking away on their computers. Oh well- if I go again, I will lower my expectations!"
"A little hidden gem. Tucked away from the hustle of Division it is a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat. As I am seeing a theme in my postings, this is another card in the back pocket brunch spots. Everyone can find something that they would want to eat and it is always delicious. I love that I can be a total glutton by eating french toast stuffed with brie and nuts or the BLT, but I can be more health conscious too if so inclined (rarely).  The bloody marys are nothing special, but if that is the worst of my issues with this place or the biggest issue I deal with on a Sunday, I think life is pretty good."
"i remembered the french toast and bacon with fondness.. i had them sometime in 2004. thank heavens the menu hasn't changed. if it ain't broke, don't fix it.so here we are in 2012.. i returned to the 3rd coast and happily ordered the texas cut french toast [$7.25] and a side of thick cut bacon [$3] - not an inexpensive breakfast, but it is so good that as long as we're both around, i will return to the 3rd coast each time i return to chicago."
"Looks like Vienna, serves like Paris, smells like breakfast all day long. Bloody mary could use a stepped-up game (one really hopes that isn't just Mrs. T's), but the hash browns give Ohio House of blessed memory a real run for it."
"Best scone experience in the country, same as it was 20 years ago.  Thanks 3rd Coast for not changing the recipe!"
"I live across the street from here and it's a great place to have in the neighborhood.  What don't they do?!  You can come here for coffee.  You can come here for drinks.  But my favorite is to come here for brunch.  They knock it out of the park!  The Veggie Hash is a favorite.  But the prices are reasonable, and it has a nice neighborhood feel.  Nothing fancy, but you don't go here looking for something fancy!"
"I have yet to have a bad experience at an Italian-ish eatery, but I was very happy here.I had the angel hair pasta with meatballs, and shared the Waldorf salad (with walnuts).Both were very good. Meatballs were very soft (a little more than I like, I like some texture), and no complaints on the salad. Nice and tangy. Our waiter was very nice and patient with my giant and loud group. We had the moscato, which was very sweet and delicious.Prices were not bad at all. I expected it to be more. The ambiance is dim and romantic."
"In short: great food, even better atmosphere, and reasonable prices.I've been here a few times, for both brunch and dinner. I honestly didn't feel like there was anything that special about the brunch. It was good food, nothing wrong with it, but I don't live in the neighborhood, so I'm unlikely to trek down unless I'm meeting my buddies that live next door. Dinner is really good, though. They have a menu that ""changes,"" but I came two times, about a month apart, and the menu was the same, so I'm not really sure if it actually changes. They have sandwiches and appetizers that they have every day, and then they also have a ""specials"" menu. The first time, I had the Jamaican Chicken Curry. It was really filling, and the flavor was a little weird- not the typical Jerk flavor I expect; it wasn't bad, just different, so if you're looking for actual Jamaican chicken, this probably isn't it. The second time, I got the mediterranean salad and vegetable soup and my friend got the grilled cheese. Everything was really really good. I know it's hard to mess up a salad, but it gets done way too often, and this salad was huge, perfectly proportioned, not drenched in dressing, and really tasty and filling. The vegetable soup was chock full of vegetables. The chicken peanut soup is also really good if you like peanut sauce- it basically tastes like a liquidier peanut sauce. Overall, I'd give the food a 3.5 stars overall, because the menu is a little hit or miss (I guess you just need to figure out which items you like), but I definitely round up for the atmosphere and service. This is such a cute little wine bar, no tourists, and the servers are so friendly. There are also always people studying in the upstairs area, which seems more suited for hanging out than meeting people, so if you're looking for a place to study and drink wine, this might be it."
"Espresso? Yes, please. From the coffee to the eggs, this neighborhood corner joint delivers. The food is top notch and doesn't ask for accolades but deserves them.  I would enjoy it much more if the lights were softer. My only recommendation otherwise please don""t change a thing."
"On one particular Tuesday, I found the perfect unpacking procrastination method: attend a Chicago Spanish Language Meetup event.  My decision making process went something like this: Wine bar with Spanish wines + new friends + not unpacking = Happy Dana.The restaurant itself is has a coffee shop ambiance, but don't be fooled: the menu features substantial soups, salads, and main courses, beer, and wine if you've had enough caffeine.The service was friendly, quick, and our server had a photographic memory.  There was quite a big group of us yet he remembered that I was drinking a young (and not too tanin-y) Rioja which made refills a breeze!"
"It was quite the gem, their coffee is AMAZING the food was wonderful as well, perfect for a rainy Chicago day"
awesome little hidden Jem. This place was awesome for drinks and a quick bite!
One of my fave places for a cafe au lait in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening!!!!! Cant wait to get back to Chicago this April 2013 for a quick weekend to catch up w/friends and family. This will be one of my stops!
"Really cramped, service unfriendly, food average."
"Love this place.  Cozy, busy, great food, fun people.  Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but otherwise, it's my ""go-to""spot for brunch.  Lots of choices, and the coffee is delicious.  Full bar as well, with some creative drinks.  The wine there is also excellent, and it's a very chill vibe at night.  Hidden gem in the Gold Coast!  The food is fresh, and the portion sizes are very appropriate.  The breakfast sandwhich is amazing, as is virtually every omelette.  Check it out, you'll be happy!"
"Hidden gem, great for dates. I lived in the building and became addicted to their Caesar salad. When I talked to my neighbors they all agreed it's addicting. It has become a bit pricey for a salad but the portions are generous. I have introduced many friends and family to 3rd Coast and all rave reviews. Also a great place to relax and read the paper, people watch, or they often have live music. I really appreciate there is no pressure to chow down and rush out."
"I stopped by the Third Coast on a Friday afternoon around lunchtime to get some writing done. I asked the waiter if I could stay for a few hours to work, and he was very kind and obliging about it. The ambiance is casual vintage with an old-school charm, a very nice place to read, have a glass of wine or espresso, or meet a friend for a casual lunch. I order a bowl of the split pea and ham soup, and it was delicious (and reasonable at $4.75). The prices for the other lunch items (sandwiches and salads) seemed a little high, between $10 and $13. I worked at the cafe for several hours, and it was a perfect setup. A cafe I won't soon forget!"
"I just fell in love with The 3rd Coast on my most recent Chicago trip.  It's a cute little place, and I was able to walk there from Hotel Indigo.  I was by myself that night, but didn't feel awkward dining alone.  This place was cool as a cucumber.  The staff was cool (thanks, cute waiter, for that ""extra"" pour of sangria), the music piped in was cool, and the decor was cool.  I ordered the turkey brie sandwich on wheat bread with fresh fruit.  The brie was melted just right over the turkey; it didn't separate at all.  The toast was buttered, which I appreciated from a tastebud perspective (not a waistline perspective). They were serving sangria as a special.  It was a carafe of tasty sangria (not too sweet) poured over a glass of diced fresh fruit.  I liked that the fruit was fresh, as a lot of places keep it in the sangria and it gets soggy.So, The 3rd Coast got me a little tipsy and made me fall in love with it.  I will return on future visits to Chicago.  Since it's open from 7am to midnight, I can go for any meal!"
"Great food, excellent service. I'm in Chicago just for the day, and chose to have breakfast at The 3rd Coast. The Veggie Hash was delicious. The coffee is strong and good. Kelsey seemed genuinely happy to be there and provided excellent service."
"The 3rd Coast is...1/3 coffee shop1/3 family diner1/3 creative escapeIt's also 100% old-school Chicago.  And, there's not many of these great undercover spots left in the city.  It's authentic, quiet and creative.My fondest memories at The 3rd Coast are catching up with old friends over Sunday brunch or sitting at a corner table all alone - trying to break my writers block and jot down something inspiring over a hot cup of coffee.Check it out.  You won't be disappointed."
"Went for a group meal with some friends and family. Pretty tasty food, with a nice wine selection.I got the Cajun Chicken Penneyelp.com/biz_photos/7mCe…and had it at spicy. Not that spicy or cajuny for this southern californian, but i guess since it was supposed to be more of an alfredo sauce, it was still good. I had a cup of gazpacho soup as the appetizer and it was delicious. My wife got the ravioli, which might have been one of the day's specials, yelp.com/biz_photos/7mCe…and while it was good, it was, like most ravioli plates, just not quite filling.One of my friends got a skirt steak i think, but only thought it ok.Our service was great - answering our questions and getting our food and drinks in a timely manner.  We happened to be sitting next to a growing table of a local spanish club, so got to overhear a group practicing spanish through the whole meal. The only odd thing was that a woman came in and tried to get us to sign a petition to get a candidate on the ballot. Alas for her, 2/3 of us were from out of state. This seemed a bit odd that the restaurant would allow someone to pester the diners. While I'm supportive of the democratic process, hitting up people while they are eating at a restaurant isn't cool.Good food, nice wine, and a nice upscale neighborhood place to walk over to."
"This is more of a neighborhood place than a brunch experience. The food is good, but really it's just diner quality with a cute atmosphere and good location. There is nothing terribly creative on the menu; standard omelets and french toast, etc. The veggie hash was good, but too greasy. Service was excellent and it's open very early (7am I think). I got there around 8:10am and had no wait. After a long, lingering breakfast with some old friends, we noticed quite a long line by the time we left at 10am. I don't know that it's worth the wait though."
"If I could go less than a star I would. This might be the worst restaurant in the world since Hawkeye's on Taylor Street.I expect decent service. I have come to realize that exceptional service is rare - so I will settle for decent. The service here sucks so hard it isn't even funny. The women that work there are very easy on the eyes and the other two on shift that night - seem to be hustling. One of them even came over to greet us when we looked lost. We looked lost because our girl was no where to be seen.I ordered the cilantro bean soup. It taste like cigarettes in toilet water. People I am not tough to please - but cilantro bean soup should have some cilantro in it.The ""waitress"" came by and saw a full cup of soup and asked ""How was it?"" I replied, ""It wasn't very good."" She smiled and walked away. Then she came out with the sandwich; the el diablo.  I was ready to be blown away. A beef sandwich named after the devil has to be something.  What it was was sparse and bland. It had as much flavor as the table.They brought something called potatoes O'Brien. In theory  cubes potato - green peppers - onions fried WOW! Right? Raw potato and greasy peppers.  No waitress. The busboy - who was serving our drinks and taking care of us - took the plate back to the kitchen to have them actually cook the potatoes. She looked at him - looked at me and smiled. BUT SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! He brought it back out - by then the scrimpy devil sandwich was a culinary memory. The potato experience was just chalky.She smiled once more as she dropped the check - she was like a Stepford Waitress except that she had less personality.I have heard they have a good brunch. I will never return to find out.It is simply too big a city."
Excellent eggs benedict!!!
"Surprisingly good food for this hidden spot, and no wait.  Tried the BLT, hash browns, and blueberry scone.  BLT and scone were pretty exceptional; hash browns were alright."
The 3rd Coast is not just a great place to eat super food at reasonable cost. It really is far more than that for myself and family...it is a place of comfort and ease with a welcoming soothing atmosphere where you know you will be cared for...not just fed. It is a nearly hidden jewel in a great big often cold and windy city. Thanks Janet for all that you do to make this happen. The San Diego Crew
"Went here with a friend after work last night. I had not been here in awhile. I got the turkey club and he got the 3rd burger. My club was really good (actually, it was delicious) and the burger was pretty standard.....not amazing, but not bad either. We ordered the goat cheese fondue as an appetizer, and it seemed a little bland....but it definitely tasted like goat cheese so I guess we got what we ordered....I would order it again.I had not been here in awhile, but the service was WAY better than I remember it. Kudos to everyone who worked on Wednesday night, 3/28/12.Goat cheese fondue, burger, turkey club, three glasses of wine and three bottles of Stella = $76 + tip. Rediscovering a quiet, non-obnoxious place to eat in my neighborhood = priceless."
"Honestly, this place is average.  Not terrible, but definitely not stellar.  I must say I was very pleased with the way my over-easy eggs were prepared (it's rare to get them cooked so well in a restaurant - I'm very picky about my eggs).  Sadly, my husband's scrambled eggs were not so good - runny, and we both had nearly burnt toast.However, the staff is pleasant and prompt and obliging.  We were on the run that morning and they accommodated us very nicely. The place itself is cute, but I'd struggle to recommend it based on the food."
"By far one of the BEST places to eat in the city.  Not only is the food superb (Best Italian beef I've ever had), but they also make great coffee and alcoholic drinks.Some of my must have items on the menu:-Diablo's Beef-Diablo's Tacos-Chinese Noodle Soup-Cajun Chicken Penne-Stuffed French Toast-Lynchberg Lemonade -Chai Tea Latte-Hot ChocolateNot to mention some of the best coffee and service."
"Wow, I'm surprised this place gets such good reviews. I was super excited to brunch here after doing a little yelping. Got there at 11 am on a Sunday and there was only a 10 minute wait for 3 people, so far, AMAZING! Sat down, it was about 5 minutes before we were given our menus and another 5 for water and to take our drink order. 15 minutes after that we got our drinks and ordered (iced coffee and iced tea). 30 minutes later and our starving bellies were served. The waitress mentioned that the BEST thing on the menu were the benedicts, hello! Being my favorite brunch item I of course ordered it. The BF got the italian omelette (my second choice, score!) and our friend ordered the huevos rancheros. This was one of the most sub-par, bleh benny's i've ever had. The english muffin, ham, and egg were fine but that was one of the worst hollandaise sauces I've ever tasted. I'm not sure what they did to it but it was gloppy and stale. There was no hit of buttery rich eggy goodness. The hashbrowns were good but couldn't make up for the benny. The italian omelette was ok but I could make better at home. Overall the combination of SLOW service + mediocre food = Meh. I've experienced better. I will not be going back for brunch."
"Hands down my faovrite Gold Coast neigborhood spot for breakfast and brunch, they also serve great dinner! Cozy and laid back atmosphere and friendly service are guaranteed."
"Ok so re-reading that review I realized I was uber-excited! But with every reason as this place seriously does no wrong.  The carry-out was great--the food was just as good as eating it there--and I ordered a cappuccino while waiting on my take-out and whomever the barista was at the time was HILARIOUS and seriously made a production of what appeared to be a craft of his (making coffee drinks).  The staff is seriously friendly and make you feel right at home...the owner, Janet is a delight and super nice! They hooked me up with an entire Apple Pie to take to a Thanksgiving dinner...and well...it was a SMASH! Everyone wanted a piece (and more..but you know I had to sneak an extra piece for myself to take back home) the pie alone just gained this place about 6 more customers!  Never walk out those doors without trying the Apple Pie (and ice cream). Now I hear the sausage and carrot soup is delectable and will be notified when they serve it again...I will be sure to let all my fans know when so you too can get a bowl :)"
"This place is warm and comfy and when you combine that with the comfort breakfast foods on the menu, its no wonder why it is my go to brunch place in the city. Their portions are sizeable and the prices are reasonable. I always get the breakfast sandwich with hash browns on the side. Delicious."
"The best part about my meal at The 3rd Coast was the conversation at the table. My friend told me how he had just flown a WWII plane the weekend prior. He had a blast. AWESOME! Unfortunately,The 3rd Coast was a big crash and burn.Went here for brunch on the basis of a lot of the great Yelp reviews and was severely disappointed. I'll start with the positives because they're quick...The physical restaurant is pretty cool. It's old school. Also, we only waited about 10 minutes on a Sunday at 11a. Nice. However, I think I know why the wait isn't longer...Once we were seated it took 5-10 minutes for a server to come by...that was just to give us menus. Another 5 minutes later and we ordered our (cold) drinks which took 10 minutes to arrive. THEN we ordered food.There were three of us and none of us were impressed by the food in any way. I had the Italian Omelet. It sounds interesting and tastes like nothing at all. The other dishes at the table were Eggs Benny and Huevos Rancheros. ""Gross"" was actually thrown around when describing some of the food.It's a very rare day when I eat somewhere and know that I can make better food...but that's what happened on Sunday.It was pretty unfortunate considering how welcoming the place seemed when we got there. Ah well. As a famous poet once said...On to the next one!"
"Love this place! The food is really good, but I take 1-star off for customer service.  I'be been here about 5 times, and 2 of the times we had less-than-stellar service from our waiter/waitress.Most of the time the service is good though, and even when it's not the best...the food is still good.  You can tell they really are making the food there- not just re-heating something frozen.  So it takes a little longer to get your food, but it's a nice quiet atmosphere that you can't help but enjoy relaxing while you wait for your food.Breakfast ALL DAY...yum. Scones and pancakes are both fabulous.  Lots of people there reading the paper, or working on assignments because it's nice and quiet."
"Damn good texas cut french toast with bacon.The bacon was actually cooked the way I like it, thick slices & crispy yet not hard.The 2 dudes working the counter were cool and chit chatting about the NCAA brackets.Very homely feel and I wish we'd discovered this before the last day we were in town.Everyone in The Chi should try this spot, it's really good.Heard their stuffed french toast (only avail on weekends) is the bomb diggy!All the way from Cali, I approve!"
"Okay, okay, okay....................True confessions here.....Last week we were staying at the Indigo Hotel, just a stone's throw from this place and my partner and I spent almost the whole day at this lovely venue.  We started with a mid-afternoon drink/cup of soup/dessert, and we just.....stayed.  Just like the two guys that were playing chess, or the elderly family of four who all had iPads to fiddle with, we stayed, it was comfortable there  My husband and I hadn't seen each other for 3 days so we talked a bit and made plans.  That night we were to take our son and his wife out for dinner,  well, why not stay here and call them to join us?The menu is casual but very tasty.  The beautiful homemade cracker that they start you with was unexpected, and soooooo herby and savory, I wanted to take some home with me.  We had burgers,  great salad and soup and my husband had their homemade key lime pie....twice!And kudos to their servers, thank you so much for letting us camp out at your restaurant, and never once making us feel rushed or over staying our welcome.  I only hoped I tipped enough!"
"Comfy, casual ambiance. Quality food and decent wine list.  Helpful staff."
The food was nice and quickly served.
"Years ago, when their was a residence for women on this block of Dearborn, I used to come here many times a week. Years later, I come in whenever I am in town. Brunch here in a Sunday morning is great. The veggie hash and the omelettes are delicious and the marinara sauce on the side is tasty. Scones come hewed up with a fat pat of butter is divine. There are other places around the are more corporate but the food here and the service are warm and neighborly. Try the  3rd Coast for breakfast or brunch."
"The phrase ""wine bar"" makes me think of a pretentious, expensive place with snobby staff.  Thankfully, The 3rd Coast has none of that, which is a good thing.Most times I've been here for breakfast, and have always enjoyed it.  For a wine bar, their Mexican entrees are incredible!  I recommend the chilaquiles, or, if you need a little more substance, the skirt steak and eggs (which comes with tortillas, pico, avocado - it's all delicious).  The coffee is fantastic, both drip and espresso.While moving out of Chicago I stayed at the hotel next door and finally had an excuse to try the dinner menu here.  Once again, despite being a wine bar/coffee shop, I had another excellent Tex-Mex meal and tried the steak fajitas, with a bottle of Pacifico on the side.  (Good stuff.)  I was pretty impressed with their selections of beer, and the drinks list does a great job describing each one, so it's hard to make an uninformed choice.There's no air conditioning, at least on the summer evening I went there, so if you are a bit delicate you might want to sit by the windows.  The waitstaff has always been friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is definitely cozy, but in a good way - not a lot of noise, great for having conversations.  If you're looking for a place to have an intimate breakfast with one friend, or five, this is a good spot."
"This place was great!We were on vacation in Chicago after coming from Madison and NW Wisconsin, and we were very tired of having typical WI breakfast of eggs and toast made in a bar/diner. It seems really popular, but they were able to seat us after a reasonable waiting period in the main room. All the waiters/waitresses/busboys there seem to be all working super hard because it is so packed! We had some AM drinks which were very good and full of healthy booze. I had the veggie hash and it was AWESOME! Broccoli and hash browns, soo good together. There were some bell peppers and other veggies thrown in there too, so very YUM. It was also served with two eggs and some really yummy marble rye; i think I could have also chosen wheat or sourdough, etc. If you live in Chicago, or you are just visiting, I would def recommend coming here."
Great little romantic spot.
not as fancy as people said
"Just not that good. I ordered the veggie hash and while it was filling, it tasted bland and over-seasoned with dried herbs. Convenient for the locals but not worth a trip."
"two words: veggie hash.  Amazing!  I can't even begin to say how awesome the veggie hash is.  It was served with a side of eggs and toast, which I didn't touch because I loved the veggie hash.  I think I may have dreams about the veggie hash.  I will be back.The atmosphere is perfect for a brunch.  No wait.  Alcohol to be had (if you have an id, i left mine in the car... darn).  Low key neighborhood restaurant feel.  I felt as if I was in someone's basement/house.  I really can't rave enough about the veggie hash.  It was so good.  I think next time I may just ask for a plate of that."
"i love this place. i'm generally not a breakfast person, so i usually get the smoked salmon sandwich with a salad. it's delicious!if you're looking for a nice quiet place, on the weekdays this is your spot. if you're looking for a typical chicago breakfast place that's completely packed and noisy, this is your spot on the weekends. (i avoid 3rd coast on the weekends.)"
"I suggested that a fellow Yelper and I hit up brunch on Sunday. I wanted to find somewhere near both of us in case getting out of bed that morning was a challenge. Fortunately, it was not. As I walked up, I realized I had actually been here for dinner once - and I wasn't too much of a fan. I remember the food being unseasoned and it being empty, but this was months ago. Maybe it was perhaps who I was with? End flashback. Brunch was great! I had the veggie hash as someone else had suggested it and I really enjoyed it. I like my potatoes crispy - because really, who likes soggy hash brown texture? The server looked at my funny but the majority of my potatoes ended up crispy when they came out on the plate. You should be hungry when you get here because they give you generous additions to your main plate - like two slices of toast and two eggs. I would come here again for brunch - maybe not dinner. It helps that this place is a no tourist zone - which can be hard to come by when you live where we live."
"At The 3rd Coast Cafe, better-than-average diner fare awaits your empty stomach.  I will have to save a longer review for a more indulgent experience, but from the standard items I did order, I can say that I was pleased.  It was a nice choice to have gazpacho on the soup list, although it wasn't very exciting.  My soup accompanied a veggie sandwich and I was so happy that they offered something vegan by nature, offering hummus as the main spread in place of the usual mayo, or for you fancy types, some rendition of aioli.  It may not have been something to write home about, but again, I'll save my longer review for a more thorough investigation of their menu.Service was above average and overall friendly.  I'll make it a point to stop here again the next time I'm in the Gold Coast and need a quick bite.OH - I almost forgot!  It says ""no cell phones"" on the menu, as a courtesy to other guests, I believe.  That's a noble pursuit... I didn't happen to notice if there were any violators present.  I'll check that out next time, too."
"(3.5)I went to the 3rd Coast last night for a quiet dinner, and I got it. It's pretty well hidden on a residential block, lower level. It has a diner feel, but a pretty good (and reasonable) beer/wine list.I was looking forward to seeing the featured artist's work, but there was nothing but blank walls with ""more artwork up on Friday"". I had the ""Dutch club"" and a Caesar salad with a Victory Golden Monkey followed by a Lagunitas Lil Sumpin Ale (on special)....my date had the cajun chicken penne with a house salad and a Metropolitain Krankshaft. The food was good. Nothing blew me away, though. The service was also ""ok"". I had to TRY to get my waitress' attention 3 times to get another beer and a water refill. The bus boys were good about taking plates but left the empty beer bottles(?)They played great music throughout my whole dinner, though I have to say.If it were in my neighborhood, I'd be there a lot more often. I think it is a nice little cafe type place......but not a ""destination""."
"3rd Coast was one of our go-to brunch destinations for almost a year (before being un-imported back to the D).  Most of the staff is very friendly (the bald gentleman is hit or miss) and the wait is never more than 15-20 minutes (almost every time we've gone on a Sunday we have not waited).  My default was the steel-cut oatmeal, toast, and a cappuccino.  The Oatmeal is quite good; I prefer with bananas & brown sugar, but they also have berries and raisins as options too.  The toast and cappuccino are pleasant to very pleasant.  I do appreciate their consistency with my usual items; I know what to expect and that's a good thing.Everything else we have tried here has all been lovely.  I do, however, wish there were maybe just a few more items on ze menu.  It's not bare, by any means, but is not imaginative or exciting by any means.  A great little place that tourists generally know not of with a short wait, good food, friendly staff, an ever-changing art repertoire (with all pieces for sale by local artists), and a nice, cozy atmosphere.3rd Coast FTW."
Exactly what I was looking for. A straight up simple and tasty breakfast 80' from my hotel. Very good staff.
"I have had breakfast and dinner several times here in the past two years, and last night enjoyed the extra bonus of the Lovely and beautiful Gayle Ritt performing her soulful music! As usual, the food was great and the atmosphere warm and pleasant. I had the mushroom-filled pasta paired with sauteed spinach, which was nicely infused with garlic!During Gayle's break, I was inspired to create a drink while observing a gal in an orange dress...a White Russian with Stoli Oranj. Not bad, huh? Well, then while I'm sipping it, she sits across my table to watch Gayle and introduces herself...turns out she is one of the owners. What a fantastic woman! It was very interesting learning about the history of her establishment, and it impressed me how much she puts her heart into her endeavors!Fantastic evening all around...it IS all about LOVE!"
"This is long overdue... but I guarantee that nothing has changed between my dinner at 3rd Coast and this review.  Progressive + Trendy are two words NOT affiliated with this joint.  Warm + Cozy + Odd {in a good way} would better explain this vintage-y little spot.  Things to love ::*Historic location + quiet ""off the beaten Gold Coast path"" location*You feel like you walked into a Denny's but then you realize it's 1000x better.*Pretty damn good food - it's usually frightening to see fancy schmancy small plates {think chevrine cheese fondue}, chopped salads, burgers, sammies, organic rib-eye, chicken marsala and breakfast-served-all-day listed on the same menu... but they pull it off with class, sans diner grease.  Heck, with a table full of two vegetarians + one picky eater + a man that will eat anything... it was easy to find something for everyone.  Thumbs up. Things that make you go hmm...*Wine bar?  Really??  I think that's a little misleading.  Don't get me wrong, these waiters know their wine.  But a comprehensive wine list and knowledgeable servers do not make a wine bar.  Especially when you have a full bar of top shelf liquor, PBR, and a complete espresso get-up that could put some corner coffee shops to shame.  Things that make you want to come back for more ::*Adorable Orlando-Bloom-esque servers.  Okay, okay, so our Southeastern European waiter from Montenegro was easy on the eyes... but he was also just really good at his job!  Loved his unsolicited wine recommendations {""I think you should get this one instead... it's the same price, but it's so much better""}, his ability to not bat an eye when I asked for hot sauce with my salad, and the fact that when he came by to refill our water, he asked, ""Do you guys want a shot?""  And then he proceeded to concoct a round of shooters he'd been whipping up for the past couple of days.  If there is ever a place that's perfect for geriatric couples + midweek GNOs + low-key date nights, then it's 3rd Coast.  There's something for everyone."
I love the atmosphere at this neighborhood cafe.  The coffee is great.  You can sit and read  as long as you like without anyone bothering you.  I love their salads and omlets.  I told my mother about the place and she is now going there with her friends as well.Brad B
"I eat here about once a month. Great local place in the Gold Coast, especially if you want something moderately priced. The wine and beer selection are pretty solid as well. My favorite part is the atmosphere - good music, good wait staff, and friendly crowd. Their menu rotates but some of my favorite things are the Cajun Chicken Penne, the cheese plate, their soups, and many times their seafood specials. Minor criticisms would be they are a bit heavy on the butter and sometimes their creativity over extends their talent. That said a little extra butter can be nice and I would rather see a changing menu that takes risks than something stagnant and boring."
"Went there for Brunch on Sunday and was not disappointed.  They have amazing scones (with butter and whipped cream!) and 3 different types of Eggs Benedict (e.g, Florentine, etc).  It was non-fussy delicious brunch food that was delightful.Server was very sweet and coffee stayed full the entire time.I will go back if I'm in the neighborhood!"
"The 3rd Coast is a comfortable little neighborhood spot.  It is very unassuming, situated below a high rise apartment building.  They have some nice artwork for sale on the walls, which changes frequently.  Props to supporting local artists.  I really like the Coronation Chicken Salad (with mango chutney, raisins, peas and apples) and Grilled Cheese (with tomato and bacon).  They also have a very reasonably priced wine menu, perfect for a low-key, after-work meal.  This is one of those places that you go to over and over again when you don't feel like trying something new or trekking anywhere far away.  Its definitely a favorite of mine."
"I've been going to this place for years. The food is great and very fresh! The servers are always friendly. I often go for the the chilaquiles. Sometimes I go for the turkey and brie sandwich, which is perfect. The soups are chunky and awesome. My hands-down FAV bacon in town, and I eat a lot of bacon. Word.They have a really nice wine selection, and the selection seems to revolve.Oh yeah, and the coffee is always perfect! A giant coffee grinder sits in the front window, which I think says something. I like sitting in the front room where the art is always changing, and you can watch sidewalk traffic file by, including a parade of small dogs and strollers. The whole place has an arty Greenwich Village vibe... or maybe Europeanish. Interesting locals, and friendly patrons fill the tables. Not unusual to see people playing scrabble, both iPad2 and analogue.Refinement and fun, rolled into one!"
"Stopped into this cozy little joint for lunch and at first thought I'd entered the coffee shop or sitting area at a retirement home.  A quick double take of the sign confirmed I was in the right spot even though the slightly blue haired clientele pointed to otherwise.To my surprise, the 3rd Coast hit the spot.  The toasted baguette used for the Diablo's beef sandwich alone was worth it.  Also loved how one of the side options for sandwiches was hash browns - a perfect way to have lunch but feel that you're not totally getting cheated out of their great breakfast.  As an aside, whoever is managing the music has solid taste.  Much respect.Overall great meal for a reasonable price - well played T3C!"
"A wonderful surprise! My husband and I were looking for a bite before heading to a show and we stumbled upon 3rd coast! It was exactly what we were looking for! Wonderful wine selection, cozy seating and very friendly and knowledgable staff! The owner even stopped by our table to say hello. The only place in the city that we have been on our weekend vacation that we had an appetizer, 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine for $50! Definitely a bang for your buck!"
"A friend of mine brought me here, or else I don't know how I would have found out about it but I'm glad I did! All the staff was super friendly and attentive.We had beers because we were in the mood, but I have heard the wines are excellent and wouldn't doubt it. The beers we're top notch, really flavorful imports.They serve breakfast all day, which is an added bonus for a breakfast lover like me. They have a lot of great options though. Definitely one of those places where everyone will be able to find something they like!"
"In college there were a few places that everyone told me I could go to get away from the other college students around me. Surprisingly, Third Coast actually did provide quiet corners despite multiple recommendations (which indicates that plenty of college students frequent the place). The atmosphere in the evening is sort of like a quiet European bar - lit by candles, littered with newspapers, fantastic bottomless coffee and drinks, and great food (the pizza was great, thought slightly expensive). I came here when I planned on needing to sit and talk for hours."
"So far I've only been here once, but I'll definitely make a point of going back when I find myself in the neighborhood.  I had a glass of the Mettler cabernet, which was lovely.  One of my friends had ""the spiciest bloody mary"" he'd ever tasted, and the other had a Frail Baby, a coffee liqueur drink that scores points just for the name and was apparently very tasty.  The shop itself feels (for lack of a better word) extremely tasteful.  Recommended!"
"One of the crappy things about traveling alone for work is eating dinner by yourself. Eating breakfast or lunch alone isn't so bad, but for some reason, eating dinner alone can be pretty depressing. On a recent trip to Chicago, I was faced with just that--dinner alone. I asked a savvy friend for a recommendation near my hotel, and she suggested 3rd Coast. It was perfect--a neighborhood joint that was quiet, unassuming, uncrowded (I went on a Tuesday), and a perfect place to take a book, have a glass of wine, and enjoy your meal without feeling like a loser.The food was quite good (I had the chicken marsala) and reasonably priced, the service was attentive but not intrusive, and the eavesdropping was DIVINE. I recommend seeking this place out if you're staying in the Gold Coast area and want to escape the Rush Street/Viagra Triangle nonsense."
Always good. Comfort food and a few surprises. One of the best burgers around. And Diablos tacos are surprisingly delicious.
"Charming, Quiet, Unpretentious and nested away in Chicago's gold coast, what I adore most about the place is the relaxed and friendly environment. Never have I felt rushed to depart, that's a nice treat in my mind. Great place for close knit friends to converse, relax, maybe even pay chess and of course enjoy any meal of the day. Also super wonderful for enjoying some ""ME"" time reading a book over tea. If you are into soups, they're simply fab, I'm a fan of the black bean soup! Entrees are awesome, had a paste dish for dinner a few weeks back and totally hearted it  Janet, the owner is super kind and crazy passionate about her place & people. She's also got a great memory, I haven't been in quite sometime, in the mist of dinner, she came over to say hello and remembered we had met. How cool is she? Everyone wants to be remembered, right?Great place, check it out. You will return!  Oh yeah, I do miss the late late night hours, however midnight isn't so bad.One other thing, I would agree with some of the other reviews that serve can take time, I always accridited it to the attendation to detail and a home style kind of feel. It's nice to have that in a busy city, less stress is always good. Perhaps if you are in a rush and don't have time for Quality conversation/connection w/family/friends and food, schedule a time to do so, because I believe everyone is totally worth it."
"Charming little brunch spot without a wait on Sunday afternoon?  I'll be back.  Their bloody mary was solid, the italian omelette (sausage, mozzarella and fresh basil) was good, and their bacon was meaty.  Not fantastic, but good, which is really what I need in a neighborhood breakfast spot."
"This place was flat out awesome!  I went with my girlfriend for our first time, although the coffee wasn't stellar, I got an omelet and she got the lox.  Every veggie was so so so fresh and tasty.  I've never had that thought before about freshness (I usually scarf my meals, especially breakfast) but it couldn't be overlooked.The omelet came with all sorts of veggies and even the lox with the uncooked red onion and cucumbers were great.  The hash browns were also wonderful, I would go back in a heart beat.Highly recommend this place, great job serving breakfast."
"My father-in-law found this place online while planning a special birthday dinner for my mother-in-law, and had no idea we would be so lucky to find The 3rd Coast. We were all visiting Chicago from WI & MN, and 13 (8 adults and 5 kids ages 4-11) of us went over Easter weekend...While we are all very happy with our meals, what struck me was the amazing variety. We spanned the globe with our selections; from chocolate chip pancakes for one of the kids to Chinese noodle soup to a Waldorf salad to Cajun chicken pasta to steak, everything was between good and excellent. This is the place to go when you have a group with diverse tastes!The service was excellent. The owner, Janet, made special arrangements to accommodate our large group and also was sensitive to the other guests; we were seated in the upper section and somewhat separated until the restaurant got busy. We had a guy for our server (can't remember his name) and he was very attentive.Finally the ambiance was perfect for our needs. Basically two open rooms it has an artsy, laid back feel that gets a little loud when full. Great neighborhood spot off the tourist track, and worth the effort to visit."
"3rd Coast is my fiance's and my go-to for low-key Sunday night dinners when we don't feel like cooking. There is a friendly, down-to-earth neighborhood vibe to go along with solid food and beer/wine list. I'm a big fan of the cajun chicken penne done spicy but everything I've had has been great."
"I have a love for 3rd coast that spans over 16 years, I have enjoyed many a cup of coffee here as well as a fricking delicious scone.  I enjoy going in the late afternoon because it is not busy at all & you can enjoy some ""you"" time either reading a book, perusing the paper, or doing work/studying.  You can spend hours here just chilling on some random afternoon.  I also enjoy the friendliness of the waitstaff, they are not pushy at all.  Nor do they hover over you so that you leave--it is nice.  While I think their food can be a bit pricey the quality is good and the portion sizes are decent.  I have a tendency to simply get some coffee & a scone.  Let me just say here--they have my favorite scones in all of the city.  Served nice & warm with fresh fruit in them and they come with whipped cream & butter (drool!).  I will say one major downside for me is that they do not offer Splenda as one of their sugar substitutes and that is annoying.  I do not understand why some establishments hold out on that front--so minus a star for that."
Great brunch!  Don't believe reviews about the Bloody Mary not being made with Worcestershire... They definitely are and they are excellent.
"Utterly relaxing at night.A friend and I were looking for a place to chat around 10:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, close to the Clark and Division red line. Having been instantly repelled by the loud, bad music and grinning middle aged suits at ""The Lodge"", we were delighted to traipse over to 3rd Coast (I hadn't realized it was open that late) and cozy up to a booth in a corner of the restaurant which we had all to ourselves.  Though you're below ground level the windows are tall and  expansive, so you have a great sense being tucked away but still connected to the world outside. The lighting is bright without being harsh and music is tastefully chosen, in the background. We were both content with our beverages--a Peppermint Schnapps hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and a cocktail I can't remember.We didn't order food but there's plenty of it, as well as a good looking wine list. It would make an ideal option for a lateish dinner when you want something other than diner or fast food.  (They do serve breakfast all day if you have that hankering though.)I'd been to 3rd Coast for a few Spanish language Meet Up groups and it's served the purpose very well, reasonable sound level, no problem splitting up checks, quick service.If I lived in the area I could also see this as a great place to go solo to read or work on a project.In sum: great multipurpose spot."
"Fantastic Carry OUT!   One of my friends stopped by with lunch today... I felt so lucky!!She brought one of my favorite sandwiches in the world-- the Turkey Brie sandwich from 3rd coast!! Yummy, buttery, toasted bread with melted brie cheese and turkey... I am very full, but just thinking about it makes me want another!!  I always get the fruit salad with it, instead of fries... they do not just stick you with cantaloupe and honeydew, they also have bananas, pineapple, strawberries..Great desserts too!  the brownies?  Chocolate, rich, and savory..Happy day!"
"I brunch a lot. I try to eat at a new brunch place every month and every time I do, I always buy a scone. The scone is my yardstick, my Big Mac index if you will on how brunch places compare to one another. To me, omelettes taste the same across different restaurants, but scones can have so many interpretations and ingredients--it's exciting every time I try one!I've been a fan of scones ever since my mom bought me those triangular-shaped blueberry scones from Safeway when I was a little girl. I think it's safe to say that I've eaten a lot of scones in my lifetime, but never in my life have I come across scones such as the ones from 3rd Coast.For one thing, these scones are shaped like a dome and are bigger than my fist so they are heartier than most scones out there. The scones come out warm and toasty as if they're arriving straight from the oven. The outside of the scone is hard and dry, which makes you think the scone will be like that on the inside. But, once you break off a piece of the scone, you can see that the inside is soft with huge chunks of fruit and the scone just melts in your mouth. This is exactly how I envisioned the perfect scone to be! Tough as a rock on the outside, but cozy and fluffy on the inside. I think 3rd Coast has only three varieties: raspberry, chocolate chip and blueberry. The chocolate chip scone tastes like a giant butter chocolate chip cookie, which is fine with me. The raspberry scone is a little too tart for my taste, but the blueberry scone is just divine.I visited Chicago recently and I bought 6 scones to bring back to California. Each scone is $2.50 each, which I think is a bargain when you're paying for a scone the size of a softball. The scones weren't as fresh as they would be if you dined in, but the crumbly, buttery taste was still there. If you ever make a stop in Chicago, you have to try the best scones in the country--I dare you to prove me wrong!"
"I have recently discovered 3rd Coast and it is now perhaps one of my favorite little places to visit.  During the past two weeks I can say that I have visited quite frequently experimenting with different items on the menu.The food is great and the service is also very wonderful.  As my fellow yelpers have stated the decor is a little bit off, but nonetheless the atmosphere is not a killer.   They offer a variety of unique local beers as well as a pretty decent wine selection. The nostalgia of the old building couple with pretty decent food makes the night and dining experience complete. Whether you're visiting the Gold Coast area or live nearby, you need to make a point to check out 3rd Coast."
"I have been here several times but breakfast only. Typically a line, but there is a reason for it and is worth the wait. Food is always fresh and service is excellent.Great way to start your day."
"I came here after dinner for dessert and drinks, but apparently people come here for all sorts of reasons.  I saw people eating dinner, studying, drinking coffee, having a meeting (at 11pm).  It was cool that this place makes everyone feel comfortable like that..  The chocolate cake was OK, it was not warmed up so it was like eating a cold brownie.  The raspberry chocolate port was different... in a good way.  It was like drinking juice and eating a chocolate bar at the same time.  I would drink it again."
"Ambiance:Maybe I didn't read the other reviews or look at the photos that carefully but this place was not what I was expecting at all.  When I think wine bar, I picture a somewhat sophisticated, slightly younger, hip crowd getting drinks after work and some tapas-style dishes.  This place is more of a coffee house/diner with wine available.  It's in an apartment building so it seems like some of the tenants eat here e.g. the 80 yr old guy eating his sundae by himself at the adjacent table or the family with children enjoying cheeseburgers at the other end of the restaurant.Food:It's actually quite good and reasonably priced.  I had french toast which is hard to mess up so I can't judge the entire menu, but the menu itself is very extensive (breakfast served all day).  My friend got the veggie burger and ate the entire thing even though it was huge.  The coffee is good too.Parking:Impossible unless you have a permit."
"I've been on this brunch kick lately.  I mean, I always love brunch... but lately, I want it everyday, for every meal, ALL THE TIME.  BRUNCH.It's awesome.  So on friday, I went to brunch, even though a lot of places don't serve brunch on fridays.  They serve breakfast. What's the difference?  I don't really know.  I think brunch may include sandwiches.Anyway, at 3rd coast I got a breakfast sandwich with the following corrections... INSTEAD of sourdough (blehg) I got it on an english muffin (yum) and I added bacon (Yu--huuuummm) that the server said was the BEST BACON IN CHICAGO.  True?  Maybe.  It was good, thick.  We asked him how the bacon got so good... are they stashing some pigs in back?  He said no, it's all about the cut and the way it's cooked.  Anyway, the sandwich was good.  Not too amazing, but I was pleased.Also got freshly squeezed orange juice that was good.  I'd like to come here for a proper brunch sometime, and not ""breakfast"" because I think their brunch menu is larger.  Also a side note, this place reminded me of my grandparents.  Probably because it's a block away from the condo they used to live in... but maybe they even brought me here when I was young and naive?   much like how many likes it takes to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, the world may never know."
"This place was a couple doors down from our hotel; we ate here twice in two days, once for breakfast, once for lunch.  Food was great (I rate breakfast better than lunch), wait staff very friendly, prompt service.  And it's a cool place to go; located in the ground floor of an apartment building"
"food is good.steak is probably the best thing on the manu.i really liked it but not 5 star place,"
"I live right by here and am so glad to have a simple and enjoyable neighborhood joint to add to my dining-out rotation now. The restaurant space is spacious, warm and inviting, if a little dated. The waitstaff is good, always friendly and informative. And the food is definitely serviceable. It's not phenomenal but it's always two notches above decent. 3rd coast isn't trying to serve the best mindblowing food ever; it's just trying to serve good food that you can take a moment or two to enjoy. But I do declare that their chopped cobb salad is the best. :p"
"When I first moved to Chicago I lived in this building and was totally thrilled to have a late night place I could eat at any time I pleased. The french toast is amazing and I love how cozy and dark it is inside. It always feels like I'm hiding out from the city when I'm at 3rd Coast. I was back recently just for some beers and had an excellent time. They have a pretty good selection of drinks and there is a really laid back atmosphere. The waitstaff are always really nice. I just really, really love places that serve breakfast into the night becauase that is when my mouth starts watering for things like the banana walnut pancakes they serve and the applewood smoked bacon B.L.T. Yum, yum yum!"
"My boyfriend and I stumbled into this place after reaching Chicago close to 11 pm. We were met with incredible service , authentic sangria, and angel hair pasta to die for!!Besides the bag for your buck, the cozy atmosphere is perfect for dinner for two. Also seems like a great place to catch up with friends ( again, over the sangria carafe)"
"I used to live a block from this place on Dearborn.  Now that I've just moved away for school, I've found myself wishing I could walk in and plop down on one of the booth seats and order some cajun chicken fettuccine and pretend to study.  Sometimes the chicken was a little dry, but oh that sauce was fork-licking good.  Their burgers & appetizers are pretty good, too.The staff is friendly, if sometimes a little bit 'more hipster than thou'.  I can take it, just give me the pasta."
Kinda strange spot with awesome food.
Applewood bacon BLT = greatHostess = very niceWaiter = rude an unapproachable
"Came here for brunch with a fellow yelper on a Friday and we both ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon. It was good, and the bacon was delicious, and our waiter referred to it as, ""the best bacon in Chicago,"" though it was tough and hard to cut the sandwich or take a proper bite. The chai tea and hash browns were decent too.Our server was goofy and a little off the wall, but entertaining, I suppose. He cracked some kind of joke any time he came to our table.This place has some overpriced items though... for example, their bagel and lox is $11!"
"I used to Coast excessively when I had friends in the building but they've all moved away....however, I found myself getting suspicious looks from the genteel neighbors while waiting on the corner with boots and fishnets so I ducked into the 3rd Coast the other day and suddenly felt home again.I forgot how much I loved this little gem on one of the prettiest streets in the Gold Coast.  Always a warm welcome and respite from the cold.  Piping hot drinks in the winter and refreshing cold ones in the summer.  Always room for me and my girls to sit for hours on end, sometimes through entire shifts, and no one says a word.  Just annouce the changing of the guard.  Brunch has turned into dinner more than once here.This is one of those places that flies quietly under the radar with decent food, great wines, fair prices and a great staff.  I kind of like it that way!"
"Tasty food in a very nice location.  Attentive service, nice atmosphere.  The decor is very warm and comfortable.  They play easy to listen to music here which fits the mood of the restaurant well.  It's a nice place to get dessert and coffee or a glass of wine and read the paper.The food is altogether pretty solid.  Not the best burger I've had, but I'm definitely happy with it.  Well cooked breakfast food.  Pretty satisfying Tex-Mex.  Going for brunch here on the weekend is one of the few times I'm not angry about going to brunch on the weekend.  Waits are minimal.  Nothing's trendy or scene-y.  Nothing annoys me more than going to the Bongo Room.  This is the antithesis of that.  And the stuffed french toast is amazing.Definitely recommend."
"It would be easy enough, if not understandable, to mistake 3rd Coast Cafe for a strictly formal Gold Coast posh spot. The atmosphere, not to mention location at the swank intersection of Dearborn and Goethe, are certainly enough to suggest a decidedly high-end experience.But while 3CC may attract an upper-class clientele, it also provides a surprisingly relaxed, casual atmosphere -- one that may not become apparent until seated.The menu varies, covering a wide range of entries and appetizers. For those looking for a light meal, the grilled cheese is bar-none the best in Chicago; you'd swear it was grilled in sunshine, not better. Those arriving with a more serious hunger will obviously be looking for something more substantial, which is where the spicy penne pasta with chicken comes in. Add bacon bits for over the top flavor -- provided you don't have a heart condition. And top the whole thing off with a massive, multi-scoop brownie sundae, with non-traditional sundae scoops of mint and coffee ice cream.Given the quality and portions of their servings, 3rd Coast can come across on the more expensive side. Luckily, every bite is worth it. And you'd be hard pressed to find a more inviting location in the entire Gold Coast."
"While this place may not be for everyone, it sure is close to perfection.  Located just north of the Walgreens at Division and Dearborn, super close to the Clark/Division Redline stop and the Broadway, Clark, and Division bus lines, Third Coast has been one of my favorite hang-outs since I moved to Chicago.I used to work in the area and afterwards would head on over for some delicious grub and its inviting, homey, almost hypnotic atmosphere.  Being at the garden level really helps transport your body and mind to an otherworldly state.  You just seem to forget time is passing outside without having to stare at all the hustlers and bustlers on the sidewalk.  There are windows that you can see out from, don't get me wrong--it's not a dungeon--but you just don't seem to notice the outside world.The food is excellent greasy spoon fare.  What it is not is gourmet, exotic, organic, fusion, or some other type of haute-cuisine nomiker that is good for visiting friends from ""Bon Appetit"" or ""Food and Wine.""  This is much more of a Rachel Ray joint where you could bring that chronic eater and hear 1000 ""yum-os"" before the meal were through.  The breakfasts come in overwhelming proportions, the sandwiches are always humongous and come with a large salad or a cup of their delicious soup, or some other choices (I can't remember).  If you order the salad, ask for light on the dressing or they'll smother it, which isn't always so bad except when you're on a diet.  Then there's some decent entrees and classic desserts.Of course there are drinks and coffee to add to the fun, and I must say their coffee is very good, bespeaking it as a truly classy joint.  I am not sure but I would imagine they buy whole bean and grind it on site.The prices are middle of the road.  I would not call this expensive for the area at all, and I don't even know if I would call it expensive at all.  Considering the portions are so huge, you definitely get your money's worth.A few recommendations: the Mexican steak and eggs breakfast; the breakfast sandwiches (plain old egg and cheese, or with bacon or with ham); the Dutch club; the applewood smoked bacon BLT; and for the chicken salad lover, the Coronation chicken salad sandwich (not for you if you don't like curry).  Also, for a quick snack, the quesadilla is a good choice.I can't stress enough that this place is more importantly about its ambiance.  The staff is friendly and patient, if not a little slow but they're always busy.  The place is so warm and inviting that it is perfect for a cold winter's night.  Go with a book in hand, your journal, or just a friend for a deep conversation.  You won't be dissapointed."
"GREAT Gold Coast brunch spot.  Went to 3rd Coast for the first time and loved it!  The prices were very reasonable, the service was friendly, and the food was delicious!  Not to mention it was about a block from my house and I had no idea!  I'd call if a hidden gem if it weren't for the crowd (don't be scared off- the wait goes faster than you think!).  Definitely recommend trying their bacon and the yummy hashbrowns."
"Rarely would I give a 5 star rating to a neighborhood bar and I find myself at a loss for words to defend such a rating.Perhaps it was the circumstances of my introduction - my friend had recently endured the loss of his father and I was getting him out of the house for a few hours in the late evening. We ran into the owner on our walk over, who stopped and hugged my friend (both he and his father were regulars). Entering, I was very happy with the fundamentals of the place - the layout, the not-too-bright lighting, the interesting-without-being-distracting background music. The beer special that night was a brew I've never tried (and I've tried many, many).The owner had called ahead - dinner was on her. The waiter took our order and, by and by, ended up telling my friend the story of the loss of his father. Again, my apologies for not having the right adjectives to laud this little spot, but I recommend it for anyone in the area. The place and people are both outstanding."
"I've been here twice now and I love it.  I haven't had anything other than brunch, but I have heard that all the rest of the food here rocks.  I wish they had Splenda.  That's my only real complaint.The owner lives in my building and I went here based on the recommendation of neighbors.   I'm glad I did!"
"Cute little cafe/restaurant.  I came to meet a client here on a Sunday afternoon, and circled the blocks for free street parking...but finally had to pay the meters since the street parking required a permit.  (*Note - meters are getting so expensive in the city!  It's almost up there with SF's meter prices now!)  I got a vanilla latte (delicious) and my client got a tea. We chatted for about 45 minutes, and when we asked our waiter for the bill, he said it was on the house!  Hm...we were so confused.  He must have got a glimpse of our confused faces, so turned back around and asked if that was 'okay'?  Ha ha.  We said yes (tentatively) ...but still decided to tip him a couple bucks.  Cute place.  Will have to come back here and try the food given all the good reviews here."
"I have already reviewed 3rd Coast but wanted to update since we used them for our Rehearsal Dinner, the night before our wedding. This was a no brainer for us, we have been going there for over 7 years(as I mentioned in my first review). We took over the entire top portion and had it set up so that it was more of a buffet. They had a table of tons of foods and apps and people just went up and got as much as they wanted. We also had open wine and beer bar for 2 hours. It was perfect and they were so amazing and gracious to us. There is a little step you have to go up to get to the area we were in and the owner took my grandmother (who is in a wheelchair) in through the back through the kitchen. It was still open to the public but we hardly realized it and didn't feel as if we were disturbing the rest of the place. They Owners are so accommodating and up for anything! I plan on throwing more parties there in the future!"
"Actually closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I will come back again to see if I am sincerely able to update it to 4 stars. My 'house omelette' was fine. With the plethora of great omelette places downtown, this omelette was as Yelp calls ""A-OK"". O'Brien potatoes (w/green peppers and onion a nice departure from the typical slab-o-sliced potatoes. Wife had '4 star' pancakes, laced with blueberry. She's a bit of a pancake snob and really liked these. Dane, the server, was one of those nice guys who adds to the friendly ambiance. Service 5 stars!"
"I often come here, as I live in the building, and its warm, cozy ambiance is irresistible during freezing Chicago winters. While this place is not cutting-edge hip by any means and gets really crowded on weekends, the food is great (especially breakfast and lunch). Among my favorites, grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato, crab cake eggs benedict, and a Caesar salad. Service can be slow on weekend mornings, but still good compared to some other brunch places in the city."
"I yelped this place hoping for a home-y neighborhood joint and 3rd coast delivered on all accounts. Plus the food was extra delicious. First they have freaking bobak sausages, which we had just tried the day before at taste of chicago. I had the banana pancakes, which were so banana-y (that's a good thing). The price was right and the service was friendly. It was really nice to have a slow brunch here before getting started on our crazy tourist plans."
"I love this place. And not because its steps from my apartment - which I must admit make it wonderfully convenient on those foggy-headed Sunday mornings - but because it's everything brunch should be. Delicious, cozy, friendly and laid back. No crowds packed with perfectly put together people that scoff at my baseball cap and comfy pants - aka pajama pants. No snooty servers and overpriced, mediocre concoctions. And definitely no ridiculously long waits. I've never waited more than 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, thanks to the ""blink and you'll miss it"" location. The steamed oatmeal with bananas and brown sugar will leave you all warm and fuzzy inside. And the French toast stuffed with bananas, candied walnuts and brie .....well, do I really have to say much more? Bonus:  this place has a great wine selection, full bar, and live music on Saturday nights."
"A great place for a relaxed meal, coffee, wine or drink. The service is wonderful and friendly. I enjoy each visit I make here as well as all of the artwork. Great breakfast - really nice menu and wine list. Definitely becoming one of my regular stops!"
"Normally when I prepare myself to go to a place for dinner, I ask friends if they have heard about the restaurant that I am going to. How is the place? How is the food? Is the service ok? Strangely, this was one place that none of my friends heard about. Therefore I did not know what to expect going in.  After having dinner here last night, I did not leave disappointed.I went with six others for a ""Grub With Us"" dinner club meal, and they served us a very nice tasting menu. For appetizers, we ate mini italian meatballs, a mini hummus plate with pita bread, and a plate of chicken quesadillas with spinach and cheddar. I did like the quesadillas and meatballs, but I could not stop tasting the hummus. It was quite yummy. For main courses we were served curry chicken, beef tacos, artichoke ravioli and slices of vegetable and sausage pizza. The one dish that stood out for me was the tacos. If you ate them normally, they would have just tasted ok...however what put it over the top for me was the spicy sauce that they gave you on the side. Wow, never had tacos that tasted like that before. The artichoke ravioli was also a different plate to try; and that turned out ok as well. Sadly, and I hesitate to say this, the only dish that I wasn't too crazy about was the curry chicken. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't stand out for me. For dessert, I liked the key lime pie carrot cake they served. I initially thought that they were going to serve is key lime pie AND carrot cake...however putting them both together turned out well for me. The settings look to be pretty old-fashioned; it looked like this could be a restaurant that would be attached to an old-fashioned hotel. I also noticed all the art pieces that hung around the restaurant; it gave us nice things to look at.Two words come to mind when describing service here: top notch. The owner (I think her name was Janet; I could be totally off since I'm not good with names) greeted us when we were initally seated at our table; and also checked in with us as we were in mid-meal. The waitress that served us (again, not good with names so let's call her Jill) was great as well. She mistakenly served me an extra glass of wine...so I ended up with two glasses next to my dinner plate. Jokingly she offered me a wine bong that she had handy to down the wine faster..sadly I didn't take her up on that offer. Nestled away in the middle of the Gold Coast/Old Town area, 3rd Coast is is a delight, plain and simple. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this place five stars is the food. The food was great; it just wasn't spectacular. I do wish I could give this place four and half stars, because it does deserve it. Still, it is one of those gems in Chicago that you would only be able to find if someone told you about this place. With its location, just a block away from the busy bar areas on Division street, it seems like this is a great place to get away from that craziness as well. More locals do need to be aware about this place, and I highly recommend this place to them if asked."
"This really is a hidden gem in the Gold Coast.  This place is tucked away and very unassuming. The food is well priced, portions are big and quality and variety are great.  I've been here mostly for brunch, but they do also serve lunch and dinner as well as a full cocktail menu.  If you go on a weekend for brunch there will usually be a wait, but it's worth it."
"This place is a delight for breakfast and lunch anytime. It's kind of retro. I love the veggie burger with grilled onions, veggies etc. it's delicious and served with a large side fresh salad. The daily soup specials are fantastic with wonderful seasonings."
"I love 3rd Coast.  It's anything you want it to be.  A coffee house with unlimited refills, a wine bar, late night munchie place, brunch, lunch, dinner, anything!It's in the heart of the Gold Coast, and one of the few restaurants in the immediate area.  The staff is always friendly and I was pleasantly surprised at their wine knowledge.Perfect for groups, brunch with the parents, or a nice date night.  The menu is large and orders come out quick.  I always forget about this place, but always happy when we end up going."
"This is by far my favorite restaurant in the city, and here is why: (1) They play awesome music all the time (Kings of Leon, Interpol, Cut Copy), (2) Their food is awesome (Corination Chicken Salad, Homemade Soups, Great Coffee, Cappuccini, etc.), (3) The Staff is super cool, (4) The vibe is very relaxing (It's just a really chill Coffee House).It's such a stress relief to just go there, and I have probably eaten there 50+ times and brought dozens of people through (all loved it).Do not hesitate to give third coast a try, you won't regret it."
"I give it four stars for what I think it's trying to be - a sort of laid-back coffee shop that I imagine existed in the Vienna of 100 years ago.  If you're expecting a super-hip, modern cafe, you're in the wrong place.  Located on quiet Dearborn Street in the heart of the Gold Coast, this place is usually heavy with studying students and locals in for a bite.  They have coffee, of course, but also a full bar and nicely prepared cafe-type foods.When I lived a block away, I used to eat there a lot and just chill with something to read and some coffee.  I still like to eat there after doing stuff in Lincoln Park (like after the Air Show) or when I want to just relax and have decent food and good drinks."
"I used to come here quite regularly when they were open til 3 or 4AM. But, it seems after the smoking ban they didn't get as much late night foot traffic and thus modified their hours. Oh, well. I still try to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood.This place is a cool place to hang out at any time of day -- for breakfast, for a coffee, for a late night glass of wine. The food is pretty good. It's nothing AMAZING, but it's decent for a cafe.Chill atmosphere, dim lighting. I recommend this place for just hanging out with a couple friends or if you have to study or read."
"A true neighborhood gem.  Old space, but not obsolete or outdated.  Maybe the only place in the Gold Coast that feels like you're in the Gold Coast.  Excellent food.  Not boring food like some neighboord dives.  That is, 3rd Coast gives you the impression that they are trying to serve you good food, not hold on to old recipes that have lost their magic.  Great beer and wine list as well."
Charming restaurant! Very well run. Servers are on their A-game and know how to keep up w/the busy flow of weekend brunch goers. The food is fresh and delish but nothing spectacular or unique.No outdoor seating. I'd recommend the place for brunch on a weekend.
"I went here for dinner recently.  One star for the quiet and cozy atmosphere.  One star for the attentive and friendly service.  Minus three stars for the sketchy, cringe-inducing, cartilage-ridden chicken.Other reviews seem very positive about brunch so if I try it out I will be sure to (1) avoid any chicken dishes and (2) update my review."
"Love this cafe! This is my friends and my go to place for a conversation over unlimited fresh coffee, delicious dessert, or a satisfying meal.  I'm always in the mood for their apple pie a la mode with coffee. Last night I tried their caprese sandwich for the first time and it was perfect, so fresh and flavorful. The service is always excellent and charming. I'm always satisfied when I leave 3rd Coast!"
"so, this one is pretty easy to miss.  As a matter of fact, I had no idea what or where it was until my food connoseiur friend decided on it for my birthday breakfast-dinner.  I like this spot more for atmosphere than I do for food - don't get me wrong the breakfast is yummy, but I want to film my next nujazz music video on a cloudy day sitting in the corner sipping a cup of earl grey, waxing poetic about love that can never be.  Well, that's if I were filming music vids.  The other wonderful thing is that you can buy wine by the bottle to go.  Got to love that."
"Just dropped in last nite for some vino and cheese...was very impressed by not only the prices, but the outstanding taste. The service was superb and being only two blocks from my dwelling its just the perfect spot to grab a bite. Definitely check out this spot when in the Gold Coast."
"Delicious food, excellent drinks as well."
"french toast + bananas + banana liquer + candied walnuts + brie + whipped cream = party in your mouth!The stuffed french toast was amazing (especially after we took out the brie.. yeah, it was just a little too weird for me).  It's also super sweet, so make sure you have a cup of coffee or glass of water nearby.  But apparently my friend thought it wasn't sweet enough so he doused it in syrup.. root canal waiting to happen.  My friend ordered the veggie hash, which was surprisingly delicious.  It comes with bits of brocolli and other veggies inside, which almost makes you think you're eating something healthy.  Yummy!! =DBonus point: they serve up some great coffee. =)Service is nothing to complain about.  They don't bug you, they're responsive, and they're quick."
"Hubs and I lived next door almost 20 years ago and frequented for many meals.  Now we live a few blocks away and had breakfast there with our teenagers,  We all loved it!  Coffee is better than ever. Art work still as cool.  AND they now have Gluten Free bread for sandwiches and toast.  If you are GF, what more could you want!"
"Located just across the street from what was a dingy apartment in a seedy neighborhood where Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, lived,   the Third Coast today is the center of a vibrant, urban neighborhood. Excellent breakfast and Sunday brunch menus; lunch and dinner offerings are varied and delicious. Service is friendly and professional This is the kind of unique, neighborhood cafe out-of-towners could visit to experience neighborhood life in Chicago. Locals love it for its unpretentious ambience."
"If not for my friend and his wife that live a block or 2 away, there is likely NO chance I would have ever stumbled upon this place.  The 3rd Coast is their neighborhood go-to spot, and I can totally see why.  Good, reasonably priced and super diverse menu.  From beef sandwiches, to breakfast, to jamaican curry--you can get just about anything here.  I had the beef sandwich--which was good, not as good as many famous spots in Chicago, but good nonetheless.  If you are in the mood to get away from the crowds (and prices) at many other Gold Coast establishments, give The 3rd Coast a shot, you are sure to find something that hits the spot!"
"Great Place to go to for coffee, wine, brunch, lunch etc.  Very comfortable and cozy on the inside.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The staff prompt, friendly, and helpful.  Thanks for a great afternoon!"
"Cute place which was pretty quiet on a Wednesday afternoon. The water glasses were broken on the top so had sharp edges which was a little bizarre. I had a vanilla latte which came to me in a glass beer mug and my friend had a hot apple cider which he said was delicious. I was disappointed that they serve coffee from NJ instead of Chicago which to me defeats half of the purpose of going somewhere local to have coffee. I also didn't understand why the coffee wasn't in a coffee mug. The service was great though and there seemed to be some good food options on the menu. Will definitely be back for the food, if not the coffee."
"I like going in for a breakfast, lunch or dinner with a book. Sometimes I meet a group there. It's a very comfortable cafe and so close to my place that I think of it often. The service is spotty, so much so that the only reason I don't go there weekly is the service. The waiter disappears or walks by without seeing the water glass is empty or there is no silver or you stand there at the register while the staff finishes their social conversation. Don't order martini's. The beer and wine choices are very good. Every meal I've ordered has been delicious and some memorable. Street parking, 151 or Clark St. bus, garage at Indigo, parking lot at State and Goethe, easy NE walk from Division stop on Red-Line. They play great Cd's all day long. No matter your age, the feel is terrific. They keep the sound just right, not loud. If they could get the service fixed I'd give it 6 stars. It could easily be perfect."
"You know how rare it is to find a restaurant that you can take parents to for a early breakfast on a Saturday, your boyfriend to for a boozy Sunday brunch, or alone with a paper on a random Tuesday afternoon?3rd Coast is all this...It's relaxed, unpretentious, and tasty food. I know, I know it IS located in the Gold Coast, but when 99% percent of us leave our pretensions at the door...Perfect!"
One word FANTASTIC!!! I have been here several times for brunch / dinner and every time I go the food is full of taste and the staff is amazing. Keep up the great work!!
"I basically grew up in Third Coast.  Bottomless coffee, smoked turkey and brie sandwiches, STRONG long island iced teas, usually pretty good music late night, really nice staff.  It's a great place for holing up w/ friends, playing board games or cards, and relaxing."
"This was a great place in the Gold Coast. They offered three levels of ""hot"" for my cajon dish. The decor was ""traditional"" and the music was not quite in line with that, but the oveall experience was good. I liked their menu's variety and pricing. I'll definitely go back."
"I'm so glad I found this place! I live a block away so I'm definitely going to be coming back a lot.Great food, great service, and the drinks were strong (good if you like that kind of thing!).Best of all was the atmosphere. Very laid back and they were playing Radiohead, Led Zep, and the Beatles in the background. I'll definitely be back to relax and have some good food"
I have dined here for lunch and light dinners.  Sometimes it is just for the great gourmet drinks.  This place has a cozy ambiance and awesome service.
"My husband used to live in this building and was a regular, somewhat daily customer.  The staff was always so friendly and welcoming to him, and then to me when I started visiting 3rd Coast with him.  It's a unique setting with local artwork for sale on the walls, a cozy downstairs atmosphere, and clientele ranging from businessmen to students with their backpacks and laptops.  Open late and early, convenient hours for busy folks.  A nice mix of tasty entrees, breakfast food, desserts, wine, and coffee drinks.  I like their pastas, apps,  sandwiches (the chicken salad with curry and raisins was really unique), paninis, french toast, lox/bagels, scones, and lattes.  Great locale to try out in this fun neighborhood."
I frequent this place for Sunday brunch.  Fantastic food and fantastic service can make for a little bit of a wait but it is well worth it.  Check out the smoked salmon and havarti sandwich and you will be very pleased.  See you there!
"I liked this place, I had the burger, which was tasty and served on a pretzel roll (totally sold me) and my wife had grilled cheese and soup which were both good.  They had a good selection of beer and wine, I had a Lagunitas IPA I'd never had, it was very good.  We also took dessert back to the hotel, cheesecake was decent.  I'd go again for sure especially if we stay in the neighborhood again."
"amazing home-style cuisine plus laid-back yet classy atmosphere, and barely any people.. what a well-hidden gem! come here to read your newspaper with coffee, or to sip on some wine, or to enjoy a great meal.. like no other place, this spot combines a coffee shop, a bar, and a restaurant under one roof in a very organic manner."
"Probably the best cafe in Chicago. Like a great French bistro, this place puts the pieces together. The daily menu has varied good choices, made with tenderness and care. The staff is extraordinary, really lovely people. It is not a white tablecloth kind of place, but if you want good food, in a great location with good vibes, check it out. And at least one of the servers knows a lot about music."
"When my friends told me we were going to the gold coast for brunch I was nervous...I figured I'd never have enough cash.  But the 3rd Coast was really surprising to me.  Not glitzy in all the right ways.  Very ""homey"" feel in the middle of many high-rise apartment/condo buildings.  No sense of pretension here.We walked in at about 1:30 on a Sunday and were seated immediately at a comfortable table for 4.  I had an omelet that was really nicely sized--I hate feeling guilty for leaving an enormous-but-rubbery egg creation on a breakfast plate.  I didn't have to worry here.  It also came with some of the best hashbrowns I've ever had...seriously. (And I'm a breakfast person).  Price-wise, I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices all over the menu, especially for the area.  I've paid more for brunch at Ann Sather's, so I considered this a great find.  And the entrees my friends had looked great too.  Even though I was going ""lumberjack breakfast"" that day, I was shocked at how good and non-brown the fresh fruit looked--especially for February in Chicago.My only slight annoyance was that the service was barely mediocre.  On an early Sunday with eggs and bacon in front of me, I don't want to have to beg for coffee.  I will, but I don't like it.  And I had to.  However, after observing some of the other servers, I think this issue might have been with our particular guy and not as an indicator of the general experience.I went there last week and was so bummed because I couldn't remember the name to even write this little Yelp review.  But, after some checking, I found it and I""m glad...I'd definitely go back.  In fact, I may be planning my next visit soon."
"I like this place.  The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere quaint, and the food very good.   I went here once for brunch a very long time ago and for some reason never came back until today.  Glad I did.   I will be returning much more often.  One of the things that I appreciated the most was the warm and welcoming staff...made me feel like I was in a small town rather than the big city."
"Recently rediscovered Third Coast after a long hiatus from Chicago. Part cafe, part wine bar, part bistro, Third Coast is in a class of its own. Its one of a handful of ""cafes"" that truly takes its food seriously. The menu is both large and diverse. You can order anything from hummus to salads to pizzas. My personal favorite is the coronation chicken salad with its interesting yet tasty curry and raisin combination. Homemade baked goods are also very good including the carrot cake and scones. But food aside, the Third Coast is a great place to bring friends. Perhaps its the dimly lit room, comfy seats and plush carpeting, but for whatever reason, the later it is, the better the place gets, and the more engaging conversations become..."
"The best way to enjoy this place for me was living in the same building, one of the best breakfast in town."
"I wish I had a neighborhood spot like this!  Super friendly staff, great food, comfortable location, and a great wine list and full bar! I've only been in for breakfast and drinks, and I look forward to coming back many times! Definitely so much more than a cafe - a bistro that feels like home!  The breakfast sandwich is great - will fill you for the day, and you may not even need dinner.  Must have this with the thick cut bacon - perfectly crisped!"
"This is a neighborhood gem in goldcoast, Chicago. A quaint cozy  non pretenious environment,. Food is delicious - The pancakes are consistently well made  - good texture that doesn't flake off when you lift it off the plate. This place is also known for its bacons. The crowds ranges from students to professionals, young couples with babies/kids, visitors and the elderly,  a good cross section of neighborhood. Also - there is  a newly introduced flat thin noodle soup special as of a few weeks ago - a size good for a meal itself - tasty and rich - was told  it's a chef's special on certain nights and is not  yet on the standard menu -  hope it made it to the standard menu. There're also an ever changing array of photography and artwork display on the walls for sale.If you plan on working over your lap top ...go sit by the window -  you maybe able to tab into some unsecured internet connection from the residence above...but there're limited duplex outlet on the wall.  wish they'd build in more outlets on the walls throughout  the main  and secondary dinning area.- it makes good hangout place to work on projects during downtime."
"THE BAD:The service is slow and generally lousy. Usually too busy and loud for what should be a low-key cafe. Atrocious crowd control during weekend brunch. THE GOOD:They do have the best steamed oatmeal and applewood bacon (but you have to tell them to burn it to get it crisp.) Interesting and sometimes great art rotates on the walls. They let you carry-out.  Overall, not my fave."
"Quality is 50/50. DON'T get the pork chops! The pie isn't very good either. Ice cream and brownies are decent though. If it gets busy enough it gets terribly noisy. Sometimes there are live performers, which can be good or bad. Staff is generally nice, but there a few bad apples.Very busy at breakfast and weekends!edit:I went here last night again. I've learned NEVER order anything but sandwiches here; which isn't my ideal restaurant experience anyway. And I though it was funny that a (literally) can of soda was 2 dollars.People say they dont take reservations, but the restaurant was closed recently for a large party for two hours, so I'm pretty sure they do."
"Take my word for it ... there is NOTHING more comforting on a snowy afternoon than holing up here for a while over an irish coffee and raspberry scone. (Yes, weird combination. I've accepted it.) A place that meets both of my legal drug needs: coffee AND liquor. I've only ever had the scones, never been there for an actual meal. Sorry. But the scones are enough. They bake them for you. No, I mean really. They aren't under glass at the counter. You actually have to wait. BECAUSE THEY EFFIN' BAKE YOUR GODDAMN SCONE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Bake it! Do you get that? BAKE IT. The scone covers a multitude of the sins I've been keeping track of ... the too cool for school service, the priceyness, the fact that it takes forever to get your check when it's time to go. I forgive you, Third Coast, because you have ""delicate antique plumbing"" in your bathroom, because of your wood panelling, because of those weird gas jet things at the door (heat?) and because of your motherfucking SCONES."
"We had a delightful little lunch here on a recent Friday.  My party tried 3 different sandwiches, all tasty: a turkey/brie, a club and a grilled veggie.  I also had a cup of the gazpacho which was the soup of the day - JJ sez dy-no-mite!  Finally, I had a very tasty sidecar, my first of (I hope) many to come.  Service was attentive and everything arrived at our table quickly.  The atmosphere was pleasant, with a great album playing, nice natural light coming in from the street, and a quaint location in the near north area."
"Imagine if Starbuck's and Denny's had a baby. The product of that happy union would undoubtedly be Third Coast Cafe. Right in the heart of the ritzy Gold Coast / Lincoln Park area, you wouldn't expect this little gem of a restaurant--with its plain, bordering on boring decor--to find its niche, but instead, it's always bopping. Live music in the evenings and a familial-acting, casually-dressed staff add to the relaxed ambience of the place.But that's not why you'e reading this review, so...on to the food!The breakfasts here are standard fare--potatoes O'Brien and eggs in every standard style. Where Third Coast really shines is in its sandwiches. Available in three types of bread, the sandwiches all come toasted a la grilled cheese. Of particular note are the Coronation Chicken Salad and the Smoked Turkey Brie. The Chicken Salad is a delicious number with moderate hints of curry mixed in with the raisins, apples, celery, and moist chunks of white chicken meat.Don't miss this place!"
It's a great place to keep coming back to and they make it oh so easy to.They're open every day from very early until very late in a neighborhood you would never think to find something like this in.The food is enjoyable and there's a wonderful atmosphere but I always feel under dressed in here.
"We eat here fairly often and everything is delish!  The specials are always tasty and fresh, the fajitas are tender and seasoned, and the Chinese chicken soup is a meal in and of itself.  The service is always great and friendly!"
"My boyfriend and I went here after visiting Garlic and Chili Thai Cuisine.  I was stuffed, but he wanted coffee and, being from Chicago, he swore this place was worth it.  It definitely was.  Once I arrived I ended up having several cups of coffee and splitting a slice of apple pie a la mode!  The service was prompt and welcoming and the pie/coffee was delicious.  The prices were good, too!"
"This place is a much needed presence in a neighborhood overrrun with franchise restaurants and fast food joints. The atmosphere is very charming. If you go when it's not crowded it has a wonderful homey and cozy feeling to it. The live music during the week is a nice bonus.The unique atmosphere compensates for the food. The food is slightly above average. But the coffee and wine list is more than adequate. I feel they are stronger at their appetizers, desserts and breakfast and weaker with their sandwiches, entrees, and salads.The service is pretty good. Can be slow at times. I think it's worth checking out, but best to avoid during weekend brunch hours when the line to be seated can run out the door and spill into Dearborn Street."
"This place is phenominal. I live around the corner, and it's by far the best deal in an insanely overpriced area. Want a quiet dinner? Go to 3rd Coast. It's 7pm on a Saturday, and you don't have reservations anywhere? Go to 3rd Coast. Don't want to spend $50 a plate like most places in the area? Go to 3rd Coast.My favorite time to go to 3rd Coast is on the weekend brunch. Half of my friends don't care for contemporary brunch, prefering to eat at Denny's. The other half craves the more unique and adventurous. 3rd Coast is very often the great compromise."
"Well, take this review with a grain of salt, because I didn't go here for breakfast/brunch, and even though they do offer breakfast all day (which is very cool) I didn't order breakfast.  What I did order, however, wasn't too bad, just really nothing special, and the same thing happened to my hubby and what he ordered.  I opted for a smoked turkey club, eh not bad, and he for the Cajun chicken pasta, dried-out chicken.  They had some nice work on display from local artists, and I do like the idea of a diner-type place that serves booze...  but if your not in the neighborhood I would not seek this place out."
"The 3rd coast is a nice low profile classy cafe. It's perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their menu features breakfast all day, which is a plus for me because I love breakfast. Their location is just off the beat and path surrounded by town homes and apartment buildings. The environment is that of a peaceful cafe. Although it was a little busy, it was still quiet and I was able to enjoy my meal in peace. The 3rd's food was superb. You would expect to pay more, but I'm glad we didn't. I had the veggie skillet. I was impressed with the potatoes. In addition, they feature beer, wine and cocktails at a reasonable price."
"Great atmosphere for a date. Very good conversation and light food. The wine is nice as well. It's small, quiet and feels like a hidden neighborhood gem off the beaten path."
Good food. Good place to have a quiet dinner/drinks with friends. A little bit too dark inside though.
"Excellent sandwiches and a real old school Chicago feel. We ordered hummus, diablo's beef sandwich and the dutch club. The hummus was average. The diablo's beef was excellent- warm grilled bread, lean and tasty beef. Maybe a bit too salty, but the texture was perfect. The dutch club was the same- freshly grilled, still hot and just the right amount of each ingredient. The diablos beef sandwich came with kind of a jalepeno relish on the side. Temperature wise, it was cold, but very spicy. Not for me, but probably heaven for someone who likes wierd spicy stuff. I would definitely go back. hummus, two sandwiches and tip- $35."
"Live music, even on a Wednesday, with a coffee shop feel, but still on the restaurant classy side. I really loved my experience here with my buddies playing our card game. The laid back environment allowed us to have fun, and still feel like we had gone out. There was a live guitarist singing all my old folk favorites, and the server was quick to take our orders.I had the 3rd Burger which was melt in my mouth pleasure. Loved the sauteed red onions, and the accompanied Caesar salad. It was halfway between a chopped/regular salad. Yummy in my Tummy! I'm definitely coming back here to hang out."
"3rd Coast is a haven in the Gold Coast in that it is a refreshingly different place to dine in the neigborhood (not ridiculously overpriced or commercialized). It's a great place to get any meal and also makes for a cool nighttime hangout spot. They have some great microbrews and often have chill live music on the weekend. I also like grabbing brunch here, as even the oatmeal is good. If you are inclined to stay and study, or laze away the day reading a book, you'd be welcome to do so here."
A lovely neighborhood place where the food is always excellent
Been here for both brunch and dinner and it's pretty good all around.  The eggs florentine and veggie hash are both excellent and the local artwork is a nice touch to the ambience.
