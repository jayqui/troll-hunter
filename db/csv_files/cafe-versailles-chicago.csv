Cafe Versailles
"Is this a five-star dining experience? If you're going to eat crepes, then yes.Strawberry Nutella & Apple, cinnamon brown sugar were both good.Eggplant, zucchini, carrot and provolone was fantastic.  Had some type of spicy sauce on the side.  Mmm.Service: 5+ stars.  Owner & brothers go above and beyond to make it a nice experience."
"Cafe Versailles is located in my old neighborhood (Old Irving).  I saw it on Yelp and went here yesterday after work with 1 of my co-workers.  Cafe Versailles is a small crepe & sandwich shop that seats about 20 people.  It has been there for about 2 years.  I was talking to the owner & he said they will soon be expanding their menu for dinner too.   I ordered a cup of mocha coffee and an apple caramel crepe. (It was ok, but nothing special). My co-worker ordered the Nutella crepe with strawberries.  This was delicious"
"Good for this place for having so many reviews -- a good sign. I live very, very close to here. I don't think I'd travel out of my neighborhood to visit, but it's a nice spot in an otherwise far-flung northside neighborhood. I'm also glad this isn't another weird storefront with blinds drawn and questionable merchandise inside.The flavours are all decent and the owners are nice. I wish the crepes were a little thinner and crispier, but I'll live. Plus nutella and banana on anything is pretty solid. Salads are also surprisingly good for those times when I don't feel like walking to the grocery store for dinner.They should pair up with The Cabin next door and do some sort of brunch on the weekends. Make that happen, guys!"
Stopped here for lunch on the way home from a meeting with a co-worker. What a GREAT choice we made!! The food was fresh and absolutely delicious.  The coffee was some of the best I've ever had and the service was impeccable. The owner went above and beyond to make sure we had a great dining experience. He was so friendly and took the time to learn our names and explain the menu to us. I will definitely make it a priority to go back there whenever I am in the neighborhood!
"I met a customer at Macys, and he is the owner of this place and he was the sweetest down to earth man I ever met, and he told me about this little cafe business that he does with his brothers and he told me it was zabiha/halal which was perfect, we need more places like that. And I got super excited and I was at the city the NEXT day after meeting him so I decided to stop by with a friend and it was beyond amazing. I was so hungry. I wanted more than just one meal. I told all my friends about it and now EVERYONE wants me to take them there. definitely should open one up in Schaumburg. :) -Zara"
"I knew this place has been opening for about a year and half, but I never made a conscious effort to try it out until tonight.  You know what?  I should have done it much earlier.  I had some hearty, and the same time, salty lunch today and really just wanted a great cup of coffee.  I convinced hubby to come along.  We walked from our apartment in Albany Park for twenty (20) minutes south on Pulaski.  We then arrived at the destination.  It's a rather small place, but it's cozy and inviting.  We started our meal with latte and mocha ($2.75 and $3.00, respectively).  Since I wasn't hungry, hubby and I shared the tomato, feta, and fresh basil crepe ($7) together.  The crepe was DELICIOUS.  I know crepes sound like the European-version of pancakes, yet crepes can be made either sweet or savory.  I personally prefer crepes than pancakes, anytime of the day.  The owner introduced himself to us and asked us how we found here.  People seemed to be very kind.  I will start coming here since it's two (2) blocks away from the CTA Irving Park Blue line station.  This is my commuter route to work."
"This crepe place was definitely worth the drive! We came on a Monday afternoon during a holiday, and there was a lot of easy street parking that is free. The restaurant is very cozy, and looks like it seats about 20. They have two couches as well. We sat at the window and people watched. Service was quick, friendly, and polite. We ordered the cafe latte ($2.75) and cafe mocha ($3) to start. Soy is an extra 50 cents. The coffee was amazing! We also decided to get one sweet and one savory crepe to share. We got the smoked salmon with herbs ($10) and the house special which had kiwi, honey, and pistachios ($8).The salmon crepe was stuffed full of the fish and fresh herbs and came with hot sauce and sour cream. It also had eggs in it. We had the sweet one as a dessert, and were happy with the fresh fruit! The texture of the crepes were thicker than we usually have, but they were very good. We left full, happy, and satisfied."
I had the roasted eggplant/zucchini/carrots crêpe with mozzarella. Very yummy and filling. They have 90s music playing which was fun. Very cute decor & plates; nice family atmosphere.
"Wifey and I came by here on Easter afternoon.  We wanted to get away from the Easter Sunday crowd that was about to engulf the city.  So we called and asked if they had seating and they did so we swung by.  It's just up the street from us so it was perfect. They location is right on Pulaski, plenty of parking on the street.   They've only been there for a short time, but, I was very impressed.The place is smaller, maybe seats about 20 people tops, I like that.  I think you get a little more personal customer service and better quality.We got a seat, there was a 2 seater just waiting for us.   It was a very nice day which i think added to the experience.  It was sunny a small breeze came through the door, the sweet smells of crepes were in the air.We were greeted by one of the owners.  I might not have the correct name.. so forgive me!... I believe it was Hamani (i hope that's right, if not, i'm very sorry).  He was super courteous and very nice.  We ordered a couple of cappuccinos.    Wifey ordered a  savory chicken and mushroom crepe and I went with the smoked turkey on focaccia bread.  the meal was just so on point, it hit the spot on that beautiful Sunday.  The bread was nice and toasted very flavorful, the turkey was good and fresh.  A small side salad and hummus.  It was the perfect meal.  They make all sorts of crepes and sandwiches. They have a little something for everyone.  The cappuccino was made ever so well.  They use excellent coffee and take the time to make a great drink.   I finished it off with some mint tea... infused with real mint leaves!  That did me in.  It was all so perfect.  We chatted a bit with Hamani and told us that him and his brothers own and operate the cafe.  Bravo for a great cafe and great atmosphere.   We felt very welcomed and appreciated as a customer.  We will definitely be back once again, thanks for helping make that Sunday a great day!Do it!"
Honestly I've had so many crepes in my life in Europe and the usa and these are by far some of the best I've found in the usa that actually are like the European ones. The crepe itself can easily hold in a competition with authentic French ones. I'm sad I didn't find this place in the past. The owner is so so sweet. I will definitely be coming back to try all the awesome gourmet ones they have!
"This is a quaint spot for some coffee, crepes and good service.The owner is super accommodating and kind to everyone. The crepe is just ok, not thin enough."
"Being from the Logan Square area, it's nice to find out that there is a French restaurant/cafe/creperie nearby. The coffee is top. I had the apple caramel crepe and was surprised that the apples were not cooked. Nothing wrong with that, as you're assured that the apples are fresh and not from a can overflowing with syrup.The atmosphere seems laid back, almost coffeehouse to lounge. I hope that the cafe has a long shelf life. It is a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood."
OMG! Was looking for a breakfast at 5 in the afternoon and didn't want traditional pancake house like IHOP or Denny's. Found it on yelp and I must say AWESOME. The food is great and service is great too. I had a savory crepe (homemade sausage) and a sweet crepe (house crepe) and both were on point and delicious. They have a bunch of different style crepes and sandwiches. Will definitely be coming back here!
"The baby in my belly and I enjoy the crepes here! I usually order the banana coconut nutella crepe which,by the way, is quite heavenly!  I tried the house crepe and that did not disappoint! I was hesitant at first because kiwi pistachios and honey did not really sound tempting.. Now, I am so glad i tried it. It was sooo delicious!  It's also perfect for those that don't have a sweet tooth!The staff are also nice and friendly. It's a nice and cozy cafe in the neighborhood. Going there after a stressful day or an exhausting week is a real treat! It's affordable too!"
"Me and the wifey went here for brunch and the server (maybe owner) was very friendly and welcoming. He even gave me some tips on where to find Lacoste in my size for cheap. Now let's get to the food, I had the smoked salmon crepe which was perfect portion and they did not skimp on the salmon either. My gf had Nutella, banana, and strawberry crepe she was kind enough to share a bite with me and the freshness of the fruit really stood out. Looking forward to trying their new menu in a week and I definitely will be a frequent customer. Almost forgot to mention we warmed up with hummus & pita plus two drink and our bill was only 23 bucks. These crepes aren't the one's you find in diners(rolled into tube and filled with sugary fruit loaded with whipped cream) they are light, delicious, and filling at the same time."
"Move this place a bit closer to the Blue Line and Metra Irving Park station and I bet this place would be crowded. Hankering for something hot and sweet, Ihad a craving for a nice hot crepe from this freezing weather. Cafe latte, while a good size, was too bitter for my taste, it's piping hot which I liked. Nutella crepe is better than the one I've had in Andersonville and the outdoor market in Wicker Park. I really enjoyed the nutella filling with the chocolate syrup combo. While I prefer a very thin crepe that is almost crispy, this one hits the spot."
"The house crepe with kiwi and pistachio and honey was The BEST combination. It tasted like heaven, and was the best crepe I had ever had."
"This place was great. I rode my bike past it many times, always making a note to check it out some time. After seeing such good reviews on Yelp, I decided to finally stop by for breakfast with family.. And wow, what a gem. I tried one sweet crepe, and it was amazing... perfectly done and authentic, not to mention beautifully presented. My mother tried the vegetarian omelette crepe, which was also very good. The coffee was furthermore very good, especially the Cafe au'Lait. The atmosphere was cute and unique, something you would probably find in a real French cafe.. a perfect place for a conversation. Service was also great. I was very impressed, especially for the price of the meal. Will defintely return for the great coffee and crepes."
The Lamp Crepe was amazing! Awesome fusion of French and Algerian cuisine!
"Just ate here for my first time. I moved in around the corner and I will definitely be a frequent customer after the amazing food and service I experienced today!! I had the house crepe, and an Americano, and both were delicious! I met one of the owners and he was so kind and welcoming, especially for someone new to the neighborhood! Thanks for the great experience and I look forward to coming back and checking out the rest of this great menu!"
"Had lunch here for the first time since moving into the neighborhood 6 weeks ago. What was I waiting for? Everything fresh, amazing spinach/carmelized onion/Swiss crepe (served with a fabulous little sauce on the side) and wonderful homemade lentil soup. Enjoyed the space and very friendly service. Will be back frequently!"
"My boyfriend and I usually don't go to the same restaurant twice. However, he lives within walking distance of Cafe Versailles and we are absolutely in love with it. We were looking for a neighborhood breakfast joint on a cold, wintry morning in December 2013 and stumbled upon this gem. Both the savory and sweet crepes are heavenly. When it comes to the sweet crepes, I personally suggest the house crepe (kiwi, pistachio, and honey) or the Nutella and three berries crepe. I always order their mint tea, which comes with fresh mint leaves in a gorgeous ceramic teapot. Other than the crepes, this restaurant also has a variety of sandwiches and salads. The sandwiches come with a generous helping of hummus and house chips and are just as good as the crepes. The staff members are attentive and polite. They are always quick to take our order and come to our table frequently to see how we're doing. We tend to sit and talk long after we have finished eating and we never feel rushed. This restaurant is my favorite crepe place in the city. I don't think I will ever have crepes from anywhere else."
"Their facebook or whoever runs it has to be a joke. I contacted this restaurant and asked if they made mille crepe cakes and they replied, YES. So, further asking them additional questions, they requested that I call them to chat more. My fiancé called them, and after a very rude conversation on the phone, they claimed they DO NOT make crepe cakes. Okay, fine.I replied to their rep on facebook telling them they needed to up their customer service game and provide . ""fyi, you have really poor customer service. first of all, dont tell a customer you make an item if you don't just to reel in the sale or discuss over the phone if you're too lazy to reply over the internet. second, if you request i call you to discuss my questions, (which you didn't read to begin with, obviously) don't give me a bad attitude."" was the gist of my conversation in to which they replied, ""U need help guys""No sir or ma'am, you need help, with grammar and running a business with acceptable customer service."
"Amazing crepes!  The house crepe is absolutely perfect. Also, the paninis - you can't go wrong with any of them."
"Came in on a Sunday morning. We were the first ones in that day! We moved in right around the corner and found this place on yelp! All the reviews mAde me really want to try it! And the reviews are spot on, phew  great crepes. I had the tomato, basil, and feta crepe! (Amazing) the sauce they pair it with is so good! My boyfriend had the house crepe, kiwi, honey & pistachio he LOVED. But my favorite part is that they have a really good expresso! Will definitely be back"
"Went for dinner with my wife. We had a Greek salad, a chicken mushroom and cheese crepe and a chicken and avocado crepe.  All food was great.  They use a more doughy crepe batter which is very good.They also have some of the best coffee around."
"very accommodating staff and good food and coffee.We had both savory and sweet crepes. I liked the sweet crepes a little bit better. I would have preferred a little more crisp and thinner dinner crepe. The portions are very generous.The coffee was good and very good salads.A solid place to eat, we enjoyed our large lunch."
"Yum. Yum. Yum.My husband and i headed here one crisp fall morning for some coffee and crepes. We were not disappointed.The place wasn't busy when we walked in, but it was early, maybe 8:30 on a Sunday morning. We chose a cute little table and ordered coffee pretty quickly. Their coffee was great. It takes a little bit of extra time because it's from a french press, but it is worth it!For crepes, both of us went with savory after much debating - they all sounded delicious! I had the chicken, mushroom and cheese ( I chose Swiss) crepe, and my husband had the chicken and caramelized onion with avocado sauce crepe. Both were served wit ha side of sriracha. We both tried the other's crepe and both were really good, but I think the chicken and onion one was just a tad tastier. Maybe it was the perfectly done caramelized onions with just a hint of spice when you added the sriracha, but I'm STILL thinking about it.When we left around 10:15, there were a couple of other tables taken, so it still wasn't super busy. This would be a great place to bring a great book, relax on one of the couches, and just linger. I even commented that I thought this would be great for a girlfriends' lazy brunch or a book club.Parking wasn't bad (we parked across the street), but it was early in the morning. It's the time of day that I like to say the city hasn't woken up yet.Quite the neighborhood gem. Try this place."
"Came here for brunch, got a strawberry, banana and nutella crepe. It was amazing! They had other stuff, both sweet and savory. Coffee was really good too. Service was e excellent, very friendly. They have a great neighborhood vibe. It was also really nice we didn't have to wait in a line for a hour and half to eat. Prices were great too!"
"We decided to try this place on a lark, and absolutely loved it. The staff was incredibly friendly and hospitable, and the food was wonderful. We tried the house crepes, which were fantastic, and the caramel crepes and sandwiches we ordered were very good, as well. The prices are a steal, too. Do yourself a favor and head over here for a bite. You'll be glad that you did."
"This quaint family owned cafe was such a treat. We had hot chocolates, cappuccinos, and a Nutella/strawberry crepe. Everything was delicious. The owners were so friendly as well. Glad my kids had their first crepe at Versalles Cafe."
"On Sunday, when we finally decide to come to terms with getting out of bed, we usually check out a new place. This time it was Cafe Versailles. I noticed it driving by a couple weeks ago. We were not disappointed by Cafe Versailles. In fact, we have found our new favorite crepes place after Icosium Kafe closed down in Andersonville. We ordered two different sweet crepes, one savory, one panini, one espresso,  and one cafe latte. All were delicious and nicely presented. The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating. We'll definitely be back!"
"Stopped in after checking Yelp on business trip... Had the lamb shank and vegetable soup , it was fantastic... Very clean, great price.... Will definitely be back! Highly recommend"
"Just happened to be in Chicago these past few days, so I stopped by here for dinner after seeing the great reviews on Yelp.I had never tried savory crepes before, preferring them on the sweet side and picturing savory crepes to be like a bland pancake stuffed with omelet toppings... In other words, not so great.Unfortunately, that was basically what I found the savory crepes to be. We got the mushroom, chicken, and cheese crepe as well as a build-your-own crepe; both were completely under-seasoned and my friend had to slather her custom crepe with the hot sauce provided to make it somewhat palatable. Couldn't understand the hype.The sweet ""House Crepe"" was decent... Definitely not for those who are craving something sweet though, as this was mildly, mildly sweet. Luckily my group and I (we shared one) don't mind not-so-sweet desserts so it was decent. I don't call it any more than decent because the kiwis were horrendously hard. Probably because it's not in season but...Oh yeah, we asked for glasses of water and were charged $1.50 per glass because they serve you water bottles (be warned). This wasn't a big deal for us, however, and the coffee was good (a friend ordered a cappuccino and loved it). Wait time for food a bit long but manageable.Reason for 3 stars and not 2 is because the panini a friend ordered was amazing. We all ended up trying a bit of it and wished we had ordered one instead of a crepe."
"It's a lot of crepe ... (Bread , egg, w/e)Not a fan...  It's looks nice though..."
"Was excited to see a 5 star rating for a crepe place.Definitely go after the sweet crepes, as powdered sugar and crème Chantilly are pretty hard to fuck up. The savory crepes were painfully bland and sparsely filled.Service was good."
Very good service. Coffee is great. Salmon is vey fresh and delicious. Chicken combo is a little bit spicy but good.
"Stopped in here while running errands for a quick to-go latte. Wish I had the time to stay, the decor is beautiful! And all of the food on the menu (especially the crepes) looked amazing!Service was incredibly friendly and welcoming, prices were very reasonable, and the latte was excellent! I will definitely be back soon!"
"This is a cozy little spot specializing in both sweet and savory crepes, coffee, cappuccino, and paninis.The owner of Cafe Versailles is also frequently there serving and greeting guests. He took extra effort to introduce himself and thank us for the business which is something that you just don't find everywhere."
"This Cafe is absolutely amazing!! I loved every minute of my experience.  From the time we stepped into the restaurant we were greeted with a warm smile and hello.  I definitely felt welcomed.  The decor felt very warm and cozy so much so that my friends and I stayed for quite sometime chit chatting. Our waiter was also funny entertaining and attentive.  He was the epitome of what a great waiter should be. As for the food... I give it an A+, .  I ordered a chicken sandwich I pita bread and I honestly wouldn't Change a thing about it.  Who would have known that you could make a flawless and amazing sandwich! ??  Also the crepes were to die for!! I give this place 5*****!!!!"
"Seriously this is one of my favorite places to go to get a cup of coffee! Me and my friend are regulars here, and the guys who work here are super nice, they go above and beyond in customer service. I have FINALLY tried their crepes (I had the spinach, feta, and mushroom crepe) and was not disappointed. The size was perfect and it was really filling and fresh. As for coffee, it's perfect! It has such a bold flavor and it's only like a dollar fifty. Seriously, do not go to Dunkin Donuts or McDonalds. Come here for great food and coffee and talk to some really cool people.Oh yeah and if you purchase coffee, they'll give you card that'll give you a free one after purchasing 10 coffees."
"these crepes are literal sex in your mouth. absolute heaven. crispy yet soft, they simply melt in your mouth. it's like love at first bite, literally.order a latte along with that crepe. it's a match made in heaven. the owners are awesome, true Frenchmen! I got a parking ticket because I parked across the street on Pulaski since it was ""rush hour""  so watch out for that! (4-6 pm weekdays)"
"A friend suggested this place to me, knowing that I love crepes. Trekked over in this cold weather and it was well worth the walk. I ordered a coffee, and the chicken and caramelized onions with avocado sauce. It was delicious. The staff was very attentive. Will definitely be back!"
Solid crepes. I don't think they're the most authentic crepes out there (I had a chicken fajita crepe... Not so French) but extremely tasty nonetheless. I will definitely pay the restaurant another visit even though it's a 30 minute L ride for me.
"Food  3/5Coffee 5/5Service 5/5Price 5/5Ambiance 3/5What I really liked most about this restaurant was how comfortable and relaxed I felt dining there.  I was eating solo and nobody was there except for me, which I thought was a little odd seeing as how popular the reviews are about this place on Yelp.  The  owner, who served me, couldn't have been nicer and we had an engaging conversation about the cultural differences between us and the French, amongst other things.Well anyways, I ordered the savory crepe, comprised of chicken, carmelized onions, avocado puree and sirracha on the side, which had a nice kick to it without being too spicey.  Nothing special about it, just okay.  Next time though, I'm going to order the Nutella crepe because I'm more of a sweet fan than savory.  Get the coffee (latte), it's delicious...and I'm not a big coffee drinker.Lastly, since this is a relatively small restaurant, please be considerate and don't bring your laptop there and hog a table for hours on end.  Apparently some patrons are mistaking this for a Starbuck's where it's okay to linger there forever with abandon.  NEWSFLASH:  this isn't Starbuck's!  When people are making a living on tips that measly little dollar you left after hogging a table for 5 hours doesn't cut it.  End of rant!"
"BF and I had some time to kill between an inconveniently timed Metra arriving at Irving Park and the NYE concert we were attending at the Abbey Pub, so we decided to hope Cafe Versailles was open and stopped by. To our delight, it was!The cafe is very small, but it is the definition of cozy. One of the walls looks like a large stack of firewood, and there are twinkly lights around the windows (maybe just for the holidays?). It took us a while to realize the menu was on the back of the placemats, but when we noticed, we entered crepe wonderland. After much discussion, we ended up being boring and ordering a nutella crepe with bananas and berries to split. We had thought about getting the house crepe (kiwi, pistachio, and honey), but decided to stick with the ol' standby. I got a cappuccino and BF had a plain coffee.It took a little bit to get the crepe, but that was fine since we were in no hurry. It was heavenly- fresh bananas and berries. and just the right amount of nutella-y goodness, plus whipped cream! My cappuccino was delightful, and BF said the coffee was good.The owner was working the kitchen and serving, and took the time to introduce himself and ask how we heard about the restaurant, etc. He was a really nice guy, and he makes some fine crepes. If I make it back there (I don't find myself in Irving Park much), I'd definitely go back to be more adventurous and try the house crepes!"
"I found this place on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. They have the best tasting crepes. I tried the Nutella, Banana & Berries and it was delicious with a cup of cafe latte. Hubby enjoyed the house crepe and that's with Kiwi, Honey, and Pistachio's. He had it with a cup of mocha. The crepes are so delicious! The coffee is great too!!! Come out soon and give them a try!"
"I had breakfast here today with my husband and kids after seeing all the great yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint!  We each tried a different crepe, mine was the nutella, banana,  and coconut. Absolutely amazing! My husband had the house crepe with kiwi and pistachios...equally amazing!  My kids had the peanut butter and the caramel apple and they also thought theirs were great. The cafe latte was a perfect compliment to my crepe! We also thought the paris decor on the walls and counters added to the experience and the service was very friendly and welcoming.  We will definitely be returning to this charming and unique spot!"
"The coffee was outstanding! Drank it so fast I forgot to take a pic. We only tried the sweet crepes however we will be back for the salty ones. Their crepes are freshly made, crunchy and satisfying. I am not a Chocolate lover therefore I was hesitant to try the Nutella and berry thinking it might be overly sweet but boy was I wrong. I am so glad my girlfriend loves chocolate because it was really good. Not overly sweet despite the chocolate & berry sauces and powder sugar. I am so happy I stopped by to finally try them for myself. Enjoy peeps!"
"Absolutely AHHmazing. My friend and I stopped here for brunch on Sunday. Through word of mouth, we had heard fantastic things about this place and wanted to try it ourselves. The place is small. It has several regular tables, and then a few lower lounge-type tables...I think there are six tables to be exact. The decor is comfortable and cozy. We arrived about 11:30 AM so we were able to be seated right away; I'm not sure how long it might have taken though if we had arrived any earlier. We found parking easily on Pulaski across the street from the place. We ordered coffee to start, which was served promptly by the owner. He was incredibly friendly and outgoing, and shared a brief summary of his background of coming here from France. My friend had the Nutella and strawberry crepes, I had the apple caramel. In my life, I have never had such an excellent crepe. Besides it being an excellent dish, it was prepared so aesthetically I think I might have given it five stars even prior to sampling it. I would definitely come back here. Perfect place for quiet conversation and a small brunch with a friend."
"Small and cozy place.  Nice decor, simple and tasteful.  Good service, nice owners.  Apparently the crepe recipe is an older family recipe, I think that's an amazing thing to share with people.  Ingredients are fresh fresh and they make the crepes, pretty much right there, not in the back somewhere - fun to see that too.Savory crepe - turkey, feta, scrambled eggs.  Was very good.  The texture of the crepe is similar to a pancake without being too cakey.  Very tasty, and a great portion for the price.Nutella crepe - delicious.  I wasn't sure how nutella would taste in a crepe, but I will be getting it again very soon.  Simple, to the point, not too sweet.Mocha - also very good.  Not sugary and grainy like Sbux mocha, which is a refreshing change for my taste buds.  If you are not sure whether to do the 'savory' (more meal-like) or the 'sweet', just do both, trust me.I live very close to this place.  I can't wait to stop in and try the different kinds.  I'm excited to try the sweet ones.  Their lemon crepe sounds good, I hope to try that next.The others in my party enjoyed their food as well.  There are no complaints.I will be coming here again very soon.  Inexpensive, tasty, quick.Enjoy!"
"This is an great place to grab a bite with some coffee and just chill. The atmosphere is your typical small cafe, nice and cozy. Everyone is friendly and the crepes are so amazing! I've been here twice already, and wasn't disappointed with what I ordered each time. They have a great selection of crepes , both dessert and actual meal crepes. They also have the option for you to create your own crepe! All I have to say is YUM."
"Great food. Great service. Excellent coffee. I have been here three times and keep coming back for more. The variety of crepes is amazing. The sweet crepes have fresh fruit and great combinations with nutella and honey. The savory crepes feature fresh veggies, meat and cheeses. Highly recommended."
"Warm, cozy, and relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for two weary travelers looking for some good food. Try the sweet crepes with honey! Will definitely be stopping by again next time we're in Chicago."
"Worth checking out and trying the honey, kiwu, pistachio crepe as well as the lamb shank and salmon ones. Delicious, big portions and affordable."
My daughter and I tried the savory crêpes and the house crêpe. They were very good. The cafe latte and mocha were delicious. I loved that is was so warm and cozy even though it was freezing outside.
"Great crapes, had their house crape, loved it. The guy working there is very welcoming and kind, he even held the door for us as we left. I felt very welcomed there, and since I just came back from Paris, it felt like Paris all over again! Cozy, delicious, and French! Try it out!!"
"We visited here after looking for a place to have some brunch after my son's haircut. Its a very nice, very clean cozy place. The owner is extremely nice and talked to us for a while. We ordered the Caramelized banana Crepe, Cheese crepe, Nutella Crepe and the caramel crepe. They were all delicious, but my favorite was the caramelized crepe. I am looking forward to having the banana and nutella crepe. We also had a Mocha, French Cappuccino, strawberry smoothie and it was all very good as well. My mom also had a freshly baked apricot pastry that she enjoyed. I highly recommend this place. Its extremely delicious and affordable and the people there are wonderful. Will be back soon!"
Absolutely loved this place! Very quaint. Friendly staff. Owner comes around to serve you and even stays to chat a bit. Food was amazing! I had the nutella crepe. They are pretty big so one was plenty. The coffee was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place especially if you are looking for something low-key and delicious.
What's not to love?? The friendly service? The French owners? The traditionnal crepe recipes? And all this for under $7!!!Get there now and try the lemon-sugar crepe
This place was awesome! Hidden Gem! The crepes are awesome the salty and sweet ones. The panini's are great as well.The owner was nice and friendly. It's a must go!
"A nice place, with very friendly owner, but for most people, if you are thinking five star, you are probably not thinking of this place.  The crepes are fine, but they won't exactly transport you back to France.  Sweet are certainly better than savory, which were meager in filling and seasoning.  No alcohol permitted."
"I haven't had a crepe here yet, but after seeing the other reviews, I'll have to try one next time.  I live a block away from here and have been stopping in recently on weekends to get iced coffee.  The coffee is fresh brewed and the staff is nice.Even better, last week I got a large iced coffee and a piece of banana bread.  The total price was $2.64.  That would have been about six bucks at Starbucks, and the whole place would have reeked of spoiled milk and desperate attempts at yuppiedom.  Cafe Versailles, on the other hand, is clean and has a soul.  I'll be coming back here frequently, especially since independent businesses (or really, businesses of any kind) are kind of rare in this neighborhood."
My café latte was delicious and my crépe was phenomenal. I had the kiwi-honey-pistachio crépe and it was seriously one of the best I have had (and there's no shortage of crépe restaurants in Chicago.)The service was very good - staff was very welcoming and sincere. Comfortable atmosphere - and open late!
"Forget the other crepe places in the city. I've tried them.. and Cafe Versailles is THE BEST in the city. The best. Yes other reviewers are saying it, BELIEVE it. IT really is true!  Be Brave. Venture out of the Loop, out of Lakeview/Lincoln Park and come west out of Andersonville. Keep going until you hit Pulaski and prepare to be wowed by this little out of the way cafe. Ok, not out of the way...the Irving Park Blue Line is right near by , but I know, I know..... this neighborhood is  not on the hipster radar. You don't come here to be seen, you come here to eat the BEST crepes in Chitown. I came here with my friend for her birthday she had a savory crepe(I can't remember which on she had but she raved about it and agreed- best one she ever ATE) and   I recommend the pistacho honey kiwi crepe. The customer service is superb. The owner was so friendly and he even gave us a free birthday crepe for my friend! Again, the crepes are the best I have ever EATEN in my life.  Melt in your mouth carbolicious. You will not be disappointed.  I am making this a regular stop every time I come to the neighborhood. And I come all the way from HYDE PARK, so you know this cafe has got to be good to warrant a trip from the crepeless southside.I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
Very cute and cozy cafe. Food was delicious and staff are super friendly. I would definitely come back!!
"Amazing! I seriously cannot rave more about this little diamond in the rough enough. The food was amazing. The banana, berries and nutella crepe is a must try! The service was good the gentleman was a bit busy, but made time to talk to use and thank us for stopping in. I can't wait to go back!"
"Specialization works for Cafe Versailles. The crepes are delicious, beautifully presented, and very filling. I had the Nutella and strawberry crepe, which was very tasty (though you can't go wrong with Nutella, can you?). Good service in a clean and nicely appointed environment. It reminded me of several small, independent cafes we visited in Logan Square before the area blew up. I miss them, so it was like coming back home. My latte was very good and eye-opening after a long, sleepless night with our sick daughter. She was feeling better, so we rewarded her with a banana and Nutella crepe. Her verdict? It was ""good."" Definitely coming back for more."
You could easily miss this place but its worth checking in to try it out. When I went they had a soccer game on the TV with volume playing & that's why the other people in the cafe seemed to be there so it could be a laid back & quiet spot to watch the game if you don't like loud atmospheres. Small place but very unique & fun atmosphere! Friendly customer service. I only had a drink but the food smelled delicious.
"Delicious food and great service. My daughter and I came for dinner and were absolutely delighted.  My Niçoise salad was fresh and tasty.  Her savory crepe was a nice blend of green peppers, cheese and caramelized onion.  We both cleaned our plates.  Dessert was flavorful, with me trying the lemon and sugar and my daughter ecstatic over her Nutella and strawberries. We will definitely be back.   I cannot wait to try the coffee that I've heard so much about."
"I took my parents here for their anniversary at lunch time on a Saturday. The owner of the cafe took our orders and continually checked in to see how we were doing. He was sincere in his service and clearly took pride in his work. The crepes were beyond delicious - my parents each ordered a vegetarian savory crepe and I ordered the sweet house crepe. They were all well-prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables, and the presentations were lovely. We shared hummus and pita, which was also very tasty. He specially prepared an Algerian tea for my parents, which they absolutely loved, and made me a perfect latte.The atmosphere is cosy and the decor subtle and classy. I'm looking forward to going back with my laptop and some time to leisurely enjoy all of the nuances of this quiet, unassuming cafe."
"Great experience. Great background music. Great service. Great food. Try Panini with focaccia bread, chicken roasted, and mozzarella cheese. LTR. Highly Reccomended."
"Imagine a restaurant whose walls are filled with Frenchmen singing ""Wannabee"" by The Spice Girls, a restaurant whose foundations are laid on blueberry muffins so fluffy that cumulus clouds seem uncomfortable in comparison, a place where the doors don't close until 10 p.m. I know what you're thinking and no, I'm not referring to Heaven. I'm talking about Cafe Versailles. After a long day of quitting my job, my wife and I were driving down Irving Park Road and wanted dessert so naturally, I pulled out my phone and typed the word 'dessert' into Yelp. The first result was Cafe Versailles (and we happened to have just passed Pulaski so we flipped a u-turn and retraced our steps).Upon our arrival, I immediately felt compelled to get the house crepe (a crepe filled with kiwi, honey and pistachios). I mistakenly told my wife she could eat half of it because I was already so full from my celebratory 'I quit my job dinner' and I'm not going to lie, that was the closest we've ever come to a divorce. I was half tempted to order another one but managed to hold off since I ate some of her blueberry muffin in the midst of my enraged stupor. Without having a single ounce of personal experience to back it up, I can say with absolute confidence that it was indisputably the best blueberry muffin ever baked in the history of Chicago and maybe even the world. Next time one of us quits our job, we know exactly where we're going."
"Suprised at how good the savory crêpe was. I ordered chicken, caramelized onion and gouda. Dish came with a delicious spicy sauce on the side that I requested more of. They did not mind me opening my computer during the slow afternoon hours to get a bit of work done.My wife came in later and ordered the Nutella crepe. This was also very good.Prices are very reasonable."
"Great crepes, coffee, and service. I went here on my day off for breakfast and to read. It's a cute little place with friendly owners. The greeting, speed of service, presentation, and taste of the food were all excellent. I also liked their music selection. It puts you in a good mood. I will definitely be coming back here again."
"Had ginger/lemon tea, turkey panini on focaccia and the house crepe. The best! I've lived nearby for a while and finally decided to venture out a bit from our usual places. I see why they have great reviews, which is exactly what brought me in to begin with. It was very intimate, cozy and casual. We ended up staying for almost 2 hrs, but then again when girl talk starts there's rarely an end. We finally left when a couple came in with a baby and our table made the most sense for them. Two thumbs up and five stars for this place!"
A cute small cafe with awesome service and even better crepes. Check them out and let's keep this little gem in the neighborhood.
No complaint at all. The food was fantastic and reasonably prices. I would however warn you that this atmosphere was a little too quiet for my taste when first walking in. So if you don't mind awkward silence this place is great lol. It definitely seems like a family type of business which is nice if you're into that. I would certainly revisit.
How wonderful to find this little gem right down the road in our new neighborhood!  We were torn between sweet crepes and savories--the usual breakfast dilemma--so we tried both and we're not disappointed.  Add strong coffee (!!!!) and friendly conversation with the owner and we got a great start to our Sunday.  We'll definitely be back.
"After reading the reviews, we decided to try this cafe with great expectations.  Almost everyone gave this restaurant 5 stars and there were over a hundred reviews. How could you go wrong?The meal started off great with an excellent latte.  The service was fine.  But, the restaurant is apparently all about the crepes.  From my table I had a clear view of the food preparation area, so I could see what was being made.We opted for savory crepes.  Probably not the best choice in retrospect.  We saw the sweet ones and they looked better.  As for ours, the crepes are not freshly made.  We saw a full stack of crepes that were preprepared and reheated when they were needed.  The turkey that they used was sliced prepackaged lunch meat.  The chicken was cubed, but in very small portions.  Everything had a blandness that really could have been improved with some sort of sauce.  All that was provided was a dish of sriracha.For me, the 5 stars that appear from others as a summation are overinflated. If I had to break it down, 4-5 stars for coffee, ambiance, and service. But, because it's all about the food, I am challenged with giving it any more than 2 stars."
very friendly and kind. Food is also great! I especially like three cheese crepe here.
The cafe versailles open mon . Fri 9 am to 10 pm --- sat to sun 7.30 to 10 pm
I love Cafe Versailles. It's the perfect neighborhood coffee house. They make some of the best crepes I've eaten in the US.
"I was pleasantly surprised with the food and style of this cafe. The brewed coffee is strong, and the panini is delicious. We also order the daily special, salmon crepes with sour cream and special spicy sauce, which is amazingly tasty. The inside is intimate and warm. The staff is friendly and attentive. A little pricy but the food is well above what it's worth."
"Mom and pop cafe. Great crepes! Very simple, quick cooked so expect your spinach to be raw (but delicious!). House crepe is interesting & yummy w/kiwi and pistachio. My daughter likes the caramel apple crepe. I've also had the focaccia panini and all the veggies are fresh, along with the bread. Hummus side was delicious.Coffee is standard. Free wifi. Limited seating. If they're busy, expect to wait because the same guy making your crepe is the same guy serving you. Polite staff and fresh so worth the wait."
"The customer service was rude, house crepe was more like pancakes with unripened kiwi, and the water I got served had things floating in it. Although the interior was cozy it was awkward because there was no music playing in the background and the owner was on the phone the whole time we were there"
"I used to love Cafe Versailles...today was my last time I will go here.  The food is good yet not amazing.  The people are friendly.  Yet they believe in overcharging customers.  If a price is listed on the menu that is the price that should be honored.  It is what is being agreed to.  When my bill came I was over charged and was told that eggplant costs more.  Well, if it costs more change the menu.  I was not in the mood to disagree over a 75% increase in price.  I paid the bill, left a regular tip, and won't return based on their unfair business practices."
"I've never written a Yelp review, but this place is a MUST! Best crepes I've had since I was in Paris (very hard to find them done right!) and the staff are all incredibly nice. The location is small, but charming. Definitely a place I will visit again next time I'm in Chicago--and great if you're looking for something unique!"
"Drove two hours to go back!! Crepes are delicious! espresso is amazing!  The owner came and chatted with us, he was excited and amazed that we came so far! The strawberry Nutella crepe was probably the star of tonight...picking a favorite would be like picking a favorite child (or pet)!"
"Absolutely amazed how I haven't been here when I lived around the corner. The food is delicious, my husband had the house crepes, kiwi and honey... amazing.. I had spinach, feta, mushroom and added eggs... to die for.. my mouth was salavating.  The service was wonderful, the place is warm and inviting. The owner is very nice, took care of promptly and made great suggestions. I look forward to Sunday morning crepes."
"I have passed this little cafe several times and now have no idea why I never went in until yesterday. I had not seen a good friend in quite a while and we decided to meet there for breakfast and a chat. We ordered a pot of tea to share and each had the spinach, mushroom, feta crepe. The pancake was good and the filling was fresh. It maybe could have been cooked just a tiny bit more as the spinach was cool and the feta unmelty. Still it was very tasty! The tea, flavored with mint leaves was perfect. The cafe is very clean. The ceramic bas reliefs on the wall and the French music in the background provided a great environment. We stayed an hour and a half and fully enjoyed it.  I will definitely be back!"
Great service! Ordered hot chocolate 10/10. Then ordered the smoked salmon crepes which was phenomenal. Great job crew!
I saw this place was in my neighborhood and had 5 stars so I had to check it out. So glad I did. Sweetest owners and super delicious crepes- I had the strawberry and Nutella and strong tasty espresso drinks. After the boyfriend finished one crepe he immediately ordered another. Highly recommend!
"The cafe is great because of its staff. Also, the food quality is high. Morad is my favorite guy in the cafe."
"Great service, nicest staff and wonderful food!  They have free wifi so it's great to do some work while you eat one of their fabulous crepes.  They also have fantastic coffee - always a plus.So I've been coming here for awhile now but just had their panini and was in love! I get focaccia with mushroom, zucchini and mozzarella- perfection! Great food for a great price!"
"Found this cafe on Yelp as I headed west out of the city back to the burbs. Small with one adorable man running the cafe. Don't go if you are in a hurry however the crepes, espresso and everything else is well worth a minimal wait. I've made the hour each way trip from the burbs just for the crepes several times and am telling all my friends and coworkers how much I adore this cafe. Simple and delicious."
"Had lunch here with a friend, amazing. I had the house crape with the kiwi, honey, and pistachio. She had the salmon crape. Both to die for. Great service and super cute cafe."
"Everybody here was welcoming. I went for the first time and I ended up spending a few hours in there. at the time there was a soccer game going on and it was a good atmosphere. I was in there working on my laptop for hours but it seemed like no time had passed. They have free wifi and a lot of open outlets. I tried the espresso which was very good, and I also tried be iced coffee which was my favorite. I would definitely come back!"
"The owner of this restaurant is fantastic. Very engaging, and interactive with the customers... Once the fun with the owner is complete.... Cafe Versailles is one of if not the best cafés in the city. My significant other and I visited recently, and they changed the restaurant's theme on the fly to make it feel more romantic. The food is very reasonably priced, and the quality is hard to beat. The crêpes are authentic and steal the show on the menu. The coffee is also fantastic. I have to say I love this place and they will be getting plenty of return visits from me."
Amazing crepes! The owners are very welcoming and it's always a pleasure to stop by.
"Stopped in the other morning and was really blown away. The food here is amazing, I had the chicken and caramelized onion crepe and it was very filling, the avocado sauce as great with it while the red ""spice"" sauce which I at first took to be salsa (I don't think it is) had a great heat to it. My dining partner loved her sweet crepe with nutella and strawberries as well as her cafe mocha. This is a very well run business where they treat customers great and serve awesome food and amazing coffee. This is a gem."
These people are positively delightful! The coffee is good. On a random Monday morning many people were sitting around at the tables enjoying themselves. Made me wish I could stick around too!
"Fantastic service, delightful customer engagement by owner and staff, the food there is absolutely delicious! Definitely going back again for the expresso and apple caramel crepe"
I had the tuna panini... So good!! Crunchy and fresh ingredients... I love the fact they give you a salad with the sandwich and it was great... Awesome flavor... The service was great too and I will definitely go back :)
"I just visited Cafe Versailles for the first time: the service was wonderful and immediately put me at ease, the mocha was PERFECT, and the chicken-pepper-mushroom crepe I had is the best thing I've eaten in 2014.  If you live in the area, you need to make this place a regular part of your life.  It will be part of mine from now on."
Good coffee
"Awesome little spot. Nothing amazing at first sight but super friendly staff, cappuccino is great and I'll definitely be getting a crepe on the way out."
Best crepes I have ever had!! I just moved to the area and we went went there for breakfast and lunch 3 times since we couldn't cook yet...simply amazing!!!  I love the quaintness and the atmosphere is unlike any little French restaurant in the area.  The 3 brothers who own & work there are so friendly you feel like you are in their personal living room.
Great menu that can satisfy either the savory or the sweet. Whatever suits your mood! Staff is very friendly and made the experience that much better.
"I feel so lucky to have found Cafe Versailles. So lucky, that after years of using Yelp this is my first review!Located a couple blocks from the Irving Park Blue Line, It made for a perfect meet up spot with a friend on the way to the airport. We split a pot of tea and two savory crepes. Oh my goodness did everything WAY exceed our expectations! The crepes are huge and quality-made and the tea was so nice. Our server was always coming back to check to see if we needed more hot water and was extremely friendly and alert. I had the most positive experience here and I will be sure to come back! Having come straight from France themselves, this place is quite a gem! GO!!"
"Food:Ingredients were fresh, and the combinations of ingredients were on point. The crepes are not traditional French crepes, thicker and also made differently (not on a pan - griddle I think?), but it works out as the thickness makes the whole thing edible as it doesn't fall apart when biting into it. It had loads of fresh ingredients - you leave feeling like you ate something substantial, which is the upside to not being traditional French crepes.Service: The server was very attentive, and not for a moment did we feel we could not get something we wanted. He was very nice with a good attitude. It was also very nice to have the floor manager/supervisor come and ask you how your meal came along.Decor:  Is odd - one side french, other side Buddha on a giant screen, other side .. Islamic? Didn't really seem to add to the experience. Overall: Highly recommend it and I will be coming back."
"This is an awesome little place on Pulaski (really cool for us since we can just walk to it). We tried both savory and sweet crepes, everything was delicious. And they have really good lattes - they use Bristot espresso, which we weren't familiar with but we're fans now. And the service is great too, the owner is really friendly, and he cooks right behind the counter, out in the open. We look forward to going back soon."
"Just what the neighborhood needed! This is a cute little place with great coffee, awesome crepes, and reasonable prices.  They also have some delicious muffins and cookies. Not sure where they get them from but the one we had today - banana muffin with chocolate and streussel crumbles on top was to die for. As of now they do not serve any sandwiches or salads, but they have a nice variety of crepes - both sweet and savory. Definitely try their house crepe - with kiwis, honey and pistachios - it's well worth the couple of extra bucks. And of course - the nutella and bananas crepe - you can't go wrong with nutella! We have also tried almost all of their savory crepes - and it would be really hard to pick a favorite - they're all delicious!They also make smoothies - although we haven't tried them yet, we have seen them being made - with FRESH fruit! They looked delicious and we'll have to try them next time.This place is great for breakfast/lunch or for an after dinner dessert and coffee. They do have free wi-fi, so if you're one of those people that like to work in a coffee shop - this place should work for you.They are still working out some kinks and the service can be a bit slow - but I'm sure they'll figure it out soon and hopefully we'll be around for a long time.If you live in the neighborhood, you should definitely check them out!"
"I can't wait to go back! Cafe Versailles is a lovely addition to the Irving Park neighborhood. My gal pal and I stopped in on a cold Sunday afternoon for some coffee and crepes. The space is very cozy, and we felt comfortable lingering for what seemed like hours! We both enjoyed a cup of steaming hot coffee that was perfect. We each enjoyed a savory crepe that was served with a delicious yet mysterious sauce - it turned out to be Sriracha! We didn't want to neglect our sweet tooth, so we shared a Nutella and berries crepe. So good!  If you're looking for an independent coffee shop that has fresh ingredients, great presentation, and friendly service, look no further than Cafe Versailles!"
"Visiting from Phoenix, this quaint stop is just what I miss about Chicago. The staff was very attentive and the food a delight. Great cup of coffee too. Bring a book or newspaper and enjoy some people watching on a lazy day."
"Had a delicious salad to go from here. The staff was friendly, the salad fresh and crunchable and full of tasty morsels... I'd go here again in a heartbeat."
"If you're in the area, you can't beat this place for their salads and a cozy, comfortable dining area."
"Kind of a luke warm review.  Good basic food, fair prices but needs a bit of development in order to suit our needs and be one of our regular haunts.Nice little place a block from my house, so quite convenient.  We just had sandwiches and tea.  Hubbs had the turkey on Ciabatta and I had the pulled chicken on focaccia.  Both were really good, fresh and generous.  We each ate half our sandwich and took the other half home.  Came with hummus and potato chips which seemed like a weird combination.  Neither of us are potato chip eaters so they got wasted, would have been better to have a bit of fruit or some vegetables to dip in the hummas.Prices were very reasonable and the guy working there was very friendly and attentive.  We asked if they had soup as we would have split a sandwich and gotten a bowl of soup each because it was a very chilly (understatement) day. They said that they can't do soup because they don't have a real kitchen and some sort of ""hood"".  As someone who regularly makes soup in a crock pot I didn't see why there should be any reason not to be able to make some sort of soup.  If they had soup and a sandwich I'd be there twice a week as they are so close by and so reasonable.They had a list of smoothies and coffee type drinks, good for Summer or coffee drinkers.  Lots of pastry type offerings for the ""coffee and cake"" crowd.There wasn't much seating so if it gets busy they won't have room for more that about 6 groups of 2-4.  The seating by the windows was sort of uncomfortable but it did have access to an outlet if you go in there to get some work done on the laptop.  There was a TV on over the bar/counter but it was showing a slide show of photos rather than a game or a movie or anything specific.  The music was a bit pervasive and annoying but hopefully it was just a CD that won't be playing every time we go in there.  Doesn't look like much from outside but is warm and inviting inside and worth going in to find out.Nice little place, shows potential.  Hopefully the neighborhood will support it and it will be there for us all to enjoy for some time to come."
This place is wonderful free wifi great food and the most amazing owner. He was honest and cared more about the service and food more than the amount of money he would make off of you. He made the experience fun and easy to try new things. I would absolutely recommend going here either with your friends or significant other. You'll enjoy great food and service.
"This is one of the very best Café, latte prepared precisely, and the crepes are also scrumptious, I tried both Savory and sweet, my family was delighted. Front of the house service is great; worth the trip all the way from Midway Airport.We will go back, looking for more!"
