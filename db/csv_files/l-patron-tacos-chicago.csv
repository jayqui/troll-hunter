L’ Patron Tacos
"I judge taquerias solely on lengua and al pastor tacos. Any other items - meh, don't care. I got  2 lengua tacos and 2 al pastor tacos for early dinner.  The lengua was quality lengua. It was very soft and moist. The al pastor, which included chunks of pineapple, was very flavorful. The char from the grill came through deliciously. There were a couple fatty pieces, but overall, the tacos were great.  The only problem I had was the wait time. It took us about 17 minutes to get 7 tacos. For a taco place, that is absurd. They need to work on getting the food out quicker, but the tacos are one of the best in the city."
This place can grow on you. Who cares about getting robbed at this cash only place. The cops love it here too. Every time I come here I order something different. They do not disappoint.
"The hubs and I came to check out L'Patron Tacos while in the area.  I'd heard that this was a favorite taco place with its numerous awards and accolades.  The menu was extensive, offering tortas, burritos, tacos, and their house special, the 'Gringo' and the 'Gringa.'  Since the 'Gringos' seemed to be of a quesadilla type, we stuck with the tacos: the Carne Asada (not the large chunks of steak that I saw from the pictures, but cubed steak; they were still juicy and had a great grilled taste to them; came with an overwhelming amount of raw onions), the Al Pastor (kind of reminded me of dwegi bulgogi; this had really great flavor, but again, too crazy amount of the sauteed onions), and the Lomo Encebollado (sliced ribeye and onions, but heavy on the sauteed onions; this had a slight mushroom-y taste to it).  While the taco meat themselves were pretty good, the off ratio of the onions to the meat was a bit ridiculous.  I am thinking to request the onions to be served on the side, so that you are in control of how much to put inside your taco.  Their red salsa was actually quite delicious, and one of the best salsas I've had - it was chunky and super flavorful, with a hint of smokiness, and great with the taco meats.  We also tried 3 of their drinks: the horchata (more on the sweeter side, but not grainy), the limeade (extremely tart, but didn't really have a lime taste to it), and their 'Sopresa' (a changing rotation of flavors, when we went, it was the watermelon - it was a tad too sweet, but it was still refreshing and watermelon-like).  I'd like to come back and try their burritos, as well as to try their tacos again with the onions on the side.  Service was super friendly, and the tacos are made-to-order; the place gets super packed during the lunch rush, so keep that in mind.  There is limited free 2-hour residential parking around the area.+overwhelming amount of onions!  Request them to be served on the side!!!+Al Pastor tacos+Carne Asada tacos+yummy red salsa+Sopresa drink (changes flavors constantly); ask for a sample!+limited free 2-hour residential parking"
"WOW.  What they might be lacking in ambiance they more than make up in taste.  FLAVOR CITY!  So delicious.  Guacamole is the freshest you can get, the meat is perfectly seasoned, and the gringa is amazing, I couldn't stop eating.Make sure you bring cash, and plenty of it, my friends.  Even their horchata was stand out good."
"Once again Yelp hooked me up with a winner! Since I officially became an L'Patron regular today, I owe this little gem a review. I'm not sure I've had better tacos anywhere & they win hands down on value. At $2.39/delightful taco it's seriously the best bargain you can imagine. There are many more items on their menu that look really great, but I'm sticking with the tacos!The Al Pastor marinated pork with grilled pineapple, onions & cilantro tacos pack an incredible punch of flavor & messiness that's worth licking your fingers so you don't miss anything. They wrap them in paper with twisty ends that helps to hold it together but it's a battle you're destined to lose to sticky fingers. The Carne Asada Steak & Pollo Adobo Marinated Chicken are very close 2nd favorites to the pork. Which one wins would clearly be a matter of personal preference. The fish taco was a little too tartary for my taste but that's literally my only minor critique. Their guacamole is made with dried cherries & who knew that would make it so delicious - but it does. They are generous with homemade chips and their red & green salsas are available at your table. Green is way spicier!You order at the counter, cash only. They call you over a loudspeaker for dine in or takeout when your food is ready and it's efficiently done. There's always bumping Mexican music that adds to the dining atmosphere. It's fun & delicious here. You should go!"
"My fiancé & I decided to go out of our way to come here and I'm SO happy we did. Quick, inexpensive food that was delicious. We tried 5 different tacos then ordered a burrito in our favorite. The fish taco and the shrimp taco are both fried (the fish/shrimp) and are topped with a creamy slaw. We both enjoyed each but we prefer pan seared/non fried seafood tacos. We also tried the chicken taco, 2 of the employees said it was their favorite- it was great! Then the beef tongue and the Ribeye + onion taco. I don't eat beef often- maybe 2-3x a year and I thought the Ribeye was pretty good. It was very flavorful. We ended up ordering the chicken burrito since that was the most pleasant overall and I'm happy we did! I'm sure the beef burrito would have also been great but neither of us eat beef often so I know it wouldn't settle in our stomach as well. Overall, great food, fair prices, and light (if you don't order with cheese it get tons of the fried options). Definitely a place to visit if your in the area! :)"
Yum. Pollo adobado. Be aware though - cash only.Nothing fancy but solid neighborhood Mex.
"The tacos here are some of the best you'll find in Chicago (and possibly America...this coming from a born and raised Texan obsessed with Tex-Mex), but the service is SO. SLOW. Seriously. Call ahead unless you want to wait a good 20-30 minutes after you order, no matter what you get. I always get the al pastor and have had the shrimp tacos too. The al pastor is out of this world delicious, and everything else I've had has been pretty good. They serve horchata and it's just right - not too sweet. The interior is nothing fancy, but a good place to sit and chow down. I do love the food but the wait really makes me angry sometimes. Won't stop me from coming back, though. Gotta get my al pastor fixes."
small little taco joint that my friend took me here and said it was good.. this place is CASH ONLY! the prices here is pretty cheap..i ordered 2 steak tacos and 2 fish tacos...the steak tacos i had was way tooooo salty.. my friends also agreed.. maybe we went on a off night.. other than that.. the steak seems to be pretty tender..the fish tacos was eh.. they were ok.. definitely had better..i do plan on giving this place another try.. hopefully they eases off that salt lol
"Pretty damn amazing tacos. Ours were loaded with the respected meats. The best of the night was the Gringo which had perfectly charred steak cuts and what I thought had an excellent flavor in conjunction with the melted cheese. It also comes with rice and beans which were both by far my favorite rice and beans I've had in any Mexican restaurant yet. The Al Pastor taco was my second favorite. I just loved the pineapples with the pork - maybe because it brings me back to my origins of tropical happiness. Ok, so yes, the tacos are incredibly oily...and everything is probably loaded with a ton of salt too, which in combination naturally makes it a heinous crime to eat....but sometimes, when you crave that delicious, beautiful carne asada taco...you're allowed to throw all that out the window.L' Patron is the place to go.Note: it is practically a zoo in there on weekend nights. Get ready to squeeze around people and wait for your food. No big deal, worth it."
"I love this place so much. I come here when I miss California (and have the energy/motivation to drive 30 minutes from Hyde Park). In order to compensate for the traveling, I often order (and successively eat) 2 meal's worth of food. Usually I feel pretty terrible once I leave because I ate wayy too much food, but oh man I love it. I ALWAYS ALWAYS get:1. Gringa: their house special with al pastor meat. First, why al pastor? Well, it's thick chunks of pork marinated with a bit of spice AND GRILLED WITH PINEAPPLES. Next, what IS the house special? It's the al pastor meat sandwiched between two corn tortillas smothered in chihuahua melting cheese. Omg. Can I just have this delivered to my lab every day? It also comes with a side of refried beans and rice that make it amazing. 2. Carne Asada torta or burrito: depending on my food, I either get more or less carbs. Both are amazing, and the torta is a nice switch up.I tend to come early to avoid the traffic and the cashier seems to recognize me since I order the same thing every time. Highly highly recommended.Oh and you can find plenty of (free!) street parking off some of the streets."
"Long line... Must be good... AND it was! Not AMAZING. But very very good. Came here because I read a article that said it's one of the best carne asada burritos in America. It was good, just didn't wow me like I was expecting. Now, the meat was Very flavorful, just a hair over cooked and  a little chewy. Next time no lettuce and tomatoes in my burrito. I don't like warm produce! I would come a get it a again just make a few tweaks!"
"Just came in tonight with the family, 4 of them kids. I'll start off by saying that everyone loved the elotes. The corn was very tender and easy to eat off the stick. They were very generous with the cheese. My husband got the Gringo and he liked it a lot. Our group agreed that the carne (steak) is the best meat choice. Also, we got guacamole and it was excellent. The dried cranberries gave a nice touch. As for the bad, unfortunately  the tacos were just ok. Actually, I didn't enjoy the fish taco at all, I couldn't even finish it because I couldn't handle the taste. I think they can learn a few tips from Del Seoul. Their fish and shrimp tacos are amazing. The horchata was great, but the limeade wasn't so great. None of the kids liked it. The service and people are very nice."
"Just ate my takeout and it was delicious. I got the Gringo and my husband had a steak burrito. We both enjoyed our choices.Yes, it's cash only and there's a sign on top of their small fridge that has their sodas and salsas.As far as parking, only cheap and lazy people complain. There's meter parking on Diversey. And there's also free street parking on California (south of Diversey). You will get towed if you park at Walgreens or ihop so don't be stupid and risk it. Anyways, we will be back as we live roughly 2 miles away :)"
I've eaten everything on the menu and the only thing I don't like is the elotes- the local  street vendors seem to have that mastered!
"Best tacos in Chicago! Delicious flavor combinations, rivaling the popular ""it"" spot in Wicker Park for sure, though this one is a take out/self serve sort of joint. All of the tacos are generously stuffed with respective meats on delicious, fresh corn tortillas! I love the al pastor and chorizo; chicken and carne asada are also good (thought I've found the latter inconsistent from visit to visit). Another must try is the house special Gringa! Holy flavor explosion in your mouth! Btw, they're cash only, so be prepared. They're busy a lot of the time during weekends and peak meals, so expect a line. You can call ahead orders, unless they're crazed in which case they don't answer the phone."
"I was wondering if I could write a one word review for L Patron to describe how great it is in so many different ways. The answer was sadly no. I am sure my wife would like me to have this talent though as she thinks I am a bit long winded.Best customer service ever. I was driving home and my wife phoned in a order for me to pick up, we had never been so she relied on L Patron for advice on what to order. The girl who she spoke with was awesome we had a excellent selection of food and she managed to put cilantro on the side for everything in a little bag so if we wanted it we could sprinkle it on. When I arrived the same girl was there she was friendly talked about the restaurant made me feel at home. The eat in atmosphere is cute pick up at counter and eat in the small dining room which is BYOB, BYOB always puts me in my happy place. People were pouring in to eat in or pick up but L Patron managed it in a orderly fashion with no problem. I saw some eat in customers order their entire meal but when the appetizers/guacamole was ready they called their name and they started with that. They have a mic on a floor stand like a band might use behind the counter they use to call your name when your order is ready I keep waiting for someone to break it down, I don't know why exactly but the mic makes me smile. Maybe it's how they grab it and lean in to it like they gonna sing but then all they say is, Johnson your order is ready.Food can be described in one word awesome, tasty, quality, homemade, flavor ok lots of one words and the list could go on. We had 2 tacos chorizo and prime rib the home made tortillas are out of this world the meat is quality big pieces full of flavor and a bargain for the price. We also had guacamole with home made chips so fresh and with some sweet and spicy to it. The chips come in a big bag to go you can see them behind the counter  in slightly greasy bags, so yummy crispy perfect salt. We also had the carne asada torta it was a winner great bread still crispy when I got home real meat flavor in the steak not salty just flavorful like steak should be. Last we had the al pastor burrito looked like a picture when we cut it in half had some kinda sweet in it I think was pineapple but not sure it had big chunks of pork and it was huge as was the torta. Great bang for your buck here lots of food and all quality. I drive by L Parton everyday on the way home from work looks like I could be eating a lot of Mexican food from now on. If only they opened for breakfast I would have 2 meals a day figured out."
"Seen this place on Chicagos best, on all those ""best tacos"" lists, so it was only a matter of time till I tried this place. Came around 9ish pm on a wednesday and there was no parking.  I took a risk and parked at walgreens, only to see a sign on the door on this place that said Walgreens and IHOP will tow your car. I got lucky, but I'm sure many people weren't in the past. I tried calling ahead of time for pickup trying to avoid this, but as I noticed once inside, If The Line is Long they will not pick up the phone  orders. The line inside went around this small establishment. Infact more people are in line then are able to eat inside. Took 30 mins to get my food.The carne asada taco was really good, Gringa was special, loved the pastor cheese and pineapple combo. Overall pretty good, but Idk why there is so much hype for this place, might be a slight on the overrated side."
"You're not dining here for the ambiance. You coming for the traditional, excellent quality Mexican food. I ordered two carne asada and one chorizo taco ($2.00 each, not bad) which were both delicious! The meat was juicy and flavorful. The freshly homemade chips are great; perfectly crunchy and not too thin or thick. Paired with their homemade guacamole it's the perfect combination."
"Everything here ranges from very good to excellent.  No duds, just gems and reliables.  L' Patron has the best fish tacos of any taqueria within city limits.  (Taco Nano in Northfield wins the suburban and overall Chicagoland categories.)  Here, they serve it with cabbage, pico de gallo, and poblano aioli, and it is damn good.I've tried nearly every single taco, and, after the fish, the best are shrimp, lomo, carne asada, pollo, vegetarian, al pastor...so, pretty much the entire menu.  Most of the tacos are two and a half bucks apiece, so this is still cheap eats despite the high quality and fancier signage than most taquerias.  Chips and guacamole are also top-notch.  And their red and green salsas make glorious little squirts of color and flavor on your chips.  The tacos do not really need them, but go ahead and indulge if you like.It used to be a very, very small place, but taking over the next storefront has quadrupled their seating capacity.  However, the kitchen remains the same size, so now the food delivery seems kind of slow.  On a Saturday at 1pm, we waited twenty minutes for our tacos, although I saw later customers getting theirs in about ten.In any case, they are worth every minute of anticipation."
I had great time here with my friends but the chairs are not comfortable enough.
"If you're looking for cheap tacos, this place is as good as it gets.  I've only been here once, so I'm not going to entirely write the establishment off, but my experience wasn't great.  I came here based off of a recommendation from a friend.While the taco ingredients were well made, especially the ribeye taco, the taco themselves had way too much grease and oil.  I remember biting into my first taco and i swear a third of the bite was just oil.  I understand that tacos aren't necessarily the healthiest things in the world, but from an establishment so highly rated on yelp I expected more.  However, this place has probably the best value for your money next to food trucks in the city."
"Amazing tacos. The Gringa and Gringo are outstanding. Lunch, dinner or bedtime snack...always a great option. I could eat here 3x/week!"
"Food taste is about 4 stars butService is okay. All staffs are nice but very very busy placeSmall place, I recommend you call ahead and to take out.No parking. No credit card CASH only placeI had to wait more than 35 mins after my order as they messed up my order as to go...it was worst time as my two babies waiting inside a car with a daddy....but food is good. I liked their fish taco the best"
This was a last minute decision to hit this very popular Logan Square taco joint. I recall my good buddy Ryan L checking into this joint on a constant basis and me being curious of how good it would be. I also checked my good friend Kyle H's review which was quite helpful.I made it over here around 7pm and the place wasn't too packed as there were a few tables open. The front area gets pretty smokey as I'm sure they are cooking up some goodness in bulk back there. Luckily my clothes didn't end up smelling like the kitchen. All tacos were around $2 and some change so I knew I would have 3. The Al Pastor is the star as Kyle mentions in his review as the pork is pretty well seasoned along with the delicious pineapple that tops it off. The Carne Asada was decent as the meat chunks were definitely bigger that what I usually get as Ryan & Kyle mentions in their reviews. The Lomo (ribeye & onion) was very juicy and oozing with flavor...almost as good as the al pastor. My date had fish and shrimp tacos and she said they were very good. The tacos were ready for consumption maybe 15 mins after ordering. I topped the three delicious tacos off with a big cup of very good horchata.Cash only joint here...there is a Walgreens that has a Chase ATM around the corner if you bank with them and don't want a fee.
Food and service was great I would definitely recommend checking out. I would order to go the dine in area is small and parking outside sucks. You can't go wrong here.
Just had quite possibly one of the tastiest veggie burritos I've ever had.  I'm definitely coming back.  Definitely give this place a try!
"I am seriously obsessed with this place right now. Went a few weeks ago and just went back the other night (I never go to the same place twice in one month). Everything is incredible. Get the chips and guac. Portion of guac is huge and chips are cooked fresh. If you're lucky they'll still be dripping with grease when they get to your table. I've never had a bad taco here but my favoring by far is the ribeye with grilled onions. 2 of my favorite foods served as a taco. Come on!! I've only been here later, 9 or so, so seating and the wait were reasonable. Prices are ridiculous. Most tacos are $2. This place is a hole in the wall dive, exactly what I want on a Friday night! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."
"I can see now where all the hype comes from. Last Friday, I was in the area checking out revolution brewery and my co workers and I needed some grub to bring. L patron was immediately suggested and delicious tacos were had. Each taco runs about 2 dollars and that is fantastic considering how popular and tasty the food is here.I orders the gringa and enjoyed the sweet pineapple and chunks of pork. Second, I ate the carne asada taco and immediately noticed how huge the chunks of steak were. It's well seasoned and the meatiest taco 2 dollar taco I've eaten. I followed the asada with a lengua taco. The meat was tender but nothing too special to note. I think if I lived in the area, I would come here weekly. The food and the prices are too good to pass up!"
"I'm sorry my Chicago friends, but I'm from Southern California and I consider myself the foremost authority and expert on all things tacos. And with that said, the lomo/ribeye taco at L'Patron is the best taco I've ever had in my life. Bar None. Full Stop. End of Discussion.  I've been to the dingiest holes in the walls, I've eaten off of taco trucks in back alleys, I've done it all, and I've had some really, really good tacos, but L'Patron's ribeye takes the top prize.  I was in Chicago this weekend and I ate there TWICE on back to back days, and thats despite all the wonderful food offerings the city has to offer.  But literally, thinking back on that now, I wish I just ate every meal at L'Patron.  I sort of want to cry because I'm sad I can't have them now. I've developed a full blown addiction off of two meals there.  I'm ready to throw it all away and ruin my career and friendships just so I can go back.Best. Tacos. Ever.GO HERE."
"This is my neighborhood taco place, so I'm probably biased just due to the number of times I eat here.  Bring cash.  They don't take credit cards.My favorite is the rib eye and caramelized onion taco, which is a little juicy but incredibly tasty.  Tacos here just come with a sprinkling of cilantro, which I hate, but since everything is made to order, just ask them to skip the cilantro if you don't want it.  Chips are divine, but I'm not a fan of the guacamole - too spicy for my wimpy Irish taste buds.  I'm assured it's amazing by those with more tolerance for spicy.The lines can be hideous, and waiting for a table is frustrating, but those are the problems that come with popularity. You can't make a reservation.  If you're coming with nine or ten people, don't get pissy when your order takes a while and you can't sit together (I've seen this happen a number of times).  This is not a sit-down-and-linger-over-food place. Order, eat, leave, because there's people waiting for your table. I order by phone, pick it up in 5 minutes, and take it home.  Don't park at Walgreens - they keep a pretty sharp eye on their lot."
Food is inconsistent.  The Carne asada can be tender sometimes or completely leathery others.  The food takes forever but the counter service is very friendly and consistent.  It's close to my house so probably will end up going back out of convenience and just hope I catch them on a good day.
"This is probably the best tacos I had in Chicago. Everyone migrates to Big Star taco joint on Damen to get their taco fix but big mistake! My friend took me here for lunch and I was blown away by how good these tacos were. From their delicious tacos, creamy orchata drink, to cheesy elote corn side to their chips & guacamole, it transported me down to Mexico. I love their location also. I highly recommend this place to anyone that want to try authentic tacos."
"LOVE L'Patron!!  Fabulous food at a really great price.  My husband & I both LOVE the poblano tacos.  I am also partial to the chorizo and the steak, while he loves the al pastor and the fish tacos.  I'm not sure you can go wrong here!  The tacos are so good, we haven't branched out to other items, but we're excited to try them.  The chips and guac are a must.  The chips are hot & fresh - the guac equally as fresh and very tasty.  And the salsa?!?!  Both red and green are amazing and really deliver on the spice.  I'm not sure which I like more!  The only negative I have is that you can rarely get through on their phone line.  We've successfully ordered carry out 3 times by phone, but have tried at least a dozen!  The last time we decided to walk in and order because we couldn't get through by phone and we waited 45 min in line for our food.  It's just that busy and good!  I would LOVE to see them fix their phone issue - they are so in demand, they might just need an additional phone line or two.  Almost forgot - CASH ONLY!!!  Make sure you have some $$ on you!"
"Don't  really see or taste the HYPE! pretty average if that , elpastor way to sweet , couldn't even taste the meat at all nothing but pineapple, the steak was way to crispy and burnt that's all I tasted was char , shrimp taco was good , elote was flavorless , had better on the street . Chicago is filled with awesome taco joints and this isn't one of them"
"UPDATE:I think our new fav is the ribeye tacos. We were fortunate enough to go on a day where it was only 99 cents per taco. We ended up ordering way extra to take home and eat (which we totally did and it was WONDERFUL). The meat is super flavorful and tender and juicy. And then you get that extra flavor with the carmelized onions OoOOh baby baby, can't get enough!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I cannot wait to bite into my tacos. It's a thirty minute wait and I'm beyond famished but I will wait for you, oh beautiful carne asada and ribeye tacos. I will wait for yoooooou. They've expanded their restaurant so now you actually have a place to sit!!!!Best tacos in town. Seriously guys."
"I loved this place when it first opened. And I still do. But, their taco prices went up since they first opened. I have one of their first menus and Tacos used to be 2 bucks and now are 2.39. Which isn't terrible but you think when a place becomes so popular you wouldn't need to raise prices? Anyways, the food is always delicious. I've learned if you go at a less busier time though you will get more meat on your tacos. If you go on a weekend or lunch rush tacos are a lot smaller. I recommend ordering over the phone unless you have a lot of time to spare made that mistake it took an hour to get my order but to be fair the line was super long!"
This place is insanely overrated. It took 35 minutes to get our food. Then my chicken burrito had completely charred pieces of fat all throughout it. Gross! Not worth the wait.
"I came in around 1:00 on a weekday and didn't have to wait long at all. The staff is sweet and the food is delish and somehow not heavy despite the amount of bread and grains. The carne asada taco was amazing - possibly the first taco where I've thought ""wow, that was amazing meat""! This is the kind of place where juice, not grease, drips down your fingers - which makes it wonderful! The chorizo burrito was great, although I see why people tend to do steak in the burritos - the texture definitely needed something a little more solid. That said, the chorizo itself was smooth and flavorful. I almost forgot my salsa halfway through the mean because it was so good as is! And the tortilla on the burrito was amazing - crispy and warm and full of meat juices! I don't know why I read some complaint about it on here! Also a perk for those who are spice-adverse: until you add salsa, these are totally flavorful but not spicy at all. And for those of us who love our spicy: spicy salsa awaits you!"
"Really great food here. The atmosphere was lively on a Friday night at 10. I would definitely order only tacos next time. The burrito was good, but it wasn't mixed around enough inside. So certain bites would be all lettuce, all carne asada, etc. The guacamole wasn't bad, but I would've expected it to be better at a place like this."
"BEST TACO IN THE CITY!HANDS DOWN!  The steak taco is delicious.  Literally day dream about it. Also the poblano pepper and cheese is phenomenal. Horchata, is great too.Very safe a lot of police presence."
"I seriously wanted to like this place and rate it 5 stars like most of the people on here, but really have experienced better food at other taquerias. I went with a group of people and the line was long, but we managed to get a table and get through the line in not too long. We ordered an assortment of tacos; carne asada, chicken, and chorizo. We also ordered guacamole/chips and a side of rice. The best part of the meal was the guacamole and chips! I was SO disappointed in my steak tacos...they were bland and left in huge pieces. I guess the venues I visit usually have it diced up. I love chorizo and know it is greasy...but, I felt like I was drinking oil when I tried a bite of this taco. The chicken wasn't bad. L'Patron wasn't horrible...but 2 stars on here is ""Meh. I've experienced better."" And that is exactly the case. I probably won't go again...but, if you do I hope you enjoy it better than I did."
Redemption is sweet!  Favorite taqueria in Chicago.  Try the corn and still highly recommending the al pastor and carne asada!
"Seriously, The best Mexican food I've ever had. The food is incredible. The bursts of flavours in the veggieTacos, the rice, and the guacamole.....insanely good. I would recommend this to anyone who really wants authentic Mexican food with more character. It's cash only, long wait but very worth it."
"They've got tacos.  Also a disco ball and disco music played to 7 or 8 on their big ass speakers.  Was pretty busy in there.  Including a couple of cops scarfing down nachos with cheese while waiting for their infinity taco plate.  Cops are a good omen if you're looking for decent quality and large portions.    Because when they aren't solving crimes, cops are generally stuffing their faces.  By trial and error they eventually find the best places.  Postmen are useful if you need directions.  That's another old school trick.L'Patron is fairly new.  They had a sign up saying what year they were established but I don't remember exactly.  A couple years old is probably fair.  Which explains alot about this place.  Like a new condo with all the latest ideas put into practice, L'Patron is a taco stand for the 2010s.   Bright, fun, fast, with a slight twist on ingredients.   No kale and quinoa mind you, but you can tell they've thought about what people want and how each dish should look when served.  And they do a decent job.If I owned taco/burrito palace #684 or was taco/burrito king #2859, I'd take my crew down to L'Patron for a team building exercise and would be like ""see, we should do it more like this"".   Then I'd bust out my best Tony Manero moves and bask in the wild applause."
"L'Patron, I absolutely adore and love you. So so so much. Probably a little bit too much. This place has the absolute best tacos in the entire city! Their steak and fish tacos are absolutely amazing. Their horchata is also fabulous.The thing to do however is to call your order in before you arrive. That way, you don't have to wait in line! Also, your food will be ready when you arrive or you only have to wait a few minutes for it to be done! This place gets crowded in the evenings!"
"My husband was craving for tacos and I could find very few Mexican restaurants in Wicker park with decent reviews. We compromised on La Pasaditas and as we were driving I googled best tacos in Chicago and that is when this restaurant hit my radar ( I found it from Chicago.eater.com). Between me and my husband we shared 6 tacos ( chorizo, shrimp and chicken) ...chicken and chorizo were freaking amazing, they had nice kick of spices and perfectly charred. The green and hot salsa on the side were also tasty.. They are the best tacos in town for sure. We are coming back for the burrito and the elotes and then again for the tacos. I would say they are comparable if not better than the ones you get at Pilsen. And don't forget to get some dineros: Cash only!!! Worth it !!!"
"I'm tempted to give L' Patron three stars for extenuating circumstances like the grease cloud of smoke billowing through the restaurant and the extremely long wait (there was no line, I was there before the lunch rush), but the food was fresh and good so I will be fair and give four. Now, let's discuss said smoke cloud. Clearly they knew they had a problem because there was a big fan set up, but no one thought to crack open a door, so the fan just blew the cloud around. It was so bad my eyes were burning and watering the entire time I was there. I don't know if this is a usual problem or a one off thing, but come on, use some common sense. I appreciate when a place prepares the food fresh and as the orders come in, but does it really take 15 mins for a shrimp taco and gringa special? And $5 for a basket of chips and salsa? hahahahahaha. NO. On a good note, the gringa was yummy. I don't eat a lot of red meat, but the steak was so good and mixed well with the grilled pineapple. A little heat and sweet, my favorite combo. There was too much cheese (for me). Like so much I ended up slightly choking on it. It's also logistically difficult to eat because it's open on all sides so stuff falls out with every bite. The two salsas were good - one green, one red. And while I thought I was ordering a grilled shrimp taco, it came out fried. But it was a light coating and the crunch really made the taco. It was my favorite and I would definitely order it again. All in all, I feel indifferent about L' Patron. If I lived in the area or worked in the area, then I'm sure I would frequent the joint, but for me, it's not a go-out-of-my-way-must-have place. But it's good, so give it a go."
Delicious!!! Made me a  vegetarian gringa! Homemade tortilla and salsa. The fam had pork and chicken tacos of which my daughter said best taco she's ever had!
"Solid guac and pico de gallo with fresh chips. The pico de gallo and guac had a sweetness to it, here and there, almost like raisins or dried cherries. Very good Al Pastor tacos and I loved the gringa which was al pastor meat and cheese between two nice and I assume home made tortillas. The al pastor was chunks of pineapple and pork. I will go back for the carne asada and it's hard to explain what's so great, the char, the texture, who cares? Loved it. Will have to try the gringo which is the gringa with carne asada instead of al pastor. I have heard this place is known for the carne asada and I can see why. Solid fish taco dressed with what reminded me of cole slaw. Solid, fresh taste. Didn't knock my socks off, but the flavor was mild by nature I think, so no criticism there. Plain decor and location. Great food."
"My one gripe is that they don't accept credit card. While waiting 15 min in line,  I was looking for a sign saying they only accept cash, and did not see one. I got all the way up to place my order and then found out. I had to go to an ATM and pay a surcharge. Once I ordered,  the wait wasn't too long and the staff was helpful and kind. I ordered 2 burritos,  chips and guacamole and a side of rice. The food was good and the guacamole was great and fresh, just not sure I'd go through the hassle of going to get cash and waiting in line again. If I drive by and there's not a line, I may consider it again in the future."
"When I look up a restaurant on Yelp, I immediately look for the bad reviews to see what people dislike so I'll try to hit on all of those areas of contention:-Wait time: Five minutes for chips and salsa, another five for the rest of our meal. This struck me as neither short, long or notable in any way.-Burrito size: Normal-Lettuce in burrito: Not enough to be noticeable and or irritable-Did I smell like a Mexican restaurant when I left?: No-Was the carne asada too salty?: NoI have zero complaints with L'Patron. I know Yelp is something of a repository for negativity so all this positive feedback is likely troubling for some of you, and for that I apologize. Although I'm sure if you go down one review, somebody likely had an overcooked piece of steak and is dying to tell you about it.Also, I've been listening to ""Blank Space"" by Taylor Swift as I write this."
"Favorite taco spot in the city/state/country. Wonderful tacos for a decent price. The wait is usually a little longer than most taco places, but it is definitely worth it. I used to live in the neighborhood and was spoiled to be so close. Even after moving, I make the trek back."
"Been there twice in a month, and I almost never eat out.  Okay, I like quesadillas but I love their quesadillas- something about their tortills (is it homemade?) and the cheese- yeah, it says chihuahua cheese and I have had that before but this quesadilla is perfection. Chips are great, friend had a burrito which looked yummy.  Yes, this is ""as good as it gets"""
OBSOLUTELY loved this place...I had a gringa omg delish the rice that comes with it was perfect.... my kids had steak tacos & we ordered guacamole. ..they loved it....definitely coming back
"What's not to love?  Awesome food, bright funky colors, pretty extensive menu, dining room, awesome prices -- hole in the wall spot, very crowded ""you know this food's gotta be fantastic since we are all standing around so crammed in here and waiting in this line"" type, great, great food!  Al pastor, shrimp and fish.  In that order.  Bring cash!!"
"Pretty good grub.   Nothing especially spectacular but solid mexican on the go.  The one thing I really liked was the option of a shrimp and fish taco, these aren't as common at taquerias.  The tilapia was a bit fishy but the shrimp was on point.  Carne asada tacos were a bit charred for my taste but the salsas were a nice compliment to the meat.  If I make it back I am curious to Try the house specialty ""Gringo"", they were making the dough on site to order and it made the place smell great  The staff was really nice but make sure you have cash on you because they don't take credit."
"the delicious smell brought me into to this fabulous place!! I literally would drive down Diversey on my scooter and be li YUMMY!! every time until finally I went in and was not disappointed at all. The food is fantastic, everything that I've had is absolutely delicious!!! I particularly LOVE that they sell elotes with cheese and chile :) The prices are great as well and the service is excellent. I LOVE L' Patron and highly recommended to anyone who loves authentic Mexican food and is also open to explore new flavors! Be aware that they are cash only!! totally worth it for the price though!"
"I heard about this place on some yahoo review.  Claimed it was a top 10 in Chicago.  Bold statement, so I had to check it for myself.  No research just went.   Ordered some tacos had a seat and it took awhile.  I was like, this is a long wait for some tacos.  Then they came.  MADE TO ORDER.  It was so fresh you could taste the HUGE difference.  Carne Asada is the best I have ever HAD!  Fish tacos were equally fantastic. Worth every second of waiting.  I will be heading back ASAP and hopefully in a few weeks, they will know me by my face when I walk in!  I LOVE a great taqueria!"
"Al pastor burrito is on point.  Seriously, the meat is tender and flavored to perfection.  Also had the carne asada tacos which have pretty decent sizes of meat in there.  The dining room is small so get there early or just hope to luck out.  I would've given this place 5 stars had it not been so obnoxiously loud from the blaring Mexican music in there that my girlfriend and I were getting a headache.  Why they feel they have to blast music and make it feel like a Mexican club stumps me.  We had to scarf our food down to get out of there for some peace and quiet of the 94 instead."
um you should probably go here
"I'd give a high rating even before I tasted the food - what a fun and friendly place! If only service could be like this at every restaurant.  They dont even wait on you - but the guys and girls behind the counter are all super friendly, funny, efficient, energetic and love their jobs.  Only been here once and got it to go - the Gringa, Chorizo Taco, and Poblano Rajas Taco were all tasty.  I was a little disappointed with the Elotes in a cup - tasted kind of like frozen corn and was liquidly.  I'd have to eat in next time and try the Elotes on a cob instead.  Definitely will go back here."
Love this place!!! Must try... Tacos are fantastic and the corn (elote) in a cup is a must!...
"A hidden gem in the middle of nowhere, L'Patron serves some seriously delicious Mexican food! When I eventually found this place, I ordered the guacamole with chips, which was amazing, followed by steak taco, chicken taco and pork taco. The flavours were fantastic and well worth the trek out here."
Stopped here on a Wednesday night after attending a rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the area. And boy am I glad I did. I dined on some of the best steak tacos in the Chicago area.I will definitely be going back to try some more items on their menu.
"This place is incredible hah.Whoa! So it's already packed at around 3pm. I ordered the al pastor taco ($2) and the lomo encebollado (on special for 99 cents). Ordered an horchata as well, and a side of rice and beans. Total $6.99.So I wait a little while for my food, and man. The first bite of the lomo encebollado. Juicy steak and deliciously marinated onions. The al pastor had chunks of pork with pineapple. The rice and beans with the added cotija cheese? Say whattt? Delicious!I would definitely come back here again! One of my favorite places so far for tacos (and I've had a lot throughout my life lol)."
"Was finally there today... the food is good but I don't know if I am willing to wait 35mins for tacos. As fresh as they claim to be I just dont see why it takes that long!Tried the asada, lomo encebollado (ribeye with caramelized onions) and the poblano pepper veggie taco. All were great and the meat was very tender however the salsas were not spicy.My other complaint is you walk out of that place smelling like a fried taco due to their poor ventilation system. There was a cloud of smoke inside the restaurant that looked like an entrance to a haunted house! Might be back but I will def order in advance otherwise I wont even bother."
"Really authentic and great tasting treat.  I had the shrimp, chorizo and poblano tacos.  Also had the rice and beans.   All fresh and perfectly prepared.   Very authentic and I recommend!!!"
"I have to recommend this place if you are ever looking for some good tacos that you mouth will be thanking you for.   I first found this place when I was working around the area. Now i find myself always returning whenever I am close by.   The staff is very polite, and you will not regret over indulging your self in the selection of food that they have. Because I don't. The tacos are awesome sauce : )And please forgive me for not ratting it a five, but i am saving that five for out of this world."
"Best taco I have had in Chicago, meats are prepared well, seasoned well.  All of them are great, the steak is excellent, the chicken is very good, the pastor is the best in the city.  they prepare their guac a bit different, I believe raisins are added, and they make a huge difference.  With the expansion, a bit more seating, but not much.  Parking can be tight, but I have always found a spot.  Cops are in their all the time, they usually go where the food is good.  Please take a day to try this, it is worth it."
"L'Patron Tacos has the absolute best tacos that I've had outside of California. I am so serious about this. Each taco that I had here was well-executed and just damn good.It is closed on Tuesdays...I learned the hard way...I repeat it is closed on Tuesdays. It is cash only. The prices are very reasonable, almost a steal. The decor is casual and the place is clean. I had the elote and had the ""off the cob"" which is the lazy person's option and it was pretty good except for I wanted a lot more flavor because the chili powder was lacking. Who cares about all of that stuff? You want to know about the tacos. All of these come with the only taco toppings that you need: cilantro and diced onions--Carne Asada: you know how most of the time carne asada is overcooked at other taco places? not here. not ever. the meat is quality and it is so tender and flavorful. Al Pastor: perfectly marinated pork with slightly crispy edges and chunks of pineappleRibeye & Onion: yes, it's a little greasy but it is sooo worth it. the ribeye has a bit of a char but juicy. the onions are caramelized and are perfect with the steak.Fish: oh man, I'm a sucker for a good fish taco. this was tasty but probably the least impressive out of all of them. it had the required shredded cabbage and pica de gallo but probably would have benefited from some salt or flavored crema.  L'Patron has sealed the deal that I'll be thinking about their tacos until my next trip to Chicago."
"The best tacos.  The way the taco is made changes based on what they have for the day.  I have had two different vegetarian tacos thus far.  One with fried eggplant another with mushrooms.  The chicken tacos are amazing too.The only draw back is the wait and that it is cash only.  But just know that when you go in and saddle up for 25minutes.  I have never been in there when it is not crowded.  Dunno what that is like.If you need a morning, midday, or night time taco this is your best bet.Price:About $3/ taco.  But if you are a cop, I notice that they give a steep discount."
Ok taco joint. Good fish tacos and al pastor. The guac is also good. Stay away from the chorizo and eating in...place is super smokey!  Another plus is that it's a cop hangout. So feel safe I guess.
"Love this place! It's cash only which means I can't come here as often as I want because I don't regularly carry cash, so minus 1 star. Other than that the food is phenomenal! I get the steak burrito, my husband gets the pork and everytime we are blown away by how good it is. The guac is just as mind blowing as the burritos so if you are feeling in the mood get some, you won't regret it!"
Everything was soooo good!  My son said it was the 'best al pastor' he's ever had!  -minus one star for the obnoxiously LOUD music.  I went with my parents and we couldn't even have a conversation.  I really hate not giving them 5 stars.  I'd love to come back - might have to order carry out.
"I love this place and tell friends and family visiting about it all the time. They have a great price, good done in vibes, and great food! My favorite on the menu is the gringa. The food is what you wished other places were like and has never disappointed."
"I love this spot - it's just down the street from my apartment and is absolutely delicious.  It's affordable and very casual - they've expanded the restaurant to have a larger seating area.  My favorites there are the lengua, al pastor, and pescado tacos.  The elotes are also wonderful.  Only cons are that the music they play is super super loud sometimes and that it's cash only.  But totally worth a trip to grab some good cheap eats. Tip: they're closed on Tuesdays."
"Surprisingly bland. Average food but at less than $3 a taco, hard to complain. Clean, nice service. I probably will go once more to make up my mind."
"The food was not very authentic tasting not even average. The service was poor, and the atmosphere and seating was extremely loud and felt like being in a sardine box. Would definitely not be returning."
"As there ARE more than a few places that I know of in Chicago with good tacos, L'Patron definitely set a new benchmark for taco standards. Came here for the first time after reading all the good reviews and wanted to verify with my own tongue.  I was fortunate enough to have had a decent appetite during y first visit here so ended up ordering 6 tacos for myself:Chorizo, Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Lengua, Fish, and Chicken.I think it literally took me less than 10 minutes to consume all 6 tacos because they were all so delicious.  If I had to add my only gripe, I'd say, the fish taco ended up being a bit soggy for the fish being deep fried.  It also did not help that I waited to eat this taco last.  Nevertheless, I am so glad to have gave this place a visit and will definitely be coming back more in the future."
Great place to get some quick delicious Mexican food.  Try the Gringo/Gringa and take some rice and beans to go. You won't regret it.
"My sister watches too much tv. Now that we've got that outta the way, let me tell you why I'm glad she's glued to the boob tube... L'Patron Tacos.  She watched an episode of Chicago's Best on the DVR and twenty four hours later we were gobbling down tacos. (Just kidding about the whole too much tv thing. I just needed an opening line.)Here's what I learned during my first visit at L'Patron:Don't park in the IHOP parking lot across the street. We did, figured out this was a bad idea and had to move the car during our 35-ish minute wait for our food. The wait. It didn't feel all that bad except that we arrived hungry having planned on this whole taco extravaganza. But the people watching was fantastic, so the time moved pretty quickly. The people. The staff were polite overall, but not really helpful when it came to the menu and the couple of questions we had. They will hand you your drinks (jarritos, 7-up, etc.) when you order the food, but if you're like me, you'll be done drinking before the food arrives. So ask them to give you your drinks with your food. They'll do it. :-)Drinks. It's BYOB. Lots of wine and PBR all around. There is a counter with some pub style chairs and maybe eight or ten two/four-top tables and chairs. Snag those suckers when you can. The family friendly vibe was going on well after nine pm on a Friday and we almost didn't have anywhere to eat. There were a lot of people with their kids here. Also, I think there was a sink at the back of the dining area you could use to wash your hands, but I didn't get close enough to determine if that's why it was there or not. Kinda cool. Kinda weird. It's noisy. I'm not complaining, but know that this isn't really somewhere to bring great-grandma for a nice quiet dinner. Unless she's into that sorta thing. The food. I loved the ribeye/onion and the al pastor tacos!  The ribeye were messy and loaded with flavor. The al pastor had a ton of large pieces of pineapple and the pork was nice and lean. The shrimp and the fish tacos fell short for me. Both were breaded and loaded with toppings that made the whole thing a mushy mess - I have texture issues. The fresh guacamole and chips are worth going back for (like I almost did this morning when I was in the area again...).  The Gringa - I had a bite. It was delicious and served on fresh made tortillas. The tacos were not served on the same tortillas. Those were boring tortillas while the Gringa was quite good. I loved that the cheese didn't take over the whole dish, so it is something I would consider ordering for my own next time. It was easy to get a carryout container for the few things we didn't eat. Overall, it was a definite success!"
"Absolutely LOVE this place. Best tacos, hands down... And I KNOW TACOS. Only issues is they are cash only and always slammed... Worth the wait .."
"I've officially given up on this place. 2 for 2 on too salty, burned carne asada anything.  Rice and beans, salsa, and pickled veggies are still good but that's not a reason to eat here. I have had a couple great experiences about 6 months ago but something has changed for the worse when it comes to the quality of the cooking of the meat."
"This was our favorite discovery on our visit to Chicago! The food was fantastic and the service was the friendliest I have ever experienced anywhere! We were obvious tourists in a neighborhood restaurant but were treated like family. I advise all tourists to step away from the tourist traps of the Magnificent Mile and experience some real authentic food like this. I recommend the Gringo, the guacamole, and the rice water!Can't wait to visit again!"
The guacamole is missing some flavor and is basically fresh avocado. The gringa house special has too much cheese for my taste and you can not taste the al pastor meat. We will come again and try regular tacos.
"Tacos are great. That's where it ends. Cash only signs should be located at the front door, cash register, and menu. The cash only sign is on top of a cooler leading into the dining area. When they get too busy they don't answer the phones for carry-out orders. Ordering tacos shouldn't take 30 mins. Considering there is no free parking in the area they should figure out a way to speed up the service to at least 15 mins in and out."
Nest damn tacos and horchataI've ever had in chicago. Especially the pork and shrimp.
"A friend told me about L'Patron having great burritos so I thought I'd check it out with him. I ordered a steak burrito and he got al pastor, I was so disappointed ): the meat to lettuce ratio was WAY off and it was like a small portion of meat off to one side and the rest was lettuce. The meat and how it's seasoned was on point though. Since the burritos are cut in half we traded a half so we could try both. The al pastor was a little too much flavor, it got a bit overwhelming eventually.So why 4 stars? Because their tacos are *heart emoji*. Some of the best tacos I've had in Chicago, especially the fish tacos! The salsas make them taste even better. Lots of flavor and fresh toppings.*cash only*Also, BYOB :)"
"Their food is amazing and consistent (and avocado comes in the burritos, AWESOME). Cash only, gets super crowded and cramped, and parking is a bit rough. But they even have a sink in the dining room in case you have a messy meal, which I think is clever. Entrance is the eastern door (closest to California ave). If you don't have cash, hit up the Walgreens next door for some gum or something and get cash back with your debit card. This food is worth the extra effort."
Great scratch made food!  Always a phenomenal choice to dine here.  Tortillas are made fresh to order.  It's just one of those places where you can tell they just do it the right way.
"Soooooo good loved the tacos de pollo + of course ASADA!!!  Good Guac, next time I'll request it a bit spicier .. Haha!"
"L'Patron scored one of three--umm, what's the word...coveted?--Chicagoland spots on FiveThirtyEight's enjoyable but (puzzlingly) lightly data-driven Best Burrito Bracket. Lead burrito correspondent Anna Maria Barry-Jester (boy, that's a mouthful) hasn't written the official review yet, nor did she give any insight into why L'Patron was chosen in the initial bracket beyond the VORB score.And if this is all Greek to you, see hyah (fivethirtyeight.com/feat…).In any case, I'll write an advance preview for L'Patron, a cash-only hole in the wall taco joint located on the periphery of Logan Square. To be frank, the food is decent but the service sucks.A hole in the wall taco joint should do two things well: make cheap, delicious tacos (or burritos, quesadillas, gringas, what have you), and get them to you quickly. L'Patron kind of does the first thing well. We've had the gringa, the tacos, and the burritos here, along with a chugful cup of very sweet horchata. The burrito, since that's what's all the rage, is tasty. I really like the tortilla, which has holding power while providing the right amount of chew. The carne asada has a good char but is light on taste, while the al pastor is a tad too sweet but otherwise tasty. Ingredients are sparse, and particularly light on the avocado.The biggest complaint here is a completely dysfunctional kitchen, with poor communication between the front and back offices. We've been twice and seen the same issues, and I'm not sure there's a third time charm left in me. The food is made to order, but takes way too long to get prepped. It seems like the cooks are content to make one order per time instead of creating proper operational efficiency. And even though that's how things feel, the orders consistently come out incorrect.Almost mind-bogglingly, L'Patron's ordering system has its cashier write the EXACT TIME OF ORDER right on the ticket that she'll hand you after you pay. Thus, you know precisely how long the kitchen is taking to get you your fast food. Our last visit? A not-so-cool 25 minutes. For burritos. The powers that be at Chipotle would have thrown a conniption.If L'Patron's burritos were staggeringly good despite head-scratching service--see Gatlin's BBQ in Houston--I could reason giving a plus grade on food alone, provided you learn the system and appreciate the wait time while getting a smile with your service. But L'Patron is no Gatlin's. And if I had my advice hat on, I'd tell you to call ahead, and check your order before you leave."
"This place is great. Amazing horchata and the burrito was awesome. I think next time I will try the tacos because they are raved about.Be prepared to wait a long time in line and a long time for your food. Seems like the front emploloyees dont communicate well with the kitchen, which is why it takes so long for the food to be done. I would avoid it here on Thurs-Sat because the wait to food time is pretty long. Overall great food. no frills place."
One of our favorite Chicago spots! The carne asada is the best around and everything is cooked perfectly. The gringo is amazing!! Friendly staff and quick service. We always get it to go as the music is usually too loud.
Damn !!!That's good!But... Honesty .. It's tasty :)Steak burrito was fresh and warm and tasty and meat was tender and delish And there sauces are fucking remarkable !Make sure to get extra red sauce;)Will go back
"My meal here was yet another justification for the existence of Yelp. L'Patron is a hole-in-the-wall near Lincoln Park that I never would have known about. On my way back to O'Hare, I needed an urgent lunch at 2 PM and this happened to be near the highway. What a treat.Based on other reviews, I don't know if we lucked out or it was just the time of day, but service seemed pretty quick for made-to-order food. We had everything in about ten minutes.After eating La Gringa (you have a filthy mind), the al pastor, the carne asada, and Mexican corn, I can safely say that this place knows how to make a dish. Each item had more flavor than the next. I inhaled everything and was a happy man on my flight home. These are legit.Cash only."
"Being a Texan, my search for a great taco began the second I set foot into this great city. Walked up to the obnoxiously bright orange building and new it was going to be great. I ordered the guacamole which came with dried cranberries. Fantastic. The al pastor and veggie (garlic, roasted potatoes, and spinach with beans and rice base) tacos were exceptional!!! Salsas are house made and yummy."
Cash only!  Inexpensive and they have delicious Carne Asada Burritos (and it comes with avocado)! Must try. It also goes great with the green hot sauce that they have available. Seating is limited and they don't take reservations. I must go back!
"Dear l'Patron, It is with a heavy heart that I must break up with you.  I used to love you so much, but recently, it seems that you've changed.  Maybe it's because all the cool kids started to like you, or because you got a fancy makeover.  I don't know exactly what it is, but I just wish the old you would come back.  TonIght,  you served me the worst burrito I have ever had (including burritos I have gotten from late night places)  The chicken was burnt to a crisp, salty and dry.  The burrito shell itself was charred and tasted terrible. Ironically, the shrimp taco I got along with the burrito was soggy and cold, which leads me to believe that you assembled it first, while my poor burrito was left burning on the grill.   Sorry l' Patron, until you get your act together, I think it's best if we go our separate ways."
"Outstanding.  I cannot wait to return to this restaurant.  It's quick style service.  The tacos were delicious.  I need to try more items on the menu.  I had the chicken and steak tacos--both tasted amazing.  My guest and I also shared a guacamole.  The guac was great and unique.  It had craisins in it.  I can't wait to return! Also, the horchata is excellent.  Very cheap.  $2 per taco!"
"L'Patron is the real deal. Great tacos at a fair price, quick and clear service, I like it! Stopped in here instead of waiting 2+ hours for hot dogs nearby (RIP Doug's!) and glad we did. Step up, order your food, pay, then get a ticket and have a seat. They call the orders by name on a microphone, which is so nice! We enjoyed:- Al Pastor- the STAR! Pineapple paired well with the seasoned pork. My fave.- Lengua- Very tender, nice. Needed a little hot sauce to bring flavors out, but I liked it.- Carne Asada- big chunks of seasoned steak, it was good. - Rajas- Very tasty and interesting. My first time trying this in a taco, maybe I smothered it with too much green sauce, but the pepper itself seemed to have a kick!I went during weekday lunch, so the line wasn't too crazy. Cash only. Great place in Logan Square, and I'll be back!"
"Pretty small place so be prepared to wait a bit but worth it.I tried their house special ""la gordita"" and an al pastor taco and both were amazing.They are cash only but their prices are pretty fair.I loved their salsas (both the red and the green), they paired well with everything I ate."
"I want to like the food here. Really, I do, but it's become so bland since a few months after they opened. Not to mention the portions have become incredibly small. Who thought tacos that could be eaten in a bite and a half were a good idea? Plus, it's always ridiculously crowded, so forget about popping in for some quick carry-out, because you're going to be waiting a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes for your order."
"This place is a godsend.  My wife and I moved up from Pilsen and after about a week I'd wake up crying in the middle of the night clutching at tacos that weren't there.  L'Patron to the rescue!  I had heard tales of this place even back when I was on the south side, and it didn't disappoint.  The location is small and very frequently packed.  If you're in a hurry, I'd recommend calling ahead to order.  Once you arrive you'll be in a long line of hungry patrons.  The staff belts out orders on a microphone and manages a large number of orders quickly and efficiently. I have to say, in my many times there they have never messed up a detail of an order of mine, so kudos guys!  Be prepared with cash as that's all they accept and get ready for some delicious food.I've tried a number of things off of the menu although the thing I come back to order again and again is the steak burrito with an obscene amount of their delicious salsas.  I also frequently get their chips which are made fresh for each order.  Their fish tacos are also some of the best I've had for that price range in Chicago, but I'm personally a bigger fan of the tortillas for the burritos than the tacos.  If you like that kind of corn tortilla though, be not afraid, they are made fresh there as well and I know many other people who can't shut up about their tacos.  My wife and parents go nuts for the Al Pastor, which is flavored with pineapple and also very flavorful and delicious.  The Chorizo is also very tasty, but a few times I've been there its been a little too oily, so I tend to shy away from it these days.  As a side note, HOLY SHIT THOSE TORTAS LOOK DELICIOUS AS HELL!!  I've only admired them from a distance, but I'll be arranging a more intimate meeting in the near future.L'Patron gives you a great meal at a great price.  Definitely one of the best burritos I've had in Chicago, their salsa is flavorful and delicious, their chips are fresh and crisp, and the staff is fast, efficient, and friendly.  Good food lives here.  Come get some."
"I've only been here twice, because El Habanero and Taqueria Moran are so much more convenient for me, living near Palmer Square. But both times I have been blown away by how delicious the tacos are - my preference is for the Al Pastor. They are worth the wait, which you will most likely have to experience if you come here at peak times."
This by far the BESTEST & GREATEST tacos I ever tasted in my life. You have to come and try them out!!!!
"The service at the counter is always friendly and efficient. If you see a long line - don't get discouraged, it moves quickly and the food is worth it. I love the carne asada burrito and fish tacos. They don't start grilling the steak until you order - so you may wait a few minutes but it's always hot and fresh."
"Arguably my favorite Mexican spot in the area.  The food is simply fantastic, period. ""The Gringo"" is to die for and the shrimp tacos are delicious as well.  Go for the chips & guacamole if you have a little extra room to spare. The setting is very casual and lines tend to get quite long depending on the time of day. Cash only. Also, there's a large speaker that is typically blasting mariachi tunes and simultaneously used to advise customers when their order is ready...a little loud for my taste, but this is all part of the L' Patron experience."
"I had been meaning to try this place for a while and finally got the chance this weekend. I wasn't disappointed! This was definitely some of the best quick, low-priced Mexican food I've had in Chicago.My friend and I tried a bunch of different things. My favorite was probably the carne asada taco, but the pollo adobado and poblano rajas tacos were great as well. Every item packed a ton of flavor into each bite. The chips were great--light and crispy with the perfect amount of salt, and the guacamole was flavorful with big chunks of fresh avocado. The Gringo, kind of like a mix between a taco and a quesadilla I guess, was delicious at well. The steak was moist and tasty, while the corn tortilla and cheese had an eggy quality to them that really worked. I also really enjoyed both of their hot sauces. The green was spicy yet still full of flavor, and the red was less hot but unique and very good.Overall, we had a great experience there, and I can't wait to bring more friends to L' Patron!"
"Great taco joint!  My son just discovered this place about a month ago.  We have all been visiting ever since, yummy!  I'm a big fan of their steak and el pastor tacos!  I also like the gringo and the gringa.  Remember, the ""gringa"" is the one with el pastor meat and grilled pineapple.  I'm still working my way through their menu, and have enjoyed everything I've have tried.  They even have better than average rice and beans for your sides.  We'll be back soon!"
"I love love love their fish tacos!! My boyfriend and I have ordered takeout from here quite a few times, and we generally always get the fish tacos. We always order when we are about 10 minutes away so that they can prepare it and when one of us walks in to pick it up, it is usually just getting put together into the bag and is about ready to be picked up. Portion sizes of each individual taco is pretty great too. I have had their chicken and their steak tacos, as well as their steak burrito. By far the best place ever to go to for tacos.It is a small place, even with an area for dine in, but seeing as they are always moving and always busy, its a great sign that their food sits at a specific standard. Cash only is the best way as well.The ladies behind the counter that prepare the bags and run the cash register are sweet girls, and they are always nice to customers. They do not skimp out on the salsa either. I always ask for a couple of each the red and green salsa, and I always get enough to the point where I could put a whole red and a whole green container on one taco, and then still have left overs for the next day or two for other meals I make. Great place, have been ordering from them for years now, and I wouldn't go anywhere else in the nearby area."
"Outstanding burritos and chips. They get real busy and youll know why once you try the food. Friendly front end service too. Food tastes fresh and well seasoned. If you like mexican food, go here."
"Best Al Pastor in the city!  The combination of smokey, pineappley, porky goodness just makes me want to order more right now.  And if you aren't a pork fan the steak and fish are great, too!  I usually stick with a couple tacos and gringa / gringo with a side of elote.  The salsas are also very flavorful and fresh.  My only minor criticism is they could provide a salsa that is more spicy to fully compete with taquerias on the west coast.  It is a great spot.  Two tips:1. bring cash 2. make sure you call in your order since the place always has a line!"
"Raving reviews, cheap tacos, late hours.  I couldn't resist going there immediately. Bright neon green tacqueria immediately catches my eye, and with such a small space, the handful of people coming in and out made my boring post work night come alive.Tacos, at $2 is typical. CD sized tacos were generously filled with meat. Al Pastor - chunks of pork, a bit sweet like bbq.Lomo - chunks of ribeye - very juicy and tender.Fish taco - spicy slaw, wished it was crunchier.Elote in a cup - cooked corn with crema, crumbled queso and chile. Eat this before tacos. It tasted weird afterwards.Horchata - very sweet, creamy. Perfect pairing to any spicy meal.Overall, I'm a fan and look forward to more. I think I'm leaning towards Asadero in North Center for Al Pastor though."
"BEST FISH TACOS EVERRRRRRROnly downside is cash only - BUT they just recently expanded and bought the place next door so more room to sit down and eat in if you want. Honestly, I would eat their fish tacos everyday.Call ahead to avoid a long wait. Orders are usually ready within 10 minutes.Love it!"
"The carne asada was WAY too salty. The al pastor was different than I've had before, sweeter, kind of pineapple-y maybe?Guacamole comes with dried cranberries on top. Pretty good portion for the price, compared to other places. Chips were hot with the perfect salt ratio.Eat here so you can take advantage of the tasty free sauces (red and green). Sometimes they're on the tables but you can always ask. We used a ton on the leftover chips after the guacamole was gone. Yum!"
"This is a great spot! We went on a Friday evening at around 6:30. There was a line, but it moved pretty quickly. The (few) seats were filling up so I grabbed us a table while my boyfriend waited in line to order. We got an order of chips and guacamole (which came up first) and a variety of tacos (steak, chicken, pork, and shrimp). The chips were hot and salty (freshly made) and tasted great with the green salsa and guacamole was chunky and fresh. We probably waited 10 minutes for the chips/guac and another 10 for the tacos. I had steak & chicken tacos and both were really fantastic. Tender, lean, flavorful chunks of steak and well seasoned, slightly crisp chicken. My boyfriend said all of his were great but that shrimp was his favorite. We had horchata and a coca-cola. Nice walk from Logan Square! Can't wait to return."
"So we had intended to eat at Hot Doug's and panicked when we saw the line was around the building... We turned around and found L' Patrons... And figured it's worth a shot.Yeah it was! I had the steak burrito with everything and an elote (corn on the cob smothered in cream, crumbled cheese with chilli powder)... Soooo delicious. The salsa verde was so fresh and tasty - as was everything else.Only complaint was from the person who ordered the fish taco... Apparently it was soggy and seasoning was not very robust.  Since I did not taste this, I'm not including that in the rating... Just figured it would be good to know to eat that first if you order it - for a better experience.The downside to the restaurant is that the ventilation is not very good; and therefore you'll leave smelling like a hibachi grill.  Not so great if you're dressed in a biz suit."
"Great Al Pastor tacos! Highly recommended! Everything is fresh, made to order. Small seating area, great ambiance and music playing in the background. Street parking always available."
"I went here twice last week. The ingredients are incredibly fresh. I noticed my vegetarian tacos had sliced roasted potatoes, beans, rice and avocado and spinach in them. Everything is exceptionally tasty and covered in *roasted garlic oil*!My dad got the carne asada (roasted steak) ""gringo"" special and said it was savory and well done. The rice and refried beans that came with the special were also well seasoned but a bit on the salty side. My quesadilla was a bit bland--both cheese and tortilla were a bit flavorless; the tortilla was sort of cardboardy in fact. That's the only complaint.Highly recommend this place for the fresh ingredients--even the salsa tastes more like tomatoes. just anticipate a longish wait of about 20-40mins because it's cheap and busy at dinner time, but they call your name out on a microphone. It's also a bit smokey in there so don't wear your best clothes."
"Saw this place on Chicago's Best and was hyped to taste their food. Decided to get a steak burrito and it was so so. The meat tasted ok but the lettuce tasted and looked old. The salsa verde was spicy, which was good. Overall from the burrito I'll give them 3 stars for now. Wish I would've gone with tacos instead but there's always next time."
"Excellent service, food and drink. Innovative and flavorful. Plenty of vegetarian options. Don't let the long lines and longer wait times deter you from trying this popular taco spot. Keep in mind everything is made to order and don't forget to bring cash and your favorite booze. Buen provecho!"
"The two times I have been here, I got a couple tacos to go and enjoyed them in the comfort of my best friends apartment around the block. This food is muy authentico and I will be returning. sidenote: I will not be getting the horchata again. ( a little too sweet for my liking)"
"A little dive Mexican restaurant that will hit the spot!! Tacos go from $2-$3, tortas go from $5-6, basically all the food is very well priced in terms of quantity as well. 1.  Get the gringas. For sure. Grilled marinated chicken with sautéed onions in a sweet sauce covered with cheese and put between tortillas. Comes with delicious beans and rice. Can become a meal for 6 bucks!!2.  Fish/pescado tacos were just as delicious. Very decent size too. Three-Four tacos could become a full meal. 3.  If you are picking up call the order ahead of time. Otherwise there is seating to spread out and smash some tacos!!"
"One of my favorite places in the area, if not my favorite. The ribeye and onion taco or burrito is seriously delicious, and the red salsa they serve makes every dish a winner. The guacamole was good, and the chips with it were tasty. The only thing I haven't liked from there was the fish taco. It was just very bland."
"I had always confused L'Patron to be this campy Mexican joint with its neon green exterior and orange awning that's probably struggling to survive hanging right off the Kennedy. I was poorly mistaken. After learning that the chef/owner was a former veteran of Topolobampo with culinary chops, I made the trip.My order: carne asada burrito, side of elotes, and rice & beans. For an incredibly cheap price, you're eating a top-notch, perfectly grill-marked burrito which lends itself to clean and straightforward flavors (none of this out of proportion Chipotle burrito bite that's all sour cream and lettuce). I will say, though, the elotes were a bit much - too rich. I could've had a single bite and been happy; though, this may have been a product of taking the order to go.L'Patron is a bit of a hike, but it's worth traveling for if you're really jonesin' for a solid burrito. Considering it's more for a casual meal, just wish it would be a little more accessible."
"Came here around 7pm on a Saturday night. It was packed with people waiting for take out and the restaurant was handling it expertly. We were able to put in an order instantly and grab a table for two right away. They called our names for our order within 15-20 minutes. For two people we paid $30 for 9 tacos, rice&beans, half a avocado and a medium horchata.Horchata was amazing though very sweet. Good tacos were the chorizo, pastor, rib eye and lengua. Fish tacos are better at Big Star. Best factors: fast service and the above foodMinimizing factors: not the best tacos I've ever had. Also they charged my boyfriend $.39 extra on each taco for an added item, even though he didn't get any additions."
"Yes! I want to compose and elegant, smart statement but all I can come up with is AMAZING OMG. The food tasted like it came straight from my abuelita. Prices were fair and for the portion there were no complaints there. The only negatives I can point to is the music was so loud my friends and I practically had to yell to talk to each other and they only accept cash.Overall I would absolutely recommend the food!"
"Really busy here on a Saturday night.  The chips and guac were excellent, with piping hot chips made to order with the cold guac, yummy!  We tried tacos only: chicken, steak, poblano pepper, and tongue.  All tacos were good, but very greasy.  Horchata is delicious, cash only. Tacos were kind of chewy and tough, could gave used more fresh cilantro for sure. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, there's better places IMO."
Cannot believe I've never eaten here before. The steak tacos are phenomenal! Actual pieces of meat- it's not shredded up and burnt. Juicy large chunks of delicious meat! The flavor was on point!!!! They give you free MexiCAN escabeche if you like it- I highly recommend it it's seasoned deliciously. My kids had tacos and my friend has ride and beans. I tasted the beans and they were great! Overall delicious food at a great price- 5 of us ate for $27 with drinks! Can't wait to go back and try more food!!!!!
"Yea not bad, but that is all I will say just not bad, and definately not acceptional.  Being a south sider that lives right by Pilsen, Little village, and all the southwest side, I have become very picky about tacos, burritos etc.... because I have had some of the best Chicago has to offer, some places many people do not even want to bother to check out.I ordered the steak burrito.  I chose steak as the meat because I heard the streak is the thing to order.  I was disappointed to be served this tiny baby burrito for $5.49.  This burrito is meant for the faint of appetite, and fits in great with the neighborhood of Logan Square that is loaded with people that watch their figures.  I watch my figure but not that much to the point that I need a baby burrito.  The steak was good but kind of bland slightly, but not real bad, it had a decent taste, but decent does not cut it for me.  The steak pieces were cut too large; therefore, there was not steak throughout the burrito, so when I got down to the bottom, it was all just tortilla and veggies.  I did indeed like their veggies inside the burrito as it was fresh tasting and a nice concept as opposed to the usual fillings, now I can see why the vegetarian menu is so raved about.  I am sure they have a bad ass vegetarian menu; however, I am no vegetarian so that will not work for me.  The salsa was good, I preferred the green sauce which had a nice burn to it, but mainly an after burn.If you think this place is cheap you are dead wrong, because for $5.49 you are supposed to get a burrito nearly twice the size.  This is like a froo froo taco place in a trendy neighborhood, I will pass for this place.  My true rating would be 3 stars but I know that would not be fair to the actual quality.  This place definately should not be on ANY top lists.  If you want top 20 material for Chicago do not come here!"
Not much to say but bring some cash because they do not take credit cards or checks at this place.  Great authentic Mexican food!  The pico and guac had us coming back for more the next day.  Chicken tacos were my favorite out of the 4 kinds we tried.
"The tacos here are pretty good.  I would not normally leave a review as this place has a ton of them already.  I can see how the wait to order could be borderline unbearable as there vestibule where you order is also where you would wait for your food.  The space that I speak of is approximately 20' X 7'.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I came here after 2 in the afternoon to avoid crowds.  I subtracted a star because the al pastor has pineapples in it.  Gross."
"OMG #myloveforallothertacoplacesdiedwheniatehere. Seriously, some of the best tacos in the city. Also, the best horchata I've ever had.Fish tacos are my favorite but everything is really good. Just go here."
"Can I give it 10 stars??? This place has THE best carne asada!!! It is marinated and grilled to perfection!! I wouldn't change a thing!! Also, they have THE best orchata!! Not a watered down mess. They also have amazing infused waters. Everything I have tried so far is  phenominal. I need to try the rest, but the stuff I already know is good I can't help but order every time! They are always super busy, but I wouldn't expect anything less. They are also extremely nice! They are going to start selling salads and we had the privilege of trying one the other day and omg is was SOO good!! And the homemade dressing, YUM!!!! The salad fed a family of 4 with seconds, and they gave it to us on the house! I can't brag about this place enough that is a stones throw from my home. I'm so lucky!! Haha"
Love this place!!!  I've been coming here since they opened and I have never had an issues! Best tacos and love the staff! My favorite is the homemade tortillas and the different veggie tacos! You must try this place if you haven't already! I will always be a L'Patron customer !!!! The owner just needs to make my flan already :) thanks !
"The food is amazing.  We ordered the steak burrito, fried fish taco (can be grilled also), al pastor tacos, chicken tacos and guacamole.  Everything is made to order.  Everything is very affordable.  The chips are made to order.  This is the best taco restaurant in IL."
"Wow, lengua was spot on. It was so tender and flavorful. Best I've had in Chicago and I've tried a bunch of places. The lengua hands down beat the carne asada which was good but somewhat tough and chewy. Try the lengua - you won't be disappointed!"
"The lengua taco was the best taco I've had in a long time. The hot sauces and pineapples really complimented the meat, which was just the right mix of fatty and meaty. I also has two other kinds of tacos, but while those were also delicious, the lengua taco is still my true love. Only thing to remember that they are cash only, because I totally didn't know this and I so I couldn't get as many tacos as I had wanted to."
"Hallelujah! Mexico has arrived, authentic as it gets. Great prices for the food you received. The gringa was great and very filling, wish it had a little bit more meat and cheese but delicious overall."
Pretty good food a step above the average Chicago taqueria but not quite a bargain and all the atmosphere of a check cashing store.  I'd willingly go back sober and would be downright excited to go back after a few drinks which really is all you can ask of any quick service Mexican restaurant.  Recommended.
"Best vegetarian tacos I have ever eaten. We went here on Fri night - and the place was packed. This is literally a hole-inthe-wall kind of place. Luckily, there was no line or wait. This is a small place... if you are looking for a romantic Fri date night place with ambient light and atmosphere, this place ain't it. And be fairly warned, if you are eating in the place you will be smelling like a fried taco yourself by the time you get out. We ordered veggie taco of the day - garlic potato, spinach tacosVeggie jalapeno taco Chicken tacoFish taco The Veggie tacos were off the charts. Especially the garlic potato taco - it was a flavor explosion in the mouth. The two salsas that come complementary on every table were very good. The green one packs quite a punch. The other veggie taco was delicious as well. The chicken taco was not very good... it looked like the chicken was deep fried (lot of grease) and the meat was not moist and flavorful. Not my fav. The fish taco was good - everything that a good fish taco should be. My only complaint, the fish was a little too greasy and it did not blow my mind like the veggie tacos did.I would definitely like to come back and taste other tacos and burritos at this place."
"My boyfriend and I came here one night after hearing awesome reviews from his cousin.. small business packed with LARGE FLAVOR!! let's see I got a few tacos I know one was lengua because I ALWAYS have to try the lengua, Anywho it was delicious the steak is nice big steak slices. We placed an order for their guacamole and chips... yowza amazing. My boyfriend was very content with his burrito, can't wait to go back to this gem. Cash only is the only downside.. you will just need to make an extra stop at the bank before you get here,  trust me you will not regret it!"
"We took a day trip to Chicago to visit some friends and I had a jonesin' for some Mexican food. Not the kind I get at Bel Air Cantina in Milwaukee, but legit Mexican food. I did a Yelp search and this is what we decided on.There isn't a lot of seating when you go in. It's along the register counter and facing the window, but you can do takeout. There is parking along the front of the building that wasn't filled and a couple of street spots on the adjacent residential streets.We were all glad that I found this little gem, because for the price we paid for the food we got, we'd definitely go again.I ordered chips and guacamole and a fish taco and my significant other ordered a poblano burrito and elote, and our friend ordered the gringa.The elote and poblano burrito were perfect. The burrito was huge (think Chipotle) and it was filled with warm perfectly cooked ingredients...the veggies were crispy, and flavorful.The chips I ate were pretty good. They weren't the best chips I've ever had, but the guacamole was fresh and wasn't overloaded with garlic or other spices - so I liked it a lot. My fish taco was tasty because it had a piece of battered fish that wasn't dry or too crispy, it was perfectly cooked and was not drowning in sauces.Our friend said the gringa was delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were flavorful. The service was quick, the food was amazing and we'd even pay more. Total for all three of us was $25. What a bargain.You can pay a lot more to eat at a fancy Mexican place in Chicago that will be good, but I'd pay a lot less to go to L'Patron Tacos for great food :)"
"First of all, it took FOREVER to get our order of 2 burritos, a taco and an order of chips and guac. The place was busy, but I wouldn't describe it as SLAMMED.The guacamole was tasty, but the carne asada was relatively flavorless and the lengua was a bit chunky. My burrito was about 70% lettuce, which totally ruined the texture and flavor profile. To make matters worse, it was clearly underfilled, and I ended up with a couple of mouthfuls of nothing but flour tortilla folded over on itself.I'm still searching for my go-to taco/burrito place in the Logan Square area, but this place does not hold a candle to La Pasadita, down on Ashland (which is still my gold standard). I'd rather go a little bit out of my way and eat there instead."
"More like 3.5 stars but I'll just give it a 4. Price is cheap but its much smaller than the tacos I'm accustomed to. We ordered 1 carne burrito, 3 fish tacos, and 1 carne taco for take out. We wanted to eat there but it was packed and the other side was closed for a party. By the time we got home, the fish was already soggy.The carne burrito was amazing. I can't wait to come back and eat the fish taco fresh!"
"Great option for pescaterian /vegetarian1. Releno taco, 2. Fish taco, 3. Veggie taco, 4. Home made tortillas, 5. Fresh. Just discovered this gem."
"Omg pastor tacos are scrumptious. Guacamole is fantastic, they put dried cranberries on top..wtf, who thought of this? Give that person an award!"
"I'm obsessed with tacos and this definitely met my standards.  Best chips and sauce I've ever had.  I ordered steak (carne asada), shrimp, and pork (el pastor) and they were all phenomenal. It's also BYOB!"
"Hands down one of the best Mexican places I've been in the city - and as any Chicagoan knows, they're are a lot. L'Patron does the classics better than the rest and is still able to throw their own unique touch on each dish. I used to work close to here and I miss it so much. Whenever I drive into the city I try and time it so that I have an excuse to stop off near Lunch or Dinner. It's that good."
"incredible. I might prefer the burrito at a La Pasadita as L'Patron's have more stuff in theirs to dilute the meat. But the tacos at L'Patron are incredible. The tortas are AMAZING. And they have a slew of sides that other local low-scale taco joints around here don't offer: corn on the cob, inventive guacamoles, etc. The vibe is incredible too as there's latin music blaring and happy people munching by themselves or with friends and BYOB. be warned that the over-the-counter feel does not indicate over-the-counter speed. You'll probably wait 15-20 minutes for your food - after you order - during busy weekend dining hours."
"Love the tacos here! It's a small restaurant with a walk up counter to order. There are about 6 tables and counter seating. Everytime I've visited, it gets pretty crowded. My favorite taco is the lomo, which is ribeye with caramelized onions. The meat is so tender and flavorful. Can't beat the price at $2 a taco."
"This taco restaurant is the be all and all of all tacos in Chicago.  Warning! If you come here I can guarantee you may not ever want to go to a different taco place again. I mean this in good and sincere way. Also, once you try the tacos you may not stop coming here either. Warning! Heheh"
"Best tacos in Chicago. So fresh, packed with delicious flavorful meat. The steak is amazing and the chicken is extremely juicy. You have to order the tacos with their house made corn tortillas. They are a little thicker than regular tortillas but they taste so fresh and are so light and fluffy. So good! Also you have to get an horchata, goes perfect with the tacos and some of the best I've had in the city.The place is small and meant to grab your food and go but it's a fun atmosphere and really enjoyable to sit at the counter to enjoy your food. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. My favorite place for authentic tacos in the city and I can't wait to go back!"
"Absolutely LOVE this place. Been eating here since it opened... I live around the corner. Consider myself a foodie and therefore I know that what Chicago is really best known for is Mexican food aka taquerias.Anyway, the trick here is to order over the phone and pick up. This way you bypass the line and always get your food in about 15 minutes. The steak tacos are the best in the city hands down. Al Pastor tacos are also excellent. Unbeknownst to most, the guacamole is the best in the city. Everything here is fresh as can be and made to order. Service is great too. If you're hungry you need to order at least 3 tacos because they're on the smaller side, like they should be. The place is super affordable. I have nothing negative to say about this place except I wish it was open 24/7. Enjoy!"
"Tacos were pretty good.  Large chunks of steak in the steak tacos.  Their sandwiches were pretty tasty as well, and not overly expensive.The wait for your food, and the lines of people does not make sense for the quality of this place however.  While I enjoyed my meal, I certainly wouldn't wait 30 mins again to get some tacos.  Chicago has lots of good tacos, and if I see a line like that at 2pm again, I will go to one of those other good tacquiria's.And whats with the reviews of the Rice and Beans at this place?  They were stunningly average at best."
"I got the assortment of tacos. One chicken, steak snd fish. Best tacos I've ever had. The manager was so kind and gave us complimentary guac for trying all the food for the first time! Really great hospitality and again scrumptious well prepared and seasoned food. Definitely will be back again soon!"
"We came here a few times when they first opened, for take out, before they expanded the space. The first chicken burrito I had was excellent; it had grilled veggies on it, and we also had some great tacos. The sauce on the fish tacos is very good. Came back recently, after they expanded, and decided to dine in. Tried the chicken burrito again-- it was an entirely different burrito, quite bland. The tacos are your best bet. They are inexpensive and if you try a few varieties, you'll get some good ones. The fish tacos are good. The homemade chips and guacamole are good. The expanded space, however, is brutal. Imagine banks of exposed fluorescent tubes without diffusers, one big speaker blasting (and I mean blasting) some disparate music, interspersed with names called out (you sit down, they call out your name, and if you can actually discern your name through the din, you retrieve your food), and a line of people standing across the eating area waiting for pick-up. Call ahead and pick up, that's my advice."
"Top notch tacos. Favorites:carne asda, fish, and al pastor. Very casual atmosphere, fun staff, and nice music! The outside of the restaurant looks a little funny, but the food is always good! They get pretty busy at night, but the line moves petty quickly. Limited seating area, so beware with groups. It's as good Togo as dine in so don't let that worry you. It's cash only but you don't need much to eat well!"
"First things first: cash only. Yes, it's the 21st century. When busy the seating is ridiculously tight so avoid lunch hour if possible. The carne asada is very good yet the burritos are the size of tacos. Couple that with the VERY long wait time and it became more of an ordeal than a good food experience. Perhaps they will decide what they want to be in the near future, but you can't get an appearance on the Food Network and have such limited space for eating until something gives. My friend and I actually had a guy behind us territorializing one of our chairs because he had a ""big family"". Yep, single people are still 2nd class citizens in this city."
"Yelp must have known I had a mediocre taco experience and was searching for the next spot to try.  Enter L'Patron and their fish tacos. You know a place is good when you have already been back and writing the review makes you want to go back again.I came here for an earlier dinner before meeting friends at the bowling alley down Diversey.  Given that it was my first time, I tried a little bit of everything: the fish, pastor, steak and rib-eye.  I had been craving right way fish tacos and L-Patron delivered.  Although they are cheaper tacos ($2.50 I think), they do not skimp on the fish.  It was cooked perfectly and had a nice, unexpected amount of zing.  My next favorite would be the pastor or the ribeye.  I really liked the juiciness of the ribeye and that the tortilla was able to stand up to it.   L'Patron was so good that I've already been back like 10 days later for their fish tacos and tried the guac (excellent).  Service is friendly and quick.  Beware - L'Patron is very small with only a few counter seats. Although most carry out, it still tends to get crowded.   [Also, their salsa verde is HOT so try it first.]"
"Muy bien! The house special - gringo/a are must haves. The hand-made tortillas are thick and delish. I got carne asada in my burrito which was a bit too chewy for my liking but the burrito was great nonetheless. Will def have to return to try the rest of the menu and meats. Like the area/intersection near L'patron, the dine-in experience is busy and congested. So not great for groups, probably would be better off grabbing take-out next time."
Food is awesome and at a great price.  Their Carne Asada and Al Pastor is delicious. 3 stars because they expanded the dining area without expanding the kitchen or amount of people working.  Even at non peak hours the last two wait times I had for small orders were 25 and 35 minutes.  This is too long for the style of food being cooked.  Average at other business of this nature are 10-20 minutes max wait time (esp. during non peak hours).
"Ever since my BFF Phill C. has moved to Logan Square, all I hear about is how amazing L'Patron is. He seriously talks about it every time I come to visit. And of course I pass it myself when exiting 94. Finally in a night of way over indulgence on Saturday, I was able to try the goodness that is L'Patron.My friends and I went about midnight and the place was packed with a line. Most people were getting their food to go but we were able to snag a few seats at the counter. Bring your dollar bills because it's cash only at this joint.Everyone raves about their Watermelon water which I liked but I much preferred the Limeade. Goodness on a stick that stuff was good.I had a carne asade taco and at $2 it was a steal. The meat was huge, juicy, saucy - just the way I like it. It really hit the spot after a day full of drinking. I may venture to say it was the best carne asada taco I've ever had! That statement may be too bold...I quickly retract. I need to go back and verify this testimony! My latest obsession is elote! For $2.49 you can get this cheese covered corn tasty on the cob or in a cup with just the right amount of spice. I like mine in a cup personally so I can scoop as much as I possibly can into my mouth at one time and avoid spraying those around me with flying corn juices.I'll give it to Phillip, this place got the good stuff."
"This place is excellent. Everything I've had this is awesome, its very reasonably priced and the staff are very friendly. Do yourself a favor and stop off the California exit next time you're driving by and grab a few tacos. They also accept call-ahead orders as well."
"First time here and as a 3 star rating would indicate, it was ""a-ok."" Nothing special but nothing bad either. Had two tacos: the Al pastor and the Carne Asada. The pork was far and away better than the steak for a number of reasons, the most important being tenderness. It was well seasoned, juicy and had just the right amount of spice to it to make it tasty. The steak on the other hand was cold, tough as leather and came in such big chunks that with one bite, your entire taco was now all over your plate and lap. Not easy to eat in a place that has no tables and limited counter space.Place is small and packed so if you're afraid of tight spaces, this is not your place. If you're lucky they have some stools at the counter so go off hours and you may have better luck getting a seat. it's also quite smoky in there as you can see right into the kitchen, Cool for the vibe but hard to breathe at times. Overall not bashing the place although it sounds like I am. I'm betting if I had just the pork, it was a bit less crowded and I could see through all the smoke from the kitchen, I'd give it a 4 star review.Cash only."
"Saw this place on Chicagos Best....and they were right. AMAZING!Had the Al pastor torta, OMG, best ever BBQ pork with pineapple and hot sauce. My mouth exploded with flavor...oh sooooo good.Bf had the carne asada burrito...just as amazing!The horchata is probably the best I ever had.Decided to get a few different kinds of tacos to go.Chicken, chorizo, fish and poblano pepper.Cant wait til im hungry later to try these as well.There were about 8 counter seats and it was packed on a Monday at noon, we were lucky to snag 2 of them.This place is no where near my house, but was well worth the drive! We will be back.---------------So.....i tried the other tacos, they were all just ok. Thought they would have better flavor than they did.Still giving 4 's because the carne asada & al pastor deserve it!"
"I. Love. This. Place. As a California girl living in chicago, I feel like this is the closest to authentic/delicious Mexican food I can find. Everything on this menu is amazing. It is cash only (which you eventually prepare for once you know) and it can get crazy busy! I normally order over the phone so I don't have to wait but even if I did, it'd be worth it!"
Great food. They skimped on the Al Pastor in my burrito a little but I usually just get the tacos.
"Decided to give them one more shot. They have definitely given up caring about what's coming out of the kitchen- at least for to go orders. Same problem...crunchy meat that tasted like grill cleaner, under filled burritos (veggies, not just meat), overall another bad experience. I'm dunzo."
"Came here with my gf for a Saturday night dinner around 7 and the place was pretty packed. Like all the other tips here, after you order be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes for your food so don't go there too hungry or order some chips and guac. Each taco is only 2 bucks so it's a really good deal for the amount of food they pack into it. Though they did charge me an extra $0.39 for extras even though I didn't get anything extra which was kind of annoying. Besides that I'd say this place was great. I ended up getting lengua tacos and ribeye with onion tacos and the beans and rice. The beans and rice were just ok. The tacos on the other hand were amazing. The lengua ones came with huge pieces of lengua and it was very simple and flavorful with lots of beefiness to it. The ribeye and onions were also incredible with a nice flavor from the caramelized onions. They also give you a red and a green salsa which go really well with the tacos because they add a refreshing touch. Overall I'd definitely come back and just make sure I check my receipt more carefully."
"I'd give this place 10 stars if i could. I absolutely love their veggie burritos because they have a different recipe every day of the week. Sometimes it's eggplant, other times spinach; whatever day you go, it's never a miss! The horchata is also excellent! There is always a line cause this place is THAT good! They recently expanded the inside of the restaurant. Just go there.. trust me."
"Steak!  It's all about the STEAK!!  Their steak tacos are delicious!  L'Patron doesn't use the same steak that these other little taco places use.  You know... those little rubbery pieces of meat with the occassionally chewy-gooey that makes you gag.  This is REAL STEAK... it's tender and tasty.  My tacos were almost overfilled, in my opinion.  I could've asked for another tortilla and made a third taco.  I also went a little nuts this time and ordered a Gringo... O.M.G.  It's basically a steak quesadilla, but it's so goooood!  The Gringo comes with rice & beans and is worth it for the price.  I do wish it was a little bigger, but they seem to have a ton of take out orders.  L'Patron is my new favorite taco place."
The Carne Asada tacos are the best way to go as far as tacos. Everything is tasty. I doubt you will be disappointed by anything they serve. Definitely worth the trip! It's really a carryout with a few seats.
"Pros: chicken burrito and al pastor burrito both very good. They cut them in half for you, so it is easier to eat. They are very filling. The rice water is tasty.Cons: small area inside and because they are so busy you may wait awhile for your food. I suggest calling ahead if you are in a rush."
Where do I start...Food was not good! If you want good steak tacos try taqueria zacatecana or carniceria guanajuato on California near this establishment! I Waited 35 minutes for 6 tacos. Insane!!! The girls charging are rude and not professional.  I cannot believe this place is always jammed I live in the area and I will never return here!!!
"I live on the southwest side but this is my go-to for tacos specifically, so I think that speaks for itself. The vegetarian daily specials are out of this world! I'm talking fried eggplant, wilted spinach, mushrooms, garlic, jalapeños, etc. in delicious combinations that change on the daily. I'm not even a vegetarian.Cash only, never not full of cops."
"What? ""Best burrito?"" Who are these people making these lists?Married to a burrito aficionado, I suggested we pop by here and now I feel terrible for suggesting it.  By the time we left, my burrito lover was near anger and was griping the whole way home.He had the carne asada burrito.  I had two carne asada tacos on flour though I over ordered.  He also got chips and pico de gallo chunky salsa, then went back for guacamole.  As I didn't study up ahead of time, we didn't know it was cash only until after placing the order.  And no ATM.  Rats.  Ok.  Frustrating but not the end of the world.It's great that they cook to order which we didn't know either and it's fresh but it does take longer that it seemingly should.  Service is dry, routine, fine, and passable enough but it's order at the counter and go away, so, there's not a lot of expectation built in.Verdict?  ""It's a wrap, not a burrito.  Nothing authentic about it.""He didn't like the pico so he didn't eat it, which was a big shame as that with chips was $4.50. ??  Wow.  He went to ask for that guacamole and I think they charged him full menu price but it came sans chips (he either said hold 'em or never got them, dunno), $5.50.  Jeez louise.  Really?  Gold plated avocados or something?  He said it wasn't all that great but he was so hungry, he ate a decent portion of it anyway.  A few additions to the main meal items like cheese and lettuce speedily tallies up.  Toss in a few bottled cokes, no cups of water as far as we could tell and wow, despite the burrito and tacos seeming reasonably priced, we dropped inauthentic hefty coin on a lackluster meal for two.The carne was ok.  Not really seasoned nor flavorful despite its marinade, a hair greasy not in the right way and it's missing char.  I mean, it was ok, but one of the best?  No.  My sweetheart kept repeating the whole way home, ""it was a wrap, not a burrito, a *wrap.*"" I guess it's pretty clear by now we were disappointed and feel this place is sorely overhyped.  We're again left questioning peoples' tastes.  Hm, too bad.  We had hopes and they were dashed."
You MUST ORDER AHEAD! Otherwise expect a lengthy wait. The meat is always fresh and delicious and the girls working the front are almost always friendly. Almost. The burritos are a bit smaller than other taco joints but they are also way tastier so it's a toss up. The veggie tacos and burritos are amazing and surprisingly filling and the ingredients change daily. It is still cash only so be prepared.
I lived in a mexican person once so my taco standards are pretty high. es alto dude! (and she was not my mama)they make the tortillas with the fat fingers of a spanish speaker.they make the meat of the marinade with the sensual fingers of the other spanish speaker person here.good lengua in my mouth.mi bocagood al pastor with the sweetness only a fat fingered spanish speaking person can orgazimate damn good fish tacos with the slaw of the holy goodness that would make you steal the juice from your favorite juan out of their to be mouth.I once knew how to speka da proper and then i eated here and everrything is a blurr.so good. so good.
Anyone who says they've had better tacos in Chicago should really message me and tell me where because this place is awesome! The tacos here are full with flavor and the ingredients are super fresh. I have only been once but wish I could be here for lunch everyday.
"Best mexican ever. Home made taco  is awesome. If you want to try real mexican food this is a place for you.This is not restaurant this is the real place :) Taco Lengua (Beef Tongue) is the best I ever had, and I love tongue ( the best are in with Mustard-Horseradish Sauce)Very nice service. Cash only."
"Really looked forward to some tacos here but it was somewhat of a letdown.  here are the good and bad parts.The Guacamole was really good and the freshly fried chips are crispy and addicting.Everything else were meh:Horchata was way too sweetCarne asada was really toughAl pastor had a twist, pork was cooked with pineapples, but it was also too sweet and in the entire taco I only got two pieces of meat and lots of pineapplesChicken pieces in the taco were overly fried and toughLengua lacked flavor, needed to put salt and tons of salsa on itdisappointed, would not come back again"
Best tacos in Chicago! Wow the steak is Perfect and I am extremely picky about the way my steak is cooked and do not like any fat on the meat. I tried the chicken ones recently and they were also amazing. The Guac and chips are yum and the horchata is perfect. I still have yet to try the tortas and quesadillas but I know they will be fantastic if you look around everything just looks SOO good. Did I mention they make Homemade Tortillas?!? OMG amazing but you have to request them! The service is very friendly as well. This place gets packed because it is so awesome. A little Gem in Logan Square!
"Ok, so I haven't written a review about L'Patron b/c keeping gems a block away from us quiet is selfish and totally fine as far as we're concerned.  Clearly nothing is quiet at this point and they pulled trump tonight.  We made a large enough order and they asked if we wanted to try their new chicken soup.  Well why wouldn't we after everything we've ever gotten there was delicious?  New chicken soup is fantastic and it feels like they put it on the menu b/c it's flu season and health is important in their customers.  Sure, I might be reading into it but making delicious food and keeping their loyal clientele happy so they can buy more...well that just feels like genius to me."
Hands down best tacos I've had in Chicago. .A bit of a wait but well worth it.. big chunks of meat in steak tacos..fish tacos were out of this world.. I can't wait to go back highly recommended
"So, I read some reviews and everyone seems to RAVE about this place....one question...WHY?  The food is good, but nothing to die for.  I've been to other Mexican joints that are hole in the walls and the food was AMAZING, this place not so much.  Good food, but not something to write home about.  The place only accepts cash.....no bueno!! Big inconvenience, for those that hardly ever have cash on them.  The place is literally a hole in the wall and not very clean.  The ac apparently doesn't work bc they have fans blowing every where and on a hot summer Chicago, day that's a negative.  The place is super busy, great for them bad for the consumer bc it took us 18 mins to get our order of 5 tacos...smh.  The hype is not worth the hassle here...Would I come back?  Sure, but I'm in no rush to."
"Pretty decent for my standards.  First off I LOVE TACOS!  I am from East L.A.  There is a taco truck on the corner of my block with a lady from Oaxaca cooking up mole, cemitas, alambres, chilitos, etc.  I eat tacos at least 2 times a week and I make my own all the time.  With that being said.  Eat there it's good.  I had the Gringo and my boyfriend had the Meat burrito.Pros:  Meat ""Asada""  is pretty good for the most part (needed a little more salt)           Rice  is ok            Mexican coke, Fanta, etc in the bottle and Aguas Frescas           Service was great and friendly.  The cooks and ladies there work their ass off.Cons: Burritos have lettuce in them.  Blasphemous , never, never, never...It must be a Chicago thing. Chile ""Salsa""  needs work.  It's too watery needs more spice and tomatillos for sure."
"OK..So this place got stellar ratings for their food...wow! really?  Not sure why? Front ccounter staff with dull attitude... laughed when customer returned bringing to their attention an omission in his order. Waited 18 mins for 1 burrito! Not worth it. And what a disapointment in the food...it was as bland as ever!!! It Had a strange taste also!!! Not exactly sure what it was.... The only thig that was good was the green sauce that came with my burrito. Wish I had more to soak my burrito with it. People, i don't know what the big buzz is here with this place! Honestly..Maybe woth a ""check out"" just for curiosity sake.Tip: I did notice that several people had phoned in their order and walked in, paid for their food and sat in the dining area to eat without waiting.I will ot go back to this place for Mex food, knowing there's a place close by on California just south of Belmont ( don't know the name..with a maroon canopy ) that trumps this place! Great burritos, no lines, and easy on your wallet!!!"
"I'm a transplant from Los Angeles (via Michigan, so I'm allowed to be here, I have my midwest papers), and die-hard taco fan, and these are the best tacos I've had in Chicago. And belieeeeeeeeve me, I've been looking. The majority of the tacos joints I've been to seem to have a different style, maybe it's a Chicago thing (don't hit me!), but none of them  have seemed very authentic. If you don't put cilantro and onions on my taco, I don't want to eat it. Stopped by last night (Saturday), we had lengua, asada and pollo tacos (don't look at me like that, my friend ordered the pollo, I would never!), all were great. Definitely the most authentic I've had in Chicago, really glad this is nearby, we'll be coming here regularly. Also had some elote, it was alright but I wanted more spice. Probably would skip that next time. The verde salsa was spicy and great, I kept dousing my asada in it, couldn't get enough. The only issue is the wait. I guess I'm just not used to waiting so long for tacos - In LA there's a taco truck on every corner, and at most you might wait 5 minutes. I ordered a limeade and it was gone by the time we got our order. Not sure if they're shortstaffed or if it just legitimately takes that long. I didn't time it, but it was longer than I expected, even after reading the reviews saying the wait was long. Also, where's the escabeche? I must have missed this, 'cos everyone else has photos of it. Having to order chips seems a little weird, but I guess they've gotta pay the rent. I've just never been to a place that you have to order/pay for them separately. The owner MIGHT hate me though. I couldn't tell if he loved me or wanted to choke me. Probably a mix of both. If I turn up missing it's because I angered the taco guy!"
"Outstanding food, burritos, beans, rice, guacamole. A must try and a definite do over!"
Gringa. That's all you need to know.
"We were told 25 min for our burrito (and it ended up taking that long). They were pretty busy (although most taquerias can get that many people in and out the door no issue...) and had seen them on a list proclaiming them one of the best burritos in the country -- so we were happy to wait. However, my al pastor burrito was 90% lettuce, soggy, and not tasty at all (the pork and marinade were absolutely bland). Boyfriend was super unimpressed with his carne asada burrito, too. Also, the burritos were totally tiny -- boyfriend was still hungry after.We were super disappointed -- it's not even a decent burrito, let alone one of the best.Who makes these best burrito lists, anyway!?"
Great tacos for the price. The tacos are flavorful. One of my go-to carry out restaurants. Cash only!
"I just moved to the neighborhood and heard good things. I went with the tacos. One pollo, one pastor and one pescado. I also got horchata, which was fantastic. $2 delicious tacos make me a happy man. Try this place out. You'll be happy, too."
"I eat a lot of tacos at a lot of taquerias. For inexpensive, plastic-cutlery-and-plastic-basket taquerias, I'd say 10% are awful, and 80% of them fall into this great expanse of mediocrity that is pretty good, but ultimately interchangeable/forgettable. L'Patron is a shining blaze of glory at the very top of the 10% that are outstanding. I ordered a perfect chorizo taco, a perfect rajas taco, and a perfect fish taco MADE WITH A CORN TORTILLA (thank you!!!) and some seriously amazing tangy, refreshing, delicious slaw quite unlike the greasy sludge I've come to expect. Everything was cooked, seasoned, and portioned flawlessly. Yum. Also, I bought dinner for myself and my 3 friends and it set me back a whopping $24, ha! Yes, the wait is long. Yes, it's packed and seating is hard to come by. Yes, they only take cash. Don't care, totally worth it. 10/10, will definitely be back."
"What do you do when you want to celebrate the end to your love's unjustifiably long unemployment spell?  Tacos, of course!Affordable, delicious, quick, satisfying - and because they come in multiple varieties - you can mix up your order to try a lot of different kinds.But in my experience with L' Patron, I have a very hard time getting away from my favorite.  Their fish tacos are phenomenal.  They bring about a gargantuan urge to eat thousands of calories worth (probably takes only two to get into the quadruple digits of calories consumed).  Right now, I'd punch an innocent child in the gut for a couple of these breaded fish beauties, served on a bed of shredded cabbage and a dollop of tangy sauce, neatly tucked into L' Patron's damn perfect house-made tortillas.My God - I'm drooling right now thinking about them...Which brought me back to last night.  Four tacos: - two fish, - two lomo (rib eye).The lomo, while being too legit to quit, was delicious, piping hot, had a nice mixture of marinated meat and caramelized onions, but ended up taking second stage to the real star of the shit show known as ""Reuben Messily and Loudly Eating Four Tacos In Under Three Minutes"" : the fish tacos.Did I mention they are fantastic?  Awe inspiring.  Stupendous.  Omnipotent.  Mind-blowing.  Wondrous.  Staggering.  Colossal.  Dynamite.  Monumental.  Breathtaking.  Tremendous.Oh, and the recently ex-unemployed (er- employed again) loves her Gringa, a house specialty that's pretty much a dang, loaded up quesadilla.  And she had a fish taco too...  Not sure how I didn't scarf it down before she could get to it.Cash only.  Very few seats.  Totally worth the hassle."
"If give it a 3.5.  We waited 30 minutes for two Tortas.  The poblano Rojas gets 5 stars but the carne asada torta meat was tough.  We also had a gringo, but the meat was tender.   Odd.   Salsa was amazing."
Such warm & quick service! Our fave new hidden gem Mexican joint! Our comparables: We love antique taco & big star.... Oh and gt fish's fish tacos! All delish.   We were very pleased with our service w comp salsa & chips on a Friday night! They were good and also had a little pomegranate on top! Fresh & well seasoned! We ate in.  Came in  during a 10 min slow period as there were only  3 others patrons...  after that it was super busy w walk ins & carry out orders.  Some dined in.  All the bar stools were full by the time we left.   Ordered the following tacos...Fish Tacos: cabbage battered fish yumminess 4.5/5Al pastor taco: better than the carne! 5/5Carne Asada: tasted a little smokey.  If u like cheese ask for it bc they don't have cheese on it.  So good w the cheese.   4.5 / 5Vegetarian (of the day): 3/5 nothing special Horchata is delish!! This is a win for us! They also gave us comp homemade picked veggies.. Very Yum! It's def on par with our aforementioned taco joint faves! Worth making a trip out of downtown to have and we will back!
I am very happy that they opened the place up and added more seating. They will do even more with more space.....maybe a transaction window?It doesn't matter anyway.....Ill keep coming back....
"I have been here quite a few times. I have never been disappointed. Everything is good and I do mean everything. There is always a line so make sure you understand this will not be a quick in and out. Call a head of time if that what your looking for. Also, they have in house waters (aqua fresca) everyday, horchata, hibiscus and if your lucky melon."
"Let me just start by saying that I absolutely hate onions.That being said, I enjoyed the living hell out of my Ribeye and onion tacos. Service was great, music was great, price was very acceptable, portion and taste were excellent.  It's a shame they close so early especially on those nights that you just want some drunk food after the bar/club.So happy my friend took me there! Will be going back today after work :D"
"The chorizo, lengua and al pastor tacos were all great; flavorful, juicy meat...perfect tortillas, and loaded with food/very filling.  The steak was disappointing; a bit dry, needed the sauces they provided to make it edible.  But for $2/taco, and the fact that it's BYO, I was pretty satisfied for $9!"
"What a huge disappointment-back in the day before the expansion - the food here was amazing!! It's clear that their overhead has increased and as a result the food has gone downhill!! The fish tacos are pathetic ... L'Patron I'm sad by this lack of integrity in what you serve... Won't be back, RIP"
"Mmmmmm tacos. L'Patron Tacos I dream of you, I do. From the pomegranate seeds that dress your guacamole to your hand rolled, freshly made tortilla chips. I have never experienced mexican so good. Me and my friend were famished after just getting in from O'hare. We wanted mexican. We were in Logan Square. Yelp to the rescue~ hopped on the bus and it dropped us off here. Initial reaction: I didn't expect the place to be so small. Where to sit? It felt awkward at first since we had to sit right by the cashier and her daughter who happened to be chillin' on the side shooting some penguins on her computer. NBD though cause we warmed up to her soon enough.Once the food arrived we chowed down. Oh my gosh, pure heaven. A huge steak burrito for under $6? Sign me up. I couldn't even finish the bugger. & The chips, to die. So amazing. Salsa in a squirt bottle? Pure Awesome. Overall: I would totally recommend this place. Prices are good and their food is the bomb.com"
"L'Patron, I want to love you, I do.The tacos are great. No question. We used to get them several times a week. But why the hell cant you answer the phone anymore?!!! Nine out of ten nights we want to call in an order the line is busy. Constantly. For loooong periods of time. This is a regular complaint of everyone I know that also loves your food. If I have to go in and wait there are much better atmospheres I would prefer to patronize."
"This is my absolute favorite place to get Mexican food. My favorite thing to get is La Gringa which consists of two handmade flour tortillas with a sweet savory pineapple pork and cheese. It also comes with beans and rice!  Their vegetarian options are always great and rotate with each day. They can be busy at times, but with their new addition to the establishment it is relatively easy to find a table.  Did I mention BYOB?"
"Went here for lunch with a five other people directly after church - the place was totally packed when we entered, but had completely cleared out by the time we got our food. It doesn't seem like a place people linger long, so don't be discouraged if there aren't any seats available when you enter! I ordered the marinated pork torta - I was the third person to order out of our party of six, but the last person to order got her food a solid five to ten minutes before the rest of us, which was really weird. The wait was a pretty long time for the rest of us. HOWEVER- that torta was so, so good. Like literally so good. The serving was huge. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the bread was crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside, and the avocados were at the perfect ripeness. I will say that the onions were cooked so they were almost like dates, which I wasn't really into, but everything else makes up for it! There's a restroom in the restaurant (unexpected, given its size), but parking can be pretty hard to find - we ended up parking in the neighboring CVS, and the person who was driving ran outside every ten minutes to make sure no one towed his car!"
"This place is phenomenal. I went last night, and it was packed...we waited about 10 minutes just to order. The service was friendly and it was well worth the wait! We had:Veggie tacos- the best veggie taco I have ever had. Beets, corn, tomatoes, etc. DeliciousGringo- a fantastic carne asada sandwich on a homemade tortilla. With awesome rice and beans. Meat was char grilled and full of flavor!"
"This place has some of the best tacos in the city. I highly recommend the al pastor,  carne asada, and chorizo. Other items off the menu were all surprisingly good: rice & beans - veggies were cooked with the rice which is a nice touchlengua taco - very tendervegetarian burrito - roasted beets gives it a sweet kickThe fish taco was okay and a bit soggy. My torta was a bit burnt and it did not have as much filling as I'd like. I'll go with the burrito next time. My friend had the al pastor taco and he said wanted to cry because it was THAT good. Then Let's Get It On by Marvin Gaye started playing over the speakers. It was a sensual experience. Prepare for cash only, long lines, long waits, and a small space."
Best Mexican food in Chicago!!!! The best. &&I've eaten at a lot of Mexican food places in Chicago..from the south side to the north side... L'Patron is at the Top!!!
"How can I claim this is the best Mexican restaurant in Chicago, which seemingly has an infinite number of them?The beef and fish (tilapia) tacos are the BEST and are ON POINT! they do it right with the cilantro and onions, not lettuce and tomato.The prices are great.The vibe is causal, with a orange decor I really like.The manager is cool and you can tell a good guy, very legit.  He seems to treat his employees and customers very well. Go there, and you'll wait in a very small line, likely under five minutes. You will make this your spot, I bet!I wish I could do more to express how good this place is. I don't even like Mexican that much... I've had it sooo many times. This place gets me exited about Mexican again"
"Wow- it's been over a year- I go about once a week- Staff is great, food is top notch-I see a lot of complaints about the wait time..well, everything is made fresh to order, best advice is to call ahead, and place your order even if you are going to eat there, or take it away."
"This place was very good. It was small but more than enough tables for a sunday lunch. I had the steak burrito, which was very good. My son had the chicken and steak tacos which he also loved. The rice and beans were good too! Definitely recommended. It took about 10 minutes to get our food but well worth it to have fresh food."
"This place is awesome!! I love their gringa, marinated pork meat with pineapple bits yumm I'm hungry again lol I read a review of someone complaining of getting pineapple with the al pastor and thought it was dumb! Original real mexican al pastor comes with pineapple!!! The shrimp and fish tacos are good but too spicy for my husband n kids but you can tell them to omit the hot pepper oil (I think that's how they call it not sure) they put on them. The corn in a cup is way but I mean way much better than the ones I used to buy on the streets with the elotero guy, this corn has decent kernel size and actually has flavor. You can only pay with cash, now if they could too, accept credit/debit cards that'd be great lol but according to the owner that keeps their prices low so I guess we can't complain. Parking can be a hassle so we usually always take out."
"One of my BFF's moved a block from L'Patron a couple weeks ago, so we hit it up yesterday.  There are a ton of reviews here, so I'll keep it short and sweet:Carne asada is tender and flavorful with no gristle to be found.  I got a taco and my friend got a torta.  I'm not going to mince words: This may be the best torta I have ever tasted.Chicken isn't shredded beyond recognition.  Tender chunks of white and dark meat with a good crisp on them.  These are seriously good tacos.  A decent size, for $2 each.  Oh my God.Rice and beans are way better than standard.  Great salsa and salsa verde.  Everything I tried was delicious.  Two tacos with rice and beans was plenty of food, for about $7.That said, minus a star for being cash only, and also for the ridiculous wait.  The line wasn't all that long when we walked in, but waiting for the food took absolutely forever.  I'm sort of loathe to call it ""fast food"", even though it's a taco joint with a walk-up counter and no a/c.  Seriously, call in your order.  How does something this simple take this much time?"
"Elotes and guacamole were very good, but the place is very dirty."
"Great price, great food, great seating area.Would give five stars but it took a ridiculously long time for food to come up.  Call in and order ahead.Worth the wait!"
"I consider myself somewhat of a taco connoisseur, and I'm always on a mission to find and eat delicious tacos. This place has the best tacos in the Chicagoland area, hands down! I had the al pastor, pescado, and chile relleno tacos, all of which were phenomenal!! Once you go L'Patron, you'll never want a taco from anywhere else!"
The best tacos!
"You know there is that saying, 'like a kid in a candy store'  where you want absolutely everything? That saying goes the same for this taco spot. Every time I go here, I wrestle with what I want to order, ""should I get the Burrito? But if I get that I can only have one meat!! While if I get a Taco, I can get a mix......but I want more of every taco I ate...Then there are the Tortas..don't get me started'  EVERYTHING is so damn good here. I have gotten into arguments with ppl all over the US (literally California, Texas, New York) that Chicago has some of the best Mexican food in the States. And this place is my favorite/It's awesome how you see them rolling out the tortillas  in the back and the kitchen is ALWAYS busy with 4-5 ppl running around. You know you wonder at times you think something is missing in your life?? that 1%?? Get a taco/torta/buritto here and you will be one step closer to self actualization.All kidding aside, go there now"
Great tacos for a great price. I love the rib eye and chorizo tacos. The elote isn't my favorite but that's forgivable because everything else is delicious. The lines show how much people love this place. If it wasn't so far away I would definitely stop by more often.
Yum! This place is awesome. My husband thinks the chips were the best tortilla chips he's had. Get the gringa!
"I was randomly browsing for nearby restaurants and came across this little gem of a shop! and i am SO glad I stopped by!Gringa ($5.49) - a MUST-HAVE - This dish is one of the house specials. Imagine a quesadilla but crispy tortilla! The gringa comes with melty chihuahua cheese and meat. We got the Al Pastor: Pork with pineapple (this combo is amazing as it is). Btwn the pork and the cheese, it gets oily. HOWEVER, the gringa gets balanced out by really FRESH rice and fresh refried beans - this didn't taste like it came out of a can. So it was well - balanced and delicious!Carne Asada Taco ($2.00) - Meat was nicely charred with a bit of chew. I'm a beef fan so this tasted better than the chicken but both were delicious. Chicken Taco - Chicken was seasoned well and seared, I believe it was a mix of white and dark meat in the taco. But it was well balanced with the onions and toppings. Both of the tacos were on the smaller side with two small corn tortillas that were heated up for that it wasn't cold. Parking was a breeze with the meters in front, with the high turnover rate of customers, I enjoyed how great the ingredients were and the overall atmosphere was clean!I will definitely be returning in the future to try the gringo and other tacos!"
"L'Patron...first I wanted to say that now that I have found you, I will be a couple pounds heavier in 2013 and unfortunately my wallet will not balance it out at all since this place is CHEAP! $5-6 bucks for a burrito??? Chipotle is my go to but i'd much rather spend less and get a freshly made burrito with large chunks of perfectly cooked steak that just melts in your mouth...I went with a buddy and we nommed on the Gringo, Al pastor burrito, ribeye steak taco, fish taco, and last but not least the complimentary pickled peppers/cauliflower/carrots/onions. The Gringo was probably my favorite of the day. The steak made the dish...it was cooked perfectly. The chihuahua cheese filled the voids between steak and the homemade masa type tortilla. This would be heaven for late night...good thing they're open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays! Also, the beans and rice that come with are rock solid and do not bring the dish down at all. The Al Pastor Burrito was delicious. Al Pastor is one of my favorite meats because it's savory but the pineapple brings the sweetness to the party. The ingredients tasted real fresh as well. I forgot to mention that my friend is from Mexico and this is now his favorite spot in Chicago....Also...he decided to try the horchata on our way out and I was lucky enough to try some and it was a sweet drink that topped off the meal! He explained to me that it's rice, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla. L'Patron serves it in a giant cup that is more than enough for 2 people. Very friendly service and easy parking right outside. What more could you want?L'Patron we will meet again...soon."
"The food at this place is amazing. The tacos will change your life. It is cash only, but who cares. We have tried almost everything here, never been disappointed."
"This is my favorite taco spot for al pastor and lomo encebollado tacos. Their meat is juicy, tender and full of flavor. I also love the gringa/gringo with the homemade thick tortilla.It's a lot easier to find a seat now that they opened the connecting storefront. The staff is friendly and they keep the place clean. The one minor complaint would be that the place is always very smoky inside, but the food is well worth it."
"We have always had issues finding something good to eat late at night. Almost everything closes at 10, but when we were about to settle for IHOP, we saw this place and checked it out on yelp. Boy am I glad to have found this. The place doesn't seem much from the outside but I liked the environment inside. The food was reasonably priced but it was probably one of the best tasting Mexican food in the area. I had their special, the gringo and wife had fish tacos, loved em both. So glad to have found this and would definitely be back. Five star due to being open till 12, price and taste, and customer service was good too."
"I rarely write reviews these days, but I wanted to share this picture cause I thought it was the most pathetic burrito I have ever seen.  My gf ordered some food for us by phone and this is what she saw when she opened up her burrito.  I have had tacos bigger than this burrito.  It's a pretty bold move to call this worthy of around 6 bucks.  Luckily I wasn't in the mood for a burrito and ordered tacos.  My biggest regret at this point is that I didn't have the foresight to take a picture next to something like a highlighter or maybe one of the other tacos so you guys could all laugh at this thing and truly appreciate it.  It was literally the size of my iphone.  Be sure to check out the uploaded picture though... I'd say you can't miss it, but you probably can given it's size."
"Food was excellent, this place is fresh and flavorful!  I cannot believe how busy this place is at all hours of the day."
"When trying to think of things more overrated than L'Patron, I came up with the TV series Mad Men, angus beef, the state of California. That's it. I opted for the ""gringo"", which is basically some kind of quesadilla & gorditia fusion. It's called the gringo because it's white people bait. In fact, that's the overall vibe of this place. That's why elotes are on the menu. ""OHMAGAWD, ILLOWTIES!"" Anyhow, the gringo is a nice spin, especially with the grilled onions. The steak inside was juicy and tasted good. However, the tortilla was too thick and bready for my liking. I would probably order extra meat next time for a better meat to tortilla ratio. Or skip it entirely. I also wanted to try an al pastor taco. This was a let down. I just wasn't feelin' the big pineappley kick in the mouth. I wanted to kick it back, in it's face...I wanted to kick a pineapple in it's face. It's unfortunate because the meat was thick and tender. But I wish they would pull it back on the pineapple just a bit. Or a lot. That would work too. This is the only taqueria I've ever been to where I can't see the cooks cooking. Doesn't affect my opinion much, but I thought it was bizarre. The inside is tiny and lacks air conditioning, so brace yo'self. Viable option for some decent tacos. I just don't think it's as marvelous as many do."
"Sometimes my white side comes out (alright, who am I kidding, my white side is always out), but it REALLY comes out when I go to Mexican places.  I love rice in my burrito.  Shut up, it's delicious and everything I love is wrapped up for me to eat one bite at a time.  That's kind of irrelevant, since I haven't had a burrito from here, and after this last visit, I doubt I'll be rushing back here anytime soon.After a night of drinking, I kept trying to come here because I remembered this place living up to the hype.  However, that idea was nixed once I realized they weren't open much longer and pizza was closer.  Too bad, because when I'm drunk, all tacos are created equal.  FINALLY made my way back here and, disappointment.My friends always used to tell me you know a taco place is good based on their al pastor.  (I still maintain a place is good when they can make a good chicken taco because chicken is boring, but whatever, I'm only a halfie so my opinion clearly doesn't count.)  I can honestly say this is the first time I've had al pastor and not wanted to eat it.  It was too sweet, which makes sense since there are small chunks of pineapple, but this was just too much for me.  Their steak is good though, I can't deny that.  I'm sure if I'm ever back here I'll just stick to a steak taco or the gringo, but probably a taco since their rice is pretty average too.  This last visit I ventured out and tried something new, a chorizo taco and the chile relleno taco and both were average.  The chorizo had better flavor than I expected, but this is probably my least favorite type of taco to order, so that's not saying much.  I attribute liking this place so much the first time to being tired and hungry and in the middle of packing for a move.  Just wasn't the same this last time."
"I'll say it: I am a taco snob. Growing up in California with my grandmother's home-made tortillas, and frequenting the many magnificent West Coast taquerias will do that, I think.Well, this place is legit. They do have home-made tortillas here, and easily some of the best tacos I've found in Chicago. The al pastor has just the right amount of marinade dripping through the pineapple, and the pollo adobado is seasoned with magic.My favorite, though, is the fish taco. With spicy serrano sauce lacing the crunchy cabbage, the crisp battered fish sang like a ballad. Outrageous."
"Tried this for the 1st time today, and it was definetly not the best. My pork taco was good and the corn tortilla was delish. Now the burrito left a lot to be desired it was really like a wrap with spring mix lettuce???? The chicken was dry and the steak was tough and neither had any flavor. The rice and beans was bad and left a weird after taste.  The service was great but the food I'll pass on."
"Really solid, cheap, traditional taqueria style tacos. They're not reinventing nor upscaling anything here like Big Star, Big and Littles or Antique Taco. But the price is right. Tacos are on the small side but tasty.You can find a lot of good tacos in this city and in this neighborhood, but without the buzz and longer waits. I think because this place is further east than some of the other taquerias in the Square it has become immensely popular. I would come here again, but i would try to make it during off peak times. And if I want a more eclectic kind of taco, or fish tacos, I would go to Big and Littles."
"The best fish taco I have eaten to date! Loved it! Def. like the idea of the ribeye steak tacos and carm. onions but I've got to eat them again as the first time I could not really tell what I thought of them, kinda on the bland side not sure. Did not expect such a hype environment in a Mex. joint either, so that was refreshing. Some of the topping on my order were screwed up but not a big deal! The rice and beans were not very good, but that fish taco Tho'! I will definitely go back. Looking forward to maybe giving that extra star soon."
"I went here after I saw that it was rated as one of the best burritos in the country, and boy is it true. I got the carne asada burrito and gringa al pastor. They were both super delicious. The price is cheap, but they do not sacrifice quality. Also, they only take cash so bring some, or go to the walgreens next door."
Best burritos and tacos around. Price is right too! I eat here multiple times a month.
"After reading all the hype about how great these tacos were I decided to give them a try. At 11am on Thursday this small ""store front"" restaurant, with bar style seating( two long counters w chairs) was open and doing business. There were only a few customers waiting for their orders, which would be great for a quick to-go order. It is more suited for carry outs, the seating does not lend itself to dining in. I've heard a lot about how great the Al Pastor Tacos are and decided on 2 to-go. Quick, friendly service.The girl taking the orders is a work horse, taking orders on the phone and walk-ins'  at the same time. I previously lived in the area and decided to conduct  my review in Palmer Square Park, curb side. The Tacos are small and at $2.00 each they are not a bargain, overpriced IMO. Maybe worth $1.50. The Char on the Pork was great, I enjoyed the flavor and the juices running from the hint of pineapple. I think it was pineapple juice because I didn't see any pineapple just cilantro and onion w a few small chucks of pork on two corn tortillas.  I give it 3 stars based solely on my review of the AL Pastor Tacos. The restaurant, although small, was clean and the service was good, 4 stars. Need a quick bite to calm that taco craving, this will work. Not for date night, unless ur ordering in.P.S. This place has a loyal following, as I was leaving the people(mostly workers)were rushing, get there before 11am. and avoid the crowd."
"Coming from LA, I was a bit skeptical about coming here, BOY WAS I WRONG! The restaurant was very tiny, thery had max, 10 seats (maybe). Luckily they're going to expand fairly soon. Tacos were pretty cheap ($2 per taco) and they're not as small as they are in LA, 2 max 3 will fill you up. I ordered the al pastor taco and the beef tongue. The al pastor taco had chunks of pineapple in it. It was AMAZING!! I've honestly never had tacos like that before and I'm a huge fan of al pastor tacos. I don't think I can ever have an al pastor taco without the chunks of pineapple ever again. The beef tongue was tender and the meat was just delicious. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. We also ordered the guac and it was so good! It had pieces of cranberry in the guac. Who does that?! It was delicious! Lets put it this way, I was only in Chicago for a week and I came here twice (especially for the amount of time that I had), I wish I had enough time in the day to eat this every day when I was there. I hope that they open a restaurant in LA, I'd be their #1 customer."
"I stopped by for some tacos and they were easily the best I've had in Chicago (I've had a lot).  The Pastor and Poblano were excellent and everything else - elote, orchata, beans was great too.  I'll definitely be back to try more tacos/other items."
This place is delicious.  Highly recommended.
"As close to authentic Mexican as I imagine a joint in Chicago can get.This cash-only, easy-to-miss-if-you-aren't-looking gem gets high marks for making you feel pretty badass for venturing out to experience the real thing.The only criticism I have is that the chicken burrito could have used more spice, and the chicken seemed to have been over cooked. My husband devoured his gringo, as I looked on enviously at the cheese strings dripping out the sides.I also ordered a pepper taco, and I could have eaten 20 of those things. Everything seemed fresh, and since it's pretty inexpensive, I can see why it's grown quite popular."
"Went for a late dinner and can I just say this place is delish! It's one of those whole in the wall places you pass by daily and don't really notice. Food is good, cheap and huge portions. I had the gringo because it seems to be one of their specialty. SO YUMMY! Will be back here sooner than later!"
"I have been there a couple times to pick up, and every time I get home the order isn't right. Or it's missing stuff that I paid, or the food is not what I ordered... Which is a problem when I order vegetarian for someone that doesn't eat meat, and everything has meat!! The quality is also questionable.. I hardly could find the meet on the taco.. 3 miserable small cubes of pork was all I found..And the guacamole, if I can call it that way, was more like an avocado put in the box.. I had to cut it to eat, or have to put half avocado in my mouth..And last, for what it is (mainly if you pay for things that you don't get), I wouldn't say is cheap...Good luck if you try!!"
"Walked in and ordered 3 tacos, but didn't expect them to be this good. The steak was big and juicy and the chorizo was flavored very nicely. Served with just salt onion and cilantro which is the best way. The chorizo was a little greasy but still very good."
"I lived in San Antonio for 3 years and have been going to hole in the wall Mexican places looking for something equivalent to authentic Mexican food.  Although this place does not top our favorites in Texas, we would agree it comes close.  It's better than la pasadita, authentaco, tres pasadas and many other places we have tried!  I've been here twice already and I don't mind the long waits because the food is just so damn good!"
Love this place. The food is awesome. I always get the steak burritos. They are very delicious.
"This place is solid!  Tacos are great.  Pico di Gallo was excellent, fresh and tasty.  I've just ordered to go cause I live close but the place always seems packed!  There is seating but it's very limited.  Going back soon to try other things!"
Omg...wow!!! This place has the best Lomo (ribeye) and Al pastor tacos ever! I also highly recommend getting the Gringa!
"I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but couldn't. It was a super solid 4 though and if I lived nearby, I am sure I would frequent this place! I was disappointed with the taco al pastor based on other's reviews. Good, but I've definitely had better. The fish taco was very good - the flavor of the slaw, lightly fried fish and cream were a perfect blend. My husband had the Gringa, which was amazing. Warning- it has a lot of cheese and is a little greasy if u r trying to be remotely healthy. But this may be worth the splurge...  Finally, we had the guac. It was really good, just not fabulous. Overall, fun stop on our Chicago trip that I would recommend to a friend."
"amazing authentic tacos !!! I would totally recommend the vegetarian taco ,it was unique and delicious! They give you 2 salsas for your food and they're both spicy ! The horchata and watermelon water here taste great too !"
"Wow!  This restaurant is clean, friendly, and absolutely delicious!  Defintiely some of the best tacos on this side of the city.  I like the al pastor tacos the best, but the fish and shrimp tacos are excellent as well.  I've had most of the menu at this place and can find nothing isnt excellent."
Stopped here xmas eve and it was delicious! Their sour cream is made in house and it was so good! We got one gringo and one gringa and they were both tasty. The pineapple is a great surprise. Can't wait to go back and try their tacos!
"Plain good tacos!!! Picked up some food here one night and I will have to say I was a bit iffy but was soon impressed after I took a bite out of my taco.  They are pretty normal size double on the tortilla and the meat is just as tender as it can be!! lol.. really juicy and I kinda like the fact it was cooked medium well side as opposed as to the traditional well done side.  The pieces of meat in the taco are pretty big and I would say I was pretty stuffed after one taco!! ( yess I know hard to believe lol ).   BUT I did manage to eat another one lol..  I also had some rice and beans and both were just as good!!I would say I am not a bean person so if I manage to go for three spoonfuls of beans then I am impressed!!   Also, tried their Guacomole and I would say It's alright not bad, but I wasn't too crazy about it and it was a bit salty for my taste buds.  But nonethless this place is pretty damn good."
I don't get it. This place is EXTRA MEDIOCRE. What's wrong with you people rating these places? The restaurant staff was disorganized & chaotic. There are so many other greasy taco joints that deserve your business. This place is a joke and so are the morons that rated it 5 stars.
I've only had take out but I can definitely say they have The BEST steak tacos I ever had! They have flavor they use good quality meat etc. I've been to many Mexican restaurants and I gotta say these tacos are awesome.
"Cash only! ""Pricey"" but is worth the quality of food. Definitely NOT your bottom rung Mexican fast food, a lot is made in-house! Great place to just go and grab lunch on office days.I've been keeping my eye on this place since its been under construction. Now that its open I have to admit that it was worth the wait!Everything I've tried so far is super fresh, the meat is tender and yummy (and this is amazing coming from me; one who does not prefer meat). As a (mostly) Vegetarian the guacamole definitely wowed me in its flavor, spicy kick, and the pomegranate seeds were a great twist.  Their vegetarian options are also tasty and always changing.You have to try! I look forward to returning for more."
"Hands down one of the best taco joints in the city - that's saying a lot since I live next door to Pilsen!  The carne asada is delish - juicy and meaty and made to order.  Freshness is key!  The al pastor is good too, but I can't stray from the steak!  It's a shoe box in here so I suggest calling ahead, picking it up and eating it in your car - er, that's if you're like me and can't wait to devour this goodness until you get home.   oh, and it's cash only folks so come prepared!"
"Middle of the road.The carne asada alone was great.  Add it to a burrito - not so good.  The tortilla is bland, and makes the whole thing meh. The tacos were good.  Must be the flour tortillas for the burritos!You will wait..... even if you call in an order.  The salsa... bland - not spicy at all.Over all, this place is OK.  There are plenty of other places that are MUCH better."
"I had a hankering for fish tacos, and I saw lots of positive reviews for L'Patron, which prompted me to check it out.My boyfriend and I ordered-1 Fish taco - Solid. Great peppery slaw.  I prefer non-fried fish tacos, but this was lightly battered and solid.1 Shrimp taco - Pretty much identical to the fish taco except sub in shrimp. Again, I'd prefer grilled, but solid.1 Al Pastor - Did not like. VERY fatty1 Asada - Tastey, but not as good as the Gringo1 Chorizo - I really liked this, smokey and delicious.  My boyfriend liked the fish tacos more, but I think this was the best taco1 Pobleno - Messy but perfectly spicey and delicious. Gringo - The star.  Amazing. So much steak inside this delicious pseudo-quesdilla. Considering the tacos were all about $2 and the Gringo was $5.50 - seriously amazing compared to price.  Ordering was a bit stressful - a decent line, lots of things going on, pretty warm with a small fan going, loud music over the intercom of order pick ups but totally worth checking out."
"Nice restaurant , excellent food. I had chicken taco, fish taco. Good taste I love it."
Best taco spot in chicago hands down! I know my tacos.... I know this IS the spot! Alpastor tacos are my favorite here... Juicy and tasty not greasy flavorless tacos. Its also B.Y.O.B. so thats a plus! Prices are reasonable and all are made fresh to order. Be patient... As your fresh and HOT tacos are served!! Service is friendly always and they make sure you have everything you need!
"I really love L'Patron!  Their tacos are great, their salsa is actually SPICY, and everything is freshly made.  I wish they weren't cash only and had slightly speedier service (sometimes you can wait half an hour if it's busy!), but I will also say that they are realistic about their expected waits.  I recommend following them on Facebook because they often announce special deals ($3 carne asada burrito? Sign me up!) that don't seem publicized anywhere else!Love."
"I've tried almost every taco joint in the city and this one is surprisingly good for the price range.  i think they make handmade tortillas which are delicious and the quality of meat is above average for the price range.  Places like Big Star are good but so pricey and are less authentic IMO.  This place does it right for the right price.  Also, the salsa is pretty good and a good indication of the quality of the taco joint is the salsa.  This salsa isn't the cheap stuff, they actually take the time to make some great salsa that I loved.  Place is small and cash only but is definitely worth a shot if you're a  fan of Mexican food.  Definitely a good way to end a night of inebriation."
I'm a vegetarian and these were the best tacos I've ever had. It is cash only and expect to wait but it's worth it! There's a Chase ATM next door at the Walgreens. I can't wait to go again.
"I have been here several times now and it can be a hit or miss.When it's a hit, it gets  5*'s: The meat is not that greasy, full of flavor, and does not include globs of fat.When it's a miss it gets 2*'s:The meat is really greasy, lacks flavor, and includes globs of fat.My favorites are the pork and vegetarian.Get the lomo instead of the carne asada, has a lot more flavor.Tacos are where it's at, and they're all freshly cooked (for the most part) to order.Pass on the carne asada (much better elsewhere), the tortas, and the house specials.  The tortas are just too bready, and the house specials aren't that great."
Great tacos and great prices! Loved the carne Asada tacos were delicious and the steak was soft and juicy nice size portions.Real Mexican flavor I will be coming back soon!
"-So cheap!-Tacos are incredible.  Definitely the best in Logan Square, maybe the best in the city???-The horchata is to die for.-Very little seating, but for those prices, who the f cares.-Is it still cash only?  Probs.  Fortunately, there's a Chase ATM in the Walgreens next door."
I can't recommend this place enough! Tastiest tacos in the area by a long shot. I recommend the al pastor and the carne asada. You really can't go wrong with anything that you order though -- tried lengua for the first time here recently and really enjoyed it.
I have been to many taco places this one trumps all.  My husband and I ordered steak tacos.... The steak was so fresh and juicy.  The tortillas taste home made..... Omg my mouth is watering that is how great it was.  Each taco was $2 and the quality was above and beyond yummy
"After being thoroughly disappointed in the abomination a certain food truck tried to pass off as ""tacos"" at an event earlier in the day, I was thrilled when my husband suggest I meet him for a late lunch around the Logan Square area. I had L'Patron bookmarked for ages as I am always looking for good Al Pastor and this place always comes up in the Yelp Threads. I had planned to take the food to go, but was lucky to find a pretty empty locale when I arrived. Phoned the hubs, ordered food and we were able to have a nice lunch at the counter. I know that's not the norm--by the time we were done, every seat was taken and there was a line of folks waiting for their food and the counter gal was very busy taking phone orders. What I ordered for me, the hubs and sidekick: Chips and Guacamole (good good stuff!)Chicken Taco (Good, not great)Carne Asado Taco (delicious! nice flavor, nice bit of char)Al Pastor Taco (amazing! I loved the sweetness that the pineapple gives it)The Gringa (Al Pastor, Carne Asada, melty Chiuahua cheese in a warm puffy tortilla, served with rice and beans. This dish rendered me speechless. Just eat. Thank me later). This was a nice sized portion and made for great leftovers later that day.Ice Cold Horchata, friendly service. Reasonable prices (cheap!)."
"Definitely lives up to the hype. The food is super cheap, the food is fresh, the food is delicious: everything I could possibly need! You could get full for under $9 easy! These are definitely the best tacos in Chicago. The restaurant is also nicely decorated on the inside and there's a good amount of seating for the small area."
"My friend ordered a STEAK BURRITO and I could tell the ingredients were fresh, but he didn't enjoy it much because he likes his burritos with the refried beans, cheese, avocado,  etc..so his complaint was the meat/burrito was dry.They serve the food more TRADITIONAL-very MINIMAL extras so if that's a concern for you I would say definitely mention your extras when you order. HOWEVER, keep in mind each ingredient will be about $.40 EXTRA. I had STEAK TACOS, which I enjoyed because personally I don't mind the traditional way of cilantro and onions, but I did add cheese lol..(I love cheese) Also I liked the type of meat they used, it looked like bistec so it is a thicker cut and had that nice grilled-char taste. No worries of gristle bleh! My only complaint was that it was a little hard to eat since it is thicker and dried out..perhaps just overcooked? I'm used to just chomping down on a taco lol The cheese wasn't melted on the meat and i only put lime and some guacamole in it to help balance out the dryness.. ELOTE was tasty.. they don't use the parmesan cheese like the vendors do, they use Mexican crumbling cheese so make sure that's what you like or ask for a sample of the cheese before ordering. . My friend says the HORCHATA was too sweet, but otherwise good taste. My LIMONADA..LIMEADE. .NOT LEMONADE. .was refreshing. . CHIPS were served warm! Yum! I definitely recommend L Patron. . Just keep some of my pointers in mind and BRING CASH! AND CARD/QUARTERS for the METERS if you're driving!"
"Delicious food & decent prices (cash only).  They have a vegetarian burrito option that changes daily, but is always my go-to. I recommend calling your order in ahead. During dinner hour, the wait for food can be about 15-20 minutes."
"Yo sueño de L' Patron. De los tacos vegetarianos y el pico de gallo con granada (pomegranate). The vegetarian tacos/burritos change based on the available ingredients. The last time I went that meant roasted beets, corn, peppers, and your typical taco accoutrements. I should not even mention the price. Nowhere else in the land of Chicago can you get this fresh and flavorful of food for this little money. It's extraordinary and sadly, maybe even too good to be true forever. I hope the modest storefront, the byob, the incredibly pleasant counter staff, and every other component of L'Patron withstand the ever-turning tides of Logan Square. I wish the nothing but success to the chef/owner, cooks, and staff because they are offering some of the best food in Chicago for the amount of money people pay to go four blocks in an Uber cab."
"Everything I've had has been really good, tacos, burritos, guacamole and chips, el Gringo.... They're not greedy with their meat and it has a really good taste. They're fast in making your order but I recommend calling and picking the food up because most of the time there's a long line."
This place is pretty busy most of the time that affects the quality of the food.. Lack of taste especially on their house dish la gringa. Get the tacos!
"I ate there two days in a row, never happened at another place before!While driving back home after an out of city trip, I suddenly had the urge for something mexican. Looked up yelp and right there at the diversey exit is this place. Reading some reviews, I thought of giving a try. Walked in and got three different tacos. Oh my, can tacos be this good? Why didn't I find this place earlier?Next day, for my birthday, when my wife asked where to go, I didn't think of any fancy places. Took family and dashed back there. We had all sort of tacos, their house special and tortas. Delicious, everything. But my favorite will always be the fresh prepared tacos, how can a simple taco be this good?Note: Take cash with you. And be ready for a short wait. Everything good in life comes with a wait."
"Best tacos in Chicago! Make sure you order ahead because otherwise you will have to wait, but its not too long.  Be sure to bring cash, that would be my only complaint - it would be much easier if L' Patron accepted credit/debit cards.  Reasonably priced. Great people. What to order? Tacos - el pastor, always."
"I cannot stop coming here.  Their carne asada tacos are el deal real, even if it takes 15-25 minutes to receive them.  They use big chunks of meat, so you definitely get your money's worth.  I've enjoyed the fish and al pastor tacos also.  The ribeye taco was super juicy, so if you like that sort of thing, go with it.  I've tried the Gringa and honestly was not too big of a fan of it.  Too cheesy for me.  But it didn't interfere with my affection for the carne asada.  The burritos have a healthy amount of juice and sour cream inside, it'll get messy.  The rice and beans are addicting and very good.It's always packed when I visit, and you'll leave probably smelling like food, as the ventilation is not the best.  If you dine in, wear old clothes you don't mind acquiring a smell.  Calling ahead and doing pickup is the way to go with this joint.I got hungry for tacos while writing this.$Cash only$"
"Worth the hype. Overall, may be my favorite taco shop, though no specific taco was my favorite of its kind.Quick breakdown:1. Carne Asada - the worst taco meat, in my opinion, but this was a good one. Barely too chewy is the highest praise I can give it. I just had to try it because people rave about it. 2. Al Pastor - this is my favorite taco. My favorite taco of any kind is the al pastor at Tierra Caliente on Ashland. The L'Patron version was good, but a little too strong on the pineapple. It also seemed like the pineapple was added after slicing the meat instead of having the pineapple on the ""spit,"" though I could be wrong. I'd say it's very similar to the Big Star version, which is a backhanded compliment of sorts.3. Fish - Great flavors, one of the more unique fish tacos around. Heavy on black pepper, which somehow worked great. The fish was fine, but not crispy enough for my taste. The best fish taco, randomly, is at Fish 'n' Salsa in Glen Ellyn, if you're ever randomly out there. 4. Tripitas - This was a special that I noticed on the counter, it was not on the menu. This was my most pleasant surprise of the day. This was a different tripe taco than I am used to, much crispier than usual. It was perfect, light in texture and not overpowering in smell/flavor. Even more randomly, the best tripitas taco is at Rancho Grande in Lansing, IL if you're ever out there for no reason. Again, all of the above were great, and this place has amazing quality across the board. Nothing else really matters, but I did like the staff, the prices, and the convenient location if you're driving. Cash only, by the way!"
"Great Carne asada tacos.  The pablano rajas taco was outstanding as well.  Good salsa, wait time was average."
"Growing up in California and living in San Francisco I grew to love the tiny little taquerias that offer all sorts of flavor with no frills. I'm not saying California has a monopoly on these joints, and Chicago definitely boasts some as well, but you have to sort place after place to find one that does it right and ignore the bright, shiny lights of Big Star and Antique Taco (which are delicious, but not quite the little joints I truly love). L'Patron is cut from the cloth of those same little joints. I love that their vegetarian taco is listed merely as varying offerings (and in fact, the offering changed while we were standing there). The salsas, vibrant greens and reds, come oozing out of big squeeze bottles. The green salsa with a good level of spice that lingers for awhile, was my main draw here. The tacos were awesome, I loved the vegetarian special (potatoes and kale) more than the pobalno rajos. I thought the guacamole's dried cranberry topping was a little odd when I first saw it, but it turned out to be a nice touch."
"This was a pleasant surprise. Went here on a whim on a Friday night after trying to get a table at two other places and landed here in my hanger (hungry anger). Was not disappointed. The guac and chips were rad, the horchata was banging and I loved the veggie taco. More please!"
This isn't over priced white people food. Real tacos come with onion and cilantro and a side of limes and cost $2 each.
I go here about once every other weekend. This and Big Star are the best bang for your buck in Chicago. I usually get the tilapia or steak tacos. Very flavorful. They are pretty keen on the ingredients they use.
The elite was out of this world!!!! I have been craving it ever since. The gringa was fair. Chicken Travis were awesome! My biggest complaint was it took forever to get our food. Usually Mexican takes like 5 seconds but this took forever.
"This is a tiny tiny place.  Didn't know it was going to be this small.  Had the veggie and poblano tacos and burritos.  The food was fine.  Chips are not included as they are in many places.  Also, they don't take credit cards, which I always think is inconvenient in this day and age."
I really love this taco place only because how good the food taste. That's all. The wait is 30 mins plus. They give you the wrong food and then I go in their today and  on the signs the prices are the same but when i go to pay for my food I'm told that that the tacos went up $.50 each but the signs still say $2.00 each. That is no way to do business .
"Oh man, the first time we went here randomly we were amazingly surprised. It was so busy on some weekend night, but they had their shit together. It was impressive. The place is small, and it was packed, but we sat front and center to watch them take orders and prepare food. We had chicken and steak tacos and burritos, both so tender and full of flavor. We were very surprised and left impressed.Another time we got carry-out, and were still in love. We also had the gauc, which is awesome as well. Sorry, not a lot of adjectives here, but no need! Just go check it out. Oh, and its Cash only."
"So I resolved to try the al pastor tacos again at L'Patron in the New Year and sweet heavenly jesu I'm glad I did.  There was a definite change from the last time I had them in that this time there were large chunks of pineapple and the accompanying sweeetness and light perfectly balanced the smokiness of the pork.  This is some serious al pastor and I'll be back for more.But, word to the wise, go easy on the salsa verde - they are sneaking some kind of Scoville overachiever into that sauce because after putting it on my tacos my tongue needed a serious milk bath.  That stuff is on FIRE!  You have been warned."
"The best kept secret in town... An executive friend of mine who wine & Dines at the most afluent restaurants in the city recommended the place.. He said it was ""hands down"" the best taco and steak place at rediculious low prices... He was right.."
"I'd been meaning to experience their tacos on some random late night but every time I've been through it was raining and they were packed.  The restaurant is a small storefront with a waiting area meshed with it's dining area which seats less than ten.  If you don't like standing in a crowd waiting on food, this may not be your kind of joint.  Ordering ahead is a great idea.So on one such rainy night I happened inside and was told I was their last customer of the evening.  I didn't realize the 4 am close time is only on Fri & Sat, whereas the rest of the week they close at 10 pm.  I placed an order for a gringa and lengua (cow tongue) taco hurriedly.  It seemed as though one of the counter gals and a cook were trying to get out of there as soon as possible (maybe trying to make the Mos Def concert that night).  Cook time was about twenty minutes, all this while they were closing up and whilst other drunken patrons were sucking down their tacos.So the food.  Meh.  The Gringa which is one of their signature dishes only served in a handful of Chicago taquerias was terrible.  The cook burnt the stuffing and still packed that shit for me to take.  It smelled of burnt, was over salted, had a black singe on it, dry and was terrible.  Thank goodness they packed it with rice and lettuce otherwise, I wouldn't of had a meal to eat.  The lengua was okay, I've never had pulled cow tongue so I'm not sure whether it was or wasn't cow tongue.  Best guess is, it was not.  Earlier, before grabbing my take out I noticed one counter gal and a cook having a difficulty in relating orders.  So, I know I wasn't the only one that got a mixed up order that evening.  If a cook can burn your dish and still serve it to you, that shit is disappointing.  When I'm in the mood for a good taco and Gringa find me at El Gallo Bravo.  Inspect your food before carrying out.  So many five star reviews and I'd hoped they could've done better."
Delicious lengua and pescado tacos. The burrito al pastor was perfectly marinated and seasoned - makes you wish it was a magical endless burrito. The corn etole was a bit underwhelming for me. Can't wait to stop by here again!!!
"This place is amazing!  My husband is eternally looking for the best burrito and he found it here with the carne asada burrito.  My daughter loved her steak tacos, and as the resident vegetarian, I loved my poblano rajas  torta.We waited about 20 minutes for our food, but we knew that was the norm going in, so no complaints.We had efficient yet friendly service, awesome food, and  our bill was under $20.  You can't beat that.  Can't wait to go back!"
"One of my favorite taco places in the city. I wish I didn't live so far away, because I'd probably eat here all the time if I could.It gets really crowded in there, with pickups and dine-in. There's only about 10-12 seats.Nice, friendly cashier ladies."
The fish taco is the best I had so far. The guac was amazing but the quality seem changed. It's not as tasty as before. The price is very affordable.
"Awesome little taco stand with fresher-than-usual ingredients and homemade tortillas.  Simple, easy-to-understand menu.  Tacos, burritos, tortas, and gringas.The carne asada is tender and the al pastor has big chunks of roasted pineapple. The staff is friendly, the store is clean."
"Move over Chipotle.Hands down the best Mexican food that I have found in Logan Square. I debated giving them a five, upon further thought I thought four worked well for them - really good, but not great food, and a great price. Below are my all-world tips for maximizing your experience.1) Eat at the restaurant - the food is way better when it is served hot2) Have the green hot sauce - banging3) Eat all things steak4) Cheers"
Favorite spot for authentic tacos when I'm at work and looking for a lunch break. Only get 4 stars because they're cash only but the food is excellent. Service is quick and friendly.
"Best Tacos in da City. Cheap and unbelievably good.Things to get, vegetarian style:-Chile Relleno-Horchata-Circulating veggie taco of the day (changes daily, dayum)-Burrito-Guacamole (has pomegranate seeds, WHAT!?)-Anything, it rules"
Be prepared to wait! This place is loved...HARD! It looks to me they make their chips there and the quality of the meat/chicken is top notch! The staff is friendly and always on their toes! Order ahead if your smart! Bring a diaper....yer not getting in the bathroom right away!
"Came here for lunch and love it! The fish tacos were incredible. We had two of us and ate two tacos each, two horchatas and some chips and guacamole and it came to less than $20.  Definitely coming here again when I'm in Chicago! Only four stars because the bathroom was a bit messy."
"Big fat steak, chunks of pineapple in the pastor, great guacamole, good people, nice salsa's, great prices, big fat steak(yeah I know) fresh chips, get the point?"
Delicious Mexican with rocking music and be ell priced. Try the Gringa with pork and homemade tortillas!!! The red salsa with chips is sooooo tasty and hot.
Probably some of the best Pastor I've ever had.  I can't wait to go back.  Not fancy order at a counter no booze etc.  Who cares when the food is this good.
"For the price, this food can't be beat.  It is really delicious-the guacamole is very unique with some dried cranberries and all of their vegetarian tacos taste fresh, authentic, and interesting!  I live very close to Big Star and often go there for the takeout window on my way home but I'll say these tacos were less expensive and better tasting."
"After visiting Los Angeles in the summer I thought I'd never find tacos close to the several i've had in LA, however, L'Patron proved me wrong. I started off with the chips and guac and they were amazing!! I would highly recommend it! For my meal I got three tacos, carne asada (steak), pescado (fish), and lengua. The lengua was the best so juicy and tender I would go back and just get these!! Can't wait to stop by again and try everything else they have on menu!"
"I have a taco dance. Calling it a dance may be a bit generous; my partner in overeating might describe it as me bouncing up and down in my chair, giddy with excitement when tacos are in front of me. Yes, I am weird.Every time we have passed L'Patron, I make a point of stating that I want to eat there. The stars aligned when we needed to grab a bite on the way to our destination and would coincidentally pass by L'Patron. L'Patron is a small taqueria, there is a counter to eat, but I'd plan on carrying out your food. For dinner, I wanted to order all of the fish and veggie items, but settled on the poblano rajas burrito and a tilapia taco; my dining companion went with the lomo encebollado (ribeye and onion) burrito. The burritos are good size, but not gargantuan; I didn't have trouble putting down the burrito and taco. L'Patron cuts their burritos in half; I don't like this. While it makes for a more dainty eating experience, it also makes for a more messy one with juices flowing everywhere. TIP: ask for extra napkins.Both of us enjoyed our burritos, him a bit more enthusiastically than me. While I would order my burrito again, it was missing the heat I was looking for; even after adding both the red and green salsas they provided. Spoiler alert: the salsa verde is rather mild. Overall, solid, but not exceptional; next time I'll go for the vegetarian special. The fish taco is where it's at; it was my favorite of my two items and I wish I had opted for more than one of them. The taco was very tasty and not skimpy on the fish at all; it also brought a nice heat I wasn't expecting. Just typing about them now makes me salivate a bit.I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu; I envision a date with some elote and shrimp tacos in my future.**Cash only, por favor."
Wow what great tacos! Nice find.
"This place is mediocre at best. The Al Pastor I had was too sweet and the meat was dry. I had a bite of a steak burrito and it was decent but I have had better, bigger and cheaper Mexican food in this city. The service was lousy. We waited nearly half an hour for our order. There were a couple people who ordered after us and got their food before us. A lot of hipsters in there that don't know any better."
"This place is a pleasant surprise.  Better tacos and burritos than almost anywhere else in chicago.  Really.   But it can take 10-20 mins for a burrito, so i call ahead.I've tried 4 different meats: carne asada, al pastor, pollo, and fish.  Al pastor is my clear favorite, but they are all way above average.  Pastor is cooked with tons of flavor from pineapples and peppers.  Great in tacos or burritos.  Vegetarian options are great, too, and vary every week, and include non-standard mexican vegies. Everything is balanced - Fish tacos come with slaw and some creamy sauce, burritos have the right mix of sauce, meat, and extras.  In fact, their Burritos are my favorite burritos in Chicago hands down.  I love how they wrap'em them grill 'em for a few so they are hot and delicious.And the best part - less than a mile from my house."
"When a place has been open for just 5 months and there are already 75 reviews in an area that isn't greatly traveled, you need to pay attention. Well, I was paying attention and now I know why lots of people have been here, and have enjoyed L'Patron Tacos. I was jonesing for some tacos and felt like going somewhere new. So, L'Patron it was. I made sure there was cash in my wallet (they are cash only) and made my way over with some very good anticipation. It's small inside. Not completely cramped, but not exactly decadently spacious either. What this means is that I'm usually in for something good. See, it's that near hole-in-the-wall feel that has usually brought me some of the best tacos. They do have a decent amount of seating all things considered, but it can be tight if there are even 10 people there. I got myself 3 tacos as I was really really hungry. I wanted variety, so it was one each of the marinated chicken, carne asada, and the chorizo. In some ways, which one do I begin with, but how do I also rave about all of them at the same time. Well, I guess I just did. I do have to say, the chicken taco flat out ruled. I've come across places around the area that can dry out their chicken a bit much, but this was everything it needed to be and more. The carne asada was rocking as well with the chorizo. Well, the chorizo was special on awesome levels. Normally I'd add some salsa verde to my carne asada and chicken tacos, but these were too good to add spice to. I also had to get myself some horchata when I noticed it on the menu. I always love me some horchata and this really hit the spot. Granted, it's hard to screw up horchata, but this was refreshing and I drained it pretty fast. It's hard to miss L'Patron when driving down Diversey. You'll notice the red and green colors on the outside and you should walk in. There is a lot of competition in Logan Square for quality Mexican places, but L'Patron stands above many of those that I've tried. I now have to make return trips and work through more of the menu. L'Patron's quality flat out demands that I do that, and, well, I look forward to it."
"Just as good as the first time. Still my favorite Mexican spot! My friends and I love coming here sober or inebriated (open late). The food is inexpensive (cash only), freshly made, and tastes wonderful. My current favorites: gringa, gringo, shrimp taco (ask for homemade tortillas if ordering tacos), al pastor burrito. Don't forget their complimentary homemade pickles. Easy street parking. Highly recommend!"
"Staple - amazing food, cheap and bumpin'"
This is my go-to Logan Square burrito place.  The burritos are always delicious and I'm usually able to pick them up within about 20 minutes of calling in an order.
"Best steak tacos I've ever had, and fatty knows his steak tacos.  (Amazing carnitas, too.)  Call ahead, though, because it's a madhouse!"
"I've lived in San Diego so it's safe to say my standards for fish tacos are pretty high. You can get quality ones there at trucks all over the city for only a buck. While L'Patron isn't quite as good or as cheap I'd have to say it's probably the closest thing in Chicago I've had. You get a good filet of fish deep fried in a tasty batter with crispy cabbage and topped with pico for about $2.50. The shrimp is the same price and prepared pretty much the same way as well. While overall a good experience it'd still be nice to have a grilled option, but I guess the next time I get a craving this place will have to do."
Update your social media or put a sign on the door if you are closed during your normal business hours (since staff was inside anyways it doesn't seem too much to ask for a sign on the door saying CLOSED).
"This place makes great tacos! Delicious, never disappointed with the quality of the food. If you're looking for good tacos, I say go! That being said.....u need a strategy because navigating this pace can be complicated....hence the loss of a star, I don't like to work, above and beyond for fast food, that's why I'm buying it. 1. U can't get a food in a timely manner in this place so I always call ahead. 2. They need more space and a better phone system, I have called several times and the line is busy....seemingly indefinitely cause I've called @ different times within an hr period and still get the busy signal. If I can't call in my order I don't go here cause I refuse to wait an hr for some tacos........even ones as good as these. This place has alot of potential & good food, I hope they make some improvements."
"The al pastor was pretty good. The carne asada was omg the best I have ever had!!!! Recommend this place to everyone, it's tiny but man oh man, the carne asada.... Moist, super juicy, great flavor.... Seriously, try these tacos!"
"Not sure what the hype is. I am a Latina, I have been to Mexico and have had authentic tacos, these tacos are a tad Americanized. In my opinion not worth the long line and 20 minute wait. Skip the extra charge for the homemade tortillas. Not that great. Steak was solid, I prefer my steak not so charred. Try it and form your own opinion but honestly, not that great."
Wow!!!! Best tacos ever.... I ordered 3 but next ti e im gonna order 4 or 5.... Very friendly staff ...
"Stopped by this place based on reviews on yelp because we were starving and didn't know what was good in the area. Service was awesome! The cashiers were super friendly! Food was also yum! Based on the cashier's recommendations, we decided to try the steak, al pastor, and fish tacos. I also saw they had elotes, so I had to try! In addition to this, I also tried the guacamole because my friend got it.The verdict:Steak taco was very flavorful with some good char on the meat. A bit chewy but the taste compensated for that. Al pastor taco was my fave! It was so tender and delicious!! I will definitely get the al pastor taco next time I'm in the area! The fish taco was my least favorite of the three tacos, but was pretty tasty nonetheless. The elotes was good, but I have definitely had better. The ppl who sell them in the carts by my house make it much more tasty. The guacamole was awesome! When I first saw it, I noticed there was some cranberries atop the guacamole. I thought that was an odd combination. But the cranberries really made the guac tasty, and not weird as expected. It gave the spicy guac a tartness and a tang, which gave my taste buds an explosion of different flavors all in one bite! It's definitely worth the trip! I will be back in the future to try some other things on the menu!"
"Really good tacos.  We tried the lengua, carne asada, chicken, al pastor, fish, ribeye/onions, and shirmp. My favorites were the shrimp and carne asada.  The red and green sauces were really good as well."
The burritos here are pretty good. Fish tacos are really great! They are a bit spicy but great all the same! Service is good and quick! Place is so small though:(
Tripas tacos are amazing. .nice and crisp. .better than the ones I had in Vegas that I fell in love with. .glad I finally found a place in Chicago that is my go to taco joint...Service is also great :)
"I was introduced to this taqueria by a friend last week.  The tacos, tortas and burritos are simply amazing.  I had lunch and enjoyed their taco al pastor (pork) and taco de carne asada (steak).  I returned later in the day to bring other items home for my family to enjoy.  Due to inclement weather, my commute home was 2 hours long.  Needless to say, the food items arrived room temperature.  My wife could not believe the deliciousness of the food in-spite of not being warm.  The al pastor items accompanied with the pineapple bits creates a highly desired fulfilling flavor with each bite.  The steak items have a char-broiled taste comparable to an out door summer carne asada festivity.  I will certainly experience all the other items on their menu.  Their fish tacos and their rib-eye food items have been utterly endorsed as well."
"Alright, I'm going to update my last review and give them a better rating. The food is still meh (It's $1-$2 per taco - what can i expect, right?) but the place was packed and I enjoyed the people watching. They have killer ambience and that will win every single time. They have expanded their location and they are making a killing. There is something about this place that keeps me coming back. The service is wonderful, they are fast and cheap. Maybe I need to try something that isn't a taco... tortas here I come!!!"
"So I always give props and recommend restaurants by posting pics and raving about them if they're worth my time and money. So today Is gonna be no different but it's not gonna be a pretty review.  I read about L'Patron Mexican restaurant being one of Chicago's underrated spots. They used to be located on Fullerton and Central and now they've relocated to Diversey and California.  So today I decided to go give them a try as I spotted them as I was driving by and WTF is all I can say.  I would rather eat Dog shit or not ever eat again before ever walking into this place. Their food was absolutely awful, their portions were that of a high end gourmet Michigan Ave restaurant. Aside from them trying to charge me 3 different times cus they have 6 different cashiers. Once I got my order and got home the tacos were so soggy I wouldn't feed them to my dog. Oh and i paid $26 for a burrito, 3 tacos and some shit they called Guacamole. So I would like to send a BIG  to L'Patron Tacos"
"I made the 4 mile trek to L'Patron today and I am very glad that I did. I tried 4 menu items.1. Steak Taco- AWESOME! Large pieces of tender, juicy steak with chopped onion & cilantro.  It needed no crema and no salsa.2. Fish Taco- Pretty Good. Large chunks of fried tilapia with a spicy slaw and cheese.  The fish needed cumin and garlic IMO. 3. The Gringa- Underwhelming :-( This is their special. 2 homemade tortillas filled with steak, al pastor,  pineapple and chihuahua cheese, served with beans & rice. The beans were scorched and the rice had no taste. The sandwich was filled with more pineapple than anything else. Although I didn't like it today, I would try it again because in theory, I think it would have been great. The cost was only $5.49.4. Guacamole & chips- Average.  big chucks of fresh avocado with dried pomegranate.  I wasn't a fan of the pomegranate. The chips were AWESOME! They were so fresh and PIPING Hot.There is counter seating for about 15 people.  I will definitely return for the tacos!"
"Being from Sunny So. Cal, I have not yet  been able  to find some legit Mexican food, unless I make it... After months of trying to convince my roommate to go with me, I finally experienced what makes this restaurant so great.We waited a little more than I would have liked, but I could tell everything was freshly prepared, even the salsas! The Carne Asada was tender and juicy. The beans were not as desirable as I would have liked, but I tend to like them more on the refried side.I will most definitely be going back again!"
"I was excited to try this place because I'm a taco lover and after reading the reviews and finding out that it's not that far from me I couldn't wait to try it.  I got there not too long after they opened so I was able to beat the crowd that usually forms. I ordered to go so I cannot speak about what their eating area is like. But I got a steak taco, the gringo and elotes all of which was very tasty. The steak was very flavorful, not bland or too salty, it was seasoned just right. The gringo was delicious as well just a little bready for me but good all the same. It came with refried beans and spanish rice which I had not realized because it wasn't stated on the menu. Had I known this I probably would not have ordered the elotes, but I am glad I got to try it. I also had the chips and guacamole, the homemade chips were delicious, but as far as the guacamole, I've had much better. It was more like avocado mashed with some toppings sprinkled on it more so than actual guacamole. That is sad considering how much it costs. All in all this is a pretty good place if your looking for some tasty authentic tacos."
"Amazing! Came here because I saw the recent burrito rankings, and was not disappointed. Carne Asada was as good as advertised, but to me the true star was their tacos. Chorizo taco was out of this world, I'll be coming back for the tacos!"
"I go here at every opportunity. They're food is amazing, always cooked to order, hot and fresh. They're the best! Get the pork or the steak! Get the guacomole! Get anything! This place is the best."
"Amazing.  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Chicago but this maybe the best.  This will not be a long review, just a recommendation to go try it for yourself.  Just remember to bring cash and be patient, the line can be long regardless of the time.  Enjoy!!!"
"Delicious find for me close to my new home ;)As a non-meat eater, I sampled the fish tacos and the poblano rajas tacos. Both very tasty. No frills here; just delicious authentic street food. My husband had the gringo and has been craving it ever since that fist bit.Expect a line on a weekend evening, but it moves quick. Cash only. People walk in and order tacos by the dozen!Also, I'm inclined to think there may be a ""secret"" menu here based on an observation I made between a patron and a member of the staff. The word ""ceviche"" was uttered and instantly excited my palette, but it is not on the menu board. Hmmm... Just a theory, however.Try this place."
"Since my boyfriends favorite Mexican place got shutdown I was searching for an awesome Mexican joint. So, while on my search, I came across L Patron and saw all of the awesome reviews and bam, I knew where our next Mexican food  destination was. The BF got the Gringo (their signature handmade tortilla filled with Carne Asada, and Chihuahua cheese) while I got the Gringa (their signature handmade tortilla filled with Carne Al Pastor, and Chihuahua cheese). Everyone raves about the Gringo and Gringa...and yes they are delicious...but I try to eat healthy(ish) and my stomach just wasn't ready for that.  The mix of  lots and lots of ooooey gooey cheese and heavy masa were just too much for me. I was uncomfortably full and bloated like a mofo. The chips and guac were really good. The meat on both the Gringo and Gringa was delicious. I'll for sure go back for tacos since it's a lighter meal. I'd recommend calling ahead for your order because the ordering process and cooking times seem to be a little longer here than at most other places. Also, the staff is SUPER friendly, so that's a bonus."
My fav taco place!
"We stopped in as second of our 5 stop taco progressive dinner. (We ended at Big Star and yes this ranks higher). This little casual joint is fantastic - we got some beers from the Walgreens next to the place. The special taco of the day were juicy, fresh and full of flavours. The 90's hip hop music in the background is just a nice bonus."
"Great tacos!!!! The wait was long but worth it. Just make sure you bring cash! I got the carne asada, al pastor tacos, and guacamole with chips. Everything was made to perfection with fresh ingredients. I can't wait to come back and try something different."
"I am not a huge fan of the burritos here, but the horchata and tacos are delicious. The chicken in my burrito is not my favorite. There are a lot of big chunks and fatty pieces that I ended up picking out. It should also be noted that there is no rice in the burritos. Nowhere does it say that there is rice in them, but I was still surprised and rice-lovers should be warned.The service is great. This place is cash only."
"Amazing tacos. Take your out of town friends here, get some guac and several of each taco and bring over some Mexican beer (its byob) and have yourself a party. They recently expanded their hours which is great. Don't expect anything fancy or classy--its very mom and pop. Some yuppies might turn their nose at the decor, but true foodies know good tacos, and this place surely won't disappoint."
"The tacos here are AMAZING! tried this place for the first time yesterday and while I dont really like trying new places, I'm so glad I did. I had a taco of the asada and one of the pastor both as delicious. The pastor though, wow! I've been searching for a taco spot with good pastor for a while and I've finally found it. only downfall was there was a was a tad bit of a wait, but worth it though."
First time here.  It was busy at lunch and for good reason.  I believe I had the best carne asada taco of my life here.   Be prepared to wait a bit if it is busy.  It's a small place but has a decent amount of seating.   I'll be going back.
"Five stars for a new authentic restaurant. I tried the fish, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The fish and carne asada were good. But the AL PASTOR WAS AMAZING. This succulent pork taco now rivals the shrimp taco at Del Seoul as my favorite taco in the city. It is so good. And only two bucks. It's also close to home, friendly down to earth service, and freshly made. The only downside, for now, is that it's cash only. But that just makes me feel like its more authentic ;). Give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Oh. And open til 4am on Saturday mornings! I will definitely be back."
yum this place was good.  super yummy veggie taco - it was a fried poblano with potatoes on it today.  yum.  shrimp taco was good.  fish taco not so much - i think they use catfish or something which I cant stand that bottom feeder mud taste but to each his own.  would def go back.
"Best darned taco joint in Chicago. The carne asada is the bomb. And the tacos de lomo Omfg I only wish I'd know about this place sooner. Only bad thing I could say is the order/wait line is super crowded all the time so I always order ahead to go,but the food is so good I don't mind feeling like a sardine for few minutes! Definitely puts every other Mexican restaurant to shame!!!"
"This is officially the spot. If it was in Evanston I would ride a horse to get there...I would steal someone else's horse and ride up there..bareback..in the middle of the night..on the kennedy/edens..flipping double freedom fingers the whole way.I was born and raised in Tucson near the US/Mexico border. So I grew up with an abundance of the greatest Sonoran style mexican food both at friends' homes and at carts/restaurants. This is bar none the most authentic and delicious mexican in Chicago; regardless of how much you spend - I'm looking at you Bayless. It rivals the best I've ever had in Mexico, in Tucson, anywhere - and as memories tend to skew towards a positive bias - I'm going to say it is THE BEST. Whoa.Al Pastor Tacos - supremely well made, crunchy juicy bits of marinated pork with grilled pineapple chunks that add but don't overwhelm the flavor of the meat.Fish Tacos - fresh!! Light slaw with a little sweetness and a thin but crunchy batter on the tilapia.Elote - a corn cob mexican style, mixture of spice and mayo that is spread on the cob like butter. If you haven't had elote you must try it. Sounds weird but is delicious.Lengua Tacos - Lengua/tongue is hard to do well but patron kills it. Juicy and full of beefiness.$14 bucks fed myself and my girlfriend too much great food. Thank you L'Patron. Open up another location under the blue at California and Milwaukee please."
"After reading Sandy R.'s review just yesterday, I bookmarked this place immediately, and then it became the shortest-lived bookmark ever because I ended up visiting last night.Everything about this place called out to me: its proximity to my residence, its reasonable prices, and of course, the food itself.The food is made to order and the variety and quality of tacos rivals Antique Taco and Big Star (neither of which I'm a big fan of). The best part is that there's no long lines (at least until the hipsters discover this place) and the prices are quite fair. Conversely, this isn't much of a sit-down place; although they do have plenty of counter seating, it's more of a takeout joint in my opinion.Ah, the food. Absolutely delicious al pastor tacos (which were bewilderingly juicy) with pieces of charred pineapple melting into the pork, adding a sweet contrast to the salty meat. And properly dressed with diced onions and cilantro. Hot, crispy tortilla chips and chunky pico de gallo were also ordered, and I was pleasantly surprised at the addition of pomegranate seeds to the pico de gallo. Also offered are two kinds of vegetarian tacos which change daily (this visit was grilled zucchini, peppers, and mushrooms or poblano rajas), so even vegetarian offerings are not merely an afterthought. Other taco/burrito varieties include fish, shrimp, chicken, chorizo, carne asada, and even lengua for you adventurous types. They even have elote, which I definitely plan to try on my next visit. On the counter are huge jars of escabeche (basically a Mexican giardinera) so help yourself--this is good stuff.I was quite intrigued by the cucumber water, which was so refreshing (especially after I added vodka once I got home) and cut through some of the spiciness of the food. If cucumber water isn't your thing, they offer traditional horchatas, jarritos, and Mexican Coca-Cola.For now, it's cash only, so plan accordingly. Service was extremely pleasant and engaging. Can't quite give five stars after one visit, but stay tuned."
"Being a so called Mexican food ""snob"" I have extremely high standards when it comes to flavor and authenticity and let me tell you something.... This place serves the best Mexican food in the Midwest hands down!!! Had one of each type of taco and was not disappointed by any. Also, the rojo sauce that comes bottled for your convience  is phenomenal."
"If you're going to this place because Google says they have Puffy Tacos, don't bother.  The tacos are nothing special, the shells aren't puffy and nothing comes in them but meat, onion and cilantro.  The Gringa was good though."
Very flavorful and their food definitely stands out from the other taquerias in Chicago. I can't stand tomatoes so asked for them to make me some guacamole without and they did without hesitation. It was delicious. I don't know how they make rice and beans taste so tasty but they do. Tacos were small but filling. Food is made to order (which is great but it takes a little while) so better to call ahead. Cash only and very little seating. A new favorite.
"I have been to this place no less than 10 times because of its proximity to our house and I'm sad to say that I just don't get it.  I want to get it, trust me I do, but I just don't.  I'm not a fan of either their fish nor shrimp tacos and those are my things!  I do love their horchata and elote, but you can only have so much of those before enough is enough.  Not only that, but the last 3 times we've gone there our order have been wrong... like WAY wrong.  If you take it for what it is (a cash only take out taco place) I can get why people love it, but it just doesn't do it for me.  I'm really glad that others love it and I hope it does well.  In the meantime, I guess I'll just keep trying new things until I find something for me and leaving enough time to triple check my order before I walk out the door."
Food was amazing and the service was great. If other steak burrito and a gringo. I couldn't finish but I'm happy to eat them again later
"Inexpensive, freshly made and everything we tried was delicious! Carne Asada burrito is amazing and the Horchata was a favorite. Food was also ready fairly quickly considering the huge crowd."
"This place Rocks!!!!!! Ernesto and his friendly staff serve up the best tacos in town, bar none.  Steak Tacos = Killer.  Steak Burrito with extra beans and avocados = lose a tooth good.  Chicken great, though I prefer it on the Quesadilla.  The Guac Rocks!!!! with dried cranberries, who's done that before???They're opening a side room next to the original next month, in order to handle the at all times overflow crowd.Horchata = Homemadeneed i say more?!La mas bien comida por precios bajo en Chicago!"
"How good could a vegan taco be?  What do you get?   Beans, (providing they're not cooked in lard) rice, lettuce, guacamole?  Snore.  L Patron's Friday veggie special was poblano peppers, mushrooms and grilled butternut squash. The taco was so fresh, so flavorful and delicious I had to sit up and take notice (and take another bite!)  No more snooze fest veggie tacos for me.  I'll be heading to L Patron for their meatless wonders when I get a hankering for a great taco.  So yum...not ho hum!"
"I am a fatboy at heart, and one food a fatboy holds dear to his heart is Mexican food. L'Patron has hands down the tastiest Mexican grub in the city. Lets start out with the Quesadilla so affectionately called El Gringo and La Gringa. The homemade corn tortillas are the best tortillas I have every eaten. Then you the marinated steak, which is the best steak I have every had at a Mexican joint, better than anything I have had at Mercadito. Then we move on to the the torta, and burrito. Both of these are muy delicioso. They ingredients used here are fresh and quality, you can tell with every bite. I suggest calling in, as it is always busy.  Which is a good thing, because you know they are doing things right."
This place is awesome! Much better then Big Star and without the wait!
"Go, just GO. If the throngs of people out the door aren't enough for you to be intrigued, take my word for it.I have lived in Logan Square for 6 years and despite the myriad of options (all great options) for Mexican food we have here, its hard to touch L'Patron. The al pastor is something of a religious experience, the fish tacos are easily amongst the best in town, and the house creations gringa/gingo are very welcome oddball menu items. The staff is awesome and the food is off the charts legit.Yes, it is true. The burritos are not the rice filled gut busters that you gluttons are looking for. They are compact vehicles for deploying meaty deliciousness to your face. No frills. No bullshit. Just calm down and order a couple of tacos too. You'll be ok. Drink the horchata too. For serious. They recently added tables and are byob. Grab a six pack and a friend and go destroy some tacos. Now. Go now. Seriously. Go."
"Best fish tacos and open late! You can have the fish tacos battered or unbattered. Did not know till last week. Been going to this place for a while now. The guac and chips are amazing. They have chunks of avocado on there and I believe cranberries. The ribeye tacos, shrimp tacos, and fish tacos are the best to get here."
"Without question, L'Patron gets 5 stars.  This place has become my favorite Mexican joint in Chicago.  The steak burrito and pork tacos are incredible.  Chips and guac (with craisins) is also excellent.  Will be going back soon."
"One of the best taquerias in the city. I should know, I've been to way too many of them! But honestly, if you say you sell tacos, I'm probably gonna let you prove it to me, and L' Patron has.La Pasadita has some bomb carne asada, but L Patron is BETTER. the chorizo is tasty and not overly salty, and the Lomo Encebollado taco will flip your lid.Great tacos, fun employees, constant quality, great prices. Cash only."
"L' Patron is all about quality Mexican street food cooked to order, delicious and hot, with family recipe salsas.  I love it.  That being said I prefer a fatter gringa."
Best steak burrito in the city of chicago hands down bar none no comparison (PERIOD) where do I start the steak tastes like steak (looking at you 98% of taco joints) the meat is cooked to perfection the beans are the perfect texture and the veggies are fresh can't say enough about this place I've lived in chicago my whole life and have had thousands of burritos but not one comes close to this place!
I actually heard good things about this place.  Where do I begin? Besides it being dirty and the staff just standing around the food is was over rated.  The one thing I like about the al pastor is that it has pineapple but it was over season to the point the taste was weird.  The fish taco was on point.  I also liked the watermelon water.  The tacos were small and the tortillas cold. So much for a place that cooks on the spot and makes you wait 15-20 for fresh food cooked on the spot. As far as Mexican food goes you could go down the block to masa azul or the zacatecana on California.
"This place is so amazing. I highly recommend the Al Pastor tacos. Also, the staff was very helpful and nice."
"Had their fish taco,  steak taco and hibiscus drink and I could not be happier.  It's clean,  it's small and so worth the wait for the good food.  Plenty of parking on California ave. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food!"
"What an absolutely wonderful place. All the tacos are delicious, the Al pastor and others are almost as good as Big Star, and cost 1.50-2.00 less. Everything is made to order so I am dreading when word about this place gets around because the line will probably be winding down the street.The owner and workers are all very friendly but the truest way a restaurant respects it's customers is by offering really good food at really great prices and L'Patron does just that. There aren't many gems like this around."
"I must be spoiled with all the excellent Mexican food in the burbs. El pastor was over spiced - big chunks of pineapple and very little meat. Not exactly my favorite combination - maybe it's just a preference. Guac and chips were awesome - service, awesome. Longer wait than expected for 3 tacos. Just on the fence ... Won't go back."
"Finally, a taco joint on the north side that I love.  Real food, not overly priced, delicious flavors, wonderful staff - I just wish the place was bigger - but hopefully that will come in time because this place has so much potential to become very successful!  To say that even a veggie taco is delicious says a lot, and it is - I could have eaten a half dozen easily.   The Gringo/as are made with fresh masa - made with either steak or carne al pastor (with pineapples) and melted chihuahua cheese - oh darn here comes the drool.I can't wait to go back because there are several items on their menu that I can't wait to try - namely their elotes (corn) - YUM!!!  Take note - right now it's cash only.....that is all."
"There are a lot of taco joints around town.  This one stands out for me because their prices are reasonable, their guac is chunky and their red sauce is respectfully hot.  I agree with other reviewers -- call in your order as their is always a line.  You can jump it if you are picking up food. Cash only."
"Forgive me for I have been SO SO wrong in thinking that all taquerias are created equal (equally good, of course!).  L'Patron stands out from all others.  This is no joke.L'Patron has shown me the way.  I recommend sticking to the tacos, as it increases you flavor to tortilla ratio.  The steak, pork, and fish tacos all highlight and celebrate the respective fillings flavors.  The meats are coarsely cut to emphasize the flavors that they bring to the tortilla shells.  The fish taco is complimented with a fresh slaw and the pork taco is complimented with pineapple.  The steak taco is celebrated on its own and that's good enough for me.If you've not been to L'Patron, you should.  It may be life changing.  A few tips, though.  Expect to have to stand and wait in a crowded space for your order to be readied.  Expect to have to take your food to go (and just eat it in the darn car or out on the street).  Also, and most importantly, expect to LOVE your taco."
"Get the steak tacos.  Meat is flavorful and tender.  Be wary, this is a good place for take out since it's kinda small, but if you stay it is BYOB!"
Better than the Price is Right (on a sick day)
"I still get amazed every time I come in here and remember that the tacos in this place are only $2.  I've had $4 tacos downtown that weren't half as good (ok, granted, the rent downtown is going to be twice as high, so...)  I've had just about every taco in this place, and they are all fantastic, but do yourself a favor and get the carne asada; even if you're a vegetarian, give yourself the night off and go for it.  I will warn you to be prepared - it is always jam packed at this place, so your best bet is to call ahead and place your order while you're on your way.  It's basically only take-out, although there are a couple of chairs and a counter (it does appear that they are expanding, though)."
"Best tacos in Chicago. Sorry Big Star, I love you but L'Patron is on a different level. Carne Asada is perfectly cooked. Chips and salsa are insanely good. Stuff yourself silly for under $10.00."
"BEST carne asada tacos in CHI. Hands down. I'm talking thick, juicy cuts of steak that can barely be contained by a soft corn tortilla. And since you're already spoiling yourself, order some elote!"
"Pretty good place.  My friend and I ordered the gringo, the fish taco, the shrimp taco, and chorizo taco, as well as the beef burrito.  The burrito was pretty good, although maybe lacking just a little flavor from the typical ""kick"" that Mexican food typically has to offer.  The tacos were good, but I would say that I was slightly disappointed in the chorizo taco given that the chorizo wasn't as good as I've had before.  My friend and I were too stuffed to even eat the gringo which means that I didn't eat it until almost two days after when it became my leftover lunch.  Given this, I won't be able to make a fair review of it.  Overall, the food was okay, but I'm giving them extra points because what I really liked was the guacamole.  It was fantastic, topped off with cranberries to add a little bit of sweetness to the equally yummy chips.  In addition to that, the chips and guac were complimentary (thanks L'Patron!) due to our wait ---- although, truth be told, we didn't wait that long.  Either way, we gladly welcomed it to start off our meal!  I also had the horchata which was really good!...although maybe a little sweeter than I would have liked.  Although their process in taking people's order could have been a little more efficient to help streamline incoming and outgoing customers, the waitstaff was very friendly and helpful."
There is L Patron and than there is everything else. The gringo is maybe the most delicious thing I've ever eaten in my entire life. Everything is top notch to the nines.
"This has surpassed La Pasadita as my favorite taqueria. All the tacos are great, however the al pastor is the standout. I thought the order was taking too long, but then I learned the chefs had some sort of connection with Rick Bayless, so then it made sense: They were cutting the meat to order, it wasn't pre-cooked. Awesome."
One of the best tacos I've had in Chicago!! Cheap and really friendly service. Love this little taqueria! It's really best for takeout or going with 1 or 2 friends. It's tiny on the inside. Sooo good!
Ok whatever. This place has pretty good food but it's definitely not worth the insane wait. And they're cash only. I would never even go here but it's near my house and I always think it will be easy and convenient but rarely is.
crazy small crowded place with ok tacos. i had high hope for this place after reading many great yelp reviews. we orderedtongue - really tenderal pastor - okbeef burrito - really huge with little meatthought the food was ok but the wait was crazy.
"Damn you L' Patron for ruining, RUINING, mexican food for me.I can no longer go to any other hole in the wall places in IL.I hope you guys are happy!"
"Just got back from Mexico and already in need of a taco hit.  There's no discernible difference between these tacos and the ones found at stands in Mexico. That gringa is something serious and again, I've only tasted fish tacos at this scale IN Mexico. Sadly, the secret is out about L' Patron. The crowd here is a mix of locals who grew up in the neighborhood, so they really know what a good taco is. Then you have that annoying group of people who flock in droves to any and everything new and ""trendy"", they make you never wanna go to your favorite places ever again. I have to stay the course with L' Patron, can't afford the weekly trips to Mexico. Will just have to figure out how to navigate this sea of newbies."
Guacamole with cranberries was on point. Ordered the elotes in a cup and will try on the cob next time. Just moved to the area and am pretty happy that such a good Mexican food joint is right around the corner. Very affordable too. I'll add a star once I try the elotes on the cob.
"Amazing food. I could probably eat the fish tacos every day and not grow tired. Horchata as previously mentioned, is also incredible. I just can't give it 5 stars because they don't take credit/debit cards- I just don't carry cash these days. FYI - the seating is limited, which is fine because it greats incredibly hot inside during the summer months. You WILL smell like the restaurant after you leave...wear clothes accordingly."
"Believe everything everyone says.  The pork,  the fish, the Gringo = all amazing.This is going to become a weekly habit for me.  Super nice service - parking is easy - I think its cash only.    Everything is delicious - the steak is unbelievable!"
Oh my oh my oh my!!! What just happened here!? Best El Pastor and Fish Tacos I think I've ever had in my entire life. And I eat a lot of mexican food.Thanks guys. KEEP THE PRICES NICE AND LOW and I will never eat at another taqueria!! (2.00$ tacos!)
I have had way better food from less hyped up establishment.... wasn't impressed with the tastless burnt torta.....
"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives -- Oh My!  This little hole in the wall ""dive"" serves up cheap eats and is CASH ONLY. Service is hospitable. The food was hit or miss in some areas. It's not a fancy place, but your $$$ will stretch a bit. I recommend trying ""El Gringo"" or ""La Gringa"" which are stuffed with tons of carne asada and melted chihuahua queso. We ordered the Lomo encebollado taco (rib eye with onions) and carne asada taco. Although the carne asada had a wonderful, rich charcoal flavor and was tender, the meat was a bit on the dry side. When I got home, I dressed up all the tacos with my own pico de gallo, Mexican cheese and sour cream, because the tacos were served naked with only bits of onion. If you want the ""works"" you will have to pay .39 cents for each condiment per taco which can add up quickly. Therefore, your tiny taco is over $3 easily, pero esto si es una auténtica estafa. Just saying! We ordered two sides of arroz amarillo (yellow rice), but the arroz fell short in the flavor category. I thought it was a bit too bland. No tenia mucho sabor. Just saying.....the Tacos are perfect for a child's appetite y muy pequeño. They should charge $1.25 (not $2 each) porque esto si es una auténtica estafa. Just saying. If you are super hungry order more than two tacos. We also tried the chicken and bar-b-q pork with pineapples, which was truly the perfect amalgamation. The salty and sweet marinated nicely. Everything here is a la carte, so your bill can add up quickly. Maybe this is why the tacos are $2 each (to justify their a la carte service including condiments). NOTE/TIP: Call and place your order ahead of time. You'll thank me later. Otherwise, the wait is about 7-10 minutes per customer. When you arrive to pick up your order let them know you are picking up an order. You'll pay and walk out quickly. WHAT IT IS: This is an old-fashioned mom and pop operation that hasn't kept up with technology, except for the two flat screen televisions listing all their menu items, beverages and sides. Yes, this is as ""authentic"" Mexican ""dive"" but we've experienced better (check out the Mexican joint on the corner of Western and Armitage for much better Tacos). My husband enjoyed his Burrito. He's a big eater, and it filled him up nicely. On the day that I went for lunch (Sunday, 4/27/2014) this ""dive"" was booming with the 20 and 30-something crowd, young families with kids, and a few runners stopping in to pick up some protein after a long run. It has only been in the neighborhood for two years. I counted 12 stools crammed closely together. Seating is super limited. If you don't mind NOT having any elbow jammed into your ribs and don't require any room to eat, while others are sneezing and coughing nearby, go for it. I noticed that most of the people were sitting in the stools but NOT eating. WTH! Finally, I figured out that these people were ALL waiting to pick up orders (not eating there). Of course, the dive is super small so there really is no where to stand while waiting for your order/food. This really sucks. If anyone wants to sit down and eat there you'll have to ask someone to please get up, and hope you don't get a black eye or busted bloody lip. This is more of a ""take out"" joint than a sit-down eat-in joint. We took all of our food home. It is located right off the Kennedy expressway just west of California. You cannot miss the bright neon-lime-green building next to the alley and across the street from Popeye's Chicken. Park on Mozart (side street) if you are running inside to pick up an order. Parking in front of the restaurant is very limited, so it is a pain in the ass. Good luck finding a ""legal"" spot. DO NOT park in the Walgreen's parking lot or your car will be towed or given the ""boot."" Someone had this happen while I was at the restaurant. Poor guy. The ambiance screams ""take it to go!"" ""La Gringa"" = FOUR STARS. The carne asada Burrito = FOUR STARS. The chicken and carne asada tacos were so-so. The tacos = THREE STARS. However, if I had to choose between the two in terms of the flavor and tenderness, I would go with the chicken. THREE stars for the Tacos. Why? Because they are very small, served naked with only onions, and the carne asada was a bit on the dry side. I couldn't taste the difference between the carne asada and the rib eye tacos y el gusto a ambos era idéntico. You'll be asked ""what kind"" of salsa do you want, but that's all you get. Que desgraciados.....Just saying! We have experienced much better tacos at other Mexican restaurants. Did we enjoy the food? Would we go back again? Was it worth the $$$?  Claro que si, si, si!"
Yum Yum Yum! Chicken tacos are perfect! Steak Gringo was delicious! I love this place and that's it. :) I will be back very soon!
The food here is absolutely incredible. One bite of the fish tacos and I am set off on a rocketship. My taste buds are out of this world.
"Vegetarian tacos were OK. There was nothing special about them. The guacamole was very well done. Had a ton of flavor and was delicious. I will plan on going back there to try a few other things along with chips and guacamole, of course."
"The best.  Yes simply the best.  Better than any sit down Mexican restaurant in chicago.  Must try the gringa, ribeye steak burrito with their caramelized onions and I always just add avocado.  This people is the best joint in the city there is no reason to describe anything else.  I'm here at least twice a week"
"Fish taco's a must. Carne Asada also a winner; the Carne Asada burrito comes with avocado, a nice touch. Al pastor taco includes roasted pineapple, an initially unwelcome surprise that I'm glad I kept an open mind about. 4 tacos for under $10 is a great deal. Friendly efficient staff. Food is freshly made right in front of you. This is my current favorite taco place in Chicago."
"I live right around the corner, and I used to eat here all the time. Now it's too crowded every time I want to stop by, so it's been several months. Pretty hard to beat though, if you want to brave the crowd. Easily the best Taco joint in town. $6 burrito? Yes please. Has the best ingredients out of any Mexican place I have ever been to. Every order I've had has been perfect in every way. I don't care for their al pastor because it's cooked with so much fruit, but who am I to judge. Steak, lengua, chorizo, and tripe beat anyone else in town by a long shot."
Awesome! They use quality ingredients and they are reasonably priced. Ridiculously delicious burritos. Do it!
"Holy guacamole! They doubled in size today!! They expanded to the empty store front next door and have tables, a second bathroom, and a sink. Run, don't walk, and grab a tasty $2 taco, stat!"
"I was super excited to try the burritos, however I was not a fan of waiting over an hour to get mine.  The food was good, but I guess I had higher expectations from a ""Top 5 Burrito"" in the country.  I would recommend it again as long as you don't have to wait."
"This is a great little taco joint! Can't miss it- it's bright green and orange outside. It's tiny, but there are many counter seats. No tables. The tacos are cheap, at $2 each, except the fish taco, which costs a bit more. We ordered 6 tacos and a large horchata. The horchata was pretty good. No refills! My favorite of the tacos was the al pastor (marinated pork) one. We were pleasantly surprised that there were pineapples in there! It made it interesting and mixed well with the pork and onions. I would recommend that you eat this last though since it was the most flavorful. My next favorite was the fish taco. The fish tasted very fresh and was fried just right. The steak was decent but not as tender as I would have liked. The chicken was good but not really anything special. We were stuffed after sharing 6 and will probably just get 5 next time. The cashier was pretty nice. There was a steady influx of people even at 9:30 pm on a Wednesday! If you're in the area, check it out. Lots of street parking, but you have to pay until 10 pm."
"Dang, I almost don't want to write a review and keep this place a secret.  In a city with so many taco/burrito joints that are open late (til 4am on fri sat) that are average to below average, I am happy to declare that I believe there is L Patron at the top and no one else is close.   I have been here only a couple times but I have been to so many other taco/burrito places in Chicago throughout the years I can immediately recognize the disparity. Tonight I had the GringO (carne asada w/cheese in a quesadilla made with masa) and it came with rice and beans on the side.  Well seasoned steak in a masa ""tortilla"" that is thicker than a flour tortilla but so much more flavorful.  I love that the masa added flavor!  Tacos can be so one dimensional at times so it was a welcomed surprise. Almost everywhere I've eaten, beans and rice are just an afterthought and not given much attention.  Most places seem to plop goopy, pasty beans onto a plate without a second thought.  Not here!  There was a customer who told the staff that these were the best beans he's ever had.  I don't like saying something is ""the best ______ ever"" but I can't think of better pinto beans anywhere.  I also got a side of the Elote in a cup.  Nothing particularly mind blowing but straightforward and well prepared.  It's the obvious care they take in the little things that I am most impressed with.  It tells me they care from top to bottom.  If I lived closer, I would probably be coming here multiple times a week.  From the looks of it, there are already people who do. I did overhear the cashier mention they are cash only for now.  It sounds like they will accept credit cards soon but still unsure when that will be."
"Sometimes, one can go over six months without eating any taco.TRUE STORY.It doesn't really happen very often in the real world; only once in a while, some random woman (men are immune to the disease) realizes that tacos, albeit delicious, are insanely loaded with calories and that maybe, just maybe, she can live without them.Crazy talk, I know.Because guess what happens after six months?!? Harassed by her friends on the internet who keeps talking about these delicious creations of chewy masa and juicy meat, said woman cannot take it anymore and drives her callipygian self to L'Patron, ready to kill anyone brave enough to stand between her and her fix.(Stuck on ""callipygian""? Let's say that in the realm of buttocks, it's the opposite of flat or unshapely. In the realm of tacos, it's the opposite of a freaking TORTILLA.)Well, sometimes, it's worth depriving yourself to only get the best. L'Patron fed my body and my soul with some of the best tacos I had the chance to sink my teeth into. I ordered my favorite, al pastor, along with the fish taco (an elusive delicacy rarely well executed) and the rajas de poblano. And I was beside myself when, sitting at the counter, I saw the tortilla maker in the kitchen. Not many things make me happier than fresh tortillas.Well, juicy, slightly charred pieces of pork glistening with caramelized pineapple juice does the trick too. And the fried tilapia, gently cuddled by tart white cabbage, tomatoes, cilantro and spicy mayonnaise was at the top of its game, making me lick my fingers with gusto.The green salsa is delicious but totally superfluous.I left impressed, already dreaming of my next expedition to this definitely too small of a shack, holding the door for the flock of pilgrims coming to get their piece of folded perfection. 'Cause, my friends, you won't be alone. L'Patron is THE boss, and it is widely known."
We went there for dinner and found the tacos to be very good.  They serve the best fish tacos I've ever tasted here in Chicago.  Only downside is the long wait for the food.  Even if this is counter service be prepared for a wait.  It took more than half hour for us to get our food.  It seems there are just as many people who order carry-out as the dine-in folks.
"The only negative thing I could say about this place is that it's cash-only, but since there's a Walgreens with an ATM right around the corner, that's not too much of an issue.L'Patron has been such a wonderful addition to the Logan Square late-night food options. I've always had consistently delicious burritos and the few times that I've had the Al Pastor and Fish tacos, I was blown away by how much the flavors stood out. The ladies working the front of the house are always lovely and attentive, even when it's super busy (which is usually always). I once accidentally received the wrong order (I got a veggie burrito instead of my usual chicken), and when I called to let them know, I received a very nice apology and was able to get my correct order quickly. It's a good/bad thing that I only live 2 blocks away from this place -- I have delicious food available to me on the regular, but I'm spending all my cash on burritos!"
"As a Mexican who is very picky about where she eats MEXICAN FOOD at, L'Patron is the best! There carne asada is cooked way different than any other place but it is delicious!! I am a frequent vistor and highly recommend this place!"
"I don't particularly like Mexican food.  But my husband does.  So I went with him.  To my surprised, I fell in love with their tortilla.  They are warm and fluffy.  Anything would taste good with such welcoming tortilla.  Tried the steak, rib eye, and fish. Fish taco was so-so.  But it could be just me.  I never like my fish cooked."
The food is excellent ! however the place is  smoky and the music is too loud also they don't take credit cards
"Totally authentic flavor, great ingredients, and inexpensive price. The pork tacos are amazing. The pineapple they add gives a nice sweet balance to the great salsas they make. Everything I've had is great (which is a lot of their menu). It's a staple place for when I'm craving good Mexican cuisine."
Vegetarian taco of the day always rules! As does the fish taco - super solid. The chile relleno taco is a grease factory of epic proportions. Avoid it.
"Wow! The food is amazing! First of all, I ordered the fish taco, veggie taco, shrimp taco, Gringa and chips with guacamole. Everything was great except the shrimp taco. The fish taco was my favorite: fresh, juicy fish and crunchy cabbage! The Gringa was so good. The grilled pineapple was so succulent and sweet. I knew this place was good because I had to wait in a long line, but it went fast. This is going to be one of my regulars from now on. L' Patron is also down the street from Bang Bang Pie Shop. I would totally put the Al Pastor on a biscuit!"
These may be the best tacos I've ever had. Chorizo chorizo chorizo. Horchata and Mexican coke. That is all.
First tip: Always per-order your food. The place gets packed and it takes awhile to prepare everything fresh.Second tip: Bring cash they don't take credit cards. Walgreens has a ATM next door.Third tip: Always ask for the jalapeño paste which is this lime green concoction that is awesome on everything.I have had multiple things on the menu and everything is good. I will warn you that the pork tacos do have pineapple in them but I have been told that is how you are supposed to cook the pork. The steak tacos are very good and there are large chunks of steak throughout the taco. I will definitely be back but I will always pre order before I arrive.
"Being from Ohio, I never really cared for Mexican food.  Out there, all beans and Spanish rice come from a can.  Blech. L'Patron has opened new vistas to me.  Their tacos are always right on.  LOTS of different varieties.  All of the meats are heavenly and the vegetarian tacos are (usually) well thought out and delicious as well.  The guacamole always has pomegranate seeds or bits of mango making it insanely delicious and fresh tasting.  The fish tacos are some of the best I've had.  Also, this place is gleefully cheap.A note:  there's no way you're ever going to get to (or want to) eat inside; it's just too small.  So order to go and take it to one of the Boulevards to picnic!  Or do like we did and order 3 of every taco and have a ""taco party"" with your friends.  Mix 'em up before you unwrap them!  L'Patron is close to 5 stars for me, however, my last couple of experiences showed a dip in quality... the guac was made from avocados that were ""on the verge"" and the tacos were lacking their original luster.  Maybe those were just a couple of off nights, but guys--- stay committed to quality and you'll be a 5 Star taco joint in no time at all."
"It's hard for me to knock this place because the food is awesome but it is soooo SLOW.  I totally get that you can't rush quality food, but when you have five guys in a 10' X 10' kitchen and it's 2:00 on Thursday you can't tell me that you can't find a way to make six chicken tacos take less than 25 minutes to prepare, and still be awesome.  That's not stopping me from coming back.  The key is to call in and take things to go - that seems like what about 75% of the people were doing and only a handful of them had to wait only a  few minutes.  Plus the space is tiny, crowded, high traffic and not the ideal place for a ""eat-in."""
"Mexican food may be my favorite type of cuisine, so it's safe to say that I love the good stuff and hate the average stuff. L'Patron is one of the best Mexican restaurants that I have had the privilege of eating at. The fish tacos reminded me of the ones I consumed in Southern California, that is, they were awesome. The pork taco and the marinated chicken tortas were terrific as well. Big flavors, friendly staff, and low cost will make me a repeat customer."
"Overrated.Went here last night with my girlfriend. Ordered a horchata, pollo taco, al pastor taco, gringo, and gringa to split. Waited about 15 minutes to order and then 40 minutes for our food. People that ordered after us were getting their food before us so we asked what was going on. The cashier said it was due to the gringo and gringa. Horchata was decent, a bit sweet but wasn't too bad. The food I have most definitely experienced better. The pollo taco had good flavor but was dry. The al pastor had a good char but the marinade was medicore at best. All in all they were okay, but I've had better. Both the gringo and gringa were not what I was expecting. Extremely greasy, lacked any sort of texture, and gave me a horrible stomach ache immediately after eating.Was not worth the wait and hype."
"Small but awesome taco joint. Great tacos at most affordable prices. A must try in this place are almost everything..Lol.Great carne asada, fish tacos un matchable, even the veggie taco is amazing.Fresh Gringos with melted chihuahua was fantastic."
We ordered one of everything. It was really wonderful. The rice and beans were mediocre but everything else was amazing. And when I called to place the order for pick up she told me she was going to have to call me back to make sure the number was real. It made no sense to me.
"Everything here is very reasonably priced. Its pretty good too. A little too greasy for my taste, but its good. Tacos are very small, but also very cheap. The seem to have a good price to quantity ratio that encourages you to order a lot extra because the servings are small and because the price is low enough that, why not, and before you know it you've ordered more food than you ever wanted and spent more than you would have at a costlier establishment.Only complaint I have (and I suppose it speaks well of them) is the crowd that comes in for lunch, I've pulled over to grab lunch here more than once and had a nice long wait each time. Now, If I'm headed down the highway and having a L'Patron craving, if its between 11:30 and 1:00, I just keep driving, because I know it'll be 20-30 minutes before I'll get to eat any way. They've told me to order ahead when I've complained, and I always remember that suggestion when its too late.As annoying as that is, it just goes to show that the place is popular, and they should be. They have great food, especially fro the price"
"Update: MELON WATER!!!Was in the neighborhood last week, so I called my order in and picked it up 10 minutes later.Tacos al pastor and de carne asada. Perfect as usual. My lunch date was also thoroughly impressed, which meant a lot as he spends all of his spare time traveling the world to eat the best food. This is my new trick...I convince people with cars that I have found the best tacos in Chicago and if they drive me over there, I will buy them some. It's a good thing I am right.Anyway, while I was waiting for them to bag up my order, the counter guy gave me a free sample of their melon water to try. It was exquisite! Seriously, the most perfectly sweet but not too sweet summer drink. BYO vodka to mix with it and you will be in heaven...or at least my idea of heaven."
"Mmmm. Their veggie tacos are freaking delicious. I crave these. Most other places would have lame ass renditions of just beans and cheese and some lettuce and tomatoes. *snore* I've gone consecutive days before and almost, ALMOST every time it's a different mix of veggies but it's still sooo good. Grilled corn, sauteed spinach, zuchinni, sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions, a little smear of refried beans, tomatoes, grilled peppers, grilled green onions!, etc.. All with a dash of lettuce. Smother that shit with their green sauce and you're golden. Those grilled green onions are so good in their tacos or burritos. I kinda like these a little better than their meat tacos but then again I may be partial because I'm relatively new to being meat free and I do really love my vegetables. I've had their al pastor before though and it really is as good as everybody says. Another good one I like is their poblano rajas- roasted peppers, caramelized onions, roasted tomato sauce, hold the cheese- that's a personal preference. Sometimes it's only 99 cents!I wasn't impressed with their shrimp tacos, the shrimp are teeny tiny and overall I was just underwhelmed by the shrimp tacos. Their fish tacos are noteworthy. The elotes weren't all that. They offer it on the cob or cut up in a cup. Don't do it in the cup!! It's really watery and the cheese swimming in that mess...unappealing; reminded me why I usually hate cheese in the first place. Lesson learned. Other than that, I only come here weekdays where there's always rock star parking and not that much of a wait especially when I call in my order most of the time. My favorite taco spot in Chicago. It's so good."
"I had relatively high expectations as reviews were really high.  I was a little bit disappointed.  The chicken taco was bland and it was supposed to be ""pollo adobado"".  The al pastor taco was tasty but little a little bit overcooked.  The vegetarian taco was good though.  Also, the fish taco and the asada taco were good.Overall, I wouldn't give this place 4 stars but 3 or 2 given the experience I had.  Also, I wouldn't drive out my way to go this place.  I'd try it if I'm on the vicinity."
"I don't know what all the hype is about. Very bland steak, yuck! We are true Mexicans, and this place definitely caters to the ""gringos"". For their steak tacos they don't use arrachera, they use some other meat and it just doesn't taste the way it should. Definitely better options for tacos in Chicago, Las Asadas for instance. If only their cashier wasn't a complete baboon..."
This place is amazing. Hands down best tacos in the area. The house specialty is the gringa or the gringo and it's made with home made tortillas. When you go there it's usually packed and it's a good thing they just expanded for more seating. The guac is great too. I've yet to try everything on the menu but I don't think they can go wrong. Cash only is the only complaint I can think of. Don't pass this place up
"Best tacos in Logan Square. Don't go here is you're in a hurry, everything is made fresh and takes a little time which makes for a great meal. Staff are polite and on the ball. Prices are cheap, amazing value. Shhh... you can order shrimp tacos but it's not on the menu."
"I have never found a fish taco this good in the city of Chicago!  Thanks for bringing that California fish taco to Chicago!!!BF loved the carne asada burritos and tacos!  Big chunks of meat! The Al Pastor was OK, but the flavor didn't stick out to me. The chicken taco was amazing!  Who makes a dumb chicken taco amazing?? These guys!!!Prices are what they should be - not extremely overpriced Chicago prices!Staff was friendly and horchata was straight!Muchos Gracias!"
I tried their Pork Taco and it was excellent. The Carne Asada was great too! The fish taco was very good but it had cabbage on it which I am not crazy about. I will be back. Thanx Yelp for cluing me into this place!
"The tilapia taco was amazing, the gringa was not exactly my usual thing but the homemade tortillas and unexpected sides were all great."
Came in to grab a quick lunch. Had one lomo encebollado taco and one taco al pastor. Super good real deal mexican!!  Authentic topping of cilantro and onions and none of those american taco toppings of cheese and lettuce and tomatoes. Would like to try other stuf next time I go to Chicago.
"The food is good. The portions for the sides are small. Yes, they are sides but compared to other establishments' that are big enough to share, these are petite. This place is most suited for To Go orders. They have limited seating and counter space. And often times patrons don't sit with courtesy in mind. Like taking up a whole side with only two people (friends) instead of next to each other. If you decide to dine in during the colder months, I'd recommend leaving your jacket on. It can get really chilly with the draft."
"If i could give them more stars i would!!! place was fantastic !! the steak meat, al pastor was omg !! made from the heavens !!! then the orchata was super fire!!! best mexican place I ever been to!!!"
Carne asada taco is as good as you'll get in the states outside of Texas. Chicken was a little dry but very flavorful. I'll be back very soon!
"Mother of god; those fish tacos.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this place, but when I strolled in only to find a pretty substantial lineup on a Wednesday at 4pm, I know I had stumbled upon a gem.  I went all out and tried one of each of their tacos and all were excellent.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced as well.  My favorite were the fish tacos with the Al Pastor being a close second.  I cannot wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.Downsides: cash only (but is that really even a problem?) and it gets really smokey in there.  Don't come here expecting to go out later, since you're going to smell like tacos.  Although, I guess if you did go out, you could just try to seek out a mate who is into taco smell.  Actually, that's probably a good thing, so yeah, do come here before going out.  It'll weed out all of the potential mates who are taco haters, therefore saving you time and money."
I'm not sure why this place has such rave reviews. I've eaten here several times and I can tell you that there are at least 4 Taco within a mile places that are better.
Best steak taco I've had in Chicago. I was very surprised with the quality and freshness of the ingredients. My wife ordered the Al pastor taco and steak burrito. Impressed with both. Definitely coming back.
"I was really excited to try L'Patron after seeing it on a TV special. La Gringa definitely lived up to its name, juicy and flavorful. Everything else was great (guacamole and carne asada) too. As for the cons, the salsas were subpar, one spicy and the other smokey with no other flavor. I was also given the wrong order and had to go back after already getting home. Despite my frustration I was grateful that the food ended up being great!"
"We visited L' Patron on 4/15/13 and were disappointed not so much by the food but the service, although the experience was bad enough to mess with my taste buds, the food was alright a little too salty (more than usual). We ordered 2 burritos and it took us 33 minutes to get our food while several people who order after us got their food before us. The tortilla on the burrito was burned and the meat was undercooked and salty. It'll a while until I visit this place again, there's plenty of other places where I can get cheap and good mexican food. Food= 1.5Service= -5"
"This place should be called L' Terrible. So, went to this hyped up taco joint yesterday. We were starving, so we were pretty pumped up. When we got there the place was packed as expected.  We ordered 2 'Al Pastor' burritos and an 'Al Pastor' gringa. Now, we've had both in the best state for Al Pastor in the world, Michoacan, Mexico. We got our food. Bear in mind, during our order, I specifically asked what is in the burrito and gringa.  The cashier said lettuce, tomato, sour cream, beans and avocado. I said, no lettuce, no tomato and no sour cream.  I also asked them to add cilantro. Here is where it got bad. Again, we are both starving, so I start digging in and right away I bite into pineapple. I immediately cringed as I hate pineapple on Al Pastor, let alone on any food. Who the hell puts pineapple on Al Pastor tacos, burritos or whatever without asking? Cashier never mentioned that it included pineapple. This was literally a pineapple and onion burrito. Disgusting!! So much onion. I opened the burrito and there were about 6 pieces of meat in the entire burrito. I pulled out what seemed to be half a pineapple in total. My wife's was the same. I opened the gringa and same deal. 3 pieces of on the entire damn gringa with a ton of pineapple. On top of that, they added lettuce and tomato when I had said no lettuce and tomato. Then there were no beans or avocado.My wife was pissed so I talked to one of the workers and she went to get her manager. The guy seemed nice but a very bad decision maker as he did nothing for us. The guy said if we hadn't eaten our food he would have helped us out. Eaten our food? I dismantled the burrito and  I had a plate full of pineapple and onion. I showed him the gringa that had 1 piece of meat on 1 half. He refused to do anything and started explaining that the way they make their Al Pastor with pineapple is traditional? Where???? Pineapple is laid on top of the meat on a spit traditionally and you request pineapple if you want any. Then he spilled the beans saying that's how they can keep the prices low by adding so much pineapple. I just about fell off my chair. What a crock!!! He said ""next time you come in ask for me"". Next time??? What a joke!  Never again!!! We walked out furious....to add insult to injury, the manager said he was the one that made our burritos...so he screwed up the order. How do you not take care of a customer and risk a real bad review.  Guy needs some management skills.  No idea how ratings are so high for this place. Didn't have the carne asada, but the Al Pastor experience was the worst ever. Never again! If I could give zero stars I would."
Great steak and chicken tacos. The meat is very tender and fresh. You can tell they do a great job of selecting their ingredients and take their time cooking the meat. Service is very friendly and fast too.
"Ate there just 12 hours ago or so & had to jump on & write a review right away.  Yes, it is busy & crowded, but isn't that a sign that they are doing something really well?  And that something is serving fresh, quality food.  I don't think $2 is too much for one taco when I know that tortilla was practically made FOR me (you can see them coming off of the press in the kitchen), & the lettuce is crisp & bright & you can see boxes of whole produce in the back.  I will probably be back this weekend to try different tacos (I enjoyed their shrimp taco - fried but not greasy & with a great spicy cabbage topping - & their veggie special last night, plus street corn & great chips & guac)."
"The best tacos out of my boyfriends moms kitchen.We're both from Texas and he's Mexican and he really really really liked this place.Between us we shared the al pastor, carne Asada, beef tongue, and the gringa.All the meat was on point. Our favorites would have to be the gringa which had steak and cheese on a homemade tortilla which was so good. For my cheese lovers this is the way to go. The beans were good, not as good as his moms, but pretty damn close. Their rice was also on point.The steak taco was definitely the best, with the beef tongue in a close second and then the al pastor. Their salsa was amazingly tasty and spicy! Which my boyfriend of course thoroughly enjoyed. They also had some pickled veggies that's boyfriend also really liked. Before we left he ordered a horchata (rice drink) and OMG it was sooo gooood. I've had horchata back home in Houston and didnt like it so I thought I wouldn't like horchata period, but theirs was perfectly sweet with an equal amount of cinnamon. Tasted like Christmas! It's a tiny little place which is cozy and the cashier was super sweet and clean! I saw her wash her hands after just about every task she did. Great place I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Chicago!"
"Maybe it's the pregnancy cravings talking, but I am not a huge fan of Mexican - and this is one place that I am dying to come back to.  I had the al pastor burrito, which was so different than any al pastor/burrito I've ever had.First of all, as the other reviews state, the al pastor is BOMB.  They cook it with healthy chunks of pineapple that gives the meat an amazing juiciness and flavor.  The burrito is literally just meat and romaine lettuce w/ slices of avocado.  When I've had burritos in the past, they're typically filled with mexican rice, beans, and some kind of salsa.  Not here - I guess they want to make sure that the meat shines through.My husband also got the elote.  Unfortunately, though, we got our order to go and didn't eat it right away so the cheesy goodness sorta congealed.  But the flavor was still divine.Next time I need to try The Gringa... al pastor + carne asada?  Yes, please!We will take the advice of the regulars and phone our order in.  Totally worth the drive from Andersonville."
"Well deserving of this 5 star review unlike other establishments. Food, service, and value are all part of this triple threat of a restaurant. For my first visit I had the steak, pastor, and pescado (fish) tacos. All three had lots of flavor, but the pastor is my favorite. It reminds me of big star with bigger meat pieces and of course the pineapple inside is blissful. For sides I had the chips and guac & some elotes in a cup. The guac was very fresh and had a spicy kick which was awesome. The owner was kind and comped a free side for me since I was a first timer. I'm recommending this restaurant to anyone who has a mouth and will definitely be returning soon! Nexttime I'm going to try the gringa! Olé!!!"
"Finally found a good taco joint on the north side! Woo hoo! I love their fish taco, not the best I've ever had, but it's hard to find good fish tacos in Chicago and for that reason I'll give it a 9 out of 10. The carne asada is excellent too. My husband loves their al pastor, but it's a bit too sweet for me. The veggie taco is pretty good too. Service is always friendly! Great for a late night bite when you can find parking. I tried to go at lunch time once, but the line was so long, & was afraid I'd get towed/ticketed from the 2 cops in line in front of me.Most of all the price is right! Wish we lived a bit closer by, but it's right off the highway!"
"If you're not eating here, you're dumb.  The best, freshest tacos and tortas around!  I'm not sure how they marinade their carne asada, but it's to die for.  The al pastor is sweet and spicy, my favorite combo!  The vinegary slaw that tops the big shrimp and chunks of fish make for amazing tacos, too!  Homemade tortillas, freshly fried chips, spicy pickled vegis.  All this goodness for cheap!  Only tip is that you should check your order after you receive it - ours has come home a bit wrong a couple of times.  Otherwise, ENJOY this neighborhood gem!!"
"Very, very, very disappointed... I am Mexican and I'm a BIG fan of tacos al pastor, these tacos are NOT tacos al pastor. They are pork tacos with a BBQ sauce with some chillies in it, and seriously... Lettuce???? When in the world do tacos al pastor have lettuce???The tortillas of the ""gringa"" or ""gringo"" are good, but everything else is subpar to say the least. It is clear that people going there have never had a real taco al pastor... I'll keep looking for some real ones in Chicago..."
"Best taco place in the area!!! Right off the highway and is bright green so its hard to miss.So many good things to say about this place.  The Quality of all the meats are amazing.  Steak, al pastor, fish, ribeye you gotta get them all.  This place is open late night on the weekends -  huge bonus! Also if you are there during the late hours, order the spaghetti tacos or the cucumber/watermelon mixed with horchata!"
"Family and I just finished eating..tilapia, shrimp, al pastor and steak tacos. We also tried steak burrito and al pastor torta. I wasn't satisfied with the portions at all. It was a little substance of meat and seafood. Customer service was nice. For the price I still felt shortened. Have to mention all my food wasn't in the bag, after they confirm it :("
"I want to like this place, I really do. I've had the food around 4 times already and every time I am let own. The meat is always fatty and flavorless. I thought at first, maybe I'm just going on bad days? But 4 times of let downs can't be a coincidence. Ordered an horchata the other day, and it tasted like onion! I don't know if I'm at the same place as all the other people who have given the restaurant 4-5 stars. I even saw this on Chicago's Best and am mind-boggled. Anyway, that's my experience - they must not like me there. :P"
"Wow! Found this for lunch and it is amazing . If you are in town and want a great fish taco, this is the place"
"Got the chorizo burrito with rice and beans. I got there at an off hour (3pm) on a Saturday and I didn't have to wait in a huge line. For something so cheap, it not only rivals but surpasses most Mexican restaurants in Logan Square. I highly recommend!"
"Just checked out this place this weekend and I enjoyed myself very much. I got a fish taco and the ""Gringo"". The fish was a bit heavily battered IMO, but it was cooked to perfection and the spicy slaw they serve on the taco really pulls the whole thing together. The carne asada on the Gringo was perfection and the homemade tortillas were absolutely delicious. Also, whatever cheese is on the Gringo is amazing - I want to be friends with that cheese. The place is small so I wouldn't show up expecting to sit down at table. The staff working the counter are friendly and efficient. If you want to have a nice weekend taco lunch, this is the place. My only complaint that I would have is their salsa verde wasn't great. Both salsas were a little lack luster. The good news is that you don't really want to drown the tacos in salsa, so it all works out great. And one last thing - this is cash only so be sure to stop by the bank before you go."
"Aye Dios Mio! This place is fantastic. FOOD IS GREAT! ORDER THE GRINGA!I have yet to read a bad review of this place that actually critiqued the actual food.There's at least 6 losers like, ""I didnt like the color of the building"" or ""it's small"". One extremely losery loser actually said, 'My baby stroller didn't fit inside'. Did you eat the food, Sir?! The quality of the food is incredible, you will not find a place in Chicago with better cuts of meat!"
"I come here for lunch sometimes 3 times a week...it's been this way since they first opened back in december. 10% of my paycheck goes to this place. The chef behind it all is a really nice and friendly guy, and he genuinely cares about his food.Everything is good here, though they take quite a while to cook the food (only gripe). I love the poblano rajas, al pastor, and carne asada. The pescado rounds out the top four for me. When they get slammed the quality can be unreliable sometimes, but I still love them."
"It's funny how people had review this place so high, after hearing so much about their tacos we decided to give it a shot. First of all the tacos are really small and for their prices and let's not talk about the wait, if I'm going to wait that long and pay that much for a taco at least I expected a normal size taco, but again it' funny how people rank them high. I really wanted this place to be my new taqueria especially when they are really close by me.Las Asadas have better, bigger and cheaper tacos and I'll stay with them until I find the good Taqueria close by me."
"We were in and out for a quick lunch a 1/4 mile away from work, and boy are we late to this party.  I have been passing this place thinking it was yet another taco joint when in fact it's a mix between street food and foodie expectations. For $2!  Right on."
"The best Mexican food I've had in Chicago, made with very fresh ingredients.  I think there was even pomegranate seeds in the guac, so baller."
This gem of a spot is tiny but oh so good! They have THE best pork tacos in the city so do your self a favor and hit up this spot for a great lunch or a late night bite. It can get a little crowded at times to sit and dine so thankfully I am just a few blocks away and can order take out.
"Finally got chance to eat here. Very authentic tasting tacos, although the they provided were just ok. I tried the al pastor tacos and the lengua( tongue) tacos, staples at taquerias in Mexico. Both were extremely delicious, good sized and not buried with  lettuce like I've seen some Mexican taquerias use to reduce the meat portions. I particularly loved the tongue tacos which were tender but not rubbery. I believe that if I took my Mexican cousins, who have taken me to several taquerias in Mexico were with me they would have enjoyed them also.   The only minor flaw I could mention was a potential bottleneck when it gets very busy. I went here at the beginning of the post work dinner on Monday and it was just starting to get busy. They had just one order taker who also seemed to take phone orders. I did not have to wait long but could see a little crowd start to form while I was eating. With just one order taker I could see bottlenecks forming if either a phone order or in person customer delayed the order taker with questions or indecisiveness. I have no idea if they add order takers at busier times like a Friday or Saturday but there didn't seem to be room for more than one additional order  taker since they only had one register.  I didn't ask but I wish they had limes to use on the tacos like many Mexican taquerias provide. Overall the most important item, the tacos themselves were delicious."
"Not gonna lie, I was initially attracted to this place simply due to it's lime green exterior but much to my surprise this isn't your average run of the mill taco joint. L'Patron knows what they're doing and they do it best and for relatively cheap too.As far as atmosphere, there isn't much more to the place then the kitchen. There is a cramped seating area with a counter lining the wall with maybe ten barstools so I prefer calling in for take out. Be sure to ask for a to-go cup of the complimentary hot pickled veggies, so good!Heads up, cash only"
"Best tacos in the city, hands down.  A friend from LA said that the tacos at L'Patron were the closest thing to ""authentic"" tacos that he has ever had outside of CA.  I recommend sticking with the tacos, especially the lengua, al pastor, and the lomo.  And the fish.  Ask for pickled veggies too."
"One of the culinary treats I crave during my annual trip to the west coast is baja-style fried tilapia tacos.  You can't get 'em here--or couldn't, until L'Patron moved in.   Their fish taco is filled with morsels of hot, crispy fish, lightly pickled cabbage and a not-too-strong (wasabi?) mayonnaise.  Also amazing: the el pastor, the pork flavored with bits of pineapple.  I'm sure the other tacos are great, but I haven't been able to advance past this heavenly fish/pig combo.  On good nights, when they aren't overwhelmed (see below), the guacamole comes specked with little slices of strawberry and finely shredded cilantro.  The chips are fresh and salted just right.  Be aware that they are slammed nearly all the time, and it gets crowded and messy.  I honestly don't know what the staff could do better.  However, maybe you entitled foodie gits could bus your own counter space--that would help.  There's a giant garbage can right as you come into the door.  Thanks."
The corn side dish is to die for! Reliably good take out... The dine in option is a bit cramped.
"Finally a place north of Pilsen with a taco I am proud to cram into my jaw.There are many claiming this is the best in Chicago, but of course they don't drive and have never been to the South side.  I am sure if I wrote a 4 start review for a dump like Passadita I would see the err of my ways and repent.They are great by the way, if they bumped their effort up to include hand made tortillas then I would include them in the elite class.The steak is excellent,, crisp on the edges and very tender,, nothing like any other North or West side Taqueria.  The Pastor is excellent as well, loaded with charred onions and some pineapple.  I didn't see a spit, but I am not hung up on that much authenticity.The chicken tacos (normally a quite inferior option at a taqueria) were really good as well, moist and flavorful.The horchata was below average, to sweet and lacking the canela flavor I have come to appreciate from the finer places.  I am looking forward to trying other options on the menu as well as being recognize as a regular.  Keep up the good work compadre's!Chips and salsa is an extra charge as it should be.  The salsa's and vegetable escabeche is gratis and deliscioso."
The only place better is Mexico.  While I'm stuck in Chicago This place is as good as it gets.  When we arrived there was a 5-10 min wait.  I'm glad we waited.  I ordered the carne asada tacos were great.  The Wife had Al pastor.  My Duaghter had Chicken.  All were perfect.  It's really small.  So there will always be a wait. deal with it!  It's worth the wait.BYOB is a good sign.   I will be going back. this time I might try the tongue tacos. Just 1.
Very unprofessional person answering the phone Sunday after noon. If the rest of the staff is as ridiculous as the girl answering the phone i do not ever plan to order or eat from here. First time calling and I don't even get a hello only what sounded like a drunk girl making ghost noises then laughing trying to answer me when I asked if this was l'patron. It was but I wasn't going to waste my time waiting for her to stop laughing.
"This was outstanding! Did I ever expect to walk into a small taco joint and get gourmet salsa with fresh pomegranate in it? No. Never before walking into L'Patron, that is. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! This is not your average taco joint and VERY worth the trip!"
"People always ask me where I go to eat Mexican food, and I'm always hesitant to give them a recommendation...because I really don't go out for Mexican food much.  Why?...because most places are mediocre at best when it comes to quality Mexican cuisine.  My fiance told me she saw some great Yelp reviews for L' Patron, and since it was just down the street from us...we decided to go for a late lunch.  I have to say I went a little crazy with the ordering.  I ordered La Gringa, and then a chicken and steak taco.  La Gringa, is similar to an al pastor quesadilla.  It was sooooo damn good!  Mi estomago dice DELICIOUS!  Yes, my stomach speaks English.  My fiance took a bite, and I cringed thinking that it might become a big bite.  She was moaning eating her veggie taco and fish taco, so she didn't have much time for my Gringa.  -insert joke-  The beans and rice sides had Mexican cheese and corn sprinkled on top.  Something my mom would do. My two tacos were very good....but they were out shined by La Gringa that I tasted.  I'm a sucker for white girls, I guess.  Anyhoo....the place is small, staff is super friendly, and they have pickled veggies and salsa on the table tops.  L' Patron is a great addition to Logan Square, and will sure to be very successful if they keep up what they are doing."
"I'm so happy my friend told me about this spot.  Great prices, super friendly staff, and best tacos I've had next to Big Star.  I had the plobalano rajas and the veggie taco.  I'm not a vegetarian and I loved both.  I also tried the Elotes.  Excellent!  Can't wait to go back which I'm sure will be sometime in the same week."
"Okay, so I went back for lunch today.  Last week I had the steak burrito and it was okay.  Today I went with a trio of tacos (al pastor, ribeye and onion, and poblano and cheese).  HOLY MOLY!  Talk about a different experience.  These tacos were so full of flavor.  The al pastor might have been the best I've had.With all this being said, I'm revising my review from 3 stars to 4.  I'm sorry I doubted you."
Nothing better...best tacos in Chicago...make sure to ask for homemade tortillas when ordering. The steak and chicken are phenomenal. Can't go wrong with gringo or burrito either. Add the poblano rajas in the burrito for an explosion of flavor.
"Nice friendly service, but after seeing them on Chicago's Best Sandwiches show, I was disappointed. I had the steak Torta & it was dry & my roll was burnt. My car smelled like burnt toast the whole way home. Should have tried the Gringa, that was the other one they made on the show. Not in my neighborhood so probably won't go back."
I love this place so very much. Everything is good. Everything is cheap. It's open late. IT'S GREAT. What more is there to say?
"This place is the definition of overrated. I don't understand the hype. The horchata is decent. The steak tacos were flavorless and the meat was cold and chewy. There's nowhere to sit, but that's not that unusual for taquerias. I'd say there's at least 5 places with better tacos in a 6 block radius of this place. Maybe I need to try the burrito. The tacos aren't where it's at."
"I came back. For more. And I'll continue this for as long as I live.....in Chicago.The wait this time was a little bit longer because they were super backed up with carry-out orders, but the girl working the counter was delightful and chatted with us and our mere 7 minute wait flew by. The veggie burrito was out-of-this-world, per usual. My dad said he's dying to try the pepper burrito next time. There's going to be a next time?!? Yes. Please.Give this one more than a shot. Don't overlook some of the highest quality Mexican food I can find. (And I'm a Mexican food snob. To the extreme.)"
"Small unsuspecting shop, the Gringa and beans were my favorite menu items. The steak tacos are also delicious- must try!"
"Aaaaa! The taco landscape of Logan Square/Avondale is changing so fast that I almost fell down from dizziness, just thinking about it.1) Dos Sabores is under new management as Sarita's, and their too-good-to-be-true menu has downsized and changed for the worse2) La Reyna Del Palenque opened on Belmont a few months ago, and brings the Pasadita family to the area3) San Luis, which I have visited about twice per week for almost a half decade, has disconnected their phone and is open only sporadically.Just a block east of the fading San Luis, L'Patron has opened with a bang, and it seems they're picking up some good business right out of the starting gate.On my first visit, I picked up three tacos. The marinated chicken (which tastes more like fajita chicken) and the breaded tilapia tacos both put more typical fare to shame, and are amongst my favorites of their kind in this entire taco-filled city. The steak was good though not as flavorful as that offered by La Zacatecana just a couple blocks north.On subsequent visits, I tried some of their more unique offerings, and it's now clear that their willingness to invent and experiment makes them absolutely one of the best taquerias anywhere. The vegetarian option changes daily, and it was just my luck to taste their roasted beet taco. The chef also invented a cool cucumber-based drink, which was good but like most Mexican drinks way too sweet. There's more I've yet to try, including the hipster-oriented ""Gringo""- carne asada plus Chihuahua cheese in a tortilla.Five stars, and I'm not even rounding up. This is the kind of spot I could visit weekly and never outgrow."
"The fish tacos are different from many other places, but that's good. Wasn't blown away by the food, but it was nice to order, sit down, and have them call me when the order was ready. It's a bit out of the way from everything, but it's some good food."
"ohh yeah, I'm still drooling over L'Patron Tacos!  Went there for late night on Saturday night and it was the highlight of my evening (sorry L'Douche Bags of the Saturday night bar scene).  The Chicago Po Po were there snacking it up too, so you knew it had to be delicious.  I tried the following tacos, and they ranked in order of deliciousness:1. pork taco - with charred chunks of pineapple2. poblano taco - carmelized onions 3. chorizo taco4. steak tacoAll of the tacos were delicious.  I will make it a point to try the fish tacos next time, and the cucumber water. Open til 4am, can't beat it."
Best tacos in the city. Love this place! You will never want tacos from any other place.
"Best tacos in Chi Town, by far."
"CASH ONLY. Dive Mexican. Would almost give only 4 stars, but the tongue tacos and pico de gallo are sooooooo good! Limeade an interesting option but they also have horchata to round out your meal. Keep meaning to try a Grigo or Gringa but :P They just expanded to have more seating!"
"First, this place takes cash only. I ordered my food and a cucumber drink, but realized I didn't have enough for the drink, so had them take it off the order. They gave me the cucumber juice anyway, with a smile. I was grateful. It was also very tasty juice! I also want to point out how clean the place is. I dirty joint isn't that scary to me, but they keep that place clean and I think that speaks volumes in a tiny fast-food place. The seating is limited and the kitchen is twice as big as the seating area. This location was empty for a long time and for a very short stint it was a run-of-the-mill fast-food place that wasn't worth anyone's time. It's great to see something new come literally down the street from my door that isn't fancy, but has a lot of passion. I just finished my three tacos: veggie, pollo and al pastor.The veggie was probably the best veggie taco I've ever eaten. I usually avoid them because veggie usually means beans and cheese with lettuce and tomatoes. I was intrigued by the fact that the menu on the wall said ""please ask for todays veggie offerings."" Todays veggies were zucchini squash and corn. Not a big fan of corn in general, but the zucchini was grilled perfectly and I could taste the wonderful, smokey grill. There was also sour cream, avocado and cheese in the mix (and not a pile of cheese, which I think is great). The chicken kinda blew me away. The meat was very tender and juicy in a tasty marinade. Actual strips of white and dark meat chicken. Not just dried up shredded ""stuff"" or cubed overcooked meatwads. My favorite chicken taco is at Moran's. They stew the meat, so it's really juicy and flavorful. This one was completely different, again the taste of the grill was nice and smokey and the meat was just perfectly cooked.The al pastor was excellent. Better than Moran's, which I do love. First time I've had al pastor with pineapple, where the pineapple is still juicy. The marinade was perfect. What else can I say about it? It's pork done perfectly in context.I also ordered chips and salsa. They don't give them away like most Mexican joints in Chicago. The chips came to me piping hot. The salsas were fair, but not spoilers. The pico de gallo wasn't bad, not the best, but it had a really nice lime flavor underneath everything. The chips themselves were really good, though and not greasy at all.The place is a little pricey compared to Moran's (which is about average). Tacos are $2/ea and it's $4.49 for chips and salsa. However, I can get on board with a $2 taco made this well. Most people love Big Star, but I think -- while the food isn't bad -- it's overpriced for what you're getting and you can go down the street and get something just as good or better. (The best part of Big Star is the booze and the patio, not the food, anyway.)Overall, I'd say I found my new favorite place to fill my taco fix. There's more stuffings to try to: steak, fish, pablano (and another I totally missed). On the grill in the back, I saw about 2 dozen fresh pablanos roasting. The smell just started to creep in the kitchen. They also have tortas and burritos and two house specialty sandwiches (the Gringa and Gringo), made with their own homemade tortillas. I forgot to ask about the tortillas they used with the tacos, if they were handmade or not. They seemed extra-ordinary, so I'm guessing that they do or they just know where to get killer tortillas. As I left, the guy cooking in the back (perhaps the owner) asked how the tacos were. I said, ""excellent"" with a big smile. He was very proud. It didn't surprise me, here's this new taco place in the middle of a sea of hole-in-the-wall taco joints. This guy is cooking with his heart and making friends with his food. I'm definitely going back. Too bad I already have dinner plans!"
"We had heard great things about this place, so we decided to check it out on our way out of the city. It's right by the highway so that was convenient.I got steak tacos, some beans for the kid and my husband got fish, pastor and veggie. We both loved our tacos. My only complaint would be that although you can eat there, you cannot eat there comfortable with a toddler as they have no high chairs. The taco places we frequent have high chairs and tables. Next time we'll get it to go :)"
"Juicy, medium rare steak in a perfectly large burrito for just over $5. This is the burrito I've been searching the city for and now that I've found it I won't be going anywhere else! I can't wait to eat there again and to take everyone I know there so I have more reasons to go back. I also got an al pastor taco which was also on point, priced right and worth going back for. Give this place all your taco money, you won't be disappointed.\"
Tacos are GOOD! They usually have a variety if fruit or vegetable flavored beverages and this are really tasty. Al pastor is great and the steak is always a favorite!
"I came to L'Patron with high expectations, and left very disappointed. I had their al pastor tacos, and let me say, I can name 5 taquerias off the top of my head on the North Side alone that surpass L'Patron. The meat was average, as was the tortilla, but the red salsa was horrible. It was too mushy for my liking and not spicy at all. Any taco aficionado will tell you the salsa can make or break a taco. Salsa is supposed to be watery or able to squeeze out of a bottle, theirs was more of a pico de gallo. I give it 3 stars because the food was average, nothing special, and the workers were friendly and courteous."
"good food good price, cant sit. better to grab and go!customer service (the cashier girl) was friendly too."
Best tacos I have had in my life
"This is probably the kind of place  to go for late night food. I went at 7pm; The first thing I noticed is that the floor and bartops were dirty. Ordered a steak torta, fish taco, poblano taco, al Pastor taco, beans & rice. The flavors in the fish taco are good but it was just a teeny little piece of fish and got lost in all the cabbage and sauce they stuffed it with. The other tacos were decent, nothing mindblowing. Torta was underwhelming but if you are going for portions you get a really big sandwich for $5. Beans and rice were ok. I feel like it was super heavy, like I said fine for late night or something but I probably won't be back."
"Wow.They could charge a dollar or two more for every menu item, and I would still come back for more! (But please don't, I'd rather tip you.) This kitchen is open, so you can communicate directly with the chefs. I didn't ask, but it looks like the staff is related, so I think this is a family joint. In any case, there is ALWAYS a line here, that's how good their tacos and burritos are. The horchata is simply amazing. If you have ever gone to Arturo's or Lazo's, skip those bland meals and hop over to L'Patron. You won't regret it. Clean interior means you can sit down at the counter to eat, or get yours to-go."
I did go have lunch on their opening day and all I gotta say is...Delicious!! I highly recommend the Fish Tacos!! But the steak tacos here are AMAZINGLY good.. They also provide side orders like pico de gallo & guacamole with chips.. Also very GOOD!!
"On my 2nd trip back I went for a vegetarian burrito and a poblano rajas taco. Both were delicious! The daily vegetable for the day was grilled zucchini and eggplant. This time around I asked if they could add some rice and that helped with the composition of the burrito I felt. It was less watery and didn't fall apart like last time.The flavors of the grilled vegetables in the burrito were amazing. And they got the seasonings just right. Not too salty and not too bland. Often times vegetarian Mexican can either be super bland or loaded with fat and salt to introduce flavor. Since they cook everything to order it tasted like""sit down"" nice Mexican food at half the price. Very high quality flavors. I think I've found my new Mexican stand by!"
"L'Patron just catered our wedding and NO ONE will forget the food. Hiring Ernesto to do this job was the best decision we made throughout the whole godforsaken wedding planning process. He gave us a great deal for amazing, fresh, hot food - and delivered it personally, going the extra mile (literally, he forgot the cilantro & onions and went all the way back to get it) making sure everything was perfect - and it was. L'Patron is delicious, fresh, inexpensive and God knows I love supporting small business. When we were setting up our order, Ernesto talked a lot about how/where he gets his ingredients and he takes PRIDE in what he does. L'Patron is no B.S. I really like walking into a place and feeling at home - it's a hole in the wallish kind of place and all the people behind the counter get. it. done. with a smile. I can't remember any other al pastor being that good. Their guac is the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and order two. Thanks."
Long time to wait for food but it was really good.  I would recommend ordering ahead and coming in to pick it up (if that's an option).
"I like this place because they use quality meat unlike most taco places around here that are slinging horse meat.  The chicken tacos were extremely juicy and falvorful.  The al pastor actually was probably my favorite, really a nice marinade on the pork combined with the right amount of pineapple.  Carne asada was solid as well.  This place is seriously deficient in its hot sauce selection though- they offer no heat whatsoever and questionable flavor.  If they could solve that then this is a 5 star banger for sure."
"We order carry out from L'Patron at least once a week.  The place is always packed and has already expanded their seating area.  I'm glad to see them doing so well.The food is innovative and fresh.  It takes about 20 minutes to get your order, because it is all made to order. I tend to stick to the veggie burrito, and it is always made with what is fresh and available that day.  My favorite is one with beets and kale, but it's always a surprise, and always great.  I've had the tacos also, and those are great as well.  My husband tends to stick to the steak burrito or one of their specialties - the gringo or the gringa.   It's also very inexpensive, especially considering the high quality and great taste of the food.  You could go to Chipotle for industrial ""Mexican"" food or you could go here for authentic and delicious Mexican food   - NO CONTEST!!!"
"This small place on Diversey next to Walgreens was formerly a forgettable place with OK burgers and Italian beef sandwiches. I wasn't sorry to see it go, but was excited to watch construction progress on L'Patron, especially as it's right by my house. When I first walked in, I was greeted by two friendly faces, the girl who was taking food orders and the cook (who I presume is the owner). I also found the minor renovations done inside from the previous place were well done, nothing over the top, but very clean and inviting. The menu looked fairly extensive, and I was salivating at the thought of eventually trying everything on the menu. My main focus on this visit, however, was on tacos. Specifically, I went for the al pastor, lengua, and carne asada. They were all excellent with my favorite being the al pastor. My only regret was not ordering more as I did carryout. I'm very excited about this new addition to the neighborhood and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu."
There's a long line for good reason! The steak is perfectly seasoned and quality meat - the carne asada taco is packed with this steak too. The al pastor taco was also awesome!! My new go to taco place for sure!!
"Hubby wanted to take me here for lunch on the weekend.  He had been there the week before, so I knew it must be good for him to return so soon.  We started with the chips and guacamole.  The chips were warm, not too thick, and generously salted.  I was pleasantly surprised to find dried cranberries in the guacamole - they gave the dish a sweet kick.  Next were the yummy tacos!  The fish was fresh and crispy accompanied with cabbage and mayo.  The el pastor taco was marinated in a sweet sauce with pineapple chunks.  The sides can also hold their own.  I really liked the beans and rice, which were both flavorful.  I wanted to try the corn on the cob smothered in cream and chili powder, but will have to save that for the next trip.  On a side note, Hubby loved the all-you-can-eat pickled veggies in the jars sitting on the counter.  He almost ate all of the cauliflower from one jar!  They also serve several fruit ades: limeade, cucumber-ade, and another flavor that I'm forgetting.  The server was nice enough to let us try a sample of the cucumber-ade before we settled with the lime one.  Nice, clean place with tacos made to order and worth the wait.  Service was friendly and timely.  The menu, located along one wall, is large, readable, well-organized, and detailed containing descriptions underneath the dish names.  Counter seating available.  Don't forget to bring cash since it's cash only."
"Sometimes the wait for your food can be lengthy, but its worth it and I've been so very happy since this little taco shack was added to the neighborhood. Their Chorizo and pico de gallo are my favorite. I do love their fish tacos, but they do get soggy fast - so be sure to order these if you're eating there. Keep in mind, if they're really busy, they wont answer their phones - but I've learned to live with it because L'Patron ALWAYS fulfills my taco needs."
"Some of the best tacos I've had in Chicago! I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I saw shrimp tacos on the menu. I haven't been able to find those at my usual hanuts. They were absolutely delicious! The al pastor tacos are amazing with chunks of pineapple to add that sweetness to the spice - best in Chicago!The guacamole wasn't my favorite, but that doesn't mean it wasn't tasty. There just seemed to be something missing for me. Also, there isn't much seating so be ready to take it to go, if needed."
Five stars. Cash only. Close to highway. They know a thing or two about being friendly and customer service which is rare in Chicago. One of the best take out joints I've ever been to. That's all.
"I can't add to much that's been said, but I've now gone to L'Patron about 5 times on my way to the Revolution tap room, and suffice to say it's become my go to spot for a meal on the way.  Since everything is made fresh, they substitute the grilled chicken for other carne in the Gringa.  Outstanding.  And the Elote, well, just try it.  Admittedly, this is a small place, so at lunch time, be prepared to wait; but it's worth it.This is great Mexican, try it out."
Best tacos I've found in Chicago! Love love love.  Pastor is amazing and a little sweet when cooked with pineapple.  Fish tacos also super tasty.  I ALSO REALLY enjoyed my burrito. This is the spot!
"The best taqueria in the city--maybe the best taqueria east of the Mississippi?The rajas taco, the rotating veggie taco specials, the burritos, the chicken tacos, the gringo, and especially the fish taco are amazing."
"Hands down thee best authentic tacos i have had in Chicago! I was hearing all this hype about how good this place was and how authentic this place is or ""hey! You gotta try these al pastor tacos at L' Patron"" ive heard it all from my friends and locals. What people don't know is that i am not a huge fan of super authentic mexican food. I love chipotle and big star. Authentic mexican food can get my stomach turning upside at times. But heck i had to try this place out. When i moved to bucktown this was on my to eat list. The menu is extensive but fairly simple to digest with a wide range of flavors and meats. From chicken to fish to beef tongue. They had it all. The seating is a bit small but after you had a taste of the epic goodness that is L' Patron it is well worth it. I order al pastor, rib eye, and tongue. Every taco i ordered had its own taste, textures, flavors, ingredients, colors, heck everything you can imagine. The al pastor was my favorite! Dont forget to wash it all down with their horchata! The staff is super friendly, they currently know my name when i walk in now! I have been in there when its packed but i still order to stay and a spot always opens up. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves mexican food."
"yes, this place is as good as everyone says it is!  my only qualm is that the seating area is so small and it was freezing (it is winter in chicago, after all!), but i can just imagine sitting at the window eating tacos on a nice warm afternoon..the chips and salsa - chips were FRESH, crispy.. delicious.  i tried the fish taco and the vegetarian taco.  i didn't read the description very well for the fish taco so it was a little too spicy for me, but once i scraped off the spiciness it was delicious!  the slaw on top was really good, as well.the veggie taco was suppppppperrrr yummy!  the best veggie taco i may have ever had at a restaurant!  the veggie was portobella mushrooms that were marinated in.. idk what, but it was delicious.  my boy raved about the carne asada tacos as well - they looked super moist!"
"I've been here a few times and the first few times were aw snaps, but the last visit had me feeling salty. My salsa verde was super salty. Not cool when you add super salty salsa to your super salty burrito. I'm not saying I won't go back, but that's not a 5 star move.  Side note, I need more burrito. A bigger burrito for more monies would be iiight! Iiiight?!For now it remains a battle vs 2 Amigos. I real loyal to my amigos over at Amigos, but its getting close. They gave me a nice calender over at Amigos for the new year so I can't quit now. Won't stop can't stop."
I love this place! It's easily my go-to lunch on days when I'm too rushed to pack a bag lunch. I'd love to see these guys at next year's Boulevard music fest in Logan Square!!
"L' Patron has quickly become one of my favorite spots in the city. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and delicious and it's inexpensive.I've had almost everything on the menu and there's nothing that I haven't loved. The al pastor is the best I've had in the city, the fish tacos are fantastic, the burritos don't fall apart when you bite into them and even the horchata is a cut above the rest. Oh, and it's open until 4am on weekends. Nowhere beats this place.The only thing that I don't love about L' Patron is that it can get very hot in there. Get a fan in there and the place is perfect."
I got pick up from l patron this past Sunday .I had very high hopes for this place. I finally try it and I was soo dissapointed. I ordered the gringa and a fish taco. The homemade tortilla was inedible it had a disgusting after taste perhaps I got a bad batch but no excuse. There was barely any meat in it at all.Also the meat tasted over salted. Average rice and beans came with it and the wait was way to long over 20 mins. I had a friend try the tortilla just to make sure i wasnt imagining how awful it was. Same reaction from her as well. The fish taco was not bad at all a little over dressed . If i ever return i will stick to the taco. If i would of ate in I would have sent it back but it was pick up and in the heat i was not traveling back up there. I was so upset about this place .
"This place is definitely a new favorite.  It is a clean, still new, family business that brings some of the small town in Mexico taste into the northern ChiTown area.  Everything from the Gringas to the Horchata are prepared with attention to detail in a delicious way.  Hooray for the later hours too!"
"Delicious food and the best taco joint in the area, besides the bad attitude from the humboldt park girl in the front, I loved it!!!"
"Came here twice and never fails. This place is amazing, clean and great customer service! I think it's great they write dates on everything to keep things fresh. I hope they keep it fresh because makes them unique from all the taco spots Chicago has to offer!"
"Al Pastor tacos are really bad. Too much pineapple. Typical crappy Mexican sauces, red and green that tastes like every other Mexican joint. Nothing special here."
Amazing! Best tacos in Chicago.  My boo and I are here for the first time tonight.  The El Pastor tacos changed my life.  Huge slices of pineapple grilled and tossed in with the pork.  I have to say the ELOTE wasn't my favorite. I prefer the street version w mayo but everything else could not have been better.  We also got the fish tacos! Amazing. Cooked to perfection.  They have quite a spicy kick but it was perfectly paired with the dressed cabbage.   Go.  Now.
"Just stop what ever you're doing and get in here. Some of the freshest Mexican food I've had in my lifetime. All made to order and you'll know it from the first bite. Al pastor burrito with roasted pineapple gets my vote for best in Chicago honestly! P.S the hours are wrong on yelp, they open at 10am and close at midnight"
This place is awesome. I have been here several times and the girl/s behind the counter are super nice and helpful.I've only had the vegie tacos/burritos and fish.  Always DELICIOUS!!!  Veggies are always whats fresh.  Today My veggie taco had sauteed green beans.. SO GOOD!! Seriously this is the only I've craved for veggie tacos or burritos.  Prices are beyond fair.  Two thumbs up.
the food is so good . went once about 6 months back . the staff is very friendly and very well to do . they make the food just so . and its so so good.
Best tacos in Chicago. Yup u heard that rite
Was excited to try after seeing it o ntv and driving by(how could you not miss ithe green building).  Not terrible but way better places in the city.
"This place is the REAL DEAL!I normally don't dish out 5 star reviews, but I feel I have to for L Patron Tacos (and I hate to do it because I definitely do not want it to get any more crowded than it already is).No questions, the best tacos in Logan Square....probably the best in the entire northwest side of Chicago, and the best taco on the NW side of Chicago is about as good as tacos get.Love this place.....I'm still full from my meal and I already want to go back!"
"I have been hounded by friends to come try the tacos at this place and I finally got my chance the other day on my way to Logan Square. I got there around 730 pm and there wasn't a line at all I got to order right away. When I try a new taco place I always check to see if they have tacos de lengua because thats a easy way to find out if a taco place is serious about their food because lengua is a taco you can mess up very easily. They happened to have legua so I ordered one taco of lengua one of rajas and one of lomo. The lengua taco was excellent, the meat was tender and flavorful which is a result of them cooking it right. SO many places get this taco wrong and the meat always comes up chewy and not very moist. The lomo tacos are made different here than other places I had it at. The lomo, rib eye steak, was also very tender and tasty and it was cooked with caramelized onions. They didn't really give you a lot of meat though. Other places I have tried this taco give you the whole steak either intact or cut up. The taco de rajas I was very curious to try because almost everybody does it differently. Here they sauteed the rajas with some caramelized onions and cheese. This taco was also tasty but they didn't give you much cheese but the rajas were not that hot but still flavorful. I did not try their Al Pastor or chopped steak tacos but from what I did have it was very good. Its a notch better than a lot of overpriced tacos joints in the area. I'm looking at you big star."
"Why am I reviewing a place that tastes like every other taqueria?  Because it does.  A friend (who reviewed this place as the ""creating a budget for"") recommended.  Noted are the tortillas made on premises and the lomo encebollito, but like Oscar said, nothing special here.  Oh and the tacos are kiddie size!  Okay, they do have sandia.  Sorry Kev, Zaca is still KING!"
The carne asade is here EXCELLENT! I love all things steak and this is the place for it. I once ordered a carne asade burrito with a side of rice and beans and all 3 were excellent. The only gripe I have is that it's cash only and not calling in your order ahead of time can be a drag but the food more than makes up for it! 6 STARS!
"The best taqueria in Chicago, full stop. Nowhere can you get this quality for this price. The ribeye and onion tacos are next level. Also the rotating vegetarian options are great in burrito and taco form."
The best steak tacos and the best service from Janet and Tania
Ordered food to go based on the reviews.  Not only did they mess up the order but they over charged us as well.  Tried the steak tacos. The meat was dry and over cooked.  Would not recommend to anyone.
"Veggie Taco of the day, something different all the time. And about 3 other options on the menu for the veggie loving people...which can also be made vegan! The horchata is not vegan though - the person taking orders went back and asked the cooks to be sure. Bummer! It takes a while tog et your order, but these tacos are delicious, well worth the wait!"
"STUPENDOUSLY good al pastor tacos (made with both raw and carmelized onion, and just a few tiny cubes of pineapple!), great, made-that-day green and red sauce, refreshing horchata, cool location. New favorite! Going again very soon!"
"Tacos are solid here.  Although my carne asada taco was a bit too tough and chewy for my liking, the short rib with green onion taco was delicious.  Solid salsa with a side of beans and rice topped off a nice meal last nite.  I will be back for more, making elbow room in your tiny, hot/muggy joint cause the tacos are that good.  wonder if they would taste better if it were comfortably spacious with a server, probably not. Grimey tacos for $2 a pop, a line of people waiting all the way out of the door, an uncomfortable counter seating arrangement , i guess is worth it - since the tacos are that delicious. I will be ordering the al pastor, chicken and fish tacos soon..."
"basics: they have a pretty deece steak taco and a yummy al pastor.  'tilla is soft.  walk up to the counter, cash only (i think) - there's an ah-tey-emme inside or at the dubb-greens across the way.  horchata is SUPES sweet though and if that's your thing, do it.  green sals is HOT, red is not."
"This is amazing food.  Fresh and made to order - no wonder the place is always packed. The fish taco is banging. I was with a girlfriend who is an award-winning chef and she raved about it.  The staff are super friendly and the prices are so reasonable. Great food, great value, great atmosphere."
"Dayum, L'patron is knocking it out of the park. I just want a giant bowl of their pastor meat for my every meal.  But seriously, I'm glad that this place is getting great recognition in such a short amount of time.  The staff is friendly and hard-working and the food is fresh and delicious at a very low price."
"Great steak burrito - nice and simple, I like how it was cut down the middle. The seasoning reminded me of Las Asadas on N. Western but it wasn't quite as huge. Really friendly staff, great prices, good burritos!"
"Super delicious and affordable Mexican food! Love their tacos(especially the pescado), and la gringa will change your life. Counter service is fast, considering how busy it can get in there. Don't be fooled by the interior, you are in for a culinary treat!"
"For the love of all things delicious...Highly recommended. It's open late, they take only ca$h and the food is so fresh and so clean clean (dunno what that means).On the real- tried the Carne Asada, fish taco, and Chicken Taco. Capital letters for Carne Asada & Chicken as they blew my mind, the fish taco didn't but I need to give it a proper 2nd chance...when I am sober.  This place has pickled veggies that are effing delicious and help offset the spice from their sauces...which, by the way, are great. The light green combo sauce of either cucumber or avocado was literally one of the top 5 spicy things I've ingested, but again, that pickled veggie action (onion, carrots, cauliflower) really helped balance things out.Additionally, their sides are also super affordable and I'd recommend their GUAC as it is delicious and has some kind of craisins or something in their with some fruit that really take it to the next level.Small space inside, but you can CALL AHEAD for a pickup order or just camp out there like I prefer. Hope this helps, hope you dig it.Support local and support Logan Square.Peace."
"i'm pretty spoiled when it comes to mexican food, as i'm from so cal. having said that, the shrimp taco here is amazing. you've got the crisp bite from the cabbage slaw. it's tangy and fresh. you've got the succulent, tender pieces of battered-and-fried shrimp. add a little hot sauce on top and you're good to go! this place has become a late-night pit stop after weekend drinks. the other tacos were good, too. i tried the carne asada taco and the al pastor taco. the carne asada was juicy. you just can't go wrong with a good carne asada. the al pastor was a blend of marinated pork cooked with pineapples. my friends enjoyed this one, but when it comes to meats, i'm more of a savory rather than sweet kind of girl. to each his own. keep in mind that this place is cash only. i sometimes have a slight anxiety about this before going to new restaurants because i never carry the stuff around. it's good to know in advance."
"We've been looking for a taco joint by the house.  Big Star, delicious, but overpriced. Antique-- a knock off of Bigstar but they don't do it as good.  L'Patron= amazing horchata, tacos, CORN! and more for super affordable prices. We came in ate like kings for under $20.  The place is tight, and it's cash only, however, worth it!"
Today 6/6/2014 I had lunch at L'Patrone.  Delicious.  This place is on a par with  Bayless' Frontera Grill.  They have a small menu and each item is exceptional.
"The food is great, but the customer service is so-so.  I have ordered for pick up several times, each time was not handled well.  They either forget and item or forget that they placed you on hold.  Hearing the employees gossip while you are waiting to place your order is frustrating!"
"I give this place a two because I do like their food but I was given food poisoning on 6/8/2013.  I ate the fish, pork, and steak taco.  My girlfriend had the vegetarian tacos and the following day I was sick as a dog with food poisoning.  I tried calling the manager to report the incident and prevent future outbreaks but girl at the counter took down my name and number and I never heard from the manager.  I have eaten there again and when I ordered i asked to see the manager he was very passive and questioned whether his food made me sick or not.  I was looking for a bit more sympathy and care.  I now stay away from the pork."
I live right down the street and I am always super excited about a new taqueria!  I have eaten at L'Patron twice the first time was good no complaints.  I got the carne asada tacos.  I just went back a second time and I called in for pick up.  When I got home my tasty carne asada was burnt!  I was super disappointed. :(
"So, after watching a segment on the news about this place, and reading the good reviews on here I felt I needed to try these tacos. Big waste of money. I called my order in ahead of time, but when my fiancee and I arrived there was a line so we still had to wait a bit. Between the two of us we ordered carne asada, al pastor, lengua (tongue), and pollo adobado (chicken) tacos. Oh god where do I begin!? First, $2 for a taco is usually not very pricy, but I don't feel these were even worth that because they were so small. The chicken was the worst because it was so salty, I think they over seasoned the meat. I am usually not very picky when it comes to al pastor, but these were a little too sweet for my taste, although I did like the little chunks of pineapple. The carne asada was mediocre at best, and according to my fiancee so was the tongue. We also ordered corn, but I threw half of mine away because it was nothing like what I am used to. Those of you who have grown up in Chicago buying from the cart vendors know what I mean. The girl at the counter was nice, but I still had to go back 5 minutes after I left because she forgot our corn. Overall, this place is less than mediocre Mexican food, but apparently some of the best Americanized Mexican in Logan square. Im sorry but as a Mexican I just can't accept this rubbish as real Mexican food. As for you Latinos giving this place such good reviews, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Maybe you guys need to go back to your mommas house for a day and taste real Mexican tacos again!"
"In a neighborhood full of great taco joints, L'Patron reigns supreme!This is now definitely our go-to Taco place, and they're always fantastic. The ""special"" 99 cent taco deals never hurt either. Great prices, great tacos!Our favorites: Al pastor taco, Ribeye and onion taco, Cebollitas, Lengua taco (if you haven't ever had lengua this is a great way to try it!!), Rajas taco."
"saw this on thrillist's ""top taco places in chicago.""  i love carne asada, but sometimes these hole in the wall taco joints are too shady.  tried it out, and damn, loved it.  their carne asada are in large cuts, seasoned well and grilled with a nice char, with very minimal fat.  their horchatas and watermelon juice are too die, and the fish tacos, are so original - they have this nice kick.  i seriously went 4 times in 8 days."
I was told about this place from a friend and all I can say is she was absolutely right. Great tacos! It does get busy especially on Saturday and Sunday afternoon but it's worth it.
This has to one of the best places to get tacos in Chicago. Steak tacos are amazing!!! Sometimes they can go heavy on the onions. Guacamole is great!!! It has cranberries in it which makes it standout. And the salsa verde is FANTASTIC!! I would recommend ordering take out. There is always a line and not a lot of seats. The girls who work the counter are always nice.
"Best tacos in the city, Ernie stays connected to his food and staff to insure everything served is exactly the way it should be, delicious! keep up the good work, If you ever get tired of making tacos there's always room on my line for someone that always worked hard every minute he was there, Burrito & Guacamole was the best I've ever had too. quality ingredients and all made to order, I eat a lot of Mexican and trust me this food is the real deal."
pork taco. damn! just get some.
Holy crap this place is great. Other tacos are dead to me.
"The food is excellent---comes out hot, fast and it tastes FRESH. My only complaint is the environment: usually the music is extremely loud and the lighting reminds me of an operating room. Turn down the fluorescent overhead lights and we'd have a perfect place to get cheap Mexican food in Logan Square."
This is my Favorite taco joint!!
Place was jammed packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Everything was $$$$$ and gravy.  Dumb ol me forgot to bring cash so I made the walk of shame to Walgreens :)
