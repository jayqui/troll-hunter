Mother Cluckers Kitchen
"My neighborhood restaurant in Forest Glen on the corner of Foster & Elston Ave.  This is the 4th restaurant since I moved here 12-13 years ago & by far the best.  You start to think because of the location & the shape of the site and building there isn't much that can be done.  The rest have come and gone, but I hope this place is a keeper.  It's the real deal!!! There's not much you can do with the outside of the restaurant as it is a triangular site, still they did jazz up the outside with new canopies and signage to let you know there is a new sheriff in town.  The interior What a huge difference.  Once again the exterior enclosure is a given in terms of area, but what they did on the interior is like night & day. The kitchen is still in the same location, but the rest of the inside was gutted and redone in rustic finishes w/faux wood panel look decorated with a bunch of really cool knick knacks like an old rusted Route 66 sign, over sized fishing lures Texaco, Standard, Sinclair Quaker State Oil signs & a whole slew of interesting wall arts to keep you occupied while waiting for your food.  Oh yeah the reason for coming here.  The food.  Mother Cluckers (ahh a little play on words?).  They have a huge assortment of different dishes from sandwiches, panini sandwiches, dinners, dinner combos and BROASTED CHICKEN. This is what I ended up ordering.  The Broasted chicken was absolutely incredible.  This is Broasted not fried chicken 1/3 less fat, and it is seasoned and cooked to perfection.  There is no breading, just the seasoning and so succulent and juicy.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  The meal came with 2 sides.  I chose the Mac & cheese and the baked beans (awesome beans). The beans are cooked with a combination of baked beans, black beans with small pieces of meat, diced peppers & onions (delicious).  The beans also had brown sugar and a hint of hot sauce). Perfect blend.  I only ordered the 2 piece meal w/2 sides as I wanted to leave room for the breaded pudding.  The breaded pudding was very good served hot with syrup & icing.  I will be back again and if you enjoy great food you should check it out."
"Me and the family were on my way to O'Hare around 6PM on a Friday to drop off my wife's friend's daughter from Los Angeles that was at writing camp at Northwestern and because we were short on time, we decided to check out Mother Cluckers Kitchen, a neighborhood restaurant in Forest Glen on the corner of Foster & Elston Ave on the way to the airport. This is the 4th restaurant here in the last 13 years and you start to think if there is a curse at this location or because of the location & the shape of the site and building there isn't much that can be done. The rest have come and gone, but this place might have some staying power. Can this be the real deal? There's not much you can do with the outside of the restaurant as it is a triangular site surrounded by fast traffic on Elston and on Foster. Very bad Feng Shui if you're into that kinda stuff. But they did jazz up the outside with new canopies and signage to let you know there is a new player in the hood. Once again the exterior enclosure is a given in terms of square footage, but what they did on the interior is like a night & day transformation. The kitchen is still in the same location, but the rest of the interior was gutted, spiffed up, and redone in a not-too-original red-neck truck stop or man-cave-esque rustic finishes w/faux wood panel look decorated with a bunch of retro reproductions of knick knacks like an old rusted Route 66 sign, over sized fishing lures Texaco, Standard, Sinclair Quaker State Oil signs & a whole slew of other, yawn, half priced artifacts you could find at Garden Ridge or Hobby Lobby. At least one can roll their eyes at the wall art and keep somewhat entertained while waiting for your food.  Oh yeah, the reason for coming here, to grab a quick bite on route to the airport. Mother Cluckers (ahh a little play on words ya think??). They have a huge assortment of different dishes from panini sandwiches, rib dinners, fish dinners, corn dogs, pecan pie, soups, and their namesake specialty, BROASTED CHICKEN. This is what I ended up ordering.  The broasted chicken was alright. Broasted chicken is fried chicken but cooked in a pressure cooker. Anyone who thinks broasted is healthier than regular deep fried chicken is thinking wishfully or in the same camp as those who believes no-calorie pound cake exists. Why broast your chicken? Pressure cooking food cuts down your cooking time in half. So do the math Poindexter - serve your customers in half the time and double your revenue! Or at least that's the goal... So the MF's or I meant MC's broasted chicken was decent but not blow you away good. It was on par with fresh fried chicken you'd get at Jewel or Mariano's and a distant 7th to blue chip fried chicken found at the big 6 chicken houses - Browns, KFC, Harold's, Petro's Diner, Popeyes, and Church's. My four piece meal came with 2 sides.  I chose the mash & greens. The mash was funked up with skin on, with pieces of taters and had a darkish cast to it. Give me smooth creamy white white mash any day of the week. The greens had a slight sour twang to them which was kind of a turn off. I've had better. I wanted to try the bread pudding as it sounded so yummy served with hot with syrup & icing. But because of my new diet to cut out all sugar intake, I refrained and did my fat ass a big favor.  I will be back again but no rush to do so. Love their parking lot in the back!"
"I recently ate at Mother Cluckers Kitchen, located at the northwest corner of Elston and Foster.  Their specialty is ""broasted"" chicken, which is sort of a slightly less fattening take on fried chicken.  I ordered the 2-piece chicken meal.  For my two sides I chose collard greens and mac & cheese, and I chose hush puppies over the biscuit.  The chicken is pretty good with a crackling skin, but I'm not sure if it is crave-worthy as some fried chicken I have consumed elsewhere.  The two sides I had were OK but I would probably try other sides next time.  The hush puppies also have a crackling crunch to them similar to the pieces of chicken.  There are some other interesting food selections and specials, so I would not mind another meal here sometime.The service here is prompt and friendly.  The food was brought to my table just minutes after ordering, and I did not have to ask for a free pop refill while I was stuffing my face.  There is a parking lot behind the restaurant if you are driving."
"Catfish was good, crunchy and well seasoned on the outside and moist on the inside. The remoulade sauce that came on the side was tasty. I chose greens as my side and it was made the way I liked it, slight vinegary and with bits of meat in it. I also had the Mac and cheese...it was good but I would have liked it more saucy/creamy.I tried the hush puppies and it definitely was the best I've ever had."
"Dude. Loved this new chicken place. Kind of a more approachable place than honey butter fried chicken. (Yes, I said it). Try the catfish po boy sandwich with remulaude sauce. So good. Especially try the collard greens as a side and its a great meal. We also tried the fried chicken sandwich and pulled pork. I liked the pulled pork better but the chicken was really juicy. Ask for the homemade honey mustard and it's even better. Place is small but just enough seating for a big group. Atmosphere is cool...very old school blues and bbq joint style.  Service is fast and very friendly that it makes you want to stay a while. End the meal with a great carrot cake that everyone enjoyed. Would come back again for sure...and you should too.P.S.  It's BYOB!"
"For Broasted chicken. Tender and juicy dark pieces. Good portion. Golden batter. Served hot. Simple seasoning. Nothing complicated. Wish I had dipping sauce.Byob.The day we arrived around 4:30pm. No traffic. Summer Monday. Not busy. Parking available.Saw sign closed on Tuesday but cannot verify since I didn't take photo.Interior clean. Server polite. Updated me on wait and offered water.So a family before me ordered chicken and was waiting awhile. Kitchen broasted extra chicken. So my order was fortunately with theirs. If not, I'd probably would be waiting more than the four minute notice.Dining area is clean. Even the exterior and parking.Hush puppies was heavily seasoned. Too salty for my taste. Should have tried the biscuit.Collard greens was salty even my oldest child complained.The baked beans had a Tex-Mex or chili flavor but still salty for me.Lemonade is lemonade.Water refreshing.Carry out packages were not containing. Started spilling in plastic bag. Even after server changed containers and bag. So protect your car upholstery.Great for neighborhood."
"As a woman who was born and raised in the South, I'm not really sure what all the hubub is about this place. Maybe it just wasn't at its best when we had lunch there. We were the only people in the restaurant at around 3 in the afternoon, and they still managed to get my order wrong not once, but twice. First, they delivered a small mac & cheese when I ordered a medium, and then we had to ask for the bread pudding that we'd ordered. To be totally fair, they gave me a large mac & cheese to make up for it, and they brought the bread pudding right out when we let them know that they'd forgotten it.Truth be told, the bread pudding, broasted chicken, and hush puppies were great. That's the stuff to order. The mac & cheese, collards, and waffle were just okay, nothing special.  They didn't have sweet iced tea, and they were out of pecan pie, which made me sad, since I wanted both.On the bright side, the place was really clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly. If my husband wants to go back, I won't say no, but I won't be suggesting it."
"Recently moved into the neighborhood from Mt. Prospect, this father and son duo serve up a whole menu of delicious, bone-stickin' southern comfort food. We had the chicken and waffles & chicken fried chicken covered in gravy and served with mashed potatoes and corn. SO GOOD. As a treat from the owner, we sampled their bread pudding as well--sweet, buttery, savory. Highly recommended this place."
"I was not disappointed when I tried out this new joint with my husband. Sadly I can't say too much about the restaurant itself because we've only ever carried out. It's not too shabby of a place although slightly tiny. But it does have a restaurant feel with the warm, inviting red brick and checkerboard table cloths.Did I mention yet how awesome the food is? The chicken is super tasty. Crispy and meaty and if you stick around the restaurant I know they have different dipping sauces on the tables. But definitely try other stuff. The last time we ordered food from there I actually wanted to check out their fish. I had the catfish po' boy and my husband saw they had shrimp tacos that day. The sauce for the po' boy was oh so good and I almost forgot to share with my hubby. He said his tacos were good, but the bites he had of my sandwich.....he liked better :DI will be back! Maybe I'll try their hush puppies. A few reviews here have said they are pretty delish!"
This chicken is better than Harolds and isn't half as greasy. I love it. The staff really go out of there way to make you feel good about spending your money there. I predict good things for this place.
Oh holy god this place is awesome. Rich and his family rock and the food is amazing! I want to try everything and we will be back again and again! The mac & cheese is so good and the bread pudding is to die for. Such a great place! Great fresh homemade food! Even the music playing was great!
"Roses are redViolets are blueThis place serves upSome damn good fried chicken!The wifey and I ordered Ribs as wellThey be so tastyThat they made my male junk swell!Collard greens were awesomeCole slaw, hush puppies, and taters were yummyI'd eat here everyday if I couldBut then I wouldn't be able to steer the car Because of my pregnant woman tummy (and I'm a dude)Their desserts are amazingI ate them so fastA deep fried twinkie, a pecan pie and bread puddingI'll be wearing on my hippo assThe owners are wonderfulThe service was top notchIf I get any biggerI won't be able to see my crotchI'm fine with my obesityThe deliciousness of this place's food was worth itIn 6 hours the food will be fully digestedAnd I can't wait to birth it!Get down here alreadyAnd put some good old down home cookin' in yo mouthTheir food is just as tastyAs many places down South!"
"I went for lunch. This is the second time I have tried Mother Cluckers Kitchen and this time around was better. Chicken is crispy, juicy, and flavorful. Catfish po-boy is also delicious, but they gave me three filets on one bun which might be fine for a straight order of catfish, but excessive for a sandwich. Beans and slaw are a hit, both have a chunky variety of veggies and are well-seasoned."
"This was a pleasant and welcome surprise.  A colleague wanted to meet for lunch and we were headed to Smoque until we realized they're closed on Mondays.  When we looked up alternatives on Yelp, this place came up.  When he told me the address, I remembered the dump I drove by for years coming home from the Kennedy down Foster.  As my good luck would have it, the place changed hands late 2014, the new owner gutted it and now serves up some of the most incredible BBQ and Po'boys I've ever had (which includes eating at Joe's in KC and Rendezvous in Memphis).  I had the ribs & chicken with collard greens, fresh cut fries and some hush puppies.  My colleague had a shrimp po'boy on a lobster roll and he couldn't get enough of it.  We both cleaned our plates even though we were full half way through the meal.  I will definitely be back!"
"The food is amazing!!!! And I have to say that the customer service is even better! Angelica the cashier is so sweet and was just constantly making sure we were comfortable and taking care of us! Made sure are drinks were filled and just genuinely sweet! I would recommend this to anybody, and to think I live down the block! I will be here more often!! Thanks for such great food!!!"
Nope. Nope aaaaand more nope. Really just not worth it. Maybe they were having an off day because I was told the food was amazing. It's not. This place has been 4 different restaurants in as many years.
"We decided to stop in for breakfast after passing by the restaurant many times. The place is nice, very clean. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. We had our two kids and couldn't decide what to order them, the waitress gave us really good suggestions and helped with figuring out how much we should order the kids. Food was amazing, I had an Omelet, wife had the Chicken and Waffles, and kids had pancake and side of bacon. We had to try the biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious, my wife loves southern food and I can't resist biscuits and gravy, and with all the B&G we've had in our time, THESE ARE THE BEST! A must try... Looked at the lunch menu and need to come back for that, highly recommend the Bfast and will help the lunch once I try it."
Best tasting and best service in the neighborhood for quick meal.
"My first time here,  and wow was I am impressed.  I live so close to this place and never even knew it existed.  I actually  discovered it through yelp. Thank goodness for Yelp! Anyway,  I walked in and I was immediately impressed  with the cleanliness of this place.  It had a very inviting ambience, it was nicely decorated, and it had good music playing in the background. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries,  and it was delicious.  The chicken was tasty and moist,  not dry at all!  The fries were very good as well.  I also had a small side of beans,  and that too did not disappoint.  I am looking forward to trying the rest of the food off there menu.  Very happy this place is so close to home."
"I finally made it to the big bad Mother Clucker. This place on the corner of Elston & Foster has been a number of places that didn't last. I think this is my 3rd review of a restaurant at this site now. Hopefully this Mother Cluckin' place lasts because they have good food to offer. At the time of my visit, this place has only been around for 5 weeks. I came here for lunch on a Friday and it wasn't busy at all. The interior has distressed wood and vintage décor, with plenty of tables on either side of the aisle. I ordered a Caesar chicken panini with a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was plenty big and the mac was rich tasting, definitely not from a package mix. My order was made fresh in about 10 minutes. No regrets, it was excellent. I hope this place takes off since they have a good looking menu of chicken and pork offerings. The next time I come here I want to try their broasted chicken dinner."
"Came back a 2nd time this time with my wife. She had the shrimp tacos and I had the fried chicken sandwich.  We shared a side of collard greens.  We both enjoyed our food and the friendly atmosphere. For dessert we tried the carrot cake and it was ok. We should of  tried the bread pudding, everyone seems to love it.Look forward to trying everything on their menu."
"I was totally shocked coming into this place last week.  The location has had a lot of turnover in the last few years that I have worked nearby, so when I saw another place open - I unfortunately didn't immediately run and get in line!  Too bad!Very friendly and helpful staff and delicious food!  I had the catfish po' boy (served on a brioche typically made for lobster rolls, but perfect pairing), my sister had fish tacos (just lighly enough friend to still be ""healthy"", and the nephew had the kids chicken meal.   We all devoured our food and all the sides!  If they could make their biscuits a little less dry - I would give them 6 stars.  Can't wait to be back."
"Hey Folks- this is the ""Real Deal"" when it comes to down home Southern Cooking!My husband and I have visited this fine establishment on a number of occasions, and most recently had the good sense to have them cater our Block Party.  We chose the boastful broasted chicken, paired with  meaty and finger lickin' ribs, sumptuous mac and cheese and delectable hush puppies!Everything was absolutely perfect, arrived right on time, was very reasonably priced and the party was a huge success! Everybody left home with a menu and a smile on their face!Richard, the owner and his son Tim are the nicest folks this side of the planet! Richard is a character of hearty laughter and a spirited personality to boot- he went above and beyond to ensure everything was as per catered request and that everyone was satisfied.We couldn't have made a better decision and will be certain to recommend Mother Clucker's to our friends, family and anyone who is looking for a superior catering experience. Go the restaurant at the corner of Elston and Foster and see and TASTE for yourself- such a diverse  and eye popping Southern menu and BYOB- you won't be disappointed - We Gar-Un-T !!!!R & R GolsChicago,il"
"The owner was an incredibly nice guy and made the experience even more enjoyable. You can really feel when someone puts a lot into making an excellent dining experience. Everything is made from scratch... Everything. What sets this place apart is their spices and seasoning. As an example, I got mashed potatoes and was a bit sad that they didn't include any gravy. And then I actually tried them, wow! They are some of the tastiest mashed potatoes I've ever had and it would have been a shame to put gravy on them. Being from Kentucky, where catfish are fresh and plentiful, I was a bit skeptical at first to see a catfish Poboy in Chicago. I've gotta say, it was fantastic. Ask for extra of the spicy sauce they put on it. You won't be disappointed. Really fun little place, I'll be back!"
"Found me some amazing pulled pork and the greens may be the best I've ever had, my southern denomination roots and time spent working at East Carolina University feed this craving...dope junk even got the sweet tea and pecan pie, am I in Greenville, NC or Elston and Foster here in Chicago?  I SHALL RETURN!I returned a day later, dinner tonight and brought a friend.  It was wonderful, I had the pulled pork dinner, greens and mac n cheese again.  I added a bowl of chili which was good, not great but my buddy had the chicken and it was so juicy and delicious.   The portions on the pulled pork dinner are tremendous, so many other places skimp, I'm 6'4 and love to eat.  This plate has spelled dinner today and lunch tomorrow.  The service is amazing as well, very attentive.  I think I'll try a sandwich next time but Mother Cluckers is making me wish I weren't leaving Chicago in six weeks to move to Seattle.   Maybe if I get my fiancé here she'll reconsider a move to Chicago and join me for some pulled pork and greens."
"I JUST GOT CLUCKED AT MOTHER CLUCKER'S (and I loved it!).This place is terrific! It has been scoured clean, beautifully remodeled, plays great music and has free wifi, and the food is PHENOMINAL!!!I loved everything, but I am a sucker for great Chicken & Dumpling soup! The fried chicken was crispy and succulent, the roasted potatoes crispy outside, fluffy inside.  The ribs are hearty and the sauce tasty.  The bakes beans are more tomatoey than barbecuey, but are very flavorful.  They have the usual range of soft drinks and milk, and also have free refills.  It is BYOB, for those who choose to get their drink on.The place is spotlessly clean, has a slight (but not over the top) roadhouse decor, and even the music has a bluesy/jazzy vibe.  They even repaved the parking lot!  You order at the counter, they bring it to the table.  FOR NOW, there is no delivery, but watch for it in the future.We'll be back! Many restauranteurs have tried and failed at this location.  I would love to see this place become a success!Share on TwitterShare on Facebook"
"Just minutes off I-90/94 on Foster & Elston, it was convenient and it's new!  The place is small maybe 8 tables but decent parking lot. The hubby and I shared the 8 piece meal with 2 medium sides and 4 biscuits. Decent pricing. The chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy and the skin was delish. The corn cobblette was soggy but the Mac and cheese with bacon was very good. The biscuits were very dry. Next time I come I'll have to try the poor boy sandwiches or ribs."
This place is legit!! Will be back! The owners are always there and always have a smile! Love the vibe and the food is even better!
My husband and I went into this little place for lunch and were amazed at how great everything was! The decor and the lighting just made everything feel comfortable and inviting.  The service was very attentive and our server went out of her way to get us what we wanted. The food was EXCELLENT!  My grilled chicken sandwich was juicy and flavorful and the side of collared greens....to die for! And the portions are abundant because I had leftovers to take home and I was stuffed.  My husband and I are making Mother Cluckers a regular outting. Check it out people!
"I went here for lunch today.I had the Chicken Sandwich with Broasted Potatoes and a Drink.The Chicken Sandwich was very good. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. The boneless chicken breast was pretty large. The seasoning was perfect. The toppings had a lot to be desired. The lettuce was just your average head lettuce and the tomatoes had no flavor. I understand it is out of season for tomatoes, but you can get pretty good quality tomatoes. Why am I giving the sandwich toppings such a hard time, the price of the sandwich justifies better quality toppings.Don't get me wrong, the sandwich tasted pretty darn good.The broasted potatoes were pretty good. The problem was there was two normal size pieces and a third large chunk. The normal size were cooked just right, but the large chunk was a little firm, not quite ready. They are not seasoned so a little salt brought the potato flavor out.The drink was regular on-tap pop.As for the price. I had to knock off a star for the cost of the lunch. Over $11 for the sandwich, potatoes, and drink. It would help if they offered lunch price specials.The place was clean inside. Great atmosphere. There were about 8+ tables.The people were very friendly and great. They greeted me when I walked in the door and welcomed me to the counter.Bicycling:One thing this place has going for them is the Elston Bicycle lane passing right by. The disadvantage is the lack of a bicycle rack.You have a group of customers passing your business everyday, give them a place to stop and lock their bicycle up.Overall I was happy with my visit to the new business. Aside from the little negatives mentioned in my review, I think they have a good thing started here.I will be returning to try some of the other food."
"Having been born and raised in the South, it has been difficult to find a good southern restaurant in the city.  Nothing fancy, just good down home food.  Mother Cluckers is that place.  The catfish po'boy was wonderful, the remoulade sauce is spot on.  Hush puppies crunchy, moist, and flavorful as they are supposed to be and the best beans since my grandmother's.  A teenager who hates raisins fell in love with the bread pudding.  Will be going back for breakfast.   If you love good old southern cooking, you will not be disappointed in Mother Cluckers."
"The staff were super nice, the place was clean, and the food was super tasty. The broasted chicken was some of the best I've had in some time. Well seasoned and flavorful. The ribs were good, as was the fried shrimp. As for the sides, not a miss."
"Stopped in for breakfast after passing by many times. My husband and I came in with the kids and it was wonderful. Great atmosphere, very clean and wonderful staff. They were very helpful and gave great suggestions for the menu. I am a huge biscuits and gravy fan and have to say these are the best I've ever had. I highly recommend the breakfast. I can't wait to come back for lunch, the menu looks amazing!!!!!!!!!"
"Wow- I am a fan of MCK. This was some great fried chicken. I had a breast and a thigh and the breast was the juiciest white meat ever. I am not a fan of breast meat but this place has changed my mind. We had the mac and cheese, collared greens, biscuits, sriracha chicken bites. Mac and cheese and biscuits were meh but everything else was sooooo great. we'll be back. This is some clucking good chicken. HBFC, Parsons, Roost- y'all better watch out!"
"This is honestly the best place I have been to in a while. It's a great spot for quick, good food. We have been back at least five times and our kids even request it. The prices are fair but the quality of food is unbelievable. We like the chicken po' boy and the kids love the chicken tenders! Try this place!"
The many times I have been to Mother Clicked the food has been delishhhhh. I recon the chicken and sides..
"Great atmosphere and very nice people who works there! Got the Asian lettuce wrap--not very good, very salty, cubed chicken was dry and you can tell it was the frozen ones that was cut up. Dish was not worth it. I think they should take it off the menu. Along with that I had the collards greens. Again very salty and as I was eating it all I see in the bottom was oil. I don't recall collard greens having that much oil (or maybe I'm wrong).Family got the 8 piece chicken dinner. Chicken was really good, not greasy, Mac and cheese for a kick to it as well. Last but not least, the bread pudding is toooooo to die for!!! Very very good!!! I would of given it 5 stars because of the Asian wrap (again I think it needs to come off the menu)  and collards greens but the bread pudding made up for it! Worth the price!"
"Great chicken!  First time I stopped: 2-piece dark plus two sides plus a drink, around $9.  A large variety of sides, I'll try something different next time.  The only reason for 4-stars: music was a little loud and annoying.  Plenty of car parking in the back, but I didn't see any convenient space to park my bike so I had to use a sign pole in front."
"Swong by after church to grab some lunch. I got the crab cle dinner with fries and coleslaw, the hubs got the catfish dinner with fries and mac n cheese. The owner had one piece of fish remade because it wasn't up to his standard of size for a fish dinner. Now, that's what I'm talking about! The only reason I give a 4 not 5 is beacuse the music was too loud for my prefer and it was up tempo and kind of made me eat fast. We'll definitely be back. We will try all on the menu......except for the pork :)"
"Don't let the exterior (former Golden Nugget location, perhaps?) fool you.  This is nothing of the sort.  We both had the two piece all white fried chicken.  They use a pressure cooker, and there's no excessive grease here.  Nice golden crisp, and tender and moist chicken.  I had hush puppies, collard greens, and fried potato wedges with mine.  We both really liked the collard greens, which had some ham hock mixed in.  Very heavy side dish for sure.  Wife's mac and cheese was okay, as was the biscuit.  The fried otato wedge was pretty good all told, though I should have seasoned it with something.  The hush puppies were excellent. The coup de grace was their ""unbelievable"" bread pudding.  Whatever meal you get, do not miss this for dessert.  It really is unbelievable, just as they say.  Save room.  I wish I had saved more room, as we couldn't quite finish it. All that was $25 before tip.  Outstanding value."
"I highly recommend this restaurant. It is pricey...but let me tell ya...it is quality & that's what you're paying for here. Fresh fish...no fishy taste or smell at all (exactly how fish should taste and smell). It is very tiny inside (boo), but I love the ambiance in this cozy little gem!"
"I haven't had hush puppies that were worth ordering since I moved here from North Carolina 15 years ago...until today.   My po'boy had enormous shrimp on it (the kind that you can actually hear your teeth ripping through), and it never ceased to make me sweat with its sauce.There was however a discrepancy on my billed amount, and I was worried that such great food might be tainted by shady business.  As much as I hate being THAT guy, I pointed it out after the meal, and they were quick to make it right without making me feel like the bad guy.GREAT food, good customer service....now if they could only magically create a better option for parking, I might just consider moving in and taking this relationship to the next level..."
"The po boy's are solid. Chicken tender and shrimp po boy -- devoured in minutes, nothing left. Crisp light breading on really tender chicken, crispy buttery roll lightly grilled, crisp romaine, and a nice honey mustard with thick sliced tomatoes to top. The remoloude sauce on the shrimp was spicy and unique. The hush puppies are awesome, and I don't even like hush puppies 80% of the time. Get the bread pudding for dessert - it's fantastic. I like that they are doing a southern comfort staples with solid production. Service is great as well. They have only been open for 3 months, and it might be a drive ( or bus trip) to get there, but definitely worth it if you want really satisifying southern food.  Need to go back for ribs, and probably everything else on the menu."
Had lunch here today.  Great service - amazing food.  Wish this place and their husband wife ownership team all the best.   Best broasted chicken ever!!
"This is by far one of best spots to eat at! Couple of things to worth mentioning:1. The owner/staff are so friendly and welcoming. I immediately knew who the owner was because he was there, behind the counter helping out and greeting people. It's rare to find a spot that has great food but it's even more rare when you find a place that has incredible customer service. 2. The FOOD. Oh my god. I've had the BBQ Pork Sandy and Shrimp Tacos. Both incredible however I have to say, the shrimp tacos I had were to die for. They also have a variety of BBQ sauces at each table and a roll of paper towels which I thought was genius.3. This place is aesthetically pleasing and extremely clean. I love the decor in the place and makes it comfortable to sit down and enjoy your meal versus taking it to go.So excited that this place opened up in the area! I love coming here for lunch and expect it to continue to be a big hit in the neighborhood."
Hey hey hey!  Great fried chicken.  Loved it.  The hush puppies are awesome.  Sides are great.  You definitely will not be disappointed.  Go for a Po boy as well.
"My husband and I went for lunch because we have heard good buzz about the place. We went around noon and the place was fairly busy. The have a parking lot so that's a plus. The decor is beautiful and the place was very clean. Nice music was playing and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We order the Shrimp po boy sand which and the broasted chicken dinner. DELICIOUS!!!!Our sides were Mac & cheese, collard greens(which I have never had) and broasted potatoes. Corn fritters came with the chicken dinner too. All the food was very flavorful and juicy. The shrimp po boy had a bit of spicy flavor but not too overpowering. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some southern flare food. The prices were normal for the area. We also had on recommendation from the manager the bread pudding and it was awesome."
"Mother Cluckers wins the Best Value for the Money award in fried/broasted chicken. The ""5 STAR"" ""BEST EVER"" ""OMAGERRD"" seems... a little much. A small little BYOB at an awkward intersection, the interior and counter service scream kitchy southern food (although, not quite as loudly as Dixie Kitchen in Evanston). My mom and I had two dinner combos for $20: 1/2 slab ribs, 2 piece chicken, corn, mash, hush puppies, broasted potatoes and mac n' cheese. My combo said bicuit, but I never saw one. That is a great price deal for a BYOB! Broasted chicken & broasted potatoes were excellent. The ribs were good, but I wasn't impressed by the sweet or spicy sauce. Hush puppies = *nom nom nom* Personally, I would recommend Honey Butter Chicken or Parson's Chicken & Fish over Mother Cluckers. The chicken, sides or some of the options are just way better. But for the money, this place is JUST FINE for Tuesday night fried chicken. 4 stars. *Note to owners, mac n' cheese and mash came out warm, but not hot - might want to reheat before serving, turn up the counter heat lamp or not set up the side orders until the rest of the food is ready."
"Delicious chicken, get the broasted chicken and you won't be disappointed. Always wanted to go in after passing by on Elston. The inside is larger than it appears from outside and very clean. Great portions for the price and they redeem good coupons (20% off of $10 purchase or more) which makes family dinners more wallet friendly. Friendly staff and definitely a great addition to the neighborhood."
"The space Mother Cluckers occupies has seen a series of failed restaurants over the years, the last one being a chicken(!) and taco place. So they have their work cut out for them since the location is a little remote. However, they've obviously invested a bit of time and money fixing and cleaning up the place. The name is a bit dorky, and ""bluesy"" restaurants don't appeal to me personally--the conceit is a bit hackneyed, especially in Chicago--but since I'll probably just be getting pick-up from here, that's irrelevant. The music was blessedly low, at least, which is a plus.As for the food, I brought the eight-piece dinner home with biscuits and beans, mac and cheese, and collared greens sides. Everyone in the family (two adults, two kids) was well-satisfied. Perfectly tasty broasted chicken and biscuits. The sides were good, but I think they need to re-adjust their idea of what makes for a large order. The mac and cheese and beans looked more like mediums. My wife wasn't too hungry that night, so there was enough to go around, but if we were having a party, for instance, I'd worry about running out of sides too quickly.The service was spot-on in terms of attentiveness and efficiency. I'm definitely going back."
"I live close by, so I really want to like this place. Thoughts:I spoke to the owner and his wife, and they seem like standup people. I'm very pleased with the customer service from the other workers. Fried chicken 4pc: Just the right price, but I would have preferred more seasoning, or longer marinade. The meat was very pleasantly juicy. Wing was overcooked.Hush puppies: ExcellentCollard greens: I've had them twice. The first time was good, the second time was gritty. Like they weren't washed thoroughly. Flavor was good, and I wouldn't say no to a few tomatoes inside to even out the texture.Ribs: Meaty, but also very fatty and bland to my taste.Catfish po boy: Excellent flavor, but the catfish was cooked much too dry for a sandwich, so it was crispy to the point of it cutting my mouth a bit. I'm going to go back and try some of the other things on the menu. I live less than a mile away, I really want this place to work out as my go-to place, and I love supporting a local business where you get to see the owner as face of the company. This is my experience."
"I often write longer reviews but let's just do the Cliffs Notes version today:Fried potatoes: crunchy, but needed more seasoningFried chicken: nice texture, but also needed seasoningBaked Beans: a little sweet, the way I like themChili: Filling and savory, but nothing excitingPrices: Excellent. I think we paid less than $13 for two of us for lunchService: Very friendlySuper clean and nice people, but I wasn't amazed by the food. I might be willing to try other things they have on the menu, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
"I was very excited while watching the construction take place for Mothercluckers. I work right next door, and knew that I would be in there often. I sat in the office over the last several weeks watching some of my co-workers come in and out with their boxes of Ribs and chicken, and it smelled so good I decided today is the day. I called in my order and then walked over to pick it up. True to my own nature I ordered off menu. I really wanted a Pork chop Sandwich, but I also really wanted Po boy sandwich. Eureka!  I asked if I could have a Pork chop Po Boy, so I could enjoy it on buttery Po boy bread along with the spicy Remoulade sauce. They gave it to me no problem. Let me tell you, Freaking phenomenal!!!  PUT IT ON THE MENU!! PORK-CHOP PO BOY!!!"
Great food and atmosphere bbq chicken sandwich was the bomb. Definitely going back.the hush puppies were fantastic
"Clam chowder was great. Fries were excellent. But the pulled pork I think came from a plastic tub they got at Jewel. Clearly not made there. I'll be back, but I'll try something different."
"Visited Mother Cluckers 3/26, and I will most definitely be back. It's located in a spot where I have seen many restaurants come and go; and I have to say I hope Mother Clucker's occupies that corner for many years to come. The staff greeted me and my girlfriend with a hearty welcome as we arrived. They helped me decide on a dish and helped my vegetarian girlfriend find something that would work for her too. They checked up on us to ensure everything was great and to see if there was anything else they could do. I felt like a regular the entire time I was there. I cannot wait to go back and eat there again. Don't trust the bad reviews complaining and just saying the food was, ""too salty"". Seriously dude? grow some taste buds."
"They took a pie sliced shape space that hasn't had a decent restaurant in years and seem to be on track to be a winner. Have come back 3 times from our first take out and they haven't disappointed. Limited menu choices but the execution is great for a little neighborhood place. Sandwiches,chicken and ribs have all been really tasty."
"Very good! Chicken was tender, breading also tasteful. Sides were all good, cole slaw, baked beans, broasted potatoes. Got Hush Puppies also, nice alternative to biscuits. The place looked clean and the people that worked there were friendly and very nice. It will be our new place to go to for Broasted Chicken. Can't wait to try some more items on the menu."
"My dad just got out of the hospital and wanted a special treat for dinner, so we got two 4-piece chicken meals.  Everything was outstanding!  The chicken was so moist and tender and I even ate the skin... I never eat the skin!   The sides were really good.. cheesy mashed potatoes, mac & cheese with bacon, buttery biscuit, and I even got some bonus roasted potatoes thrown in my box.  I wasn't even that hungry but couldn't stop eating!  The 4 piece meal was $8.99 and totally worth every penny.   The food was perfectly seasoned and not salty.   Service was fast too.  I waited maybe 5 minutes for my take out order.The restaurant itself is really clean and decorative.  All the tables and everything are brand new.  There is a freshly paved parking lot in the back that can be easily accessed from either Foster or Elston.   The employees were super nice and friendly and constantly asking customers if everything was okay or if they could get them anything else.  Honestly the only negative thing was they put the wrong sides in our chicken boxes but really, that's no big deal.  They also could have some music or TV's.. it was kind of quiet in there.  But hey, they just opened 2 weeks ago!I'm dying to try a Po Boy sandwich.  I think I'll be back this weekend. I would have taken photos but we ate everything too fast... LOL"
"First impression: The menu looks great. Collards are on the menu. Prices are reasonable. Ordered takeout: broasted chicken with a side of collards and mac & cheese.It's not the best or worst chicken... somewhere in the middle... more seasoning needed for sure.The collards were on the sweet side. I'm from the south and our greens aren't sweet. It along with the mac & cheese needed more seasoning. I was hoping for some ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness, but it was let down. The meal came with a biscuit but for some reason it wasn't included in my order. Bummer on top of the tiny sides.-1 star for seasoning-1 star for an incomplete order-1 star for  tiny sides+1 for friendly service.3 stars! The people were friendly, the place is clean, and it's close to home. I'll cut them some slack since it's their first week."
"First time here, and let me tell ya! Words cannot describes the deliciousness of this combo meal! I ordered the ribs and chicken combo!"
I am so happy this place opened up.  I live in the area and will definitely make this one of my regular spots.We ordered to go over the phone and the food was ready in about 10 minutes.  We ordered the 12 piece chicken - very good.  We also had biscuits - also very good.  The large sides that came with it were smaller than I expected but it ended up being enough food for 4 people.  We had the collard greens which were delicious as well as the baked beans which were also delicious.  The mac and cheese was good but not my favorite.  The place was cozy inside with a nice clean interior and a few couples eating in with beer - looks like they give you an ice bucket to keep it cold in - nice touch.  BYOB.
"New place in the neighborhood. You walk in and instanly your eyes are fixed on the cool bbq signs, rt 66, and  fishing photos on the walls that look like drift wood.  Rich the owner is a musician so theres lots of blues music playing in the background.  So you walk up to the counter and look at the menu full of goodness. Bbq ribs, broasted chicken, shrimp, catfish to name a few. Plenty of sides mac & cheese, backed beans, collard greens etc... the sandwich menu is also extensive fron Po boys to skirt steak. Its BYOB so bring your favorite beer sit down eat great food and enjoy the music!! Small not tiny cool new BBQ place that I encourage you to come and support.  Ill be back either to sit and eat or carry out."
"Ordered take out for lunch yesterday. I had the Sriracha Chicken Bites Basket with Corn Cobbettes and Collard Greens. It was really good. The chicken bites were crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside. They had just the right amount of heat, and were delicious dipped in the accompanying sauce (which wasn't sriracha but it had some spice). Great value for $8.I'm glad this restaurant is in the area. I'll be coming back!"
"Stopped in one day a couple of weeks ago after driving by this place about 50 times. I love good fried chicken and am always on the lookout for a good place up north, even though I only eat it a few times a year. The wife likes to keep me away from the fried stuff. Anyway, a coworker and I went in for lunch and I wasn't disappointed. I had a two piece with a side of mac and cheese, greens and hush puppies.The chicken was good. Not great but good. It had a nice crispy skin and the meat was very juicy. My only criticism was that it was a little under seasoned. Not a minor thing, but not enough to keep from going back. The mac and cheese was pretty good too. The cheese sauce was a little starchy, as if the they made it with flour base that was a little under cooked. Had pretty good flavor though. The greens were allright. I'm not a huge greens fan, but I like my greens simple. These tasted like they cooked them in hot sauce. I didn't really like that. The hush puppies were absolutely on point. No complaints about those at all. The star of this whole show, however was the bread pudding. One of the best I have ever had. Sweet, but not too sweet as bread puddings some time tends to be. I don't think I need to try another dessert there. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely go back to try some of the other menu items. I am glad this place is here. Can't wait to try it again with a couple of nice cold ones. I don't want to forget to mention that the owner was very nice. He came out to check on us and was interested in how we were doing and how everything was going. I hope he keeps up this type of interaction."
"Biscuits and gravy was such a treat and very delicious!  Want to come back for BBQ, the menu looks so yummy!!!!"
"Great broasted chicken, pretty yummy sides and awesome customer service. Fish tacos are delicious as well."
Really excited to see this new spot open in my neighborhood. Had to try their pulled pork sandwich and I gotta say it was well above average! Great coleslaw on the side with a bit of spicy kick into it as well. Small and cozy joint where you will be welcomed by a friendly stuff with a great attitude.
Just had the shrimp po boy for the first time.  Outstanding.  I might go back later for a second!  Very friendly service.  Can't wait to try the ribs.
Mother Cluckers is now serving Breakfast! I just returned home from Mother Cluckers and just had to write a review for the amazing Breakfast my Husband and I had. I was thrilled to see my favorite Breakfast item Biscuits and gravy on the menu. It did not disappoint. Served piping hot the flavor was so good. Hands down the best I have had ever.  Huge portion had to bring some home. The eggs and home style potatoes were both delicious as well. My Husband really enjoyed his steak and eggs. We are so happy to have our favorite local dinner spot now serving Breakfast. The ambiance is great we really liked the decorations and especially the music! We keep coming back not only for the food but the excellent service. The owners and staff here are so friendly and the service is outstanding. We are proud to have Mother Cluckers in our neighborhood and we keep coming back. Did I mention its also BYOB! Yes just another reason why we go here. The Breakfast hours right now are Saturday and Sundays 7:00 AM-12:00 PM
"Outstanding! We clucking love this place! The flavors and selection here -- ribs, Po Boys, pulled pork, broasted chicken -- are just not available in/around Forest Glen. The collared greens and beans are amazing, tho don't skip the slaw either. On top of that, you have owners here who deeply care about you and your food. It feels like home -- if your home does all that AND streams killer blues/roots with ambient lighting and a cozy vibe.Congrats Rich and Penny! You've made something special here. Can't wait to come back."
"I ate with friends yesterday and two of the three food orders were great.  The pork chop sandwich and fried chicken sandwiches were huge and very flavorful.  The Reuben was on panini, not rye, the meat was overcooked and served barely warm.  The beans and greens were seasoned nicely but the fries were cold, greasy, a little burned and sat on the counter quite awhile before being served.  Since the food is pricey for lunch, at least there should be more condiment choices.Staff was pleasant, helpful and attentive but the kitchen was slow and appeared distracted.  If the establishment works out their kinks they should be worthy of 4.5 stars."
"I got the grilled chicken sandwich and a ""side"" of Mac and cheese. The grilled chicken sandwich was ok, nothing special. The ""side"" of Mac and cheese was more like a ""bite"" of Mac and cheese. Tasted fine, but came in a container maybe three times the size of a to go condiment (see picture). $1.80 for a bite of Mac and cheese - come on!!!My wife got the chicken tenders and fries, which were very good and reasonably sized, which is why we gave this place four stars.We'll be going back, but only for the chicken tenders and fries.Also, ownership was very friendly and they did a great job with the renovation - looks great inside and out."
We were disappointed with the quality of the food especially after hearing good reviews. I don't know if they had an off day yesterday (3/28) but all the food we ordered was extremely salty.
"We were staying in Rosemont and couldn't find any restaurants with good reviews. We decided to make the short trip here and it was a great decision!The place is smaller than I expected, we had a large group so we had to sit with tables by each other. The food was awesome! Everyone in our party got different things and everyone was happy. My husband said that the ribs were the best he's ever had and I ordered seconds of the coleslaw! The mac and cheese was the only thing we didn't love. The owner was very friendly and always checked to make sure that we were happy with everything. The bread pudding was awesome, the owner told us that one of his employees shared the recipe and he ended up using it. I will be back even though this is not too close to home!"
"I'm really sorry to write a 2 star review for a local business, but I've ordered chicken, hush puppies, and collared greens at least three times here and I've had the same exact problems with each order:1. The chicken was way overdone. I'm seeing a lot of people saying ""juicy"" in the reviews here, but each of the three times I've had it, my chicken has been bone dry. It was so dry last time that my wife and I couldn't even finish our dinner.  I don't know if I keep catching them at an off time or what, but I have not had anything close to juicy chicken here.2. Each time, some of the hush puppies were mushy in the center. Maybe the oil is too hot? They taste really good, but biting into one to discover that the center is soggy ruins it for me.3. The collard greens, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, are gritty. It really seems like there is sand in them. I'd say every third bite or so I'd feel some grit in my teeth. You need to wash greens carefully! Also, they haven't tasted right. They're bitter and acidic, and maybe they have too much hot sauce in them. Too much garlic? Too many stems? Overcooked? I'm not sure, but again, I couldn't finish them the last time I ordered and had to throw them out.I really hate to leave a bad review, but when I lose my appetite for (somewhat expensive) fried chicken, there is clearly a problem. I would encourage the management to do some quality checks during off-peak hours."
Good food and great price. Loved the greens! I would definitely eat here again.
"So I really, really wanted to like this place.  I drive past it every day.  The folks are real nice,  but the food was not so good. I ordered the 2-piece chicken  ""snack,"" which was a lot of food.  The high point was the chicken which was pretty good,  but not amazing as others have suggested.  The sides were sad,  and that is what lost me. First,  the mac and cheese was barely Luke warm and it just did not taste right.  The fries were so-so, but also were not super hot and crispy. The worst was the biscuit which was stale and chewy. I stretched a 2-star into a 3-star because I really want them to succeed, the people are nice and the place is very cute inside. But they need to have fresher and hotter food.  Clearly this was a reheat or heat-lamp gone bad.  I hope I was the rare one to have this experience."
"Very good  food, Rich, the owner is a great host. The broasted chicken was excellent.Check it out."
"we stopped here for breakfast this morning and all i have to say is OMG. the best breakfast we have had in long time. Eggs cooked perfectly, southern potatoes excellent. Bacon cooked the way we love them and a little surprise fresh fruit on the side. All so good we could have stayed forever and kept eating. Do yourself a favor a stop in for the breakfast only available on saturdays and sundays but so worth the wait."
