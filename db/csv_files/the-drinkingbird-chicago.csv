The Drinkingbird
"One of my favorite bars in the city. Laid-back speakeasy type feel to it. Friendly bartenders who make damn good drinks. Amazing Old Fashioneds. Beer selection is on point, too. (1/2 price draughts on Sundays!)Changed their menu a few months back and got rid of the chicken BLT which was a game-changer, but the new menu is still pretty good. Pool table in back, too. Hard to go wrong with this spot."
Came in not knowing what I was in for. I started with their old fashioned. Very well made. Generally prefer an OF that gives a great balance between flavor of the spirit that follows with the hint of sweet. Great stuff. Moved onto ordering the burger of the month.... Floored. Simply incredible. One of the if not THE best burger I have ever had. You can tell they pay attention to detail and have honed in their craft. Still floored. I'd give 10 stars if I could. More than worth a visit.
"Like most of the other Yelpers, came here after a delicious dinner at Pequod's. Loved the vibe of this place: dark, great music, and fun for groups or couples. We only had one drink, and I honestly can't remember what I had, so I'm assuming it was nothing to write home about. All in all, I'd definitely come here again next time I'm in the area."
"When I was a kid, my very elderly aunt had a pet bird that continuously chirped, bit people, and was just a little asshole... I *HATED* it! The DrinkingBird is his polar opposite - a semi-quiet environment, super cool staff, and cocktails that can never make you think this establishment has asshole tendencies. The vibe is chic and dim - perfect for a date. However, I came with three other ladies and found it to be a good spot for singles too. It's in a good area, next to pequod's (if you're looking for a carb overload of cheesy ass pizza goodness before/after your drinks).I got the Whiskey drink that came with a dark, super sweet cherry (don't remember the name but see my pic). It was so, so good! Almost as good as Longman and Eagle's which has been pretty hard to beat in my book. Overall, I really, really liked this bird. Chirp on over there and flap your tipsy wings, my friends. Cheers."
"I was going to watch a movie and had some time to kill and decided To stop in for a drink. My boyfriend and I shared a flat bread as an appetizer which was good and both had the house burger . The house burger was very good ! The drinks were even better ! We both had the Su novia , it was really strong and delicious with hints of cucumber . We then we had the zombie killer which was awesome ! I would definitely visit again if I was in the area !"
"The Drinkingbird is hiding in plain sight, and I love that the place is fairly empty on Tuesdays, as the $10 burger/fries/beer special warms the heart.  (Of course, I'm sure that the business owners would like to see a bigger crowd on Tuesday...)  The burger comes topped with bacon, a fairly unique form of cheddar cheese and some special sauce (the menu says it is jam), and the fries were served with some shredded parmesan on top.  They were a little overcooked, but otherwise great.  Paired this with the Eliot Ness beer from the draft list...yessir.  The space is dark, definitely has the feel of coming from another era, love the bartender who has been there both last night and in my previous visit.  Of course, the playlist helped; I don't hear Lyrics Born's ""I Changed My Mind"" remix too often (off the ""Same *&^%, Different Day"" album), so that made it all worth it.Great spot to hit when Pequod's is crushed on a Tuesday and you want to see a movie at the Regal afterwards, since Tuesday flicks are only $6.50 at Regal.  You're welcome!"
"Great place for some delicious cocktails. They make a great Pimms cup. Not the place to go to go to if you want to watch any kind of sports....they rarely have their tv on and when we asked them to put on something, we were given a look like we weren't supposed to be asking such a thing...."
Cocktails are delicious! Try Connect the Dots if you like Jameson. The people are also really friendly. I was sitting in there waiting to have pizza at Pequod's so didnt order any food.
Awsome drinks nice people and good food this is not a pick up joint its chill ask for  sammy hes the man
"Love this bar! The ambiance, the interesting drink menu, the bartender, all were perfect. A little pricey, but the cocktails are the perfect balance of fancy but not intimidating."
"I have given this place at least a half dozen tries and I am done with it despite immensely convenient location. Every time I have left this place my hangover screams cheap booze and my wallet screams bankruptcy. I like good food and good drink and don't mind paying for it, unfortunately while you certainly pay for it, it's just plain not good. The service is consistently atrocious and the food is just not good, they can screw up a burger which is just plain hard to do.."
"We came here for a late dinner on a weeknight.  Seemed like a great spot for a date if you were local, loved the music, and wanted to get tipsy.  But the food/menu were limited and not good.  Few/no healthy options.  Fries were a highlight.  Best for drinking, not eating"
"This is an old-school Sinatra, gold-seated lounge bar. The first thing I noticed is that the Drinking Bird is one of the cleanest bars I've seen in awhile while I was shocked to find out it is 3 yrs old too. The ambience is classy rat pack with a touch of contemporary just to remind you didn't enter a dive.Other than that, it's a no-nonsense, great music, fine craft drink establishment.  A multitude of micro brews on tap as well as bartender suggested drinks. Bartenders are conversational, knowledgeable, and attentive given I came mid-day thurs. I can see this place being a good date joint at night as well. Custom Drinking Bird match packs, neon DB front bar light, and DB drink doilies are all great touches.  This is a joint I would go out of my way to hang out. Next to Pequod's to boot!"
Awesome bar with a very relaxed vibe.  The bar manager Chris is great!  Not only does he really know his stuff and is able to recommend some great drinks but he's also super friendly.  He even recommended other bars to visit while we were in town.  All the bars he suggested were spot on to what we were looking for!  We had a great time in Chicago and are glad we stopped into this bar :)
"I probably should come back here and have another experience before reviewing the place, but if I ever do return I'll just update it. The place itself is really cool, intimate, and has awesome music. Situated right across from the theater, it's in a great location for a pre- or post- movie drink or meal. My roommate and I came for a late dinner before an even later movie and were excited to try out the cocktails and charcuterie and cheese plate, until she realized she forgot her ID which is always awkward... So I just ordered beer (from their fairly extensive draft and bottle list). Our waitress was super slow and didn't seem to make serving a priority. She also had no idea what was on the charcuterie plate for that evening which was a bigger delay... We also ordered the kale salad to share. The figs, goat cheese, and pistachios went really well with the vinaigrette dressing and I probably could've eaten a whole salad myself. Luckily we had a heaping pile of meat and cheese and pickled veggies with grilled bread on the table to enjoy as well. There was a spicy sausage, a more mild sausage, a cheddar cheese and another unknown type--because no one bothered to let us know. It also took me about 5 tries to flag down our waitress, who seemed to just be sprinting by our table each time she passed, just to order another drink, which I ended up having to chug really fast to make the movie on time. All in all the food and drinks and music are great here, but the service is just really lacking in efficiency and friendliness."
"We came here for drinks after dinner.  It took us awhile to get settled, and the waitress wasn't too friendly until our group started to dwindle down as people left for the night.  I understand that a group of eight walking into a bar can be a little overwhelming.  That being sad, the drinks were good and the bar seemed nice.  I'd like to go back again with just the boyfriend next time.  I'd be interested in trying the food.  A group nearby ordered quite a bit and it smelled good."
Stopped in here for a drink on a Saturday night while waiting for a table at Pequod's next door. This bar is a really cool space and has a great vibe inside. We grabbed a table by the open window which was awesome. They have a really nice cocktail and beer menu and our server was very friendly. We didn't stay long because our table next door was ready sooner than expected but I enjoyed my beer and the server cashed us out really quickly.I would love to come back again for longer!
"Ah yes, the magnificent Drinkingbird - my favorite kind of bird.Actually, my favorite kind of bird is probably the bald eagle, but my favorite retro booze-related bird is, hands down, the Drinkingbird.  My date and I arrived on the early side of a Friday night, and we snagged a red booth in the way back, beside a pool table and lit fireplace.  We later learned that this nice little back room can be reserved for private parties (noted!).  There's also a deck that I suspect gets packed in the summer time. We started with an Old Fashioned (Rittenhouse 100, Demerara, Angostura bitters, cherry bark, vanilla bitters - with cherry and citrus garnish).  This cocktail beat the pants off of any Old Fashioned I've ever attempted to make, and it's probably the best I've ever had.  My following cocktail choices include the Reverend Mother (red wine, cognac, cardomom, cinnamon, cloves, citrus, simple / almond / cherry syrup - served hot), and the El Diablo (Tequila, creme de cassis, lime and ginger beer).  The Revered Mother was just too sweet for my liking, but the El Diablo was a nice, crisp follow up. I sampled a variety of appetizers: fried olives, polenta, and the croquettes (mushroom, chicken, and yam/marshmallow) - the croquettes, specifically the yam/marshmallow, were the most tasty.  I really enjoyed this place - the old school atmosphere, the top notch cocktails, and the service.  Our waiter was so nice and friendly. Side note:  I loved the red & gold women's restroom - so glam!"
"This place is THE BEST. Tasty food, incredible drinks, great ambience, and good service. We came here for some apps and drinks before a movie across the street but would have stay and lingered for hours if we had been able. I usually prefer beer over cocktails but these are not to be missed, and are extremely affordable when it comes to drinks in the city. We ordered the crabcakes, the sausage (served with charred bread, spreads, etc.), and half an order of the mac n' cheese. All were delicious and just enough to act as dinner for two.Really doesn't get better than this; already excited to go back soon."
"Stopped in on a slow Monday evening.  No matter, Sammy was quick to greet us and help us out.  Very friendly and not hovering.  Was looking for something delicious and new.  Great website that listed all the menus items and specials.   Can it get better than a Dickel and Shlitz? HA.  Decided to try a handful of the small plates and each one was great.  Wings, Parmesan Frites, Bacon wrapped dates and Mac and Cheese.  Great presentation and the presentation delivered.  I cant wait to try the rest of the menu.      A good place to hang with friends.  Pool table in the back.  The only trouble is parking and less than obvious signage.  Corner of Clybourn and Webster.  You will find it.  I will be back."
Good atmosphere. The hot toddy was something new to try. Great place to grab a cocktail.
"Just stopped in for a few beers. Great bartenders, awesome music, overall fun feel. Will def be back to try some food!"
"OMG what a hidden gem! My fiancé and I came here on a Sunday night before catching a movie. We ignorantly thought we would go to Pequod's but the wait was undesirable. So we stumbled in here instead. I really like the decor. I like mad men and chevron patterns, so I was into the mod-60's vibe. They had a little patio in the back that was nice too. It was half priced beers, so our beers cost $3. Always down for cheap beer! The food was bomb! I got the Waldorf sandwich and frites. The frites had Parmesan cheese melted on them-yum! And the sandwich had the perfect balance of savory and tart flavors! My fiancé got the Mac n cheese which had four types of cheese. So good! Service was good too! All in all, those folks who come and have a drink here while waiting for a table at Pequod's, should just drop the light up buzzer and eat here instead!"
"They've lost a star. Ever since they updated their menu, it's not the same. They even stopped smoking their pineapple base for piña coladas. They removed some favorites from the food menu, and that's just sad."
"This bar has a cool style and a really tasty old-fashioned! The menu is a little unorthodox but everything we've ordered has been awesome, especially the burgers! I love the classy 50's vibe and the jazz/funk/blues they play.There's also a pool table in back and the bartenders are great. It's a cool stop on your way to or from the movie theater across the street!"
"Burger. Of. The. Month. What!?!? Amazing burger, great frites, friendly staff. Couldn't have asked for a better place to fill my belly."
"Stopped in for dinner and drinks and had the $10 burger and beer special, which is an amazing deal. The burger was so good, cooked perfectly and came with fries. They had a great craft beer selection, too. After watching the bartender mix some drinks we had to order a cocktail. The old fashioned was outstanding and the su novia was really unique and tasty. Both the bartenders were very friendly and welcoming. We'll definitely be back to see Jillian as she was outstanding!"
APerfectSpot to waitFor a tableAt Pequod. The beers and cocktails were good.
I love a good bar but this place is just alright. The pool table in the back of this place is  a nice place to hang out. The drinks are not that good though. Just grab a drink that you're familiar with (bottled or tap - steer clear of the 'specialty' drinks) and chill in the back.
"This joint has slowly but surely become my default date spot in Lincoln Park. Besides being one of the most cleverly and tactfully decorated bars in Chicago, the drinks are top notch. The bar caters to just about anyone. The retro 1950's/60's decor is really cool - complete with awesome neon signs, mood lighting, and cool bar stools and tables. A TV also lets the sports fan catch the game at the bar. The cocktails are my favorite part - the list is simple and not too long, so those who are undecided can quickly make up their minds. For those who want to order off menu, the bartenders know their shit and have been able to make anything I ask for. The wait is not long and the place is never too packed. Specials are also great, with half-off craft cocktails on one night, split of champagne and oysters for $12 on another night, etc. I would try the food, but who are we kidding, I usually end up eating at Pequod's on the same trip as the Drinkingbird."
Came in at 1a m.. let's just say friendly and awesome service by MR. SAMMIE.. He makes awesome drinks! Had a St. George ' s phate and a milk punch! I will be coming back :] atmosphere is chill with the likes of hip hop..non radio.thank god!
"Good times. A very chill spot, not too crowded, and a very extensive list of alcohol. Was able to sit in here and have a conversation and a few drinks without yelling at each other over the din of TV or other people"
"I like this place, and would definitely make it my hang out. However, I wouldn't call these guys Mixologist. I've been spoiled by the inventive, daring, and delicious cocktails I've had in NYC.When asked to duplicate; they either didn't have the ingredients and/or just didn't know how to make it. I would strongly recommend they take a look at the menu from Second Floor On Clinton, DeSantos, and Employees Only."
Sunday night was a success here. Came for a late night drink before catching a late movie and the ambiance was great. The cocktails are awesome and the bartenders were attentive even with how busy they were. Su novia was so good I would have gotten another one but we had to go.Definitely coming back for more drinks. By the way parking was hard to find though.
"I did not have the food but the drinks art great. A super chill vibe inside -- the decor is up to date, clean bathrooms and a fun pool table in the back that takes $ bills now. We sat at the bar and the bartender were very attentive. Definitely check it out!"
"I feel like this place is either a hidden gem or the sucky service keeps people away. My friends and I easily got a table on a Friday night, but the place emptied out after an hour or so. I loved the retro decor and my awesome Pimm's Cup, but our server was super slow and rarely checked on us. I sat for almost a half hour with an empty glass while she ignored us. One tip: stay away from the Miss Noma. It sounds delicious but tastes like an ashtray!The food looks pretty good and I wouldn't mind coming for the whiskey and wing night!"
"I am seriously thinking about tatooeing (?) the drinkingbird -bird and martini symbol- on my wrist ...no joke! Have been to this place like..a BILLION times because we always go to the movies at the regal across the street and afterwards we need to put some alcohol down in order to feel like adults again. No sense whatsoever.Drinks are cute and delicious, there's something about their old fashioned because it is a very popular drink and everyone orders that.  I wanted one but J said it was too strong for me. boo. This time we ordered some clams,...or oysters? I think they were actually mussels.  YEP, asked my husband and they were mussels! Oh my! so deliciously delicious. The Drinkingbird has specials M-Thu, so it is the puuuuurfect spot to come around with that girlfriend of yours and kill some time, while enjoying some good cheap deal and listening to some music. :) The bar has a retro mood, or should I say.. wannabe sophisticated? I don't know.  It's not a lounge, a sports bar, nor a dive bar.  Far from a pub, although with beer on tap, still...not a pub... I don't know what it is, you should go check it out."
"A nice place, good funk music, the service is attentive as well, the prices are fair, easy to find a table considering that it is a Saturday night!!!"
"Chirp, Chirp!I'm singing the praise of The Drinkingbird. This space has changed a TON since its days as Flounders. I was almost shocked I was standing in the same spot that used to be such a down and dirty dive that I once was locked inside the bathroom for over thirty minutes before someone could repair the broken ladies room door handle from the outside. Prison potties be gone at The Dbird! Let's all use the restroom with confidence! Thanks be to the makeover, The Drinkingbird is now a hip, cool, throwback style lounge. The menu is chockfull of vintage and modern craft cocktails (helloooo Pimms Cup). The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. And the back room is such a stylish little hideaway. Yep, that room is definitely where it's at. It has a very fabulous Mad Man vibe replete with swanky fireplace, big booths and a brand new billiards table. This is where the cool kids hang and vibe out with their old fashioned's out. But wait! There's more! Just off this room is their awesome beer garden! Well appointed and spacious, there's nothing better than chillaxing with your beverage of choice here.The Drinkingbird has really cleaned up this space and transformed what was a bit of a hazard into something cool and quite zippy in the neighborhood. Yes, the DBird is all things lovely. I'm flying high after my visit here."
"Cocktails are on point for the price, beer selection (both bottled and on tap) is great.  Atmosphere and decor are cool.  Nice long bar to sit at.  Love this place!Also I, or should I say my wife, appreciates the free matches on the bartop.  We keep them in the bathroom..."
"I went here one time after visiting webster's wine bar, and it was one of the worst customer service experiences in my life. The server was so incredibly rude, that we decided to leave and call it an early night. I have never encountered such a rude individual. It almost seemed like he was just trying to be mean. I will not be coming back here, and I will be telling my friends to stay away!"
"I have not tried the food here yet, only the drinks. I do like the vibe because it has a retro look and feel, almost like what they call today ""mid century modern!"" The stools are old fashioned leather or ""pleather"" and that is done on purpose. The drinks are well made and effort is put in to have a creative drink menu but also get traditional cocktails done right. I will come back again to try the food!"
The bartender was completely unaware we were even there for the first few minutes (even though there were only about 5 other people at the bar...looking at other reviews this seems to be a trend).  He did notice the guest who walked up to the bar 5 minutes after us though. I finally flagged him down for a drink.  He then made about 4 other drinks first.  I think the barback eventually made them. It literally took 25 minutes from when we sat down until we got our drinks.  Such a turn off to someone so uninterested in their job. The only redeeming thing about this place was the old fashioned which was pretty stellar.
"I had a party here Saturday night with around 35 people. I was able to easily book the back room , which was wonderful. It felt private, yet not too secluded. The fire place and pool table pull it together to make it feel very warm and welcoming, and overall, the room was a good size for the amount of people that arrived. The reason I deducted a star is because, although the food is great, the share-ables comes in small portions and are a little pricey...so when ordering appetizers for a large group of people, they didn't last very long. Also, the staff wasn't quite on top of providing plates or napkins for the group, so it was a little awkward to eat some of the messy dishes (wings, for example). But, they were delicious. The food is very tasty and the cocktails are mixed well.The ambiance is great, with a nice 60s, yet chic vibe. The music is loungy and chill. This is a great date spot or laid-back hangout with friends. It felt prefect for my large group."
"The Drinkingbird is one of my favorite restaurants in the nation! The service is stellar and the food is killer. Great drinks too! I wish there was one in my hometown! I love the bacon wrapped, cheese stuffed dates! Super delicious!"
"When I had difficulty deciding on a drink (nothing on the cocktail menu really appealed to me), the bartender suggested a cassis cocktail (liqueur made from black currants).The cassis cocktail was fruity and tasted like a cocktail should!  No sweet and sour, no sugary soda mixers, none of that stuff got involved.  My cocktail was $8, and it was definitely worth it.  I would have likely paid $5 more at any of the fancy cocktail bars in the city.The bartender was friendly and checked in on us a few times but didn't linger unnecessarily either.The atmosphere was more of an upscale watering hole for locals than an upscale swanky cocktail lounge.  The bar stools are surprisingly comfortable.  On a Sunday in the early evening, it wasn't crowded at all.  And that little bird mascot is simply adorable.But, really, ""famous for nothing""?  It's cute.  It's kitsch.  But it's kind of true.  My cassis cocktail was REALLY good, and I give tons of credit to that bartender.  Drinkingbird is strikingly similar to Scofflaw with the cocktail menu and prices, and they both seem to be trying to accomplish the dark ""speakeasy"" feel.Supposedly the place is haunted, or at least that is what we were told during our Weird Chicago Haunted Tour.  At this Lincoln Park spot you can drink spirits and feel 'em too."
"How cute is this place? Well, it's adorable. The cocktails are strong and really good, a few bucks goes a long way here. They also have a variety of tasty little appetizers and dishes. A great place to come for a snack and drink before a movie at the Webster theater. Definitely will be back!"
"Man, this place is great. The food is wonderful, the cocktails are well crafted, and the atmosphere and the people who work there are superb. We came on a Thursday night around 8pm and it was pretty dead - handfuls of people here and there. I seriously wonder why, though, with how great the food was and our amazing drinks. That bartender is a saint - and the artisan bitters on the counter show his worth!Our only complaint was that our waiter took a little too long to pick up the check, so we ended up paying at the bar. But when I looked, it's because he was busy washing dishes, so I'll cut him some slack.Overall great deals with a rotating menu, cocktails to die for, and a laid back 60's lounge atmosphere make The Drinkingbird a winner. Be sure to keep the cute postcards they attach to your tab - they look very vintage and are mailable!"
My drink was AMAZING... and Sammy was the most hospitable host.  That kid has jokes for days!
"I had heard of this place, just from Yelp suggesting it and I thought it sounded cool.  So my birthday was this past weekend and I decided I wanted everyone to meet there for some drinks and a few appetizers.  They were so helpful and quick at responding to emails when I inquired about saving a few bar top tables for my group of 15-18.  We had a waitress that was just ours and she was so attentive.  The atmosphere was just what we wanted too-cool drinks, chill vibe and room to talk and hang out.  There's also a bigger room in the back and a pool table! My group had a blast and people were very happy about my choice to go there and multiple friends said they planned to go back regularly."
A bit pricey but the bar's environment is great. The bartenders were very knowledgeable about liquor and drink combos.
"I had a terrible experience here. I had a foreign friend in town and the bartender made a huge deal about her foreign ID. Dude, if you don't want to serve her, fine, then say so. Don't throw a hissy fit, serve us drinks, and then treat us like crap. Thirty minutes later they are shutting the bar down - turning on the lights and turning off the music and yelling down the bar for us to leave. As we try to gulp down our drinks and leave with a shred of dignity, we pass by at least six of the bartender's friends at the bar still hanging out. One of them gives us a ""Have a nice night."" I used to really like this place but someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed... and I will not be returning or recommending."
"Specials are great..Burger Tuesday is a good reason to stop by, but, Jilian is the real reason we come back. She provides, great service, always friendly, and gives the place extra spirit.  Seriously, she has given great drink recommendations and has remembered what we like. Stop there for a drink visit with Jilian. (Giving 5 stars..because of Jilian.). Oh they also have a patio..and a pool table.."
Waiting on Pequod's for pizza and this is the bar next door. Had a porter vanilla. Good beer & pool tables.
"I adore this place- the bartenders (Chris and Sammy) were attentive, kind, witty, and excellent at their craft. Food was exactly what I needed it to be- fresh, tasty, and able to be the perfect balance for whatever cocktail I was sippin'. The music and atmosphere were perfect for a Saturday night on the town...this is definitely a quality establishment and you should not be afraid to try it out if you are in the area!Good job, Drinkingbird, you are my new favorite spot when I am in the Windy City!"
"I stumbled upon this gem called Drinkingbird. I immediately felt like I was thrown into an episode of Mad Men. I love the decor and feel of this restaurant/bar.     As a vegetarian, I was surprised to find delicious options like the veggie meatloaf. They change their food menu often and everything is creatively prepared. The cocktails they craft are very good also. I'm able to try something new and unique every time.     The back room and patio make this an excellent hangout spot year round. I would recommend this place for date night or a nice evening with friends."
"I was really surprised with The Drinkingbird.  I figured they would have good cocktails, which they do, but i didn't think the food would be top notch as well.  I had their burger and it was delicious.  I'm very critical when it comes to burgers and I don't give the thumbs up very often.  It was cooked how I wanted it and the flavor of the meat itself was great - juicy and savory.  The toppings and cheese were fresh and complimented the meat well.  For drinks, I had a Pimms Cup which was refreshingly delicious and an Old Fashioned, which was one of the better ones I've had.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Overall, The Drinkingbird is a great place for dinner and drinks and I recommend checking it out.  I'll definitely be back."
"Atmosphere is cool and the staff is super friendly. Food is taste but kind of pricy for what you get. Spent too much money to leave hungry. One think that always bothers me but I pretend not to notice is details, not quite wiped down tables and smudges on glassware... I don't want to be that person, but its pretty simple to clean a glass properly. Will give it another try though, particularily when the patio opens."
"The Thursday night specials drew me in. Looking for a place I haven't visited and this was the half way point for meeting up with a few friends. The $7 cocktails and $2 PBR made for a good combination. Start with the liquor first, obviously.Fries and croquettes were summoned for something to munch on while slurping down those delicious cocktails. The fries are legit so do yourself a favor. The Old Fashion was right on the money. One of the better ones I have experienced in a while. The bar keep also whipped up a Manhattan, which isn't very difficult, but it was well balanced. Hats off.Our server was pleasant and tended to our needs. No need to wave her down or wonder if she had taken a 30 minute cig break. Pleased for sure. No experience of the smugness or discontent with the staff. This is a place to enjoy the company you are with and the drink in front of you. The dimly lit front room is relaxed and the booths in the back lends itself to some seclusion. There are two TVs situated above the bar and that's it. They did have the Blackhawks game on but it was definitely an after thought. Just steer clear if you are looking to to drink shitty draft beer and watch a game. Speaking of which the rail featured a nice selection of drafts if PBR doesn't do it for you.Three people, 4 rounds each, croquettes, and fries for around $75 (one straggler had a couple beers). You can't beat that for a Thursday night. But we were left wanting to finish up both the sporting events so down the the street to Zella's to cap off the night."
Great selection of beers & nice ambiance!
"Came here for the Old Fashioned and same grub, wasn't disappointed with either. The drink was very good, and I believe I ended up eating a burger with fries. If I remember correctly, the fries were pretty crunchy and amazing. The place is smaller than I thought even though it has seating in the back, but its a great date night location.One of our glasses mysteriously fell off the table even though no one touched it, which was odd. Apart from that everything went smoothly with great service."
"Loved the atmosphere at The Drinkingbird! Intimate small tables in the front, larger booths for bigger groups in the back. Our waitress was very attentive without being overbearing. I let her know I was in the mood for an Old Fashioned, but wanted something a bit more exciting. She told me I should go with their Old Fashioned, so I did. This was a good move, fantastic drink. I think it was the cherry bitters that made this drink, I'd come back for this alone. I arrived late to meet a group of three who had already ordered some small plates for the table.We tried the lollipop style chicken wings which had a delicious and flavorful hot sauce! I thoroughly enjoyed this style of wings because I could ""gracefully"" eat them by holding onto the bone and not end up a saucy mess. My dining companions had also ordered the ""pigs in a blanket"" which was a bit confusing because it didn't resemble anything related to pigs in a blanket. It was ham and cheese on a pretzel roll...skip this one. The fish tacos had a spicy mango-ish salsa and were very good, but we felt they skimped on the portion. It came with 2 tacos that were not overwhelming in size. The steak sliders were another winning dish, the steak was cooked very well and caramelized onions were a great addition.For round two, we did the wings again (worth it.), the meatball sliders, and the croquettes. The croquettes were real, real weird. One was supposed to have brie and apricot, did not taste any apricot. One was supposed to have spinach, water chestnuts, and cream cheese...just not getting those flavors. Skip. Meatball sliders were the definite favorite besides the wings. Loved the BBQ sauce these came with, but they were a little hard to eat due to the nature of a meatball's shape. Overall, I'll definitely be back to try more drinks and that Old Fashioned again!"
"Service was great!  Have only come here for drinks, so quaint place to go to.  Good ambiance, and the drinks are pretty good as well."
"Such cute decor inside and a really cool light fixture out on the patio. Not very exciting at 5:30pm when there are just a few tables on a Saturday but that is my fault! Drinks were strong but a bit boring in presentation and flavor and apps were a miss.-  Royal Bermuda Yacht Club - Mount Gay Rum, fresh lime, Cointreau, Velvet Falernum $9 - Was strong but reminded me of sweet and sour mix, which is gross. -  Miss Noma Sombra - Mezcal, Grapefruit Oleo Saccharum, fresh grapefruit, orange cream citrate $9 - Reminded my friend of band-aids, ekk. -  Pigs in a Blanket- Black forest ham, melted Swiss cheese, wasabi-honey dressing on mini pretzel rolls  $9 - The description is accurate but the name is false advertising, these are by no means pigs in a blanket. 3 boring ham and cheese sliders and though I love pretzel buns, I was disappointed that bun was pretty much all these are, honey wasabi sauce was visible but not to the palate. -  Rumaki - Smoked bacon wrapped madjool dates stuffed with Gruyere cheese $7 - Hard to go wrong with these, very sweet, very fatty bacon, as its hard I assume to cook it when its on the dates. My friend doesn't mind undercooked bacon so she enjoyed them, I could have done with out.Overall I was disappointed, maybe I got the wrong things, but out of the 4 things we tired I wasn't impressed with any, and that is a problem. Good looks can only take you so far. I really had a 2 star experience but they seemed to be trying so..."
"Positives:1. Great decor inside.2. Pimms cup and Old-Fashioned were great. 3. Waiter was great (at the beginning). 4. Fun place where you can talk to your friends while enjoying a nice cocktail. Negatives. 1. As mentioned, waiter was great to start, but couldn't find him after we got our first round. Rest of the party that showed up after we received our initial order ended up ordering drinks from the bar. And then had to bug the bartender to get our final bill. 2. One of the two bartenders wasn't that great. We asked him for a napkin, and it was like the Spanish Inquisition trying to get one. Also on that note, they don't provide paper napkins when you receive your drink.3. Ask Answered cocktail -- not that great, well not good at all. Sent it back after one sip (and ordered another drink in its place), but they wouldn't take it off the bill. Had a party of 6, including several hard-core scotch drinkers, and no one could stomach the Ask Answered cocktail."
"Loved it. Great manhattan and talented bartending staff sans pretension. Good wings, eclectic crowd and not grossly overpriced. If you have some time to kill before a movie or are looking for a date spot, check it out!"
"Maybe a drinking bird isn't the best guy to get to watch over your home work station when you have to run out to a movie, but The Drinkingbird is a great place to drink your cares away.  The retro feel and cocktail menu are right up this vintage lover's alley and I couldn't keep myself from ordering a second old fashioned.  They have the fancy cherries too.  There's also a good selection of craft beers on tap, which are half price on Sundays.  I got the steak diane sliders, my companion went for the beet salad, and our other friend got a burger whose accompanying fries were delicious and came in a cute little fryer basket.  There were some other interesting things on the menu which I hope to try out in the future.  I will probably be staying away from the meatball sliders which have grape jelly on them, among other accoutrements.  I just can't do grape jelly."
"Love the decor, music and drinks. Seriously, you can't beat them. However, they should just throw in the towel and stop serving food. It is some of the worst I've ever had -- anywhere! The chicken wings are atrocious -- made with a weird tangy sauce that seams slopped together with left-over ingredients. The chicken itself was dry, old and overcooked. The crab cakes were totally inedible and the lamb meatballs looked like dogfood. Of course, all of this comes at a steep price -- $150 for three of us. Of particular annoyance, the wait staff seems totally indifferent to customer experience. We complained about the food, and the waiter basically rolled his eyes and walked away. Not cool. 2 Stars = Needs improvement. ."
"I've been wanting to try this place out after seeing the retro vibe commercial that airs before movies shown at the Regal Cinemas on Western.  Also, the neon sign of the pecking bird reminds me so much of Homer's pecking bird on ""The Simpsons"".When I entered the place, I felt like I stepped into the ""Mad Men"" era.  The decor and vibe is definitely retro.  Even the bartenders tend to dress the part.  There's  a cool booth area with the bright leather seats and pool table in the back.  We sat at a high top in the corner near the bar.  They were nice enough to switch the TV closest to our table to the NBA playoff game per our request.The drinks are very good, and the server gave good recommendations based on your alcohol and taste preferences.  I had a George Collins and a Garrick Gin Punch.  The food sounded enticing, but turned out just okay.  The three of us shared shared 6 croquettes (2 of each flavor: spinach + water chestnut, cheddar + jalapeno, and brie + dried apricot), which were bite-sized; Steak Diane Sliders (3), and a Bratwurst.  The sliders were overpowered by an excess of red onion, but the pretzel roll was good.  The bratwurst was well seasoned and pretty good.  It was enough food for a small meal because some of us had already eaten and were not too hungry.  I recommend ordering more if you're staying for dinner, or just ordering drinks and a few plates to snack on in between.Service was friendly and prompt.  Hubby forgot to pick up our credit card after paying and was able to recover it the next day without any problems.Now I have their theme song from the commercial stuck in my head."
"I love this joint. I believe it's the same people that ran Flounders, at least the same bartender (Aaron).Great beer selection and good food at a reasonable price. They seem to be getting creative with the cocktails and that's a plus. Never had or heard a complaint about the food. I'll tell you that everything I haven't had a chance to eat at least smelled really good. Only complaint, and very minor, is that during the summer when i sat outside in back there was this constant creepy low hum that was just driving me bat-balls crazy.Other than that, I hope it has a long and successful presence on this stretch of clybourn."
"I'd definitely wet my beak here again. It's a chill little lounge with comfy bar stools, a brand new pool table in the back, and an awesome drink menu. They've got a good selection of craft beers and a cocktail list with the likes of Singapore Slings, Plantars Punches, Pimms Cups, and Zombies. Can't speak for much of the food menu although I'm definitely beetin' it the next time I come back. (salad that is) It was bigger and better than almost any I've ever had with blue cheese pine nuts, arugula, lemon-thyme vinaigrette, and shaved fennel. Overall I definitely dug the spot. The staff was nice and although it's a little on the pricey side I'll definitely be back."
"Holy hipster! I feel like this is a place hipsters will absolutely burst out of their vintage 40s dresses for, until it becomes ""discovered"" of course. This place kind of have a 50s theme, which would be rad except for the 2050s prices on everything. 2 cocktails and an app for 37$! Well the cocktails better be the shit RIGHT! They are good. Not great. Just artsy enough for your velvet smoking jacket though."
Excellent cocktails (The Old Fashioned is among the best in the city) and small plates. Strong music and vibe. Great place to chill before a movie. The staff was perfect and spending time here set a solid tone for a great evening.
"""Famous for Nothing""? That's your motto?   Well given my recent experience- I sadly think, oh Drinkingbird, that you are working to keep it that way.I loved the name, that the decor is a 60's kickback, and the limited menu.  The seating is comfortable and I liked the beer garden out back.  I also loved that the namesake was one of my favorite childhood toys . . . .that bobbing bird who through some law of physics, ""drank"" water in a perpetual motion once started.What I hated was a bartender that should never have been behind the bar- let alone with his big meaty paws in our drinks.  We ordered martinis that should have been simpler to make than the specialty cocktail list that we found in front of ourselves but that obviously were not.Two came up and somehow tasted like hand sanitizer (we think the glasses weren't cleaned properly) and the third came up sans the lemon twist that had been requested.  We should have left good enough alone and left but my friend wanted the lemon twist.  The bartender comes over with a quarter of a lemon which he proceeds to squeeze into my friend's martini and then in front of us, peels the fruit from the peel and tries to attach this huge lemon wedge skin onto the side of the glass (obviously the word lemon peel has no meaning here)After the whole thing had fallen into the glass AND been fished out by the bartender for the 2nd time- we called for the check and left.I'm not even sure if the guy knew what the problem was . . although the disgusted looks on our faces should have told the whole story.Oh well- I guess the real Drinkingbird had 3 martinis to consume the other night!"
"This place is all around amazing! Great food/drinks, service, ambience...the whole package. I'm from outta town, so when I asked around about a good local place that wouldn't drain the wallet, a few different friends pointed me to The Drinkingbird. It didn't disappoint at all!Our server was super nice and helped me out with a couple of gluten free options (celiac). Had a burger w/o bun, served with frites and they were definitely above average and exceeded my burger expectations! To drink, I had the House Mule and Pimms Cup and they were absolutely delicious! Great overall experience and vibe and will continue to be a ""must stop"" every time I'm anywhere near Chicago in the future!"
"Excellent all the way around.  Fantastic service, great food, great drinks.  I only wish it was closer!Has that high end mid-century modern feel, without the pretense many similar establishments have in this city.The ability to simply have a good meal, a good drink, and a good time with friends in an intimate environment where I'm not being bombarded by music, waitstaff, or the people around me is worth every cent."
Went here for a quick drink before dinner at periods and was pleasantly surprised that this hole in the wall was so charming.  Great drinks and fantastic service.  The croquettes were delish!
"My cocktailin' kick continues.  A friend and I headed here and we were not disappointed.  I got the Paloma.  Woah.  They don't mess around!  Top notch, crafted cocktails for your drinking pleasure.   Drinks not badly priced from $9-11.  And not only did they taste awesome, they looked pretty.  Each drink had a little drinkingbird swizzle stick, with their cute saying ""Famous for nothing"".   I adore clever little details like that.   I had a swig of my friend Pimm's Cup.  Mmm....they make a damn good one!Of course we got food.  Get the mussels!!!  Some of the best I've had.  Ever.  I'm serious!  Who puts bacon in the broth?  They do!  It was so creamy, rich, satisfying.  I wanted to drink it.  But I didn't because I was in a public place.  And I didn't want to embarrass my friend.  And the adorable bartender would have thought I was a cave woman.  The whipped pork rillette was sinful.  It comes with bourbon butter.  What?!  Yeah.  bourbon + butter = sex.My only suggestion would to put a dessert on the menu.  Anything.  A cookie.  Sorbet swimming in a coup of prosecco.  I can't live a day without sweets, so off to Sweet Mandy B's we went.  But really, the drinks/mussels are where it's at!"
"The cocktails were good, but thought the staff was terrible.  They were stuffy and pretentious.  We had a 12 people in our group and entered an empty bar.  We started to put two tables together in the front window but where met with a lot of negativity from the bartender and were told to move to the double booths in the back.  Well guess what, we could not all fit a double booth so we ended up spilled over, half filling another double booth.  There loss.  but by the time we decided to go back to the front, some tables were taken.  We would have gone to the far back, but there was a jewelry party going on.  We stayed for a few rounds as it had started to rain and still continued to get nasty looks from the bartender.  Our waitress also left much to be desired, but was at least courteous.  One of us received a skunky Bud Light with a born on date from last year.  The best by date was January 2013 so I guess they thought that it would still be good to serve in June.  When we told her is was skunky, she merely brought out another bottle from the same batch.  At least that one wasn't bad.  At the end she totally botched our drink bills too and charged for extra drinks and guess what, the skunky beer.  It's too bad really as that was our kind of place, but we'll take our business elsewhere."
I adore this place. It may be my new favorite spot in Chicago. The drinks are strong and well-prepared. The food is delicious. The decor strikes the right balance between contemporary and kitsch. The bathrooms are stylish and well-appointed. The food and drink specials are reasonably priced for unreasonably good quality. The macaroni and cheese is the ultimate comfort food.I want The Drinkingbird to be the place where everybody knows my name.
