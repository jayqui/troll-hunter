SideDoor
"My friends and I went to the SideDoor last Saturday to celebrate our reunion after about 4 years. The place was really nice and our server was so funny! I usually don't order sandwiches as I was never able to finish any sandwich for one meal. However, I ordered Prime Rib Sandwich last time and I FINISHED IT ALL!!! That was definitely the best sandwich I've ever had."
"The food was great. Seriously. Everything was outstanding. 5-stars, no question. The service? Not so much. First: unless I am at a frat party bar in LP, as a server, you are allowed a maximum of 5 ""bro-isms"" per meal, and I think that's being generous. Please do not call me ""dude,"" ""bro,"" ""man"" or anything of the like throughout my entire meal. Second: when I order a draft, I hope to get it within 5 minutes--also generous, I think. I watched my draft sit at the server station nearly 15 minutes before I flagged down another server to get it delivered to me. Third: I had a weird interaction with my bro-server. It went like this. Him: ""Still working here, man?"" Me: ""Nope, we're finished."" Him: ""Cool. So do you want me to clear these plates?"" No, chief, I love just sitting around with my dirty plates... And as if that question weren't awkward enough, he walked away and then took 10 minutes before clearing the plates. So, in sum: great food, awkward and at times abysmal bro-service."
"Oh my gosh! I usually have my wife write these reviews but I had to do this one. From the time we stepped foot into this bar, we knew it was cool. The staff here was amazing. We were greeted by an incredibly nice bartender who was friendly (without being annoying) and we sank into a nice couch in the bar to have a couple of drinks and a little bit of food. We ended up eating like kings. My wife had the fried brussel sprout salad (yeah, weird huh) and it was probably the best salad I've ever had. Then she put the dressing on and it was even better!I had the fork and knife pastrami which was amazing. No fat on the meat and a soft pretzel bun. A couple of good beers on top and we were done....or not.Desert was the sticky toffee pudding and Not Your Father's Rootbeer. Absolutely incredible!"
"Had dinner in lounge area. The few tables in the booth area is quite nice and comfortable. You can watch tv or eavesdrop on conversations at the bar. It's casual here, but if you like to dress up, go ahead. Anyway, their beer draught menu lists beer from light to dark with probably 4 IL brews and rest from California to Maine. Bottle list is a bit longer with more options for cider, sours and IIPAs. You can do flights of 4 for $16.The menu is simple yet delicious. There's definitely ""bar"" food like fish&chips, lettuce wraps, and wings, but if your appetite wants something more ""elegant"", go for the roasted meat boards. I'd recommend the braised pork belly - its crispy outer edges surrounding melt-in-your-mouth fatty layers and moist meat covered in a sauce that's full of umami goodness!!! I'm drooling just thinking about it even though I just had it like 5 min ago! I had the Lawry's wedge and it was good too. 5 mini wedges with chopped egg whites, crumbled blue cheese and beef bacon. I haven't tried dessert, but I did save my last sample of a beer flight for last: ""Not your father's root beer"", ABV 10.7! And they can make this into a root beer float!If you want some quietness, come around 5-6, but it'll start to pickup around 7. And this is a Saturday."
"SideDoor was a wonderful meal to close out a fun weekend trip to Chicago. It was fantastic to escape the tourist crowds even though this place is located right next to the bustle of the Magnificent Mile. We went right before noon on a major holiday, and there was plenty of seating immediately available. We were a little bummed that the legendary meat board had been retired from the menu, but we quickly forgot once the delicious food came out.Prime rib poutine: Great. The pickled veggies atop the plentiful meat and gravy added a lovely acidic kick to the all-around solid appetizer.Prime rib sandwich: Great. The bread was crispy, the meat was tender and plentiful, and the au jus and horseradish creme added wonderful flavor.Sticky toffee pudding: Great. This warm, rich cake paired well with the cooling taste of creme anglaise.The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated with copper tones, rich wood, and a tin ceiling. On top of that, service was extremely friendly; everyone was so warm and courteous that I thought I was back in Texas."
"In the fantasy episode of Check, Please! that exists only in my dreams, I get to explain how I feel my pick has a certain gravitas, coming from the manager of one of the city's best sandwich spots (I am the manager of Xoco.)My favorite sandwich in Chicago is found here at Sidedoor: the prime rib sandwich.  There's nothing quite like the combo of prime rib, horseradish, softly-toasted bread and jus!  Today was one of my first outings since last fall, a picture perfect spring day in the sixties, blue skies, birds chirping.Here it's my day off, it's early afternoon and I am already back home from an amazing lunch (prime rib sandwich, handmade Idaho potato chips,  lemonade because I don't drink although they have a fantastic craft beer and cocktail list, excellent service from Scott who talked about Game of Thrones, creme brûlée) with an extra prime rib sandwich to-go in the fridge, kicked back in my chair by the breezy window, digesting delicious Lawry's prime rib, my brow slightly moist from the meat sweats."
"Came here for the Three Floyds Collaboration; beer and food pairing. The food was delicious and with great beer, great company, great service, Hubby and I had an awesome time. Jeff did an amazing job planning this event."
"Came by recently for the $5 burger they were offering due to Yelp Burger WeekThe place is located within Lawry's Prime Rib hence the name Side Door. Me and my buddies walked in and no one was at the front which caused us to kind of wander around in hope to find someone. We saw a guy that happened to walk behind the bar and he told us he could get someone for us.We got an awesome server that continued to make jokes and was really interactive and helpful with the menu...pretty cool actually. I went with the $5 burger which was an angus beef patty with iceberg lettuce, pickled red onion and gruyère cheese (my choice of cheese). I enjoyed the burger very much and would buy it again for its regular price. My buddy got The Roger which is pastrami, gruyère cheese, caramelized onions, horseraddish mayo on sourdough...it looked very good. Pretty cool spot and good food as well as beer selection."
"Down a star as the service really was suffering the last time we came here.  Our server seemed to be pulled in way too many directions and we had to keep flagging him down.  Maybe it was because it was the first time we actually were seated at a table?Well, whatever the reason, the next time I go, it's back to a seat at the bar for me.  That way I know the service will be spot on as those folks know what they are doing!"
"Tried to call in an order to go, however they won't take phone orders because they said they don't want food getting cold and additionally orders will be ready in 10 minutes. Well, they were dead on. 11 minutes after placing the order it was ready to go. I ordered the prime rib sandwich which was absolutely perfect.  Really don't know what more to say other than that.  Also ordered the avocado mash which is basically guacamole without pico that came with pita chips. Again, perfect. Flavor, texture and portions were all great. One star reduction was because it took 6 minutes sitting at the bar before I was acknowledged which was frustrating, especially on a relatively slow night. Just a heads up, the location was a bit hard to find. The address is 100 Ontario (mid block) but the actual entrance is on Rush just north of Ontario."
"2 words: life-changingI haven't felt this way about a food establishment in a long time. Came here after watching a movie at the AMC Lowes 600 (just a block away) and was looking for a place to eat nearby and boy are we glad we found this place! Hubby ordered the 'Prime Rib Sandwich' and it was delectable. The thinly sliced meat just melted in your mouth, but the star of the dish was the small dish of au jus that came with it. All I was thinking was how many other dishes you could make with this small bowl of liquid. Can I have a bowl of au jus to go please?Based on the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the 'Fork & Knife Pastrimi' and yes, you do need a fork and knife to eat it as it was messy. The pastrami is 3-weeks work of TLC and well extremely well done. At first glance, it was a big sandwich that I thought I was only able to eat 1/2 of it, but eat bit was a new savory discovery that kept my mouth wanting for more. Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!!!  It's been almost a month since my discovery of this place and I've thought about it constantly. The decor has a warm and cozy hunting lodge feel. Since they close at 10:30pm on Saturday, you don't have to deal with the loud and crazy crowd at a bar waiting for a table. We got here at 8:30pm and was seated right away. I'm a HUGE fan!"
I came here at an off hour on a Tuesday so me service issues. In fact the staff were exceptionally nice.  I had the prime rib steak sandwich. They slow cook the meat for hours so it's so tender you could practically eat this without using your teeth. Ask for the raw horseradish and mix it in with the jus like you mix wasabi and soy sauce. What a great dip!
"I don't want to call this place pricey, but it'll certainly hit your pockets. The atmosphere is the perfect combination of upscale and low key. The food is well prepared and most of the menu consists of things I'd like to come back and try. The menu is also seasonal, which is exciting given the quality. Solid beer list, excellent service provided by knowledgeable servers. I will become a regular here."
"This and every other review should be a five star but their inability to service the lounge is incomprehensible.  Maybe I'm just that customer that fell through the cracks of service, but for it to happen more than once is inconceivable! (If you don't want to read my review, know that their small plates and cocktails are BADASS! and for that alone it should be rated FIVE stars but, service is weak and terrible.  On a date, I would definitely go elsewhere.  Service is what kills the rating.)My first visit was a month back whilst ""gastropub hopping"" with friends.  This was our second stop on an early Saturday evening and for having only a drink plus shared appetizers, we were WOW'ed.  Our waiter whom resembled ""Sam Smith"", seemed delightful enough initially, but was hardly caring enough to come around to check on additional drink or food orders.  Getting a reload on water was a feat!  Going to the bartender resulted in being rerouted back to the server, whom we learned was assisting the entire lounge! Hire more people, WTF!  (Note: We sat at the comfy couches near the front of the lounge, closest to the bar.  This close proximity gave no added benefit.)  For best drinks, order what is often mentioned in reviews or the special cocktail of the week.  For small plates, the deviled eggs were very good and the Prime rib poutine (Prime Rib Poutine, cheese curds, beef gravy, giardiniera, fries)was ""outta this world.""  Had they been able to come round' for another drink order, we would have ordered a couple of those to go!2nd visit was for a drink date on a week day, just this past Wednesday.  She beat me to the table and was met by the server.  She'd asked for a large water or if they could leave a pitcher on the table so that she could properly hydrate, it was a hot day.  He said he couldn't oblige either request but could return with a refill soon after she finished the first pour.  LIES!  I joined the table, once he poured that first glass of water.  We sat and chatted.  And chatted.  And chatted some more.  (During this time, the both of us were looking around for the server so that we could place a drink order.  But he never came by.  The place was maybe at 40%, with people there for after work drinks and tourism.)  Our patience wore out after twenty-five minutes had passed.  So, I asked if she would join me at Watershed.  I'd been there recently and knew their servers actually visited tables.  She decided to thank the waiter for the water and indicate to him that we were going elsewhere for better service.And all I wanted was a great drink and some fucking great poutine!  I don't care how busy it is, no table should wait longer than ten minutes.  If that first drink order is not received, you better get your heiny back over there and fill an order.  You don't get paid to leave llamas grazing at tables!  As I stated earlier the food and drink is a solid 4 or 5 stars.  It's great.  But the service.. Holy crap.Have additional tips on this business?Good for groups? Hell-fucking no.Good for kids? Have you heard any of the conversations that are happening in here? It's probably wise to leave the wee ones out of here.Has TV? Naw, I dunno."
This is what a gastropub should be. I went here for lunch and the drink selection is impressive.  Bartenders have skills that's for sure. Chi-town you have won me over. I had a salad and the prime rib sandwich  and washed it down with nice cold local beer.Good hearty mealsGreat beer and liquor selectionGreat service
"This the best place.  Great fresh food.  Had the fish and chips and the fish was fresh and moist.  The sticky toffee pudding was the best and it went great with ""not my dads"" root beer. Service was the best."
"Wow.  The Fork and Knife Pastrami is pretty darn special.  Whoever called it ""life changing "" wasn't wrong.   Pretzel bun, a few small chunky veggies, melted cheese, and breathtakingly great meat.  Do it. Service was a little slow, but the food quality makes all that be forgotten.   If you haven't tried it before I would also recommend ""Not Your Fathers Rootbeer"". A 10% ACV beer that tastes like your childhood but kicks like a mule."
A great place and great food! Local or tourist must. A relaxing atmosphere with food quality that you would expect from Lawry's
"What a brilliant menu, atmosphere, and set of flavors. Group of 4 for dinner and we enjoyed every bite. Poutine is excellent as a starter. Burgers and sandwiches were perfect. Brussel sprouts al dente in a great balsamic cream sauce were great."
"Great steak sandwiches, amazing beer list! Ask for what's aging in the cellar. Jeff will fix you up with what you need!"
This place was epic! Beautiful decor and somehow they managed to blend a classy and cozy atmosphere. The service was fantastic and everyone was super friendly. The food? Well... It was out of this world! I ordered the Fork and Knife Pastrami Sandwich and it blew my mind. I would definitely consider myself a foodie and I have had a lot of pastrami sandy's in my day but this one might take the cake! We were visiting Chicago and just so happened to stumble upon Side Door but you can beat your sweet ass that we will be hitting up this spot when come back for a visit!
"This place is a wonderfully affordable (for River North) hideaway with excellent decor and servers that make up for the relatively slow rate of service. If you have time to linger and inhale the smell of someone's order of chicken and waffles, then do so. I got the prime rib poutine for Canada Day and was able to inhale the entire entree without feeling gross from overly gloppy gravy - the gravy itself was more of a reduced jus and the giardiniera was a piquant counterpoint. The aforementioned chicken and waffles was a somewhat less generous portion of a large chicken breast, cut in halves, battered and fried, served on top of impressively aromatic waffles with apricot maple syrup. The chicken was juicy, the waffles were fluffy, and the syrup was an elevated version of the usual. We were told that the poutine toppings were changing for the season, and while I can't remember what the new poutine was, it sounded great as well. But you should save room for dessert! Our server made a mistake and entered creme brulee instead of C.C. Brown's Hot Fudge Sundae for one of us but then he let us keep the first dessert, meaning we had not three, but four desserts - and they did not disappoint! A strong white chocolate cheesecake, a perfectly custard-y and caramelized creme brulee with fresh raspberries, the best sticky toffee pudding I've had with creme anglais, and the hot fudge sundae dressed with hot fudge table-side. Yum yum yum. The coffee was pretty good too.My only critique of SideDoor is the alcohol menu - I don't think I saw anything for less than $8 (beers) and the cocktails were $10+. That might be the going rate for the neighborhood, but considering the generous food one can get at SideDoor for the price, I think the bar could offer just a few affordable beverage options as well. Nonetheless, I'd be happy to spend my dollars and calories on food and dessert here again!"
"I wish I could say that I tried the food, but I didn't get a chance because of the horrible service. My wife and I went in at 9:15 pm because we had been walking around and we wanted some food and drinks, and their website and yelp clearly says that they are open until 10:30pm. We were greeted by a woman from behind the bar and led to a table where we received our menus. Then some angry little man came out of the back and rudely asked us, ""how did you get in here?""  We thought he was being funny, so we replied, ""through the side door!""  He didn't laugh, but instead said the kitchen closed at 9 and we could not have any food (again, try to find where it says anywhere that the kitchen closes at 9). He said that the door should have been locked and he led us back out to the front. Then he tried to give us recommendations where we could go to eat instead, and then he and a manager looking guy argued about whether the kitchen was actually closed or not. At this point we just wanted to get out of there, so we left and went to The Purple Pig where we were promptly seated. Maybe it's because I was at the ball game earlier so I came in with a baseball cap on...or because they're just rude. I guess I'll never know."
"Wow what an absolute let down.  Great review great looking menu but either I hit an off night or people on Yelp need to drink a lot less before writing their reviews. The decor is very cool and hip.   Some of the staff was on the ball but our server was about the worst I have had in a LONG time and this was one of the worst dining experiences have had in years.  If you look at my other reviews you can see I eat out a lot and am fair with my reviews so take heed. From the top, we walk in about 8 on a Monday night and were seated right away. The server can over told us about the menu, well pushed on us the restaurants desire for us to by their meat board, which individual servings are 1/4lbs.  Now why I say push is that our server have the same speech to everyone seated and not only was the  ""house specialty"" but she recommended that we ""save"" bye either getting three choices for one of us or a 6 pack for the table.  Now let's do the math shall we, 6 orders X .25 lbs = 1.5 lbs meat for two of us, that would be me and my wife oh ya and a couple of sides.   Seriously!? Rule of thumbs says 1/4 to 1/2 meat per person.  Let me digress because there is SOOO much more to cover.  So we finally decide on what we want, for me Knife and fork pastrami burger on a pretzel bun, my wife the cheese burger with American with a side fries and mac N cheese to split.  I also ordered a ""Not your Dad's root beer"".So the drink comes and it is as advertised a root beer flavored drink with alcohol, something new but nothing I would order again.  I finish the drink and set eh glass aside, and wait... and wait... I finish my water and wait.. my wife empties her glass and we wait.... Finally after I put my 2nd empty glass (water and ""beer"") of to the side of the table the waitress gets the hint and fills up my water glass but doesn't offer me another drink or clear the empty one.  Now I know this may sound petty but I would like to think that there is a certain level of service all restaurants should have and drinks and used items should be removed.  I mean 99.9% of all the Chili's and Applebee's would know to clear the used stuff and offer a new drink.The food arrives (note they server you the food as it is done so things can come out of order, but they do tell you this up front) I get my burger and my wife gets hers and a minute or so later we get the sides.  Both look amazing... this is where things stopped going from ok to just flat out BAD.  My pastrami was so greasy I had to stop eating it after two bites, I honestly was worried I would get sick from the amount of grease, it was so bad that after eating a couple of bites my napkin was so greasy I had to take it off my lap for fear or staining my clothes (see picture posted), I shoved my plate off to the side and simple wasn't going to eat it.  My wife's burger was ok, average at best until she got a few bites into it and found that it was under cooked.  Now let me add to this, she asked to make sure ""I want no pink in the patties"", the waitress said medium well which my wife agreed to.  After about 3 - 5 minutes of my food just sitting there the waitress comes by to check on us..mind you she didn't even pick up on the fact my food was pushed off to the side with only a few bites taken.  She didn't even ask about it I told her to just take it away I couldn't eat it.  At this point I would have expected the standard question ""Is there something else from the menu I can get you"" but I was offered nothing.  We also asked for some ketchup for the fries then too.  Again 3-4 minutes later we flagged down the waitress and asked about the ketchup she had forgotten and then offered me something else in place of my other burger.  By this time I was just ready to go so I said no.  My wife pushed her partially uneaten under cooked burger to the side as well and we ate the boring plain overpriced fried and mac and cheese.All said and done they took the two burgers (that we didn't really eat) off the bill, the manger never came over and apologized and the waitress sort of tried but fell flat.  Summary would be nice looking place, expensive drinks (on par with most places like this) clueless staff, gross food or just boring food and a customer service level that rivals with the DMV!"
"Got to stop by this place for lunch today. We were seated quickly as it was not busy at all at around 1:30. The waitress was really pleasant and friendly. My brother and I ended up sharing the pulled pork poutine and a burger that had prime rib on it (sorry, not sure of the name!). Both were delicious tasting, but I have to admit it was a bit of salt overload with the combo of the two! Had to drink a lot of water, but luckily the waitress kept it full. I was very happy and very full with the meal."
"Forgot to write a review for this place when I went, but a friend recently asked for Chicago recommendations on FB and SideDoor instantly came to mind. It was my favorite stop during our last trip and we always plan our vacations entirely around food/drinks! Go try it!"
"Have you ever literally fallen into a small place that you were so happy you did!This is an amazing example of getting SO LUCKY while on our Chicago adventure!This place is a door, and a sign. Don't miss it.Once you step inside it is a comforting oasis! With some of the nicest staff we met during our entire weekend in Chicago.We were brought to a cozy booth, and greeted immediately. The waiter gave us some menu tips and we ended up decided on a few shared plates. YUM!Everything was amazing. I would search this place out next time I a in town!"
"My sister in-law and her boyfriend were in town visiting and we found ourselves downtown without a dinner reservation. I haaaaate being downtown in general because the food tends to be overpriced and mediocre. But, thanks to Yelp, I found this place and we decided to walk over and check it out. We came in at 7pm on a Saturday night and were told it would be just a few minutes. Great! We sat in the bar area while we waited for the rest of our party to join us. The server in the bar area was fabulous and we tried the ""Not Your Father's Root Beer"". Yelpers, please listen: you MUST try it. It's amazing! It's root beer with a 10.7% kick. So good. When the rest of our party arrived we were sat. We had a fabulous booth for our party of six that was separated from the dining room with a tied back curtain. The little alcove made it much easier for us all to hear each other at dinner. Excellent! Our server explained that it's an open kitchen so the food will come out when it's ready so you might not get everything in an order you would prefer. That's fine though, it ensures your food is hot. I ordered the fork and knife pastrami sandwich. I will be dreaming about that sandwich for a long time. It was perfect. I sampled my sister in-law's mac and cheese and it was delicious. The only hiccup in the whole meal was when the server was clearing our plates and noticed that my sister in-law had gotten the pork tenderloin sandwich instead of the prime rib. She hadn't even notice but he gave us a complimentary dessert and adjusted our bill. Amazing service! I would not hesitate to recommend this place and my husband and I might very well make the trip back downtown specifically to go here for a date night."
"This is a great gastropub with a good track record of pleasing its customers. Count me in. The small room off the bar is dark and clubby. I had a nice cocktail called a Blind Pelican made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, Aperol, lemon and rhubard bitters. Tres refreshing. The menu is mostly bites and small plates. I ordered a caesar salad made with red & green kale and white anchovies--yes, real anchovies. Followed by a board of deliciously seasoned and perfectly cooked lamb chops. These are served with little dipping sauces and caramelized onions. I can see how coming here can be quite addictive. Easy on your wallet?--no, but quite enjoyable. And the service is very fine. This is a cool retreat off Michigan Avenue, open for lunch and dinner, so head on over. I will definitely be back."
"I did not realize this was literally the side entrance to Lawry's prime rib. The interior is somewhat dated with that dark, old steakhouse feel to it. We grabbed a few seats at the small bar and ordered some appetizers and beers. The selection of draft beer was limited, however they did have quite a few unique larger format bottles. The avocado mash with pita was good, with a very strong flavor of line to it. The other appetizer we ordered never came out and we ended up leaving to go to another restaurant for dinner."
"Out on the town on a Saturday night and decided to grab a bite. We didn't seem to have luck finding a place that was kid friendly and with less than an hour wait. We looked on yelp and found side door! So glad that we came here! The food was superb add well as the service. Jonathan was amazing and gave us great recommendations! We had the Lawrys prime rib sandwich, the fork and knife pastrami and the pork tenderloin. .. Super delicious! Definitely coming back!"
"This place really surprised me. I went here on Memorial Day for lunch and they were empty which worked out great because I was starving and not in the mood to wait anywhere. When you go, I recommend ordering their steak nachos. They're one of the best nachos I've ever had. The portion is large and the chips are spread out so every chip has a topping. I also tried their prime rib sandwich which was great as well. I'm curious to go back and see how their dinner is but in the meantime it's definitely a great place to go for lunch."
"I want to dock a star because they pulled the fork and knife pastrami sandwich!! Alas, I can't knock this place at all. The atmosphere is a warm welcome from the hustle and bustle of the Chicago city streets. Their bourbon selection, while not exhaustive, is respectable. The bartender on this night is very knowledgable of the spirit selection, and even pours a sample of the higher end bourbon when I seemed too perplexed to make a decision. The wedge salad is amazing, and the replacement pastrami sandwich is very good (but not amazing). The deserts also look fantastic. This is a great stop, just off of Michigan, that will take you back to a not-quite-speakeasy old school pub with some of the best food (especially for the value) in the area."
Amazing. Must visit place.Pastrami sandwich and pork belly amazing. Literally some of the best food I've had in my life. Friends who had already eaten were chowing down too after insisting they weren't hungry. Solid 5 star good.Service solid too. At one point an elderly gentleman fell coming down the stairs. Staff were all over the situation as was I. Really impressed how well the staff helped him. 5 stars. Awesome place.Will be back.
"On a recent trip to Chicago we stayed at the Intercontinental on Michigan Avenue. We had Afternoon Tea at the Langham Hotel (awesome experience) and weren't hungry until later in the evening. We looked for a restaurant that was within walking distance of our hotel.I used Yelp to locate some options. I stumbled across Side Door and looked at the menu. We decided to try it. And boy am I glad we did.It's adjacent to Lawry's Prime Rib. It's like the hipster baby cousin version. We were greeted by a gentleman with a fabulous mustache. It was like walking in to a speakeasy. The dark wood and dim lighting added to the ambience.I would say this is a very masculine restaurant. From the decor to the menu, but I'm okay with that. I just had the girliest afternoon sipping tea and eating scones. I needed some gin and meat to balance my hormones.I had a rosemary and grapefruit gin cocktail. We shared an iceberg lettuce salad. Best darn iceberg lettuce salad ever. I actually tried to recreate it when I got home.Mom had Lake Perch Fish and Chips and I had a Pastrami Sandwich with Spicy Gardinera and Cheddar sauce. It was all delicious. The only down fall was that the waiter took a long time to take our orders, because he was tending to another table.The price was affordable and the food was delicious. I truly recommend this place."
"Quick update...stopped in for lunch today and avoided the meat platter...ironic at a steakhouse...heheheBUT I have to say our meal was DELICIOUS!Crab dip...amaz!  I just wished it would have come with more than three small flatbread crackerslamb meatballs were amazing!!!!!veggie salad was crisp, refreshing, and crunchy.  Perfect additionpoutine...do it...just do it.  Gravy was heavenly, peppers made the dish...YUMMMMM"
"Stellar sandwich selection at lunch, including The Roger, a fork-friendly pastrami sandwich ($13) with caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese on grilled sourdough. And the Lawry-inspired prime rib sandwich ($19), the size of a small infant, is topped with shaved prime rib, whipped cream horse radish on a large baguette. The restaurant itself is somewhat dark and moody, but far more casual than the main dining restaurant, with most of the signature items being prepared at a chef's station in the back of the room. The hands'down surprise for lunch was our Fried Brussels Sprout Salad ($10), featuring shaved sprouts, slivered carrots, dried cranberries, candied pecans with a sweet chili vinaigrette - simply an amazing selection of flavors and textures that's almost interesting enough to woo you in by itself. Wash it all down with a ""Not Your Father's Root Beer,"" a boozy 10.7% childhood favorite that's a blast from the past."
"I visited SideDoor on a recent trip to Chicago. It was a great choice. The service was very attentive, but not pushy and the food was delicious. I got the Fork and Knife Pastrami and it was above and beyond my expectations for a pastrami sandwich. The restaurant was cozy and I felt free to linger. I will be returning soon."
"My first meal in Chicago and I'm already in love. Paxton, the Sous Chef, and Reagan, the Line Cook, made my experience at SideDoor incredible. We were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen in the back, and they made us feel so welcome. He and Reagan clearly share a passion for culinary arts and are talented to boot. They told us about new recipes they were trying and spoke extensively to all of the food we tried. Paxton's recommendations were on point-- everything we tried was delicious, but what Paxton recommended was above and beyond. The atmosphere of this place is cozy and charming and conducive to long dinners and good conversation. I (I.e. Paxton) recommend the skirt steak, the mac n' cheese, and the bread pudding. YUM YALL"
"I was visiting Chicago last weekend, and yelped for the closest ""Gastropub"" in the area since I am a craft beer guru.  Side Door came up as first choice, so I stopped in and sat at the bar.  I was very impressed with the draft selection, they had a few rare drafts, most of them are from local breweries.  There were several IPAs on tap, and although I don't like hops, I tasted a few and they were pretty good!  I stuck with my favorite, the sour ales.  They had a fabulous sour ale by Two Brothers, ""Fathom.""  It was amazing.  There were several other Two Brothers selections, as well as some from Firestone Walker.  I didn't eat here, but the menu choices were so top notch, I seriously wanted to order one of everything.  The menu changes every week, so that is cool, you can always come back and get something different!  The atmosphere is prim and proper, but trendy and beautifully remodeled.  Grand staircase and high ceilings.  Reminds me of pre-prohibition type pubs.  The bartender was awesome, and all the wait staff were so friendly, they were chatting with me, giving me some history of the place and good tourist things to do while in Chicago.  Overall, 5 stars for Side Door, I hope its stil there next time I go back to Chicago so I can come again!"
"We came here for lunch and the place was practically empty.  The decor is nice.  It has a rusty intimate thing going on that works well.  Even though most of the tables were empty they tried to sit us at the table in front of the kitchen.  We asked to be seated in one of the many empty and better tables and the hostess begrudgingly complied.  Our waitress was nice but very slow.  A table got seated next to us about 15 minutes after us.  They received everything before we did from drinks to entrees.  They had a good selection of beers on tap with some interesting options.  The sour beer they had on tap was good.  I also tried the rootbeer beer which was fun for the first sip.  After that it just tasted like flat root beer.The food was not bad but it was extremely over priced.  It seems to be modeling itself of the a la carte steak house model.  In the gastropub atmosphere it just came across as really over priced  The spiced lamb meat ($16) platter was three small slices of lamb, some bread, and a small container of the giariniera.  The meat was good but for price it was very disappointing.  The prime rib sandwich ($18) was similar.  The meat was good but it was one slice of prime rib and some chips.  The green beans were great.  Overall, this place is overpriced and the service is slow.  Our lunch for two with one drink each came out to almost $80 and neither of us felt stuffed.  For the price there are a lot of other places I would rather go."
"The food. The sliced steak was wonderfully done. The meat board is a nice luchtime option and it pairs well with the quite loverly pinot meunier served. Things got off to a confusing start as the restaurant opened late for lunch, staff sitting at the Lawry's bar seemed a bit befuddled that I was there and eventually roped me back over to the ""side door"" to eat in the proper room. How the hell was I supposed to know if you don't greet your customers properly?Once inside and seated, the server was a bit edgey and sporatic but I honestly, eventually believe that he was just eager to get everything around the restaurant in order. BUT, if nothing else, make SURE that your only customer gets a glass of water within a reasonable amount of time? That would be nice."
"This is a great date spot and really cute. We went here tonight after work and I felt a little under dressed, but the wait staff made us feel right at home.We shared and loved everything. The stuffed shrimp and poutine were delicious! I saved room for dessert and we shared the sticky toffee pudding. Also delicious.I also didn't realize we would be in for a musical treat. They had a jazzy band there that was really good. I will definitely be back to visit other items on the menu."
"SOOOOOOOOOO good!  Best prime rib sandwich I've had in my entire life, can't wait to go back for it again!  Also had the kale salad... I'd skip that, if I did this over again.  Had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert and it was UNREAL.  Two things you have to get:  prime rib sandwich and sticky toffee pudding.  Oh, great atmosphere, too.  Nice, but the price tag is a lot friendlier than Lawry's!"
"I've been to Side Door 3 times (drinks and appetizers with coworkers, dessert with my friends and on a blind date) and each time I've enjoyed my experience here. First off, Side Door is a 3 minute walk from my condo so by default I already liked this place. Secondly, each time I've been here I've had great service from the friendly staff working here. Thirdly, the beer menu is impressive, the food is good and the dessert hits the stop.If you love Root Beer like I do, I recommend you try the ""Not Your Father's Root Beer."" This beer tasted just like root beer, which is probably why I downed it in under two minutes and needed a second one.Appetizer -I'd say try the blue cheese potato chips with crispy prosciutto. You get a plate filled with chips covered in this awesome blue cheese sauce. Worth trying and you get enough to share with someone else.Food- Spiced Rubbed Leg of Lamb: the lamb comes sliced and on a board with some different dipping sauces. The lamb was tender and delicious. - House Smoked Pastrami: was pretty darn good. The sandwich comes packed with a nice portion of warm pastrami covered with this hoppy cheddar rarebit on a pretzel bun. I can see why three different waiters/waitresses recommended I try this. I enjoyed every bite of this sandwich.Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding: is the one to get! It's so good, but I wish a scoop of vanilla ice cream came on top of it.SideDoor is pretty awesome and I would definitely recommend this place for drinks, dinner, a quick stop for dessert or as a date spot."
"This place feels like a hidden find, tucked away on the side of a building (literally).  We walked right by it the first time only to realize we must have missed the door, so look out!The bar area is large and welcoming and as you walk into the various lounge / dining areas I felt like I was taking a bit of a step back in time to an older, fancier Chicago.  It was beautifully decorated for the winter holidays when I was there but I'd imagine that it'd be a great space to have a large dinner or a private gathering.The staff was really friendly and we had our pick of tables (granted, it was 4pm on Monday) and were happy to find out that they have 50% of the ""bite"" category on their menu from Mon-Fri from 3-5pm.  I ordered a SideDoor mule and M ordered a Cocoa Old Fashioned.  My mule was a bit strong, but had a nice smooth ginger flavor and was very refreshing.  M's Old Fashioned was awesome - bacon bourbon, which definitely tasted smoky, and had a nice cocoa flavor that lingered in your mouth.  Unique and memorable.We also enjoyed the potato boats, a large baked potato cut in half and then stuffed with meaty chili, bacon, sour cream, cheese and chives, as well as the pretzel bites, which were pillows of pretzel dough with a zippy mustard sauce.  The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered and were piping hot.The waitstaff was really open to us hanging out way past happy hour, clearing our dishes and refilling our water glasses but not pressuring us to hurry up.  I would definitely want to come back for dinner or for another round of drinks!"
"I was determined to find a place neither myself nor my friend had been for dinner before. It's quite a challenge when it comes to places in downtown as we were both quite into trying new places and just about every place we suggested, the other had been to. Then we found Side Door! Not only had neither of us been there but we planned on a movie post feasting and AMC was just a block from the restaurant. As soon as we walked in, we were meet with a dimly lit, semi romantic atmosphere. Tables & chairs of various sizes and comfort levels throughout the establishment. The decor reminded me of a haunted house, in a kind of strange good way. There was a giant turtle shell on one wall, huge portraits (a la Haunted Mansion at Disney World) and fancy candelabras. They have a lot on the menu that sounds absolutely delicious! Some soups and small plates were really sounding good to me but in the end I decided to go not so classy and order their grilled cheese for $10. This was a pretty intense grilled cheese! Way better than most places and I would have to bestow it the honor of being my second favorite grilled cheese in the city. It has some seriously funky cheese up in there and just like the haunted house comment, that's funky in the good way. I still have no idea what kinds of cheeses were on the sandwich but I'd venture to say it was a couple and one had some kind of seeds or something in it. It was amazing. The downfall of the sandwich was the grease. My fingers would get soaked in the oil and the napkin it rested on was soaked through. Plus it had a bit too much crispness to the bread. Overall though, I wouldn't hesitate on getting the sandwich again, but would be prepared with some extra napkins to soak the grease up.My dining companion had Lawry's Prime Rib Sandwich and gave me a bit to indulge on. I wasn't that into this sandwich. I found it to be a bit dry and just not overly exciting. Especially for $18. Just seemed a bit much for what it was - a sandwich all on its lonesome with nothing on the side.I liked Side Door, found it to be A-OK and one of the best things about it is that you're right in downtown and can get a seat. Like get a seat immediately on a Saturday night which is almost unheard of! I wouldn't balk at coming here again though I can say with confidence I'm not going to be going out of way to dine here again."
"Phenomenal.I am rating this place based on our second visit! Let me start by thanking Jeff, the general manager! This visit was beyond any of our expectations, from the service to the food! Right as we walked in we were greeted by the sweet girl in the front! She remembered us from our previous visit and made us feel like we were regulars! Our waiter, Jon was pretty great, really nice and attentive! The food...we were pretty much left speechless as each plate came out! We did not have intentions of eating this much but every bite was worth it! Our feast consisted of  chicken wings, fish n chips, mac n cheese, a 10 oz prime rib, their amazing French fries, and probably the best pastrami sandwich on earth...the ROGER! Wow! You definitely have to try it for yourself cause I have no words to describe how amazing it was! You would think or at least we thought we wouldn't have enough room for dessert...then walks out Jeff holding a tray that consisted of their toffee bread pudding, CC Brown's Hot Fudge Sundae, and a slice of the double layer chocolate cake. Our jaws dropped...just when we told ourselves we couldn't eat anymore we took a bite and about 10 minutes later that platter was cleaned! It was such a pleasure and treat to come here with such awesome customer service...from the minute you walk in the door to our waiter and all the way up to management! We cannot thank them enough for making this visit a wonderful experience. I can guarantee you we'll be back over and over again!"
"This popped up recently in the downtown neighborhood, and I'm sure glad it did because we need more places like this around here! First off, it's inside of Lawry's steak house - just walk to the left when you first walk in. You immediately feel a less formal, less stuffy vibe when you find it: The waiters aren't wearing the old-fashioned uniforms and there's a full bar. It's also cool that jutting into the dining area is a single chef working on your order in front of you. The service was amazing. Our waiter really knew his stuff and actually seemed really excited about the new menu options: he spent 3 minutes describing their best cocktail - the Smoked Negroni, which features small-batch, locally made gin that tastes like bourbon, smoked ice, and other goodies. It definitely has a smokey taste to it and I loved every drop. Next we shared a Roasted Meat Board - which is basically cuts of their best steaks to share. All of their menu focuses on shared plates. You pay full price for your first meat choice (the most expensive: $17 for the Lawrys Roasted Prime Rib), and then 10 bucks for any choices you make after that. We had the Roasted Prime Rib, Prime Angus Sirloin, and the Leg of Lamb. It was all perfectly cooked and delicious, and the various dips they came with complimented each meat well. This place makes a great date spot, or a good place to catch up with a friend in a laid back spot, with an excellent drink menu and delicious portions to share. I can't wait to go back."
Love this restaurant! Delicious prime rib and you have to try their Mac and cheese! Open on Sundays so you can have a nice hardy lunch!
"Stopped by for lunch, it was good! Had a beer flight and they had some really great options that I have never tasted before. My turkey sandwich was good, could have had more pickled red onions... But then again, I don't think there is such a thing and too many pickled onions. Service was good and the atmosphere was very nice, bonus for them playing rock music!!"
Beer selection is nice. Burger was excellent. The waiter was very friendly. Salad was a little heavy on the dressing but good.
"This is a really nice place. When we walked in it looked like a pub. Our waiter was very attentive with us explaining the menu & concept. We ordered the poutine and it was awesome. I recommend it to everyone. We also had the brussel sprout salad which was crisp and had a delicious dressing. The pastrami sandwich was warm, had crunchy giardinara, and melted cheese on a pretzel roll. What more could you ask for? For dessert we had the creme brulee. It was creamy and the topping was delicious. Refills of ice tea came with new lemon wedges without having to ask. That's the sign of great service to us! Ask to sit by the chefs. We had great conversation with them. All the staff were very friendly!"
"SideDoor made it onto my list several months ago when I was looking for places to eat poutine in Chicago. It took a long time for me to actually pay them a visit, but I'm definitely a fan now!I came in on a Thursday night around 7. I didn't know this until I actually arrived at the restaurant, but SideDoor is a sister restaurant to Lawry's Prime Rib - indeed the entrance to the restaurant is a.... side door to the Lawry's building. (Get it??)The ambiance is kinda reminiscent of a speakeasy. Atmosphere was lively but it wasn't too crowded (though I wouldn't be surprised if it's more bustling/rowdy on the weekends), so we were seated immediately.Our server was full of praise for the poutine and the Southern Smothered Pig sandwich, both of which had looked appealing to us from the get-go, so we ordered those along with the fish and chips and a side of the sweet potatoes. For the record, this was way too much food for two people to eat - the ""small plates"" really are entree-sized in my opinion. We had about half the fish and chips leftover, half the sandwich, and a good portion of the sweet potatoes (all of which we had wrapped up to take home) - and this was after I was pretty much ready to explode and my dining companion took one for the team by continuing to eat long after he was full.The poutine was awesome - I wasn't a fan of the pickled vegetables in it (just because I don't really like pickles no matter how you spin them), but the gravy and cheese curds were delicious. It's a HUGE serving size - you could probably split it four ways and it would still hold up as an appetizer. The fish and chips were amazing as well - when our server brought it to the table, it had obviously come straight out of the fryer and was piping hot. Really wish I had had more room in my stomach so I could have eaten more of this. I enjoyed the sweet potatoes too (even as someone who's not usually a big fan of them) - they were roasted with brown sugar, goat cheese, and candied pecans. Finally, for all the praise our server had given regarding the Southern Smothered Pig, it was a bit underwhelming - I didn't really think the pork tasted that good, though the kale was decent (ugh, I know, I'm judging myself too).Service was friendly and our server was quick with the water and soft drink refills. I will say that the food took some time to arrive at our table, even though it wasn't that busy that day. Overall a pleasant dinner, though, and I'd probably come back (even though I say that on every review and I almost never do - not because the restaurant isn't good, but because I usually always choose places I haven't been over places I have.)"
"I went here on a slow Wednesday and had the whole bar to myself.  They had a good selection of booze and beer and it was all mine to choose from.I got the pastrami sandwich based upon some pics I saw on here.. It was delish but super sloppy - there's a reason they call it the fork and knife pastrami sandwich but I'm a stubborn Frenchman who had to blaze his own trail.. After going through a few napkins and getting some weird looks from the bartenders, I decided to go the fork/knife route and things cleaned up considerably.  The taste was very good.. Just don't try to pick it up and eat it.I also had the cheese/meat plate where you choose from a bunch of different options - I don't know if I just have a knack for cheese plate decision making or if I got lucky, but mine was fantastic (pic attached).The service was great and very friendly as well.  The overall menu didn't pique my interest quite as much as others I've encountered in Chicago but the service and great taste of what I ordered gets them a 4 (very good!!)."
"This review is actually based on two different visits! I travel often, and love to yelp to find my next meal, so it is rare that I return to a place when I'm trying to explore many food options in a city like Chicago. I was staying at Omni, which was a very short walk away from SideDoor and made the second visit very convenient.Very simple & unassuming from the outside, I might have walked on if I was looking for a place to eat purely based on the exterior. But the interior is just the right amount of cozy with a splash of upscale.I sat at the bar for my first visit, and the bartender was very knowledgable and helpful in explaining the beers and menu items. I had a flight of beers (you pick 4 different beers, 5 oz. each), started with the deviled eggs, and ordered the fork & knife pastrami sandwich. Everything was absolutely delicious! The best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. It had the perfect amount of spicy & crunch (pickled jalapeños, carrots & cauliflower) from the sauce, and the pastrami was tender & flavorful. I finished the meal with the Great Divide chocolate oak aged yeti imperial stout instead of getting dessert. A solid choice!I went back with a friend for my second visit, and we were seated at a table. Our server was very knowledgable and enthusiastic! We both had a flight of beers, and started with the shrimp & grits. The grits were creamy and flavorful, and accented the (surprisingly spicy) shrimp well! We split the prime rib sandwich & an order of fries, with the prime rib completely living up to its expectations... The au jus was savory & an amazing compliment to the sandwich. The fries were served with a garlicky dipping sauce that we enjoyed.I will most definitely be stopping in again on my next visit to Chicago!"
"I come to Chicago every year and look forward to the variety of food that I can find. Through all of my years there was a restaurant that was always my favorite, Lawry's. When I found out that they had a pub/sports bar style restaurant on the side I had to go. I went twice in a period of about 3 days, tried the prime rib sandwich and also the burger. Both were amazing! If you go also try the ""Not Your Father's Root Beer"", it is simply amazing and truly tastes only like root beer. Very surprising beings it is over 10% alcohol."
Great atmosphere! The lounge/bar had plenty of seating. Food and drinks came quickly. The wedge salad and burgers were fantastic.
"We like the food and the service is fine, but twice now we have gone there at 9:45 or so and been turned away, even though they are ""open"" until 10:00.  Disappointing!!!"
"Started writing this review after my first bite. Everything was perfect. The ambience is sumptuous, great lighting, wood finishes, real gastropub vibe. I was dining alone and it was a great venue for that - lots of little nooks and crannies. The friend Brussel sprout salad was to die for. I wasn't sure how the sweet chili dressing would pair with the other ingredients, but it was spot on. The perfect blend of sweet, tart, crunchy, salty. Must have. The meat was also good, if slightly rare for my liking. I requested medium rare but it was certainly rare. Besides that, wonderful. Also great service. Would go back in a heartbeat."
Makes you believe in God.
Awesome small plates and beverages at the bar. Christiana is an amazing bartender and I'll be back for her signature cocktails the next time I'm in Chicago.
"A can't go wrong kinda place with an excellent beer list and food to match.Interior has an upscale British Pub feel in one section with high back chairs, couches and dim lighting while the main dining room has more of an open feel, although still dimly and cozily lit.Service was outstanding as I was seated in the bar / lounge area and my bartender was also my waiter. Never missed a beat. Always checking on me, refilling water glasses, etc. And doing it while tending to the main and service bars. A rare feat. Nice work.Food was delicious, albeit a bit pricey but hey, this is Mag Mile. Paid $13 for a house cured pastrami sandwich with homemade gardenia salad, served on a pretzel roll and house made pickles. Sides are purchased a la carte so you could drop a bit of coin if you are hungry.Beer list was well represented with a variety of styles, ABV's and local brewers. Prices ranged from $8 - $10 per glass but all high quality stuff. Tastes and flights are available and my server was well versed in the list and made a few spot on recommendations.Only reason this place isn't a 5 star is the a la caret thing. If I wanted to do that I'd go to Smith & Wollensky's. Management might be wise to charge me $17 and throw in some fries with my sandwich. Just felt a bit punitive when I'm dropping $13 on a sandwich and $10 on a beer.Other than that, no complaints. A winner in anyone's book."
"My friends wanted to take me somewhere for my birthday, and they knew I love Lawry's. Problem? They don't love Lawry's pricetag and I wasn't the one footing the bill. Enter: SideDoor, the solution. SideDoor had Lawry's delicious meats with an interesting spin and personality of its own, and we had a wonderful time. I've heard good things about the prime rib sadnwich, but all of us ended up ordering the fork & knife pastrami sandwich after our waitress and my friend Koji - a shining gem on the staff, if you have the opportunity to have him - really suggested it. The sandwich was absolutely spot on and hit the spot. Had a really great experience here and I'll be back, next time on my own tab."
Here on a quick weekend getaway during St. Patrick's day weekend. Great interior and cozy atmosphere. The wait staff was excellent!!!! ( Amy was our waitress) the food was awesome and had great portion sizes. Would definitely come back!!
"Came in during an off hour and I think they were changing service or shortstaffed because it took 20 minutes before my order was even taken. However after I settled in with one of their signature cocktails and ordered the prime rib sandwich (medium and the whipped horseradish was delicious) and the twice baked tater which was a surprising take on rich, whipped mash potatoes in the potato skin. It was very filling and I left full. Although I was reluctant with the service at first, my server was very nice and attentive throughout my meal. Will be back with friends."
9pm on a Wednesday night. Place was at around 25% capacity. Sat at the bar for ten minutes before any of the staff acknowledged I was sitting there. One of the bartenders talked to the party next to me and passed me multiple times before a different staff member handed me a menu without saying anything. I had hight hopes for SideDoor but when I'm ignored by the staff that does not make me want to come back. With the huge selection of craft liquors I thought their drink menu would be more extensive. My friend ordered the bartender's choice cocktail but the server walked away before even telling us what that was for the night. It was an odd experience and it's clear they're still working out the kinks after only being open 1 year.
"Your chefs are amazing. Never let them go.  Ate here on 6/13/15 and it was the best food I've ever had, and I'm from the south, so I've had some good food.  The service was slow(taking orders and closing checks, food comes very fast), but the chefs make up for it, worth the wait!!!"
"Based on bar tender's recommendation, ordered a duck confit - a customer ""favorite"".  The duck confit was subpar.  There was no crispy skin that one would normally expect. But, I won't give a one star just because of that.  It came with onion rings that were soft and cold.  Did they batch make the onion rings and forgot to microwave them before serving???  A disappointment to say the least."
"This is a great new addition to the River North area. SideDoor may have a slightly trendy atmosphere (the actual side door entrance, the modern yet rustic decor, etc.), but it really delivers in terms of great service and quality. I went here on a Tuesday evening and enjoyed the mac and cheese (soooooooo cheesy and delightful!) and a tall glass of Not Your Father's Root Beer (words cannot express how amazing that craft brew is...OMG). Our server was very attentive, and multiple people came over to our cozy table to ask how we were enjoying ourselves. The only negative was the music. It was all Top 40 and was playing very loudly. It really didn't match the atmosphere of the place. Other than that, it was a great experience. I'll definitely go back."
"Can't say enough about this place. go here!!!!! From service, to atmosphere, to the food..... An amazing restaurant!! Sean was our server - request him! The mac and cheese was so good...the best I've ever had. We got the brussel sprouts, short ribs, pork tenderloin nachos, turkey breast, and since we waited 15 mins before getting a drink order Sean brought us deviled eggs. Everything was so good! One of the best places I've ever been to."
"My wife and I stopped in for lunch the other day.  If I could give it 3.5 stars I would. The pastrami was pretty good as was the rest of the food, but it wasn't blow-you-away delicious and a bit overpriced. The atmosphere was a nice - dark and intimate.  The service was somewhat lacking: our server wasn't rude but he definitely didn't make much of an effort to be friendly and we kind of got the sense that he just didn't want to be there.  With all of the good food in Chicago this isn't a place that I'm rushing back to anytime soon."
"I just left here. It wasn't busy whatsoever, yet the service was subpar. I give it four stars because the beer list was pretty good for the area which this is located. The service started off slow, and gave us the impression we would have a bad experience - we didn't! It was nice, low key, great beer. Ordered the IPA pretzel bites for a snack. They carried a beer that is no longer in production, so that aids to the four star rating. I'd recommend checkin this place out."
Service was amazing. Started off with the chili it's to die for! Mac n cheese was really good. The pastrami sandwich was perfect for me...little spicy with the homemade giardinera and pretzel roll mmmmm! I will be back! Great lunch!
Tasty but expensive for what I got. I got the prime rib board and the meat was so thin and small it was impossible for them to get it mid rare. The meat was also so thin that it got cold quickly. I think I'll just stick with the regular Lawry's...!
Great Service and Decor! Delicious Food! I went there for lunch by myself. I had the Eggplant Press and the Brussels Sprouts. Just delightful! Portions are large so I ate too much but I wished I could have tried everything on the menu!
"Hit this place on Saturday with a part of 5.  We got seated quickly and ordered up some cocktails and food.   Cocktails were interesting, our party liked what they drank,  I found mine to be solid but not as good as I was hoping.  The staff was great and the waiter could tell I wasn't loving on my drink.  He switched it out with a tequila drink that had a smoked ice cube.  Now I forgot the name but that drink was outstanding.We ordered a pile of food and most were solid:Blue cheese potato chips - Good choice as it was solid for sharing and good tastePoutine - This was an outstanding example of poutine... a must ordercharcuterie, added prime rib, smoked ribs, and grilled sirloin - solidcheese - was pretty good, my cheese was a bit dry as if it was cut earlier in the daySticky Toffee pudding - AWESOME!!!  order thisOverall fun place, cool ambiance with the old mansion and an old school decor.  In a busy area so you can wander out into tourist land and hit some other fun places.  We left and went over to Sable for some killer cocktails after dinner."
"wonderful place.Deserve five stars.Strongly Recommend Cauliflower,very unique flavor."
"I have to say this place exceeded my expectations!  It's listed as a gastropub, but it's nice than that.  It is technically part of Lawry's but the prices aren't as insane and the ambiance is almost nicer.  Plus there was absolutely no wait at 6pm on New Years Eve!  Our waiter was very nice and even threw in a free dessert he accidentally ordered.  Made for a perfect way to end 2014!"
Watch your self on the TAP
"Whenever I'm in the area for work or shopping, i will be sure to drop in here.  A coworker and i had about an hour to eat lunch and thought we'd give this place a try, hoping they would be quick.  We ordered the   prime rib sandwich and pulled prime rib sandwich.  The sandwiches were cut in half,  so we each got to sample both.   The prime rib sandwich was good,  however the pulled prime rib was unbelievable.   Service was good and quick and we made it back to work in plenty of time.  Next time I'll be trying dessert!"
"We've been here for lunch every weekend for the past six weeks as a welcome break from visits at nearby NWMH.  While pricey, the food is excellent and you can't beat their prime rib.  Start with either the avocado mash or fried zucchini.  Fish and chips are a good bet as well.  The prime rib sandwich is now shaved, which is a much better fit.  House made chips are delicious, as is the homemade cheesecake which changes flavors often."
"I find trying brand new or new-ish restaurants incredibly titillating. There's something about the freshness of a recently opened establishment that really gets me going. I always like to see what a new restaurant has to offer. I like to check out the interior before there's wear and tear. I love seeing progress over time (if I return). And frankly, I enjoy going to places before others find out (later, there are huge lines, long waits, or impossible-to-get reservations). Side Door is a relatively new place having opened a couple months ago. I read about it and immediately bookmarked it knowing I was returning to Chicago. I also knew I was arriving late on a weeknight and needed a place with a *full* late night menu. Side Door is literally a side door... or, at least the entrance is located on the side. When you walk in, you immediately get the sense that this is one of those joints that feel ""Classic Chicago"" yet you're in the 21st century. When you enter through the second door, you'll notice a lounge with plush seating to the right, an adjacent bar, and straight ahead is the connection to Lawry's (Side Door's sister property). To the left is a well-appointed dining room. Simply, the decor is ""masculine"" in the sense that dark browns, harsh woods (not *literally* harsh), hard surfaces, tiles, and turn-of-the-century reproductions/furnishings predominate. To put it crudely, the style is reminiscent of a Restoration Hardware catalog spread. That said, it's simultaneously rustic and luxurious. Most stunning are these beautiful globe-shaped chandeliers hanging from above. The ceiling is a pattern of square-shaped frames. My boyfriend and I went in on a Wednesday evening around 9:45. To my surprise, it wasn't very busy. Perhaps because it's a weeknight, or perhaps because Side Door is new? Not really sure. At any rate, we were happy because we basically had the entire restaurant to ourselves... and because of that, we chose a private-ish booth partially covered in drapes. Behind us was a lovely wallpaper that was kinda ""British equestrian club meets Anthropologie home decor section."" Our server introduced himself and was great... but throughout the night proved to be very *very* chatty. Again, I think because we were the only table, we got a lot attention. Nevertheless, I appreciated his enthusiasm talking about the food, their food philosophy, and his recommendations (which were very very thorough). Alright, in terms of food... we started off with the French onion soup. The beef broth for the soup had a lot of depth. The onions were sweet and cooked until tender. The Gruyere over the sourdough was tasty, but it was very hard to cut through the bread without having soup spill over. While the soup was good, I've had better. We also ordered the Lawry's Wedge salad. This is such a classic I couldn't not get it! Crisp baby iceberg, *beef* bacon, blue cheese, scallions, egg, and their classic ""Vintage"" dressing (similar to an Italian dressing) made for a very satisfying starter. These are very basic ingredients yet they managed to up the ante and delivered a winner! For our entrees, I ordered the Side Door Cheeseburger with all the fixings (avocado, bacon jam, roasted jalapeno). I really recommended adding these items because I couldn't imagine this burger without them. The bacon jam was particularly outstanding with the 7 oz. of Angus beef. The brioche was fantastic -- buttery and the top bun glimmered. The House Smoked Pastrami sandwich was also delicious. The brisket was fantastic and I loved the rarebit! It was served on a pretzel roll so you can imagine it being very filling. The giardiniera added both a lovely flavor and color to the sandwich. Lastly, we shared the Pretzel Bread Pudding. My boo and I have a weakness for bread pudding and even if we're stuffed, that is one dessert we WILL make room for. Our server raved about the pudding... and as he should. It was similar to a French Toast -- but for dessert. Dried apricots, pistachio, and whisky (!) caramel topped things off. Even though we didn't ask for it, our server was kind enough to bring out two glasses of milk to eat with the bread pudding. Unfortunately, he came with the glasses during our last bite. Nevertheless, that was still a lovely gesture. On the whole, I recommend Side Door to anyone who loves gastropubs. I personally seek out New American restaurants all the time; it's one of my favorite types of cuisine. Side Door is one of those places that seem to ask: ""Why mess with the classics?"" I'm so glad they feel that way. I'm definitely going back."
"SideDoor was on my to-visit list for about a year, but I only got around to visiting recently. For anyone in the same boat, here are three reasons to bump up its priority:1. Not Your Father's Root Beer (and float). It tastes just like the standard root beer from your childhood, but it's 10% alcohol. Dangerous, delicious, and difficult to find (as SideDoor is one of the few places that serves it). That alone is enough to warrant a visit.2. The desserts. The Bag of 'Nuts (doughnut bites shaken up in cinnamon sugar by the waiter, with bourbon caramel dipping sauce on the side) were incredible, and I liked the Chocolate Peanut Tart until they took it off the menu (salted caramel, ganache, peanuts, chocolate crust, and whipped cream. Put it back, put it back!!).3. No wait for seating. They don't take reservations, but don't let that scare you. I went for Sunday brunch during Lollapalooza weekend (when ~100,000 extra people are clogging the city), and I went to dinner at 7:00 on two standard Friday nights. I didn't need to wait at all, any time, and the service is quick without making you feel rushed.Extras: The bacon, mac and cheese, and pretzel-roll pastrami sandwich are all really good. I split them with the boyfriend and we were still full by the end. I wasn't really into the poutine, but my dad got it and liked it. The beer pretzels kick butt, too. The only thing I'd want to add is a bit more more selection on the menu."
"I wish I could do 3.5 stars. Drink selection - great. Burger - phenomenal. Service... ehhhhh... not so good. Thing is... I didn't expect that I would have to pay $8 for a side of fries (but I knew it before I ordered... so whatever). BUT... I did not expect that  ""on the rocks"" would add $2.50 to my bill! Seriously!  But hell... when you're in the seat and you've eaten your share you gotta pay the bill. Guy next to me also asked about the pour of whiskey he got and there was just a matter of fact response... no apology or anything. For me... when I asked about the ""error"" on the bill, the bar keep indicated he poured more when asked for rocks. HOWEVER, the volume he quoted in my response was different than the other guy! What the hell."
"Excellent fresh sliced pastrami sandwich. Great service, great food, and decent prices for downtown. A little hard to find though as it is actually on Rush, not Ontario."
"SideDoor is great. I went with a co-worker. We were in town for a conference and were looking for something off the beaten path, not touristy and unpredictable.  SideDoor hit the spot. The venue is small, open and has an intimate ambiance.  And the service is superb ... attentive but not intrusive, informative but not routine. The menu is unique and well designed.  The items are tasty and filling.  We both had the pastrami sandwich with stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini for appetizers.  Their sandwiches are large and require a fork and knife. The food is very rich and full of flavor which makes it great with wine. The wine selection is even better. Being from California, I really appreciated the server being able to describe the wines on the menu and suggesting a pairing.This place reminds me a lot of a neighborhood spot in San Francisco called Kezar.  They are both cozy, friendly and serve up good wholesome food."
Amazing place for lunch.  Recommend Lawyers Prime rib sandwich. Spicey bloody mary great.
"Really wanted to like this place since it was right next to our hotel and it was the first place my girlfriend and I tried for her first time visiting the city. However, 10-15 minutes goes by and we were only served a glass of water after still having not met our server. We ended up leaving with no one trying to hold us back or concerned we had gotten up to leave. Good thing my gf likes me because this was NOT an impressive date experience!"
"Happened upon this place for lunch, and so glad that we did! Absolutely delicious food and drinks with a great, fun atmosphere.Highly recommend anything prime rib on the menu and their fish n chips!Will return!!"
"I had lunch recently and was pleasantly surprised! The former Lawry's sandwich bar was no frills, but tasty. Now it has ambience and delicious food.We started with the chips and Blue Cheese sauce. Decadent and yummy. I had the smoked Pastrami  with cheese sauce. So good, I have the other half stashed in my freezer for a rainy day. We shared Mac and cheese as well.Our server was great, knew the menu and made good recos.Excellent lunch spot, I will return."
Find this restaurant on Rush Street. Informal and great food.  Have the Carver ' s Trio (meat plate) and the Fork & Knife Pastrami sandwich and finish with a Hot fudge sundae. Delicious! !
"Just a wonderful lunch. Everything was very tasty. This place is such a hidden gem. I have walked past it every week since they opened and finally walked in, I am upset I waited this long. Excellent food, friendly service. Highly recommend the poutine and the knife & fork pastrami."
For what this restaurant is trying to do it performed perfectly on my visit! Every dish was very flavorful and the service was excellent also this beer selection was very eclectic. The server said both food & beer selection changed quite often. They are open all day long with a full menu so it can be great if you missed the normal lunch hour. Finally most of the dishes are rather large in size so order with your brain  and wallet rather than your stomach.
"This place is okay. Food is decent, if overpriced. Ambience is comfortable. Service is terribly slow. Beer is expensive"
"Just finished an amazing dinner here. Started with poutine, potatoes, stuffed mushrooms, pretzels, and pear/pecan sort of salad. All great- poutine was generous portion. Split the six pack (tried all meats except turkey). Beef Tenderloin and PR were my favs. Get real deAl horseradish. Sides: mac and cheese is tomato and bacon studded with bread crumbs , fries are perfection (salty, crispy). Sticky Toffee pudding is on point - has raisins and fresh whipped cream. I don't know beer but my brother in law does, and he was thrilled by the menu. Service was as good as it gets. Go here now. Chill atmosphere, casual , I'll be back when I'm in chi next"
"Eh, this really wasn't the best choice for dinner but it wasn't that worst either. I was out with friends one night and we couldn't decide on a restaurant so we whipped out our phones and started checking out places on Yelp. We found SideDoor and thought their menu looked diverse enough to have something for everyone. Once we walk in we are immediately seated and the restaurant is beautiful. There are a lot of awesome copper accents and everything feels very intimate. Once we are seated our waiter comes by, now this is where the craziness begins. I am usually never the Yelper that gets on here to air out a waiter because I feel like an individual hired without psychological assessment should not entirely represent a restaurant, but man this guy was something else. He begins his speech giving us (what I assume) the typical run down for new comers. After that he says he will give us a few minutes to look over the menu. After a few minutes he returns to take our order, I order the chicken wings and pretzels. My friend orders the fish and chips, and then my other two friends ATTEMPT to order an order of nachos for each of them. The waiter immediately tells them that they should consider splitting because the nacho orders were on the larger side, then shows us the size of the dish. My friends decide they would still like two orders, but I guess this waiter really was not going to allow it, he continually tries to persuade them only to order one order to the point where he is now interrupting and talking over them as they try to explain they are both really hungry so finally after what seemed like them being harassed into only one order they just give up and let him have his way. I must say this is the first time I have ever been to a restaurant where you are convinced to order less of their food. More food = More income = More expensive bill = HIGHER TIP FOR THE WAITER. After a short period of time my wings are brought out as well as the pretzels. Thank god the wings came with ranch or else I wouldn't have been able to eat half of the order because they were severely bland. They also provided lemon which helped the flavor a bit but the recipe for these definitely needs a few additions in the spice department because there was an extreme absence in flavor. The pretzel bites on the other hand were pretty darn good and the honey mustard was great too.Now heres another issue, how was I able to finish my food before my friends received their SINGLE order of nachos? The waiter came by 4 times, each time saying, ""just 10 more minutes on those nachos,"" so you do the math. What about making nachos takes 40 minutes? By the time they got there my friends were hungry enough to eat three orders. The waiters ""suggestion"" of splitting was very unappreciated because the order was definitely suitable for one diner's entree, or maybe an appetizer for two people, but split by two people for a main course the portion was far too small. When asked about taste, they both agreed they definitely worth a 30 minute wait.Okay so there was a silver lining, the waiter did bring out a free desert with the check because of how long the nachos took. This was nice and the desert was good but we still had a lot of trouble getting over the service and some of the flavorless dishes we had. Perhaps things would have gone better with a different waiter that would allow us to order as much food as we liked but I don't think I would give them a second chance."
"This was the first restaurant my boyfriend and I ate at when we arrived in Chicago late in the evening.The restaurant was almost empty, save for a couple guys watching a football game on the big screen. I loved the decor and whole ""key"" theme. The bartender sat us near the TV. He promptly brought us menus and water. The menu had a lot of good things going for it, but since it was late and we didn't want to eat too heavy we ordered the Lawry's Prime Rib Sandwich (the bartender recommended Prime Rib since it was connected to Lawry's) and the Chips & Dip because (#1. White Cheddar #2. Prosciutto). The food was brought to us rather quickly and we dug in. Loved the presentation of the chips & dip with the paper cone made out of menu paper. The dip was good, but nothing particularly special. I think my favorite part of the whole Prime Rib Sandwich dish was the whipped cream horseradish. I'm not a huge fan of straight up horseradish so it was nice to have it in a whipped form, which made the horseradish taste a lot lighter. The sandwich was decent, but overpriced for the amount of prime rib you get.I would definitely go back and try other items on the menu!"
"I went to the Side Door Saturday night with my girlfriend after reading a few reviews. It's a cool little place that is much more modern and updated than the place it's attached too. We had the prime rib tray and the porkbelly after having a couple drinks. The meat tray was delicious and i wouldn't hesitate to have it again. The pork belly was good but the cheese grits that came with it were the best I've had in a long time. I especially enjoyed the ""Not Your Fathers Rootbeer"" that was 10%abv. I wish I had room to have it in a Root beer float for desert (which they offer). We are absolutely going back next time in town."
"Took my mom and grandmother while they were in town. Food was disappointing and unremarkable despite sounding good -- no one out of the four of us had any desire to finish our meals and we had walked in hungry! IMPOSSIBLE to flag down our waiter for assistance (missing fork, water refill, etc). Won't waste my time or money here again."
"Lovely atmosphere but they close at 11 on a Saturday?! Bartenders were unfriendly and seemed inconvenienced by us trying to order a drink 10 minutes before last call, they stood at opposite end of the bar talking to each other for so long it took us longer to check out than drink our one quick drink!"
"Not a bad find - nice cozy bar serving traditional pub fare with a focus on prime rib.  Interesting if you are into that sort of thing.  I went for the fish and chips - not bad, but I would suggest thy stick to a more traditional white fish.  Lake perch doesn't really class it up.  Overall, a good place to grab a drink and something tasty to eat on a cold day.  I would probably return."
"I wanted to love this place, as it was highly recommended.  I don't understand what the rave was for the Prime Rib sandwich...it was ok, not life changing.  My friend ordered the burger but that too was not that great.   The ambience was nice, our waitress fabulous.  Wish the food would have lived up to all the hype."
I've been back from Chicago for 4 days now and I can't stop thinking about the Mac and cheese they made! Besides that we had a great waiter and the dining rooms were beautiful. I'll be back.
Great place! Very knowledgable staff and delicious food prepared where you can see it. Highly recommend.
"Wow.  Went to SideDoor for a good beer and some pub food.  Ended up with some amazing beer...complete with a back story from a manager that really knows his world class beer assortment. Next we had the pulled pork nachos, huge plate, every bite was delicious.  Split an order of brussels sprouts with Neuske's bacon...even if you've heard the stories about evils of Brussels Sprouts...try these...amazing.  Finally, the pastrami sandwich makes most pastrami seem like bologna.  It is simply delicious.  Our primary server, Laura R, was amazing.  Would recommend her highly for recommendations and attentiveness."
"Came in for beers and some food. Ended up ordering Pulled Pork Poutine. It is listed on the menu under small plates but the portion was huge. This really should be listed as entry in my opinion. Loved the beers, loved the food. Interior was good and wait stuff was great as well."
"This was out first stop after we checked in at our hotel, and we didn't regret it. We simply picked the closest place with a decent beer list and a good looking menu. Our waitress was friendly, welcoming, and eager to recommend some local beers. Beyond the drinks, we split the shaved veggie salad and the house smoked pastrami. They were both excellent. The veggies were very fresh, and the vinaigrette was perfectly tart. I have a high bar for pastrami, but my expectations were met. One might think that a restaurant in an old mansion might be stuffy, but we found the interior to be spacious yet warm. Even with all the options around, if we were in Chicago for a few more days we surely would have returned."
"Stumbled upon this place and what a pleasant surprise! Food, beer and service were all excellent! Would definitely return."
"Went to the side door in July with my family. It's a cozy atmosphere with a fine dining feel. Most of the menu items are for sharing or you can get a bunch of small plates. We got 2 salads to share for 5 people and then a charcuterie and cheese plate. Everything was presented very nicely and you definitely have to be prepared to try something different. We also got a meatball dish. All in all those 4 plates for 5 people was certainly not filling so come prepared to spend a good amount of money on your meal. Also, the drinks were overpriced although they did have an eclectic selection. All in all it's a good gastropub, but not particularly my favorite because everything was good, but nothing blew me away. We came here on vacation so I probably won't have the opportunity to go here again, but if I lived in Chicago I probably would only have gone here the one time."
"Very nice atmosphere, very tasty food that came out incredibly fast. The prices aren't too high for Chicago downtown. I am definitely coming back :)"
"I've been here a few times with some of my friends from school. The name SideDoor comes literally from how they built a sidedoor entrance to Lawry's The Prime Rib to create a more casual restaurant.As a Gastropub, the servers here really stress that it's a restaurant for mixing food and drink, and they don't hesitate to offer drink pairing with the dishes that you order. They are also a fan of sharing dishes family-style, but I find that some of the dishes - the sandwiches in particular - can't really be shared. I haven't yet tried the Meat Boards, which seem to be the main selling point of the restaurant; essentially, these are full meat cuts that come out in slices on a platter to share. I'll have to come back in the future to try these!They also do brunch, but I haven't been able to try the brunch menu yet.What I have tried:1) Prime Rib Sandwich - My favorite dish so far2) House Smoked Pastrami - I'm not usually a fan of Pastrami, but wow, this sandwich was incredible!3) Fish and Chips 4) Eggplant Panini5) Rabbit Pasta6) Mac and Cheese - my waiter told me that after I tried this mac and cheese, I would be dissatisfied with any other mac and cheese in the future. Unfortunately for me, he was correct. It was delicious!They also have a giant list of beers on tap, and have a number of house - cocktails. I've had a few of the beers that my waiters have recommended, and have been happily satisfied with what I've tried."
The GOODQuiet local ambience Bistro cooking bar behind Excellent kale salad and Guac dipGet the appetizer portion prime rib (filling)The BAD Poor and slow service Seating is limited
Great food!  The quality is really high.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the ribs and the prime rib was the best I have ever had.
"Great ambiance. Great food. Great beer list. Great service. I came in on a quiet Monday night and was quickly seated by the open chef station. The waiter served me promptly and was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks, offering suggestions and his favorites. The menu apparently changes regularly, which is good to keep in mind. If you're looking for a mid-range priced restaurant with unique dishes and a wonderful atmosphere, you can't get much better than Sidedoor in downtown Chicago."
"I come to Chicago a lot for work and always stay at the Chicago Marriott so I'm always looking for good places close by.  The Side Door is definitely a place to visit. Great ambiance, wonderful crafted cocktails and the food was amazing.  I had the pastrami sandwich which was probably the best pastrami I've ever had. The only negative was that it was messy and I ended up finishing it with a fork and knife.  I had the fries as a side and the seasoning was spot on for both the fries and mayo dip. While I didn't have a beer the micro brew selection was impressive and the bartender knew Hus stuff when is came to beer. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is this is my first time here."
"I liked the food and the service,  the style was so nice and cozy. The only thing I didn't like was the food portion it was not quite enough,  satisfying though but you would feel hungry couple hours after that maybe."
"My boyfriend and I were in Chicago on a weekend trip, and after hanging out at a rooftop bar on a Friday night, we looked on our phones to see which restaurants were nearby.We saw that Sidedoor was fairly new and had received good reviews, so we ventured over a few blocks to try it out. There are no windows in the restaurant (from what I could see), but I don't mind that, as it definitely adds to the ambiance.We were promptly seated, and our waiter, Sean, came right over the introduce himself. First and foremost, Sean was a terrific waiter! So incredibly nice, and willing to make suggestions based on what we were in the mood for. I wish I lived in Chicago just so I could visit this restaurant more and be waited on by Sean.We ordered some delicious wine, and had the blue cheese potato chips...ohmygoodness they were awesome! For dinner, we ordered a lot - our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs that night. We had the poutine, which was amazing, and the angus sirloin. We actually ordered the leg of lamb as well, but then as we were chowing down on the other dishes, we decided to cancel the last order. However, we weren't too stuffed for dessert, and we had the sticky toffee pudding. Fantastic! All in all, Sidedoor was great, and if I'm ever in Chicago again, I'll be sure to stop by here!"
"Delicious seasonal menu made for sharing. Extensive, well crafted beer, wine, whiskey/scotch list. Great ambience that begins when you stumble upon the nonchalant door leading inside. Excellent service. We shared the grilled wings and a meat board. I would highly recommend the wings- they were very simply done and excellent. We will be back very soon."
"What a disappointment! The entrance is welcoming and we enjoyed a cocktail while waiting for a table. We ordered three items to share. Waited w-a-y too long for some very dull, uninspired stuffed mushrooms; at least they were hot. After another long delay, probably 20 minutes, our wedge salad arrived. It was tasty. Upon finishing our salad the waiter comes to the table and says, ""we have a slight hiccup...we've run out of hamburger."" What? Really? Hamburger? This is Chicago. How do you run out of hamburger on a Saturday in Chicago?Don't waste your time!"
"We were looking for somewhere without a wait on a Saturday night. SideDoor came up with great reviews and they didn't disappoint! Connected to Lawrys, you enter literally through the side door. :) They serve Lawrys prime rib as an entree or as a sandwich (which we had and it was incredible). The shared everything between the 4 of us...the pretzel bites, chips and dip, wedge salad, cheeseburger and aforementioned prime rib sandwich as we'll as the brisket sandwich. Let's put it this way, you can't go wrong. It's yummy and quiet and dimly lit so you can have a glass of wine and long conversations with good friends...Enjoy!"
"SideDoor is the new, trendy little sister of Lawry's steakhouse. It's a gastropub serving rich delights like duck confit poutine, mac n' cheese with smoked bacon, delux burgers, and an in-house cured brisket pastrami sandwich that does not disappoint (according to nearby patrons). I enjoyed the chef's selection of locally-sourced cheeses- quite a generous sampling accompanied with the necessary jams and preserves. Do people still get excited about cheese plates? Well, I do when quality is so apparent. The cocktails and beer list were robust including interesting selections from Deschuttes on tap, and 22oz bottles of even more rare options. The bartenders (who really were cinematically lovely ladies) assured that they often feature tap takeovers to mix things up. And speaking of mixing, the cocktails were refreshing. I've never had ""smoked ice"" before, but you can try it in the smoked negroni featuring FEW gin that you'd swear was bourbon...it's aged in bourbon barrels. The ambiance on a Monday night was super chill...we got a seat at the bar immediately and could have gotten a table. The decor fits with the rest of Lawry's, so think classic gentlemen's salon with modern finishes. It might not seem like the spot to go when everyone else is hoping to lounge on sunny outdoor patios, but the dark and cavernous environment is certainly a respite from the overglossed blur of nearby Michigan Avenue."
"This review should be considered preliminary, as I strongly suspect I came here on an off day - they were trying out their new brunch menu and appeared a bit understaffed.That said, this experience was a weirdly mixed bag.  My husband and I were seated immediately, and had a few minutes to peruse the menu before our server showed up.  Said server was extremely friendly and enthusiastic about the food, which always gives me hope for a restaurant - if the people who interact with customers every day care that much, chances are the people who actually make it do as well.  My expectations were further heightened by the classy decor and the spotless open-view kitchen.When our food arrived, however, it was...not great.  Don't get me wrong, it was good!  But in Chicago, and especially the Magnificent Mile, you expect ""great"" almost as a matter of course.  My pastrami sandwich was well-seasoned and the pretzel bun a great touch, but it was frankly drowning in cheese sauce, to the point where I couldn't even pick it up.  My husband's prime rib sandwich was nicely done, but it was a little bland, and the provided horseradish had almost no spice at all.  (He did say the au jus was beyond reproach, however.)They still would have gotten a four-star review, as the food was still tasty and the service so excellent, except...after we were finished eating, our server disappeared.  So we ended up sitting there for a good ten minutes with empty plates and empty glasses.  To his credit, our server apologized for the wait and explained his absence, and asked if we wanted dessert, which he was equally enthusiastic about.  We decided to order the creme brulee.Aaaand...waited another fifteen minutes for it to arrive.  (When it did, it was good, but again, not great - the caramelized top was barely a paper's thickness.  Tasty vanilla custard, though.)  Needless to say, I was pretty unimpressed at that point.I'm not sure I'd recommend this place based on that experience, or at least not their brunch service.  But it's got potential - the decor is nice, food was perfectly good, and if they can iron out the kinks in service they'll be on par with everyone else in the area.  So, three stars for now, with an update promised if I decide to try them again."
"Tried the burger with all the toppings, the duck poutine, house pastrami sandwich, and the bread pudding. All were great. The service was excellent as well. Will definitely be back to try the prime rib sandwich!"
We went for a drink and ended up having four. Christiana is a great bartender. Drink and wine list were impressive and the bartenders were knowledgeable in case you wanted something that was not on the list.  Appetizers were good. Prices were fair for the concept and the neighborhood. I had one of the best cocktails I've had at this place- we will definitely be back!
I am in town for business trip and was looking for some unique food at a great price and found it.  Side door atmosphere is upscale pub with chef menu at a reasonable price.  Extensive beer menu as well. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in this area again.
"Recently visited here for lunch.  I am a sucker for historic buildings in this fare city of ours, so I was an immediate fan of the ambience and decor.  But the food was also satisfying, which was kind of a shock.Salad - thinly sliced carrot, beet, celery, apple, possibly parsnip. Shredded aged cheddar on top which just not necessary, though. Just because you're a technically a pub doesn't mean you need cheese in every single dish. All in all a beautiful and delicious salad. Big portion, by the way. Might want to share.Poutine - I have never seen poutine on a menu and not ordered it.  It's a problem.  It's the reason these last 15 pounds just won't come off.  This one had shredded prime ribeye and a thick, rich gravy and topped with gardinier.  Also, the fries were not soggy, which is key in a good poutine.  It tasted exactly like an Italian beef sandwich.  If there was ever a Chicago-style poutine, this would be it. Mac and Cheese - Loved the fact that it had gouda, which added a nutiness.  Loved the diced tomatoes, which added much-needed acidity to cut through the fat.  But just in general, a little runny and not spectacular. This dish gets two stars.There is absolutely nothing blatantly wrong with this restaurant, but if it weren't owned by Lawry's, it would have closed by now.  You just can't compete with the rest of the options in the neighborhood.  I would suggest Sidedoor as a good alternative for something on the inexpensive side."
"I went here with a friend on a Saturday night and was not disappointed. They don't accept reservations and I was pleasantly surprised to be seated right away (though I suspect that once word gets out that might not be the case). The atmosphere is warm and cozy and more laid back than neighboring Lawry's. We had the shaved vegetable salad which was delicious and also a generous portion for what it was. The stuffed shrimp were good though not memorable, but the true highlight was the SideDoor Sampler of cheese and charcuterie. We mixed three cheeses (April Showers cow, Robiola sheep and Great Hill Bleu) with serrano ham and salmi. Each portion was more than generous and the presentation was lovely. I also appreciated the quality and quantity for (what I thought) was a reasonable price. I love all things cheese and charcuterie and this is definitely one of the top spots I've been to in a while.My only critique is with the service. After we were seated our waiter filled up our water glasses while introducing himself before disappearing for what seemed like forever. We saw him take care of another table that was seated after us so it seems like he may have been confused and/or overwhelmed. Our wine also didn't come until after the salad arrived so pacing was a bit off too. On several occasions the manager (or so it seemed like) came over to check on us which made up for the overall experience. Overall SideDoor is a great spot and one of my new favorites in the city. You get high quality food is a great setting which makes for the perfect evening out."
"SideDoor - not the most unique of names, but they're also not trying to hard. The name does its job and gets out of the way. The same can be said of the restaurant itself - it doesn't try to be something that it's not. What you see is what you get - and what you get is amazing. This time around, I didn't opt for the meat board since I was craving a sandwich, but the prime rib sandwich was delectable. The gruyere mac n cheese wasn't overly rich and sodium laden as lesser options tend to be. The grilled seafood salad was more of a mixed bag - seafood good; cabbage so-so. The look of the place is polished; the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Great service-staff, and overall, a nice experience. I'm looking forward to going back to try the meat boards - I'm sure that if the follow-up experience is as good as the first, I'll be ready to give them the final star."
"Good food, although I second, third and fourth the Yelpers who've said the service here is crappy. I visited this past weekend and heard from nearly every employee in there (waiter, manager-looking-dude) about how inconsiderate or otherwise sucky their respective colleagues were. It was kinda sad, honestly. However, they were telling the truth because the service sucked. Their Prime Rib Poutine is dayum good, but not with a side of the ""mom and dad are fighting again"" vibe they have going on in there. I would choose other places in the area before coming back here (and will)."
"Nice addition to Lawrys with this new concept within the same location.  Really liked the more casual atmosphere here compared to the main dining room at Lawrys. I felt the expanded menu here is much better than Lawrys, even though you can still get prime rib.  Our group had the deviled eggs and potato skins to start and both were good.  Had the carving board trio which was also really good.  Also, had the prime rib sandwich and Mac n cheese side.  Great.  For dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding and ice cream sundae.   Pudding was not as good as Gordon Ramsays but still pretty good.Service was also much improved over the past few times we have been at Lawrys.  My new preference is SideDoor over Lawrys.  Give it a try."
Good Drinks. Good Food. Fun place. Great place to eat when visiting Chicago and in the area.
Lawry's quality on a budget.  This place is impossibly good.  Curry cauliflower and prime rib sandwich (it's the only meat I eat as a pseudo-vegetarian!)
"My wife and I (and our 1.5yo daughter) ate here twice this week.  We're in Chicago on vacation, and we ate at this place early in our stay.  Since then, of all the wonderful places we ate this week, so we just had to go back to this place again tonight!  The experience was beyond wonderful.  Our daughter eats table food, but she still acts like every other 1.5yo at times.  The SideDoor staff, including the restaurant manager Jeff were incredibly accommodating and welcoming of a ""non-traditional"" client to their gastropub - they even gave her a toy on our first trip. The Food - wow.  Words just won't do it any justice so I'm not going to try. Over the course of both trips, We had the LWF salad (twice), fish and chips, cream of asparagus soup (was prepared table-side),  bacon Mac-n-cheese, the lamb and braised short ribs on meat boards, an assortment of cheeses, and sticky toffee pudding.  The best of the bunch was the lamb, but all of it was unbelievably amazing. The Service - as with a previous reviewer, we had Shawn and he was excellent.  The second time in we requested him specifically because he was so good with us and with our daughter. The dining experience is very relaxed - we ordered something and ate it, the ordered some more, etc. until we were completely stuffedThe Price - considering the quality of the food, this place is an excellent deal.  The bill for each evening was almost exactly $100 including alcohol; of the foodie-focused places we ate while on vacation, this was actually one of the cheapest!  Considering its location just off the Magnificent mile, I couldn't believe how cheap the bills were considering we ate continuously for more than 2 hours each visit!!While this place is apparently fairly new, I'm guessing that before long it's going to be packed beyond belief, so I'd try it soon before the word gets out too much. p.s. - their beer selection is also quite good.  We had the La Trappe quadruple (twice) and absolutely loved it."
"Excellent food, good value, and an amazing beer selection. It's a small restaurant and is almost always packed, so come prepared to wait for an open table."
Waitstaff is accommodating and helpful! I joined a group of friends and the staff hurried with a chair for me! The waiter gave a wonderful wine recommendation! Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.
"I came here for lunch expecting to get the Lawry's ale and sandwich bar and instead being told SideDoor was it's replacement and needless to say I was disappointed. While the meat is still the same excellent Lawry's fare, the prices have been raised and the feel is very different. They are shooting for a pub feel but the prices on the menu don't match that. With the ale and sandwich bar I still has Lawry's carvers offering any cut off meat, and the Lawry's salad and now if you want prime rib the Lawry's cut is the only option and you get fries instead of chips or a side of mashed. I would rate it lower but the food is still high quality."
"Great place! The ambiance is nice, great for groups as the noise level isn't obnoxious like a lot of other restaurants like this one. Must try the meat boards! Prime rib and lamb are awesome!...moist and super tender.  Mac and cheese was also very good. Fish and chips: fish, not so great, chips - very good.  More recently, a friend and I visited to try their pork belly.  YUM!  Great taste and texture.  We also ordered the Koji sandwich to share.  It was fantastic!  Super soft fluffy bread and the ingredients that made up the sandwich made it delicious!  I would have liked a little more slices of beef given the price.  The stuffed mushrooms were also pretty good as well."
"One of the BEST we found this weekend! Very friendly, knowledgeable staff. We had the Side Door Cheeseburger, Crab Cakes, Grouper and Grilled corn on the cob, The most scrumptious Baked Mac-N-Cheese! And guacamole and pita chips. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"A great surprise inside a well known Lawry's Prime Rib.  It's a proper gastropub.  Their pastrami sandwich is a must have.   You don't get a pound of beef like you would at Manny's or any other Jewish deli, but their cut of house smoked beef makes up in quality for the quantity.  Pork tenderloin and the charcuterie selection are excellent as well.  Be sure to sure to try some of the Lawry's menu crossovers, such as the blue cheese wedge salad and stuffed mushrooms. Should you chose to sit at the bar, their bartenders, under the diligent supervision of a local mix guru Kristianna C., will take care of you with a well executed selection of specialty craft cocktails."
"I wasn't impressed.  Food was ok.  Service was slow despite being essentially empty. On arrival they tell you they are a ""gastropub"" as though the designation meant something.There are better choices nearby. Keep walking."
"The Side Door had some of the nicest bar staff you every could meet. They also have a pretty good bottle selection. It was snowing outside and the bar was warm and conducive to what we needed. The staff took our coats and our money as we spent a couple of hours sampling different stuff that we can't get in CA. I didn't know it was part of Lawry's until leaving. Had fun, would definitely come back."
"Absolutely remarkable! The avocado mash was phenomenal but the experience was definitely made by our server, Sean. He was knowledgable, personable and 110% on top of his game! What an experience all in all! Will definitely come back! Make sure you call ahead to have him as his server and pair your visit with the Lock, Stock & Barrel whiskey!"
"So excited they are here in Chicago! I no longer have to wait to be home in CA to get my fix. Excellent cocktail selection and yummy bites to share. The newly opened Chicago location has a very similar menu selection and vibe as the one in CDM. While there are a plethora of options, it seems we always end up with a lot of apps and charcuterie plate. Never disappoints!"
"Loved the decor/atmosphere, and our waitress gave excellent service.  I ordered a bloody mary which was not up to par for my taste buds.  The wedge salad with shrimp was to die for...very balanced flavor and loved the creamy dressing.  The kale caeser salad with chicken was great too, and my bf and I shared the poutine.  The poutine was yummy, however for me I would have skipped the giardinara on it, but that simply is a personal preferance."
So delicious and the staff was so friendly! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a cozy restaurant with character! Great burger and amazing fries!!
I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service. Kudos to all the staff they are EXCELLENT! The drinks were amazing as well. I'm almost at five stars but fell one short because I thought the food was little too greasy. It slightly went over decadent to too much.
"Had a nice emergency lunch here with my wife upon arriving to Chicago for the holiday and we took a stroll down michigan ave.  we had no plan but stumbled upon Lowrys side bar - I had always wanted to try lowery's.   She had the sweet potatoes and Mac n cheese - unreal.  I got the prime rib sandwich - prime rib was tender, it was ok, the aus jus was awesome. I mostly just enjoyed the atmosphere in a nice relaxing lunch and a flight of their unique draft beers of which Renee actually got a full glass of the Not Yur Fathers Rootbeer becuz she liked it so much-too sweet for me.  Overall a nice atmosphere and lunch."
We had a wonderful light dinner with high quality food and excellent service. Our waiter JP answered all our menu questions and made spot on recommendations.
"My wife and I had been traveling all day and were looking for some comfort food. We found it in spades at Side Door. Awesome little dining space. We split the prime rib sandwich and the poutine. They were both amazing.  My only regret was that there wasn't more space in my stomach for more courses.  Server, JP, was incredibly nice and helpful and even the music was just right. We're hoping to make it back one more time before we leave town."
"I can't believe that mine is the first review since this establishment opened a few weeks ago.  This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in recent memory!It was a total fluke that I chose this restaurant tonight;  I visit Chicago from time to time, and I'm in town for a guest lecture and conference, and this time am staying at the Four Points hotel across the street.  Since my blood has thinned (I now live in California), and it's freeeezing outside, I didn't want to go far.  My first wimpy thought was to consider the restaurants that are attached to the hotel, but both seemed a bit too bright and lacked ambiance.  I took a short walk while running errands and SideDoor seemed pretty interesting from the outside.  There was a sign hanging on the outside: ""SideDoor now open!"" so I walked up the stairs,  gave the door a pull and felt the lock rattle.  Jokingly, I thought to myslef, ""Liars!""  But I did understand that they were referring to an opening, rather than their actual open hours.  :)Anyway, I peered through the door, and decided it was worth investigating further.When I returned to my room,  I considered SideDoor and a few of the other places within a short walking radius.  SideDoor stood out easily. . . .One of the first things that struck me was the scotch whiskey selection.  Then I was quickly drawn to the cheese selection.  I didn't even make it to the mains or starters, and I knew I wanted to eat here. I told my friends definitively that this was the place for us, and I anxiously looked forward to dinner time.I arrived first and was greeted warmly. Laura showed my to my table, and happily discussed a few ways that we could ensure my friends would find me easily.  Shortly after that, Ben, our server, came over to introduce himself.  As he was starting to describe the menu, my friends arrived, and the perfect timing was a foreshadowing of the awesome evening ahead.We learned that SideDoor had only recently opened, and so far we had high hopes.We started with drinks, and after asking a few specific questions about one of the scotches that Ben didn't know, he offered to pour me a taste.  Rather than just pour a splash and then ask for a simple yay or nay, Ben brought two small tastes, and joined me in the taste so that he would be able to give better feedback in the future.  After ordering and beginning to enjoy a full pour, Ben then brought over the bottle per the bartender's suggestion, since I wasn't perviously familiar with it.  Of course, my friends and I joked about how it might have been a test, and that there might be some secret mark on the bottle so that they'd know if I helped myself to another pour.We then had a delightful appetizer, and after we dove in, the Chef Victor stopped by personally to say hello and check in.  We were already feeling a bit like royalty, and after a short while the general manager, Max, also came over and introduced himself.  We had a delightful conversation, some great laughs, and felt as comfortable as if we were all having dinner in a friend's home.We then had a lovely cheeseplate, the selections informed greatly by Ben's suggestions.  This man took our interests and tastes, and crafted what was probably the *perfect* selection of cheese (and accoutrements) for us.  We followed that with the ""Pretzel Bread Pudding"", which caught my eye as soon as I saw the menu.  (Which differed slightly from the version online, since the menus are prepared daily).  Seriously, when I saw the description (pretzel and brioche, with dried apricots, pistachio, and whisk(e)y caramel sauce), I nearly ordered desert first.I ordered that too, insisting that we could all just take a bite, and that I would take the leftovers home for a delicious breakfast treat with my coffee the next morning.  After it arrived, I realized that I might barely have enough room even for that one bite.  Well, we all made room.  Let's just say that there was no need for a to-go box as there wasn't even a crumb left.  Every single thing that arrived on our table was phenomenal, and every single person with whom we interacted was a delight.  I will heartily look forward to enjoying many more meals here . . . and the menu is just begging to be explored!"
The service is great  - ambience is great for a nice dinner after a hectic day. However go here only if your a meat lover - else there aren't many other optionsGreat beer options also!!
"This place has GREAT food and atmosphere.  I had the pastrami sandwich and it was delicious!  Came with some of the best homemade chips I ever had.  Service was great especially Kristin behind the bar.  I'm going back for the prime rib sandwich next but it's Lawry""s so it has to be good!  Go! You will love it!"
"We ate here for lunch and were not impressed.  First, our entrees came out about a minute after our appetizer, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  On top of that, my sandwich was somehow still cold!  The flavors of the entrees were also not that good.  The open face lamb sandwich was bland and the pear salad was very very salty.  Although we did not drink, the liquor selection looked good, but way over priced.  The service was good, but we will not be going back."
"Food was delicious, service was great. Music was random. Think my dad would love this place!"
Wonderful service with even better food. I would not be surprised to see this restaurant on a Chicago must see list soon.
"It was very interesting for sure.  Great service, very fast and very friendly.  We went at 530/6ish right before the rush which was great.  The food comes out whenever it is ready, instead of coming out all together.  That being said, it is best to share food.  My wife and I shared the Sidedoor Burger, the Mac and Cheese, and the french fries.  The food was delicious and worth it!  There wasn't a ton of food I liked on there but the stuff I did like was delicious.There is only one window, a stained glass window, in there but it is a cool, hip little restaurant.  Very clean and very fun.  Awesome layout with a full bar.  Totally recommend giving it a try!"
Dropped 20 beans on the Yeti and Scott was well jealous. Had it with the carvers trio and the 5 cheese selection between 3 of us and it was simply amazing. The decor is amazing and I want to move in. Easily Chicagos most refined venue. Love it here.
Amazing food amazing service. I loved how everything went that day. First week back to the city and this restaurant just topped it off :D
Yse good quick bites. Still a lot of food. Adds up quick. All Lawry's style. Casual
