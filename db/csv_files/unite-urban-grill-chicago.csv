Unite Urban Grill
"We aren't mothers but we still want good food on Sunday. And so we ever for a stroll down Chicago to see what we could find. Brunch is always a good time, so we stopped into Unite Urban an"
"My husband and I went in this place on a fluke as we were both in the mood for some steak. We were slightly skeptical because we've been to some amazing steakhouses before and we saw a few unsavory reviews about the food being ehhh at best. I am glad we made the stop into this place. Both of our steaks were seasoned really well and cooked to perfection. I had the hanger steak and my husband had the ribeye - you could tell they were good as neither of us offered to share a taste. I would have to say the only hiccup in our meal was the wild mushroom risotto. The risotto left much to be desired as it was under seasoned and very oily. However, I'm sure if we would have gone with another side dish then we would have been happier. I would like to caution - this place isn't cheap - our bill was over $100 for the 2 of us with food and drinks. They should really consider making it a $$$ instead of the current $$. But I'd have to say that overall we had a lovely dinner. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The ambiance of this place was lovely. I did like the fact that we got to experience some of the outdoors by sitting inside next to the open window but still were able to enjoy the air conditioning."
"A friend and I decided to stop by Unite for brunch this past Sunday.  I just wanted to say that we were both pleasantly surprised.We ordered the lobster benedict, the brioche French toast and the thick cut bacon.  The lobster benedict was served cool (at least mine was), but it was delicious.  The brioche French toast was wonderful - the taste, the amount, the sliced apples on top, etc.  I didn't even use the syrup or the butter that came with it - it didn't need it.  The bacon was on the rare side.  I did not ask to have my bacon cooked well-done so this was my mistake.  I sent it back and it came back quickly - done to perfection.  Our waiter was in a great mood and returned every so often to ask us if everything was ok.  I think the main chef stopped by as well to check on us.  Very nicely done!Thank you for a good experience and I hope to return again soon!"
"Dropped by Unite last Thursday for dinner to give this a second run; I came away more impressed with my overall experience, with one major point of hesitation.First, the food was mostly excellent.  This time around, we tried a flatbread that featured sausage, a couple of different cheeses, and a pistachio-based sauce that my wife said was very good (I avoid almost all nut-based items, so I skipped this one).  She also got the farro side dish, which was a lot of food for the serving size...we both thought that the farro was a little plain but we can't argue with the portion size.  We tried a couple of glasses of the rose on the wine menu as well as the Humboldt Park cocktail; all of the drink selections (like our first visit) were good and refreshing on an incredible 80-degree evening.We also had another round of the wings, and that's the reason to try out Unite if you have not been before...those are as good as any in the surrounding area, for sure.I got the veggie burger with the arugula salad, and this might take the place of the veggie burger I've had at Bite as my new favorite.  I can't claim to be an incredible source on veggie burgers since I get them much less than the flesh-and-blood variety, but the flavor in the one at Unite kept me (a hardcore carnivore) very happy throughout.  The arugula salad on the side was dressed lightly and just right...usually, I pass on the salad with burgers but this was perfect.Our server was working double duty between the bar and the patio outside, and this showed a bit as he had to run back and forth often to make drinks.  But he was significantly more knowledgeable of the menu than our server was during our first visit, a nice change.  And the same manager that was there for our first visit was there again, and he was a wealth of information on the Unite menu and other suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood.My main knock at Unite is still the prices; from the alcohol to some of the appetizers/sides, things are just a little higher than the restaurants nearby.  And some of the bourbon prices, in particular, are very high (Woodford Reserve for $15?)...a visit to Five Star reveals prices that are sometimes two-thirds of the drinks at Unite.Otherwise, I still think Unite is a very solid place to grab food, sit outside, and enjoy a variety of meat and non-meat dishes.  And everyone I have met at the restaurant has been very friendly, from the host stand to the owner, so I know it's a very accommodating group.  Give it a shot if you haven't already!"
"Jessica and Aaron made our last day in town memorable! Great service, knowledgeable about everything on the menu(food,/wines, beer and spirits). So made our weekend! SERVICE and FOOD Top notch!"
"Since dining at Unite Urban Grill my first time, it has immediately become one of my favorite restaurants in the city. My first experience there we did not make reservations, so we ate and drank cocktails at the bar. Since then I make sure to have reservations, because they can get busy. My absolute favorites are the Hanger Steak and the Bone-In Berkshire Pork Chops! I've tried all three steaks they have and the hanger steak is the clear winner. The pork chops are some of the best I have ever had. Most places including myself cannot cook pork chops well. Most of the time they are overcooked or dry. The pork chops at Unite are spot on, full of flavor, and delicious. My favorite side is the Baked Cauliflower. AH-Mazing! I also enjoy the roasted fingerling potatoes and hand cut fries.  So far, the only app I have tried is the lamb meatballs and they are great. Each time I visit Unite, the staff is very welcoming and attentive. Every time I visit Unite the manager comes by to make sure my meal and experience is to my satisfaction. Even the valet guy is super sweet. The best thing about Unite is the price you pay for the quality of food you get. It can't be beat."
"WOW. I was wow'd when I came with Katy S. on a lady date. Unite was making things right from her previous negative experience. They exceeded all my expectations.Decor is super cute with a mix of romantic and modern with dim lighting and couches at the entrance. We each had a glass of wine, shared the brussel sprouts and cauliflower, I had the salmon and she the full rack of ribs. I love my veggies and if I could prepare cauliflower like that every day, I would be in heaven. It tasted literally like mac and cheese! How the hell did they do that? The salmon was a smaller portion than anticipated but its quality was out of this world. I didn't have to chew, it melted on my tongue. I have never had salmon like that, even in the fanciest of restos. She loved her ribs like none other. Don't think I've ever seen my friend that happy over a meal in the 10+ years I've known her. We then shared the peanut butter dessert which tasted like a grown-up version of a butterfinger bar. Super rich and decadent and any peanut butter lover's dream. Service was phenom and we had such a great time. I need to go back again and again and again."
"Food was Excellent and the service was even better. Outside is dog friendly , had a wonderful experience. . Jessica was our waitress .... Really nice . Go , you won't regret it,"
"Had a really good steak, shrimp and watermelon salad. I highly recommend those three. The Irish organic salmon was good too. The wine and server were also both great."
"Sometimes in life, you have to give things a second chance to fall in love.As you may know by reading my review #1 for Unite Urban, my first visit to Unite was not very pleasant. Joe, the owner, subsequently contacted me and tried to make things right. First of all, kudos to any business owner who cares that much about their patrons that they even reach out to unsatisfied Yelpers. I walked in to Unite on a Saturday night to find a much different scene than I saw the first time. A very dim, romantic, hip, classy restaurant with beautiful decor. On visit #1, it was still day light out and I could not enjoy it nor appreciate it as much. The restaurant is small but still welcoming; this spot is perfect for a date night. The nice, pleasant hostess sat us immediately upon check in (I had made a reso through Joe). BTW, they e-mail you the reservation information so you don't forget. Nice touch there, Unite. Quinn, our awesome (uber nice) server, promptly came to the table and greeted himself while I was waiting for my dining partner and fellow Yelp Elite, Angie K to arrive. He told me that they had just released a new cocktail - ""Andersonville."" This was a sparkling beverage made with gin, prosecco, and I believe peach liquor (if I remember correctly). Though delicious as can be, I would recommend this for brunch not for dinner. I later opted to switch to the Pinot Noir that Quinn recommended and boy was he right. Their pinot paired perfectly with all things consumed that night. Now on to the most important part of all things dining: the FOOD. When I was waiting for Angie K to arrive, I was being the typical ""food spy."" Definition: one that sits at a table in a restaurant observing what others are eating in order to determine what looks good and later copies that persons meal to the T. What caught my attention: the RIBS. I thought, ""hmm, I am not on a date; I am with a friend. Thank God!"" I could order those ribs and eat them like crazy Fred Flinstone without being judged. I ordered a full rack - yup, hungry girl status! Angie K ordered the salmon as she is a pescatarian (a few fish options on the menu, hooray!); as for sides we ordered the cauliflower mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. We also had the spinach/cheese flatbread as an app. Listen here people, there was not one bad tasting thing on our table that night. Every SINGLE item was delicious. The flat bread was amazing. Their spinach was something I've never seen before - so green and leafy; it almost looked like kale and tasted phenomenal. Angie K said her salmon ""melted in her mouth"" and that she was able to cut into it like butter. It looked great, though I did not try it. The ribs were THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Seriously, I ranted and raved about these ribs to anyone I called/came in contact with the next day. The brussel sprouts were so amazingly soft and perfectly seasoned (with parmesan cheese and herbs, I believe). The cauliflower mac and cheese was my least favorite, though Angie's favorite! lol, different tongues, different strokes, I suppose. It was like, ""would you like some cauliflower with your cheese, madam?""  The cheese was a bit overpowering; still delicious but definitely too much of it. As for dessert, we had the peanut butter mousse bar? It tasted like a butterfinger in the form of a cake. Though angelic in nature (lol), I'd choose another dessert next time as it was very rich. That cookie sandwich someone else mentioned on Yelp is a must next time.  Towards the end of our meal, both Joe (aforementioned owner) and Jason (manager) came up to introduce themselves to us. Both are very nice gentlemen and Jason is definitely not bad to look at either (eye candy alert!)Side note: the bathrooms were modern and very clean. Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago thus far. This is why second chances are so important. I found out that they have a travelzoo special and bought that thing with the quickness the following day!I will 100% be returning. Thanks Unite."
"I walked in from the rain today and immediately felt warm and cozy.  I love the colors; moody soft grays, dark blues, wood tones, and pops of orange, all lit by soft overhead lighting.  So inviting.  I sat on the soft banquet by the window and watched my fellow humans dodge raindrops.  I came here as part of Yelp's Burger Week.  Unite was the only featured restaurant that offered a veggie burger.  As a veggie burger aficionado I have to say this one was tops!  It truly is a veggie burger and not a grain or soy burger like so many others.  There were bits of mushrooms, corn and carrots along with black beans.  The burger was thick and hearty with good texture, and was served on a perfectly toasted brioche.  A spicy aioli was served on the side.  There was also a simple side salad of arugula and cherry tomatoes dressed with a light vinaigrette.  My amazing server also let me know that mimosas were half price.  The delicious mimosa had a nice kick to it and included house-made orange bitters.  The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the surroundings were inviting.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying other menu items."
"The food here is edible and the service is average.two stars for the Chicago Style Rib.  The meat is very tough.I originally wanted to order the FOTB rib (fall off the bone)but they didn't have it so the server suggested that I order the Chicago style rib instead but he did not tell me how tough the meat would be comparing to the fotb ribs.  I had to eat with my hand because it was impossible to eat with knife and folk.  Luckily I am not on a first date, because if I was on the first date I probably had to take it home. (can't be making a mess on the first date, right?)  If the waiter had told me that the Chicago style rib is tough I would have ordered something else.I also ordered the lamb meat ball which taste ok.desert menu didn't have anything that makes me want to order. so I skipped the desert."
"I wasn't super hungry when I came here so I think I should give it another try. I ordered the rose noir wine special - the first glass was a short pour, but they made up for it on the second. As a table, we shared the lobster mac and cheese which I thought was awesome. I would order it all for myself next time! For my main, I actually just had another snack, the steak tartare. Again, since I wasn't too hungry, I didn't care for anything heavy like a steak or a burger. It was fine, but I wasn't wow'd."
Solid brunch. They opened the front windows and it changed the whole dynamic. We were a group of 10 so I got to try a lot if food. The Ruben was my favorite. Don't miss it.
"Went with a group of fellas fir a bachelor's last night out. The service staff was very friendly and hospitable. Aiight had gotten there early, before anybody else, and was felt welcomed while I waited at the bar. Every subsequent guest, wether they were with my group or not was greeted warmly. I liked that level of consistency. The food was delicious! portions were hearty and by no means skimpy. I went with the lamb meatballs as an appetizer.  Others in my group git the fries. One other got the lobster mac and cheese.  Everybody shared because the food tasted great. The main course was also wonderful. The porkchops, I must say, were the best!!!! Tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly. They give you two pieces, as well, so in case you can't finish, you can take some home."
I loved everything our table ordered. The food was excellent and the drink I had was strong. The service was superb as well. I cannot wait to return.
"I ended up coming here again after Joe, the owner, offered a second meal on them since I had such a terrible experience the first time around.I opted to come for dinner this time with my other sister. This is what we ordered:-Lamb Meatballs: This was pretty good. The sauce that it came in was very flavorful. I did find the meatballs a bit tough but overall it was pretty good!-Bolognese: This one definitely could have used a bit more salt...-Rib Eye: This was really really good! I loved it. It was cooked perfectly!-Spaghetti Squash: Meh, but I think I'm just not a fan of spaghetti squash to be honest so this was not their fault!My sister also ordered a sour beer originally but the server offered to let her try a sample since it was a love or hate beer. I thought that was incredibly generous of him and it was fantastic service. She ended up hating it so that worked out well!Overall, I really enjoyed my second experience here. I thought that the service was phenomenal, some of the best service that i have received in the city. The server was incredibly attentive and nice but definitely not overbearing at all!"
"My mom and I had dinner here on a whim because they had no wait on a Friday night. We ended up sitting next to a table of bros conducting a conversation about ""titty-fucking"" but luckily my 65 year old mother has a sense of humor and we were able to laugh about it. We split the steak tartare, a burger, salmon, and an order of fries.  The food was delicious but I did have a suspicious stomachache in the morning.  Our waiter was super friendly and the owner stopped by a few times to see how everything was going."
"Wow, this place has some of the most amazing food I have ever tasted. We were visiting Chicago from out of town and got lucky to find this place on yelp. Their lobster mac n cheese is to die for. Literally closed my eyes when I ate it. If I'm ever back in Chicago I'll be sure to come back here."
"Tried, but missed the markAny restaurant (management) that cares about its customers will try to make things right, including comping your food. For the part of both diners and the restaurant, showing respect for your fellow humans goes a long way to helping the situation. Last night, Unite Urban Grille tried but missed the mark. I have recommended this spot to others in the past. Now, I have nothing good to recommend. I do not like sweet and sour dining experiences. --Did the manager work to get my wife's food right? YES, absolutely. --Did the manager tell us ""certainly you will not have to pay for that?"" YES (the problem). --Did the manager offer her an appetizer or something while her food was re-fired? CERTAINLY. So...what was the problem? When the check arrived, the manager kept his word and comp'd the messed up steak. However, the manager turned around and charged for the re-fired steak. ""Something is wrong here,"" I thought. Although we spoke to him about his original play on words and he apologized for any misunderstanding, I was no longer interested in the last minute offer of free desert. Suddenly, I lost my appetite for their food. Look, I understand that some larger restaurants may be able to financially absorb staff errors by comping the food. I get it. After all, it is much easier to comp an appetizer or a drink than a meal. Then again, I'm not a novice on the restaurant circuit. I let the manager know what my expectations were. When the error is with the meal, then an adjustment is customary with THAT meal. Even TGI Fridays comp's staff errors. To his credit, the manager approached us while exiting to apologize for the error. He welcomed us again by sliding me a ""1 free appetizer"" coupon, ""with the purchase of any entree"" in small print. I'll pass (it on to somebody else).  Somehow a contingent complementary item reminds me of the sour patch kids candy slogan, ""Sour. Sweet. Gone.""  And, I don't like sour patch candy."
"Came here to celebrate myself getting a new job with my boyfriend. We had talked about coming in the past because its right down the street from me. The service was great. We went on a Friday evening, though I think we got lucky because we didn't have to wait for a table. The steaks were really good. They aren't the best I've ever had but for the price they were great. Like a typical steak house you need to order your side dishes separate. They fries and the other potatoes with the caramelized onions and bacon were really good too."
"My birthday dinner was excellent! Big thank you to the wonderful Cassie for taking such great care of us. We had ribs, whole chicken, chicken wings, and the burger. Side of fries too. All were just perfect. Followed by desert and by then we were in food heaven."
"How does this place get '$$'? They have three steaks, one for $26 but and the other two for $39. The steak had no flavor what so ever. Might as well go to one of the more popular places and pay a little more for a much better tasting steak.It cost me $150 for a dinner for two. Biggest waste of money ever."
"Was not impressed with this place and I won't return.  I took my gf here for her birthday dinner.  She ordered the ribeye, medium temp.  It came out rare so we sent it back and it came back medium rare.  I ordered a corned beef and pastrami sandwich and it was just ok. All I can say is that if you're going to charge 40$ for a steak, you better make sure the chef knows how to cook it. Now I gave them a slightly higher rating than I would've otherwise simply because they were very attentive to us after we sent back the Steak. So on that aspect they did a great job. In conclusion, I don't see how the ratings are so high.  Customer service is great but the chefs need to learn basic steak temperatures, especially when you're charging the prices you are. Just some advice from a fellow chef."
"Great atmosphere is a very subjective and cliche but it's the best way to describe this place. The waiting area has several couch-coffee-table combos to knock back a few drinks on an empty stomach. The food was expensive but the quality was worth it. I got the UNITE BURGER. It was one of the more affordable items on the menu, but not my recommendation. The RAVIOLI was by far the best entree that I tried. I highly recommend them, but make sure you get a side to fill the void in your stomach. Bring your wallet, don't expect leftovers."
"Well..went here for brunch for my birthday on a Sunday morning. We had a reservation at 1, and bunch ends at 2, which I think is a fair time to show up to a brunch in the city. We came here at 1, and had to wait about fifteen minutes, which, fine, whatever. So we get our table, and start ordering...only to find out that they are out of the french toast and Madame croquet..okay...so we order pancakes instead. Five minutes later we find out that they are out of pancakes too. How a functioning restaurant is out of something that consists of flour, eggs, water, and sugar is beyond me? So we are annoyed and frustrated but we have already ordered drinks so we are staying. Our food comes 35 minutes later...but with french fries instead of breakfast potatoes. No one told us they were out of breakfast potatoes..we should have just assumed, I guess. Anyways, the food was average. I ordered the omelet and it was soggy and gross. I sent it back. They fixed it. Meh.The manager was super apologetic and professional and comped everything and gave us free dessert, which was awesome...but yea. I think we're going to Hollywood Grill next time. They'll have pancakes."
AWESOME BURGER!!! Amazing service...we will be back again and again!
"Yum!  My fiance and I went here for here for his birthday dinner date. He was seeking a place that was still in the two price-sign range for entrees but fancy enough for a special occasion.  He also always wants great steak for his birthday.  I have to say, this place fulfilled all of these requirements perfectly.The meat dishes we got were really the stars here.  He got the NY Strip Steak medium rare and I got the Hanger Steak also medium rare. Both cuts were juicy and bursting with flavor. The seasoning/marinade on both was delicious and they were cooked perfectly.The service was also fantastic. Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. And the manager checked up on us after our meal and made us feel extra cared for. Only not five stars because our side of asparagus was good but not amazing and our side of mushrooms was weird to us...maybe too many earthy-tones...I'm not sure what it was. In general, I'm really happy with our dinner here and will be planning to come back and try additional dishes (especially other meat dishes!)."
"Our waiter last night (if a hipster with a giant beard, big gage earrings, manbun is your server - beware) was so aloof and inattentive that the meal was ruined despite good food and a very pleasant ambiance.  Sometimes kitchens and bars get a bit backed up, but it is absolutely unacceptable to wait 40 minutes and ask twice for wine. Our table was made to feel as though the waiter was doing us a favor to bring anything to our table. The manager (sort of) apologized and blamed the unacceptable wait (1.5 hours for food) on a delay in the kitchen. I hope this evening was an exception. Our dining experience was so unpleasant that we will not return."
"Although Unite is my rebound boyfriend due to Flo's popularity and negligence of my existence, he is so sweet and nice that makes me feels bad for dumping him for the next guy. What makes Unite a great rebound?1) He is a gentleman who makes sure that your glass is filled with water 24/7.2) Despite the fact that he does not have soy milk, he tries his best to provide you a substitute - skim milk. 3) He is soft-spoken, clean and fashionable.Why do I hesitate in going on another date with Unite?1) The food is decent but not memorable. For my granola, I like the fact that the yogurt is not too sweet. However, the dried fruits overpowered the yogurt and the rest of the ingredients.2) The selection of tea and coffee is limited. My favorite chai tea is not available. However, it is great to have early grey as an option.3) Unite has many competitors, such as Bongo Room and Feast, in the area. In order to stand out, Unite has to serve a unique dish. After reading this review, do you think I made the right decision of dumping my rebound boyfriend?"
"Went here for someone's birthday .. Can't remember who... my mom maybe?Unite had it all down pat.  Atmosphere, food, service, drinks (wow).  I had this spicy jalapeno drink that blew my mind.I don't recall what I ordered... but I remember liking it a lot.  This place has a lot going for it, but competition is fierce... I think a little more creativity on the menu could be a good thing - not with every dish, mind you - but maybe throw some herbs or more goofy sauces in here and there."
"I came in last weekend for a reunion with some college friends. What a cute neighborhood spot!  The night started out right with a warm welcome and a hand crafted cocktail by bartender Carlos- a unique creation with gin and Campari. For dinner, we started with the lamb meatballs and glazed chicken wings- both recommendations by our server- delicious!  The sauce was tangy on the wings and they had the perfect amount of spice.For dinner I ordered the hanger steak- medium rare and marinated and prepared to perfection. My friends ordered the whitefish and Amish chicken, also a hit.  The beer and spirits list was vast and our server was able to guide us on good pairings.  And wow the sides- the baked cauliflower standing out as the best.We didn't have room for dessert but ordered the peanut butter mousse cake out of curiosity- it was eating for taste alone at this point... And wow! So glad we did!If you haven't checked out this neighborhood gem, make it your next night out.  I will definitely be back!"
"I ordered the grass fed hamburger that came with cheese, grilled onions and lettuce, i think it was $14.  I asked for no cheese (allergic), no grilled onions.  Asked if it could be just lettuce and tomato.  Waiter said they don't serve tomatoes on the hamburger.  Hmmm, really?  So what's  left?   Told him, next time I will bring my own sliced tomato.    Lettuce only.   So I added avocado for $2 more.  It came with oily, soggy, limp, flavorless, disappointing fries.  Really?     Didn't  anyone go to culinary french fry school in this place?  fries were a D-, not an F because they showed up and were served! Disappointing fries!   Can't say it is a place I would go back anytime soon, Tragic!"
"It was hard determining how many stars to give this place, because I had such an odd experience here. My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is modern and stylish: I liked the decor, but not the fact that the place was ridiculously loud almost the entire night. The bathrooms were super clean, which is always a big plus. Service was above average and the food was fairly priced, considering the fact that we were eating in West Town and received a decent amount of food for our money.Now on to the actual dining and drinking experience. First, the drinks. Unite Urban Grill offers a variety of innovative specialty cocktails. I am a pretty adventurous drinker, and I happily downed a few Logan Squares, and sampled my friend's West Town and Pilsen. At one point during the evening, I attempted to order a French martini, and they couldn't make it for me because they were out of pineapple juice, which seems like a very odd thing for a bar to run out of, but oh well. Overall, the cocktails were very good.On to the food itself. The appetizers were hands-down the best part of the meal. Our group shared the Spinach Flatbread and the Lamb Meatballs, which were both divine. For entrees, one friend ordered the Lake Superior Whitefish, which she was very happy with. My other two friends each ordered the Vegetable Gratin, which I sampled and thought was good, but nothing more than that. The flavor was a bit bland and the eggplant was a little on the tough side. I ordered the French Dip Sandwich, which was by far the worst entree at our table. The roast beef was this very odd shade of pale elephant gray and just did not taste too great. My sandwich came with a ton of fries, which were excessively coated in salt, to the point that I could only eat a few of them. It was not good. To compensate, I sampled some of the vegetable appetizers we ordered for the table, including the asparagus and the brussel sprouts, both which were very good. For dessert, we all shared a piece of the lemon cake, which again I thought was just okay. Nothing special.So why does this average dining experience deserve only a two-star rating? Well, after I went home, I was up all night, sick as a dog. It was not pleasant. Could it have been due to something I ate that night? Maybe, but I had no way of knowing for sure...until I talked with one of my friends the next day, who told me that she also was sick to her stomach the same night after our dinner. Two very upset stomachs at the same time on the same night, right after sharing a lot of the same food does not sit well with me, my friends. For that reason, along with the mediocre dining experience in general, I will not be returning to Unite Urban Grill."
"Coincidently walked in at the same time as the owners were treating his parents. Down to earth and very humble people. Service was prompt and friendly. Kitchen smells made us even more hungry. Waiter explained the menu in complete detail and gave us plenty of time to decide. Delicous food, great atmosphere, and glad we came by."
"This place is so close to our house and has become a to-go place every time we are in the mood for drinks and good food.  We love having this place at our neighborhood by the way. Food is yumi, drinks are awesome, and the management and owner are ubber friendly!I recommend! :)"
"THIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE NEW BREAKFAST/BRUNCH OFFERING ONLY.Wonderful people, nice comfortably contemporary décor and tasty food. They just started serving brunch a week or two ago.  While the service was perfect, portion size OK, the breakfast choices were very limited. I believe in these guys.  I think that as they get traction on brunch they have the potential to roll out innovative and tasty fare and become a Sunday brunch destination.  I encourage them to continue building our their brunch day-part offering.I'll be back to check in on them and am expecting great things from Joe and his team!"
"My friend and I shared the hanger steak and lobster mac & cheese. Both were great but the attentive service at the bar was even better. Our bartender, Carlos, really knew his drinks and had great recommendations. My friend asked if a signature drink could be made with vodka and he said 'no' since it would really change the flavor profile. We appreciated his honesty and ability to confidently share his suggestions. The steak was perfectly cooked and the lobster mac & cheese was decadent. We left with a handful of suggestions for local bars and they also lived up to his recommendations. Great place!"
"Hubby and I both had burgers - I had the veggie and he had the regular burger. Veggie is one patty, beef burger is two thin, stacked patties. The veggie burger was tasty, one of the better ones I've had lately. Homemade with black beans, squash, corn, etc. There were lots of veggie chunks, which typically aren't my thing in a burger, but it was actually quite good. Get it with cheddar! Hubby said the beef burger was juicy and delicious. Both were served on brioche buns - my fav!They have a unique cocktail list, but hubby wasn't into drinking that night and I was drinking wine. Our server, Moses, was super friendly and brought me a sample of the wine I was considering, the Sur Torrontes. It was a great suggestion, had a very beachy flavor, as the grapes are grown near the ocean and get the sea spray. Really cool!Everyone was extremely friendly. The owner, Jo(h)n, came by our table to introduce himself, check on our meals, and thank us for coming in. I thought that was a nice touch. The interior design is great, it's warm and inviting while being just dark enough to be intimate.We'll definitely be back to check out some more menu items and hang out in the front lounge area!"
"I couldn't of had a better experience than the one I had last night. The food was great, the service was great and we will be going back again. Be sure to try the lobster mac n cheese. Save room for dessert!"
"We got carry out from here and I really enjoyed the veggie burger, was pretty damn good!  However, my husband thought the wings were mediocre and didn't finish them, hence the 4 stars. The carry out time was accurate.We would go back because it's so close to where we live and I would like to eat the burger again."
"I was really blown away when I visited this spot about a couple months ago. I went in with a friend, she had a GC and we ordered the Lamb Meatballs to start as a suggestion from the waiter, SO glad we did...they were fantastic! I ordered the Shrimp Linguine and I cannot even begin to tell you how fantastic it was. What topped the evening off is the adorable owners walk around and greet almost all guests and I had the pleasure to meet Joe who slipped me a few ingredients that are in the linguine so that I could attempt (poorly) to recreate it in the off season. The vibe of this place is just what can be expected in West Town, and so worth it. The owner's story is great and it shows through the amazing food."
The ribeye steak meat quality was below average. I had it cooked medium and despite it being cooked fine Ithaca chewy parts and did not taste like good quality. The Brussels sprouts with pesto had no salt. This place has some good dishes but is lacking the finishing touch.  The wings were quite good but it's definitely not in Chicago's top steakhouses like it claims. Spent over 100 for two of us with mediocre meat.
"I was here for an office holiday party.  The staff was very friendly and remembered my orders and preferences even though I was one of a party of almost thirty people. The food was well-made and delicious with a few unexpected (but yummy) twists.  The space has a great open but cozy feel and the cocktails are inspired by different Chicago neighborhoods, (I loved the mezcal-based ""Bucktown"", with a list of classics available as well. Each drink was made beautifully, and slightly spirit-forward. A must try in the neighborhood:). FYI, don't be surprised if the owner stops by your table to ask how everything is... It's how they roll here, but you won't know it was him unless you ask, because he won't say so."
"I really enjoyed this place. We came on a Wednesday night for dinner with my brother and we took our time. We orders drinks and talked for the first 30 minutes and order an appetizer to start. We were having a slow dinner and never felt rushed by our waiter. He was a nice guy and gave us his opinion of the menu. We had the lamb meatballs, cauliflower (SO GOOD!) and sliders. All were delicious. The table also had the ribs and steak. Both had good reviews from the group. I would come back, a great addition to Chicago Ave."
"My first time and what a disappointment. I had food delivered and the first two dishes, the mushrooms and the wings were delicious. Unfortunately, the ribs were burnt to a crisp on the bottom. Complete charcoal. I have had some mediocre food before but I don't remember the last time that such an obvious screwup made its way onto my plate."
"The atmosphere and the people that work at this place are the best I have experienced in a long time. My lady and I used a Travelzoo coupon here last night, and it did exactly what restaurants hope will when offering a deal through a coupon distributor. Jason, who appears to be a manager of some level, was super friendly as soon as we walked in, both servers were very attentive/comfortable to be around. We had 4 employees come and ask how things were going, which seems like it would be a lot, but they approached and asked in such a comfortable way that it was very nice. Must haves: The pork chops and lamb meatballs. Also very good: The spinach flatbreadIn an area that gives a lot of opportunity to not repeat restaurants a lot, we will definitely be back for this one."
"I actually went to Unite twice in the last few days. The décor is great and it is located just a few blocks from my house. The staff is very friendly and attentive. There are couches and seating areas when you immediate walk in, along with a bar and dining tables further in. Very well done.First was for Brunch on Easter. Fortunately is was not an inflated price Easter brunch, but the normal brunch with regular prices. I had the omelet, which was good. The side of bacon, while generous in size, I could not finish and it was very greasy, even for bacon. The bloody mary was not spicy and was fine.I also went last night. We had a salad, which was good and sliders, which were also good. My friend got ravioli, which was also very good. I ordered the NY strip, which came cooked to order, which is not always the case. My problems with the steak ($33) was that is was very fatty. Not marbled, but fatty, which left very little meat.In sum, very good but I would not get the NY strip again. I might try the chicken or other pasta. Overall, a nice addition to the neighborhood."
"Wow the food and service are incredible here! We had a reservation on a Wednesday night around 7pm; the place was not particularly packed so we received solid attention from the wait staff.We were unsure of which wine to have so our waiter allowed us to try two different types before making a final decision, which was a good gesture. Some rain started to leak through one of the vents near our seats and we were promptly moved without any problems (again the place was near empty this might have been an issue if the place was more crowded). The table we moved to was a little wobbly and the owner (I think) promptly placed a stabilizer under the table. Again, great service. On to the food. This place can be $$ or $$$ depending on what you order as the priced items have a wide range. We opted to share the hanger steak, salmon, mushrooms, and asparagus. The steak was delicious and juicy. The salmon was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. Contrary to other people on this board, I really liked the mushrooms and the way they were seasoned. The asparagus was also good with some oil drizzled on it. I washed it down with an Allagash White. Their alcohol seems to be reasonably priced as well. I will definitely come back here to try some other items on their menu and I definitely recommend the place for a date."
"I came here on a weekday evening for dinner.  I was impressed upon walking in to the restaurant.  It is well decorated, cozy and inviting.  You walk in, you want to eat there and you expect the food to be good.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and we were seated immediately.  The waiter was friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu and not shy about offering suggestions or letting us know his personal favorites.  The drinks were very tasty and well prepared.  In fact, we ordered two!  I ordered the shrimp skewers, lobster mac and cheese and panzanella salad.  My friend ordered the ribs.  The food was good.  I did have a concern with my shrimp skewers and the staff graciously handled this concern.  The waiter took the food back with no complaint.  The manager came over to check and make sure the meal was prepared to my liking the second time. I felt bad for sending the food back but the waiter reassured me that they wanted me to be happy.  I continued to eat the lobster mac and cheese which was very good.  Creamy cheese sauce, breadcrumb topping and generous portions of lobster throughout the dish.  Dessert (ice cream sandwich and carrot cake) was great too.  I don't live near this restaurant but I would definitely come here again.  The food was good overall and they went overboard to accommodate me when I had a concern.  What more could one ask for?"
"Went here on a date w/ my girlfriend and we left pretty impressed.  The spot is way larger than it looks from the outside and very trendy.  The small outdoor seating to the 'lounge-ish' front, to the large tables in the back, there is plenty of space for everyone.The food pricing is a bit on the higher side but it is actually worth the price.  The portions are pretty large and we ended up taking leftovers for the following morning.  The French Dip + Fries was enough for two meals.  The Shrimp dish had quite a bit of shrimp on it and would recommend it.  Just makes sure to remember that the plate dishes are a la carte style so make sure to order some apps or veggies with them.The cocktails and beers are average price and the cocktail was pretty good.  They have a decent craft beer on tap and continuously change out their 3 Floyds, which is pretty awesome.If you want to bring your date here, highly recommended.  If you want to just hang out and drink cocktails and beer, not a bad spot either.  I would just say this place is not a place where you would come to just your light beers and makes a fool out of yourself."
"Second time there once for dinner and once for brunch.I want to like this place more than I do.  Service at dinner was great...our brunch experience was not good service was really subpar.Food is decent, but I think I am done with this place, I hope they get better cuz its a nice local spot."
"Outstanding food in a casual atmosphere. We split the ribeye steak and ribs. Hands down the best steak I ever had. Starting with the right cut of grass feed and anti-biotic free steak. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Melts in your mouth. The bbq ribs were crazy good. Excellent flavor with a sauce that was a perfect compliment to the meat and not overpowering. For the veggie lovers, it doesn't get any better than this. Spaghetti squash with toasted pumpkin seeds was unbelievable. Many more dishes to choose from. Carnivores and vegetarians can both be very happy here. Please go and try this place. It's a hidden gem."
Nice clean space. Amazing food. Reasonable $$. Cute waiters.  Highly recommend you check this place out.
AMAZING. The atmosphere. The food. The staff. The cocktails. SPOT ON. I was very impressed.
"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place last week while searching for something besides the ""same old"" in his neighborhood. We were seated right away on a Thursday night. The restaurant is actually much bigger than it looks from the outside. They have a great beer and cocktail selection. We shared the salmon appetizer, the ""house"" salad, and the 32 oz. strip with brussel sprouts and mushrooms. It was all fantastic! I highly recommend Unite for a nice date spot.FYI, we got the scoop from our server, and Unite is basically the combining of MEAT and farm-fresh....well, it's a great combo!"
I would give a higher star rating if service wasn't so dismal. Our waiter introduced himself and didn't come back for a long time. And then the time between taking our drink orders and coming back to take our order was way too long too. He also never even came around and asked how our food was. Salmon crudo (2/5): Pretty disappointed in the flavor combination. It was overwhelmingly lime and nothing else including salmon. A different fish would have worked better.Brussels sprouts (1/5): definitely missing seasoning. Salt...bacon...something. I love Brussels sprouts and I hated these. Half Chicken (2/5): boring. The bbq sauce was way too sweet. Chicken was cooked well enough.The menu is pretty boring. The food was boring. The atmosphere was boring. Why is a restaurant emptying out by 9 something on a Friday??
"Great food and  great service. We came in for a 6 o'clock reservation on a Friday night.  It must have been the end of family dinner because our table was flanked by toddlers. We ordered the cheese plate, hangar steak, pork chops, brussel sprouts, and farro salad. All were excellent, with the sprouts the weakest of the bunch. Our server, Danny, was wonderful, attentive and  knowledgeable. Will definitely be back."
"The food was very good, so nice start.  I had the hangar steak, which was well cooked and flavorful.  My wife had fish--delicious.  Portions were solid. Fries were perfect!  Good beer and wine selection.  It's a long narrow space, but they did a good job making it comfortable and inviting for a Saturday dinner or sitting at the bar for drinks and a bite.Good stuff.  It's a little pricey to be a go to neighborhood spot (everything is a-la-carte), but I'll recommend it and I'm sure I'll be back."
"First time there, not my last!  Fantastic service, food, & decor.  It's a treasure a short walk from my place, but I've missed it for five years!  I'll be going back as a regular.  Prices reasonable, varied menu should make everyone happy."
"So happy I tried this place for brunch. The restaurant was busy but not too crowded and were were able to get a table right away which is nice, considering how crowded some brunch spots can be. Both the food and service were great.  We ordered the steak and eggs and the Rueben sandwich.  My boyfriend said this was the best Reuben he's ever had. My steak was cooked perfectly to a med rare and was absolutely delicious. (Portion size was awesome as well) The breakfast potatoes that came with it were crispy and really good.  I am really happy we tried this place out and cannot wait to come back for dinner.  The food is executed really well and I would definitely recommend it!"
"This is a great steakhouse in a non-traditional way.  The atmosphere is super modern, warm and inviting.  The service was perfect.  The ownership makes time for every guest at every table and was engaging and informational.  The lamb meatballs are a must eat.  All of the sides were really well done and yummy.  The steaks, both the NY Strip and the Ribeye were as good as predicted."
"This place is absolutely amazing. I've lived in the neighborhood for years but never came here because the name led me to believe that it was a burger joint/sports bar type thing. How wrong I was. The ambience of the place is elegant, modern and relaxed. The service has always been friendly, unpretentious and wonderful. I'm a vegetarian and have ordered multiple sides as my meal consistently. Tonight I split the farro, cauliflower and brussels sprouts side with my friend and we were completely full. The cauliflower is like mac n cheese done cauliflower style and- somehow- it works. The brussels sprouts have a pistachio pesto- delicious. And the farro-- well, I'd never had farro before, but this was jaw droppingly fresh and delicious. Come here soon!"
"Best meat in Chicago! Bold statement I know but this place is a true hidden gem! The staff are very friendly, not too overbearing. They have amazing cocktail selections and a great ambiance. It's a pretty chill place but the food will blow your mind! I have ordered the pork chops with a side of mushrooms twice now and am still dreaming about how delicious it was. The pork chops were done to perfection, flavorful and great presentation to boot. Check out the owners story on the back of their menu; pretty cool personal touch to what the restaurant is about....grilling meat."
Came for a family dinner/ birthday celebration. Loved the decor. The Service was great and the food was good. The drinks were clever with fun names and good. A bit pricey but fun for a celebration. I would go again.
"Great food, love the sharing style. The watermelon and heirloom tomato salad was an interesting combo but nonetheless delicious! Their version on the French Dip was one of the best I've ever had and some excellent straw fries that accompanied it! The Hangar Steak paired with the asparagus was top notch. Will definitely be back and if not to dine in, will order for carry out as I saw several others doing this while there!Also definitely try some of their signature cocktails. I had a Remember the Maine and my girlfriend had the Logan Square. Both were mixed excellently with the right blend of sweet to compliment the liquor but not masking it."
The decor and vibe is great. Menu has something for everyone. The chicken was perfectly cooked. The ramp side dish was perfect. The fingerling potatoes so-so and came after rest of the meal. The service was spot on- the dish I ordered had goat cheese even though it didn't say so on the menu and the server did not think twice before replacing it with something else. Thumbs up to that kind of service. I'll go back for sure.
"This is a really cool spot with an interesting vibe. There are lounge-ish areas with tables so you can eat, typical tables, as well as a pub style high top section. My food was delicious -- I had the burger as well as the brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and because our food took a little while to come out, he proactively told us we would get dessert on the house. This was really phenomenal service, great ambience, as well as really good food."
"Love this place. A wonderful story, delicious food and a really chill and intimate atmosphere. I decided to return here to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends and so glad I did. We are also meat lovers and all enjoyed a great cut of meat with a few vege sides so we didn't feel too guilty. The brussel sprouts were my personal favorite. They paired well with my flank steak which was literally finger-licking good. There was this amazing sauce that complimented it very well - a nice touch. Also, Joe, one half of the owner-chef team came by to say hello. He was very appreciative of us coming in and welcomed us to return. I definitely will."
Unite Urban Grill cannot disappoint! Our first visit was a few months ago for Valentine's Day. I've dreamed about the lemon farro with roasted cauliflower ever since! Tonight we returned to celebrate my husband's birthday. He ordered the hanger steak for a second time and I had the babyback ribs - both amazing. Unite will have us returning not only for the food but because of the wonderful owners too!
"I was so looking forward to going here but I ended up pretty underwhelmed.  We had a group of five that was seated at two tables combined. After we were seated, a larger group came in and our waiter asked if we could move tables to a smaller table so they could have the bigger table. This is 100% not an issue we obliged. He offered us free cinnamon rolls for moving which was very nice of him. The cinnamon rolls were meh though. Kind of bland.  But they were free. I just wouldn't ever pay for them.The restaurant is set up nicely and I really loved that they took reservations for brunch because it seems like whenever I want to go to brunch in this city, I'm quoted an hour wait.  Things I liked: my boyfriend's fried french toast. He loved it too. I got the quiche of the day which was delicious. My friend's lobster benedict was amazing but not $20 amazing. I guess that's just what happens when you order lobster anything.  I also liked the arugula salad that came with my quiche. it was all thinly coated in a super delicious vinaigrette.Things I didn't like: the thick cut bacon is nowhere near thick cut. Maybe I expected too much. Au Cheval's bacon is easily a centimeter thick. The thick cut bacon at Unite Urban Grill was just ..thicker bacon. Like I could buy it from the grocery store and there's a decent chance a few slices of bacon are about as thick as what they served us. So then it was just overpriced bacon.  In general, I thought most of the meal was a bit over priced. The mimosas were $9. They were really strong which is nice but they weren't bottomless so at that point $9 is kind of steep for one small mimosa. The bloody mary's with their never ending garnishes were approximately the same price so they seemed like more bang for your buck. I realize bottomless mimosas would  never be as cheap as $9 but one should also not be $9.  The food also took a bit longer than expected but our server and a manager were apologetic and they was indeed a rush about when we came in.  It was a tasty meal but I probably wouldn't come back."
"I'll forever miss Leopold - However...Unite - you've won a special place in my heart...for now.Lamb Meatballs - SCORE!  So tasty.Ribs - Not as good as my husbands but they're really good for not being at a BBQ joint.Hen of the Woods side - OMG.  If you love mushrooms, you'll love this.  Salmon Crudo - Ahhmazing and absolutely fresh tasting.I think everything here is a bit on the $$ side, but I kept ordering and kept enjoying so I guess I wasn't that annoyed by the prices.I think this place will do just fine. A word on the bathrooms - Awweesome cause you have your own little room!  BUT - I wish they'd get better soap.  It smells like I just walked out of the doctor's office and it leaves my hands incredibly dry.Other than that, I'll be back (unfortunately for my pocket book)Oh - and the bar stools are so comfortable."
"Watch out Flo! The new kid on this block is about to steal the spotlight soon for brunch!!The service was fabulous and our server Casey was very friendly with a cute sense of humor. The veggie burger, stake and potatoes were prepared with delicate detail. Will definitely come back again for brunch and recommend this place to friends and family."
Pretty healthy and quality food. Great options for the vegetarians in my group. And the service was especially friendly and caring.
"The food was pretty delicious, but the service made this a terrible experience. My two roommates and I went here for our ""Chrismakkah"" celebration. We were really excited to try this place out, so we traveled from Lakeview! When we walked in, we were seated 20 minutes prior to our reservation, something we didn't expect! The restaurant was about 1/2 full then (6:40pm.) Our server asked if we had visited before, which we hadn't so she explained the menu to us. We basically knew what we wanted and were already salivating! She walked away and came back about 10 minutes later to take our orders. My roommate J and I ordered 1/2 house salads and my roommate K ordered a smoked tomato soup. These were all loved by us. Next, our entrees came out. J ordered the Hanger steak and cauliflower, I ordered the NY Strip and spaghetti squash and K ordered the French Dip Sandwich (it came with a side of fries). Our server said she'd be right back with steak knives. THESE STEAK KNIVES TOOK FOREVER TO ARRIVE. We waited patiently for about 5 minutes, but then flagged someone down. We didn't complain to anyone, but by the time we had our proper utensils, our steaks were cold. We did enjoy all of our food, but with we wished we ate the steaks hot. The busser removed half of our dirty plates at once and we assumed he would return for the rest. There was a 10-15 minute gap in which a plate of steak fat was sitting in front of me. K and I wanted dessert, but by the time our server was flagged down for the check, too much time had passed and we lost our appetites for dessert. Our server never apologized for anything. If she had, we would've forgave. Unite has potential to be great with their amazing food and story, but they need to pay more attention to their customers experience!"
"Recently dined here while on a whirlwind weekend. I hail from a great restaurant city (L. A. ) so my expectations are high. I was very impressed with this place. From the food selections to the service everything was outstanding. The wait staff were very familiar with the menu and made excellent suggestions in the pairing of foods with beverages i. e. IPA's. The portions were substantial enough to share among the table. Everything ordered was prepared with expert care and was extremely tasty. I would recommend the salmon crudo, pork ribs, and goat cheese ravioli. Don't forget the toffee sticky pudding for dessert. Go to this place NOW."
"What a welcome addition to the neighborhood! We happened to walk by Unite on their first morning serving Sunday brunch. There were no other couples in the restaurant when we entered but the space quickly filled up and based on the food, that's no surprise. I started withe bloody mary which was just the right mix of spice and a surprise twist of Ginger. The omelet was light and fresh and the pancakes with berries were delicious as well. I also appreciated the attentive service. You can tell the owner is eager to become a staple in the neighborhood and with food and service like this Unite should be around for quite some time! My fiancee and I are already making plans to return for dinner and will review accordingly. Based on the experience at brunch we are definitely looking forward to it."
"I can't say a bad thing about this place at all and it's literally on my top 10 in Chicago.  I've tried everything from the beef short rib sliders, the lamb meatballs, the watermelon salad, to the pastas, to the veggies.  The drinks are impressive.  What tops this place off is the fantastic servers and very reasonable portions/prices.  I've never had to wait for a table which is insane for a place this awesome."
"Really good service and food quality.  We had dinner early Sunday evening.  The hangar steak was great - better than my husband's rib eye.  The cauliflower was great, adequate house salad, good lamb meatballs.  The dessert menu could use an upgrade.  All in all, very satisfactory."
"I went here with 10 other people for a pre-Chicago Marathon meal. Most of us don't eat pasta, so this seemed like a healthy place. We were pleasantly surprised! Food was all cooked to perfection with spot-on flavors. I had the bone in pork chops & quinoa. Pork was juicy & tender. I also shard my mom's watermelon salad, it was tasty & refreshing! They were very accommodating of our large group. No issues timing the food. Would go here again in a heartbeat! Good prices for gourmet food."
