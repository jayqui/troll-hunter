Goosefoot
"Fantastic and creative food, amazing service, etc. EVERYTHING you'd want in a restaurant for a special occasion. We stopped by the bottle shop downstairs and were recommended a lovely rose which went very well with the meal.Hands-down a must-try if you're in Chicago :)"
"Went for the first time this past weekend. Food was fantastic- literally everything we ate was wonderful. Probably a better meal than Alinea and Moto and Next, if you can believe it. Here the focus is on flavor, #1, and then presentation. That's what I prefer! If it doesn't taste great, who cares how it looks? But everything here was plated beautifully. Interesting gelees and flowers. Service was mostly good- when we walked in, there was nobody up front and we stood around for a few minutes, unsure of what to do. That was a little weird. Also during the meal I requested a drink which never came. 45 minutes later I asked someone else for it and it came (but I did get an apology from the first server who forgot).My one complaint, truly, is that it takes FOREVER. I was there 3.5 hours. I do not understand the need for such a long wait in between courses. Honestly. You're literally just sitting there and waiting for more food. 3.5 hours! I was falling asleep by the last few courses.I loved the food, and I'd want to go back, but another all-evening-long meal just doesn't seem that appealing."
"Marvelous dining experience.  It's BYOB.  Which is frustrating for non-locals, typically I would have our cab stop at a liquor store and then hightail it to the restaurant.  Luckily, GF has recently opened their GF wine shop right next door!  If you shop there, GF will waive the corkage fee.  Mainly full bottles, but there is a limited selection of half bottles.  We purchased two French selections for under $100 including tip and tax.  The dining room is warm and humble.  Same goes for the staff, all extremely friendly and makes any diner feel at ease.  If you're celebrating something special, the chef writes a well stated long message on your menu, the server will ask you for the correct spelling of your name.  How personalized and sweet.  Menus are printed on planting seed paper.  Very interesting and unique.  Food has touches of gastronomy, but not overly so.  Food was savory, satiating, balanced and seasoned perfectly.  The progression of the meal was very clear.  The standouts were: truffled potato soup, scallop, tuna, venison, angus beef and roquefort.  There is really no need to go through all the details, as no course would leave a diner disappointed.  I was so impressed at the quality of the meal and the well thought out details. If I lived in Chicago, this would be on my regular rotation, it is great approachable food, but not something anyone can make at home.  Make the effort and venture out to one of the finest tasting meals in town!"
"Very beautifully prepared dishes and for 9 plates at their price, it is a steal. Memorable:  all the gelees topped with flowers, especially the mini orchid, egg custard topped with shrimp bisque, tender angus steak, macaroon topped with Roquefort creamIt's more a personal preference but I would have preferred my venison and scallop rarer.  Wine selection next door was great and the lady at the shop was very helpful in giving us the perfect choices.  Hostess, wife of chef was so hospitable."
Came here for our tenth anniversary.  Was a night to remember.   Service was outstanding.  We were greeted by the owner who knew it was our anniversary.   They called in advance for food allergies.   Food is spectacular.    Every dish is art.  Tastes as good as it looks.     Can't miss and we are coming back for sure.    It's expensive but when you look at the service and the presentation and the wonderful taste it's very fair and great for a special occasion.
"Absolutely incredible, unquestionably 5-star quality food and service, and candidate for best meal of my life.  There is incredible care taken in the preparation of the food, the presentation, and intimacy of the room.  Romantic - yes!  This place is proposal-worthy.BYOB - what an amazing idea.  Why isn't this everywhere?  What better to complement amazing food than a wine of your own choosing, and here that is not only possible, but greatly encouraged with FREE corkage!  I brought a Kosta Browne Pinot Noir and an icewine for dessert, and both paired amazingly.  Chicago is cutting-edge when it comes to BYOB, and it's a trend I hope to see replicated elsewhere, because I have a lot of wines that are occasion-worthy that I'd like to break out for a meal like this.Nina was the nicest hostess imaginable.  I was concerned about making it to a convention event at 9:30, and she reassured me that despite what you may read in some reviews here, a 3-hour tour is completely normal (and indeed I was in and out in very close to 3 hours).  If pacing or other commitments are an issue for you, by all means mention it and it should not be a problem.  As noted by others, a description of the food itself may not be helpful because it changes so frequently, but I'll post my menu and some short notes.AMUSE: the truffle beignet on a bed of wheat grass was ""an amazeball"".  A great start to an amazing adventure in dining.SCALLOP: just perfect in texture and presentation.  Perhaps the best I've ever had.CORN SOUP: I had a corn soup once in Zurich that was so good it completely redefined my expectations of what a soup could be.  Goosefoot confirmed that.  Crazy good, with an amazing sunflower foam.SALMON: a beautiful and perfectly-prepared piece of one of my fave fishes.DUCK: see the picture for the 1000 words - just a perfect cut of deliciousness.BEEF: the tenderloin was, again, one of the best examples of beef I've eaten.CHEESE: the creme provincial was so good I inquired about it.  It's a triple-creme cow-milk cheese rolled in herbs de Provence.  Drool.  The candied artichoke stuck to my teeth and I gave it up early, but it was about the only thing I didn't completely devour all night.PEAR: so perfect - light, flavorful.  Even on a full stomach by this point, it was amazing.PINEAPPLE: served as a parfait with coconut foam, another fantastic dessert.Very hard to get a reservation at, but completely worth it, and less than half the price of Alinea (not including the bonus free corkage).  If you are planning a trip to Chicago, book it before you buy your airline ticket (it's that good)."
"Goosefoot is a special experience. Incredible attention to detail. Dishes were whimsical in their presentation. Unlike our experiences at some other high-end restaurants in Chicago, the servers are warm and welcoming. The first 3 courses were our favorite - the scallop, egg, and chestnut soup - in part because they were so creative. Their food and wine store  has a good selection of wine in a wide range of prices, starting at about $14."
"Well, I'm not sure a review of Goosefoot can even do it justice.  This is one restaurant that definitely does not disappoint and it lives up to it's justified high marks.I finally scored a reservation on a Thursday evening about two months in advance.  I am sure it was a random cancellation as I have been attempting to dine here for about two years!  However, I wasn't complaining and I was going to do whatever it took to have my dinner!First of all, they call about a week and a half in advance to confirm.  I suspect this is a smart thing considering they want to keep the restaurant full and allow others to make reservations if people are canceling...However, I don't know who would possibly cancel a reservation here...unless they were immobile.Anyway, I of course confirmed and asked about my byo options and was directed to their website.  I checked out the website and just gawked at all of the delicious looking food for a few minutes before I found the right page...and while helpful, the suggestions definitely allow for you to bring whatever you like to go with your meal.I stopped in to Lush Roscoe Village and asked the person working if they had dined at Goosefoot before...and yes, he had!  So, we talked through some options.  I typically like Sauvignon Blanc, but admit it doesn't always pair well with food, so, I wanted something food friendly.  I selected a Portugese sparkling (total winner, dry and nicely yeasty) and a french Loire Valley wine (perfect for food pairing - sort of a cross between a Chardonnay and Riesling...hard to describe, but wonderful!).  My red was something I had been storing for a while - it was a CA merlot - which also turned out to be a great pairing.So, we arrived at the restaurant and we were warmly greeted by the chef's wife.  She seated us and asked if it was a special occasion (it wasn't but it would be a great spot for one!).  Our wines were whisked away and chilled and glasses brought for the sparkling.I'm not going to go into every menu item as I know the menu changes relatively frequently.  However, I will say that everything was absolutely divine and beautifully presented.  Fresh was an understatement - it was like the vegetables and greens were taken from the garden 5 seconds before serving.  Fish and meats were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I have to also say that the edible flowers were so lovely!  They made each dish look like a present and while I would say they were too pretty to eat, I definitely got over that issue quickly!  The only item that I think wasn't over the top amazing was the steak.  I was still wonderful, but just not as inventive as the rest of the dishes.All in all, I was thrilled with dinner and was so glad to have finally dined here.  I was also glad that we weren't looked at oddly when we didn't finish all of our wines and took the remainder home.  Service was perfect and not overly formal.  While the space was beautiful, it was also very homey and relaxing - not stressful as some fine dining spots are.  It was also very bright - perfect to see the food!Expensive, but I thought not extravagently so.  Obviously this isn't a spot that most people would dine at regularly, but for a once in while thing or a special occasion, it was perfect.  The plantable menus - also a really nice touch!"
"I'm so happy to have finally dined at Goosefoot, though I am simultaneously sad that I did not go years ago because I would have been back countless times since.Goosefoot lived up to the hype, at least for everyone in my party.We loved the friendly service and the intimate atmosphere. The pacing of our meal sounds better than what many other folks have reported. Our meal probably took around 3.5 hours.  A pace of 3 may have perfect, but this was fine - we obviously weren't in a rush.The food was incredible - there was not a single dish that disappointed. This also seems like a relatively safe place for people who aren't incredibly adventurous. The dishes all featured more common proteins or veggies with really beautiful flavors (scallop, salmon, beef, duck breast etc). No offal, etc.Before leaving I made a couple reservations for 2015 and I am so very much looking forward to them!Their long awaited shop selling wine, cheese, chocolates, soups, etc will open next door on 10/14!"
"Perhaps the best food experience of my life. Was it long? Yes - but I expected that.Was every dish phenomenal? No (tho all were far above average)Best dish for me? The beef blew my mind. Blew. My. Mind. The service was just right. Attentive and genuine.Oh, and since I couldn't find it in other reviews, the dress code is dressy jeans."
"First off, the food is spectacular and the presentation gorgeous.I had read from other reviews that the dinner ran overly long.  I chalked that up to those reviewers perhaps not being experienced with a tasting menu.  My best friend and I have been lucky to have had many multi-course dinners over the years, both here in Chicago and NYC, running from 6 to 18 courses.  And I have to agree with the other reviewers-the pacing between courses is really, really long.  25 min long.  Yes, we timed it.  Not because we are normally that obnoxious, but because we couldn't believe it.We even mentioned it to our servers, and they were so apologetic but we got the feeling that nothing could be done about it.  For the two of us, dinner was over 3 1/2 hrs.  We actually ran out of things to talk about.  I would give Goosefoot 5 starts if they could simply cut the time between courses in half."
"A TRULY unique experience - our party of six spent a solid 5 hours (a bit on the long side for me and I took off one star because nobody warned me of the time needed).The 9 course menu had two or three surprise additions so we had 11 - 12 courses in all. For the birthday girl in our party they even put a candle in one of the dessert courses. Nice touch. This ""meal"" was much more of an event, it's not just a dinner in a restaurant. And I would even say that calling it a restaurant is not a good description - you are going to ingest a big edible show.Overall, it was a bit like climbing a mountain - I'm glad that I can say I did it, but I can't imagine doing it twice.... but never say never ;)"
"I have been going to Goosefoot on a regular basis since it opened in December 2011.  I was somewhat shocked by the person that reviewed Goosefoot and said that the wait between courses was too long at 25 minutes and that the wait time should be cut in half. Chef Chris Nugent runs a very small kitchen and to expect a new course every 12.5 minutes is not only impossible, it would be undesirable. If you want your food fast, go to a fast food restaurant. If you want to experience a chef's cuisine, relax and let them take you on their culinary journey. I had attended Goosefoot twice in the past two weeks, and loved it. Chef Nugent has some new courses that are wonderful. I actually thought that the timing was too fast and asked that they slow things down (probably a reaction to the review). But seriously, it's not a race! New on the menu is tropes onion soup/heirloom tomato/goat milk cheese, big eye tuna, potato gnocchi/truffle butte/allium. All are welcomed additions to the already amazing menu.  So if you want fast food, I think that there are several places in Chicago that will be perfect. If you want to enjoy the genius of a Michelin one star chef, to go Goosefoot!"
"Interesting food,  incredible flavors,  wonderful staff.  A Chicago must if it's in your budget."
"I'm not going to give a run-down of each course (plenty of people have done that already) but I will give a warning:  the meal can get VERY long.I'm not a ""rushy"" eater.  I enjoy savoring each delicious bite, and the company I keep at dinner, usually my beautiful wife.  But when we went to Goosefoot I couldn't believe how long it was taking.  It's a tasting menu, and we often had 45 minutes in between courses.  45 minutes!!!  It doesn't need to be McDonald's, but if you're doing a tasting menu it has to be quicker than 45 minutes.  We were starving the entire meal and left starving as well.A number of people have complained about this, so I don't know if anything will be done or not.  I'm writing my review as a warning:  yes, the food is great, but I'm not sure it's worth sitting around over 4 hours for.99/365"
"Went to Goosefoot last night with my wife and a couple of friends.  Absolutely fantastic.  I am not sure why those who complain on here about the length of the dinner use that as a reason to give a not-so-great review.  If you are going to drop the money on a dinner like this: (1) you know its 9 courses and so they most likely will not be firing them out of the kitchen, and (2) you should already have known this going in b/c its pretty much written about in 50+% of the reviews on the internet.  Yes dinner may take 3-4 hours, but its an experience and each table in that restaurant is only meant for one party each night (they dont turn the tables over at all).Anyway, we were warmly greeted and shown to our table at which point the head chef's wife came over and talked with us to explain the menu, the process, as well as a couple of other conversational points.  I think we had in total 11 or 12 courses (including the off-menu items sent out by the kitchen).  I would say of the 12, 11 were absolutely wonderful.  The 12th I didnt really care only because it was pear-based and I dont like pears.  My top faves were the scallop, the corn soup, the duck and the filet.  And the best part is that its BYOB which saves some major coin at a place like this.  Can't wait to go back."
Enjoyable dinner with friends on a Thursday at Goosefoot.  Dinner was very good with most of the courses coming in with very high levels of execution and very well thought out combinations of ingredients plus great texture mixes.  Really enjoyed this dinner.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  Chef came out to talk after we wrapped up.  Decor was solid and noise level was good with a bit of background music that you had to stop and listen for.  Overall excellent experience.One suggestion to the owners.  Being a BYOB with this quality of food is excellent and rare.  I would like to have the option of decanting my wine that I bring.  Really expensive decanters are not necessary as it doesn't have to be crystal and snobby.  I would love just a wide bottomed glass decanter you can pick up for $20 to decant my wine as I'm guessing many guests like myself are anticipating this fantastic dinner and bring some big wines to drink.  Decanting would be a great benefit to those bringing older or really big wines that could use some air.  Other than that... fantastic!Would recommend this place for special occasions or just a great food night out.  Rezy's are hard to come by as they book up way in advance.  I'm always a fan of Thursdays for great dinning nights out and Goosefoot delivered.
"Overall, it was great. We actually went there a few months back, but I was too busy to write this review. The flavor was subtle. For me, it was lacking the punch line and some complexity. One of our waitress was new (probably not so new now), but she tried hard. The host and the chef wrote us a little note since we told them that we came for our anniversary.(to be continued...)"
"I have waited a long time to dine here and was very put off by the process of getting in. Now, I understand. This is such a intimate dining experience, and worth waiting for. We were greeted by the chef's wife upon arrival and the wait staff.It was a four hour journey, that appealed to all senses. In total, we had eleven courses and enjoyed almost all of them. Each server explained the food  and we chatted about the previous course. It was like a personal chef was cooking for you.At the end of the meal, the owner came by to thank us for coming and offered to call us a cab. I will never forget my night at Goosefoot."

"This was my first visit to Goosefoot, and I was impressed with the food and pleased with the service. Since the menu changes frequently, there's no point I describing individual courses. However each of the 11 courses was top-notch in flavors, balance, textures and presentation.My companion and I agreed that this was among the two top fine dining experiences we've had. I'm looking forward to returning (after my credit card gets out of rehab)."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this restaurant for months. Its taken me more than 8 months to get a booking at this place on a weekend since I don't live in Chicago. Its totally worth the hype and such a great value. They offer 9 courses for $135.  Each course was exquisite with amazing ""natural"" presentation. There were so many textures and colors in each dish. I had to take 2-5 min before eating to take in all of the sights and sounds of each dish. My favorites are the seared scallop in lobster bisque, the seared venison with indian curry, and the angus beef. The last 2 dessert courses were ok. They were made really well however if you don't love coconut and banana (which is me) then they may not hit on all cylinders. The service was great and they did everything to make us feel comfortable and wanting to celebrate something with us. It took us a few attempts to come up with something to celebrate. We settled on ""life in general"".  Since the restaurant is BYOB, we bought wine next door at the goosefoot shop. They have a very nice selection, although their selection of reds seems to be more centered on french wines rather than other regions. The french wine that they recommended was still quite good. Also picked up a prosecco that was fantastic. (Also note that the chef's wife loves bubbly so she was quite pleased that we gave her half the bottle). I'd venture to say that goosefoot is a much better experience than Next. I'll hopefully be back someday."
"Consistent. Every little flower, herb, vegetable eaten with protein but in different combinations give a new flavor profile. Seasoning, temperature and textures were balanced. This helped with chef recommended pairings especially when transitioning from white to red.Chicago land has great wine guys to suggest a byo bottle or two. If bold, the Aragon gas Coravin system might be a nifty tool to bring.I prefer Acqua Panna over tap. The still bottle water is a great palate cleanser and compliments the wine and meals as well.A dessert wine should be selected based on the flavor profile of desserts posted online. Sauterne challenge...I usually opt out on tea. Sometimes a good cup of coffee is ordered to end a filling meal.DH would finish my plates. He builds an appetite working out before we arrive.Conversation filled the time in between courses.Follow on Twitter, where open seats are tweeted.."
"Goosefoot is a solid tasting menu with big portion sizes, but if you're looking to be wowed, there are lots of better choices in Chicago.  Come for the family atmosphere and byob if you're looking for a tasting menu.Upon arriving I was impressed with the staff's memory as they easily recognized my dining companions who had been before. Good strategy to keep the books filled in the future by being friendly and providing on the spot future reservations, making it impossible to get in unless you get in grandfathered in.  The ambiance was inviting but stale. I loved the flower arrangements. The music was bipolar, elevator music putting me to sleep for a while, the 70's then contemporary?  The meal started quickly with a nice golden beet amuse, however we didn't get our first course until 27 minutes after arriving.  The pace of the meal continued to be an issue the rest of the night. It was a 4 hour meal. That's way too long for only 9 courses and 2 amuse.  I don't mind eating for 4 hours but I better have 25 courses.  Portion sizes were huge, biggest portions of a tasting menu I've had.  Specifically the soup and steak can fill you up on their own.  Despite the sizes I walked away hungry after the length of the meal. Our server was new, she was adequate, but I didn't feel super loved or get in depth food explanations. I hate just a quick listing of ingredients.  Others have already listed a complete list of the meal, I'll highlight the salmon, soup and strawberry dessert as favorites. The best bite of the night was the compressed apple. Every dish was solid, no misses, this is hard to accomplish. But in a week I won't remember anything I ate, nothing wowed me.  No clear standout signature dishes and this the ultimate failing. There are so many places I can go for a solid meal.  When I want world class tasting menu, Michelin star rated no less, I need more. I need a wow dish, a change in my perception of what can be done or in flavor profile.  The flavors are well balanced and subtle finishes of flowers abound, but it leaves you wanting to be punched in the face with something bold every once in a while.  The foie gras powder is a perfect example.  It sounds titillating but your left trying to find the flavor, instead of air. Another issue I have is Chef's Nugent use of jellies and micro flowers.  They all tasted great, but then they were seemingly on every day its just contrived.  Additionally, they were so small you couldn't use them to compliment the main dish. Fun time with friends, but I can't see myself coming back."
Awesome Dinner!
"I don't really understand how come people are going crazy for this place.  The food is good, but not outstanding.  Alinea, Next, Avenues, Moto...all have more interesting dishes.  When we went there, the lights flickered the whole time, the meal lasted 3.5 hrs, and everyone in the place had the same look of, ""how much longer is this going to take?""  It is expensive cuisine that just takes too long and is not worth the time or the money."
"This is a world class restaurant.The dinner consists of 9 courses, plus amuse bouche, plus palate cleanser, and ends with a home made chocolate. We arrived a little early for an 8 pm reservation and finished around 11:30.The menu is seasonal and the current menu will remain for about a month; it is posted on the web site.All of the courses were exceptional, but there were a few standouts:The first course scallop: a diver scallop in a bed of crab meat with a lemongrass infused sauce; only Le Bec Fin had a better scallop;Third course Jerusalem Artichoke (Sunchoke) Soup with a heavenly truffle froth; a very large portion almost a meal in itself;Sixth course Angus Beef with lentils, cumin flavoring and ""compressed apple"".Each dish had amazing, imaginative flavor combinations; the Salmon course featured a nice piece of fish with a dash of coriander - extremely flavorful while not undercutting the salmon.I noticed that the early diners were pretty much served at the same time and the later arrivals also were somewhat coordinated, but except at the beginning of the meal      there was no real delay issue.Service is excellent and each course is explained in detail.  Nina Nugent, Chris' wife runs the front of the restaurant and is exceptionally nice."
"The food is beautiful, and tasty.   But, as others have said, they are sloooowww.  So slow.  My husband and I spent 4.5 hours at the restaurant and it was half empty.  Even for 9 courses (we've been to other similar restaurants) that is a long time. If they institute some efficiencies in the kitchen and can pick up the pace, it will be an absolute gem.  But for now, I don't think I'd recommend it."
"Had an amazing experience here. Booked a reservation 2 months ahead and had a lot if time to ponder the menu and what i wanted to drink since its byob, which i thought was really cool. Every dish was carefully executed. The portions were good and the food was rich so i didn't leave hungry. The duck, well i still talk about that dish when fine dining is brought up. Absolutely amazing!!! Service was also equally fantastic. This is a bucket list type place if you enjoy fine dining."
"Just now getting around to writing this review. After trying to find a reason to go I ended up booking a free night for no reason other than the fact I could get a table. The food was wonderful. The space is cozy and nice. The owner who works the front of the house was so wonderful and friendly. It was a great experience. Yet, somehow I can't muster up the strength to give this place the fifth star! I don't know if the edible flower thing with gels was an overused gimmick or a theme, but it did feel a bit old after a while. Every dish was cooked perfectly, but also felt a bit too composed and too perfect, bordering on uninspired. These words sound harsh and if you love food you should go, and if you love the upscale byob movement in Chicago you must go! It is a long dinner but I knew that going in and we expected that. we even made friends later in the nigh with a group who was there who comes every six months. I also talked to a colleague who had the exact same menu with a few minor changes months before, which sort of bummed me out, I would love to see more experimentation and diversity in the menu from night to night. More like 4+ stars, but just couldn't muster up the 5th after a few months have passed and I struggle to remember what I had for most of the courses!"
"Wow.  I had many pre fix meals in my tenure as a foodie.  Goosefoot is second to none of them!  I would go as far as it rivals French Laundry (gasp!).  I had been waiting to come here for over a year.  It is difficult - next to impossible to get reservations here.  Goosefoot has a lot of repeat patrons and Nina knows all of their names! Exceptional service and such friendly staff.  The following is our 3 hour dinner:Hamachi/crab/lemongrassshrimp/preserved garlic/rosemarycorn soup/potato/sunflower truffle essencescottish salmon/espelette/crawfish/corianderfarm egg/asparagus/parmigiano-reggianoangus beef/spiced beluga lentils/cumin/compressed appleroquefort cheese/goji berry / hazelnut/ pear/portapricot/cassia/kaffir lime/citruschocolate/passion fruit/coconut/ice wineChef Chris Nugent is a magician.  Nina, his wife, is the hostess.  Food comes from local farms and is super seasonal! I would definitely recommend and would go back myself!  (You can plant their menus they are made of wild flowers!)"
"Fantastic restaurant, wonderful experience in all aspects. Friendly, extremely courteous and helpful staff, delicious food (perhaps the best was the squash soup, followed by the beef), and great ambiance. If you go, plan to be there a while, though - our meal lasted over 4 and a half hours!"
This was a great expereince and a ver delicious meal. I am not sure if Goosefoot is part of the slow food movement but you will take your time here and enjoy the company and the food.  It is a very intimate experience.  I think we were there for over 3.5 hours.  The preparation and presentation of each course was superb.  I enjoyed the fact that it was BYOB!
"I've been wanting to try this place for a looong time.it's almost impossible to get reservations but I got lucky and got a last minute reservation for the 9pm seating.since it's the last seating of the day, the dinner only lasted about 3 hours and half, and honestly, the time just flew by, it'll be over before you know it.Service was really nice, our waitresses explained every dish they brought over and patiently answer any questions we had, also they were nice enough to have the chef wrote a special note for my friend who was moving away.The food!! presentation was just nice and clean, and they use a lot of flowers in their plating :) every single bite was just so so good, my favoriate of the night has to be the scallop dish, but honestly, everything was worth every penny :)will definitely go back :)"
"Goosefoot for our 10th anniversary (12/27/13) was an extravagance, a once-per-decade expenditure as a treat for ourselves. Was it worth it? Stay tuned for the answer. For now, the menu:1st course: Scallop - perfectly prepared, which is always a trick with scallops. Good flavor.2nd course: Shrimp - served in a brown eggshell, a custardy, garlicky delight. Adorable presentation. One of the highlights of the night.3rd course: Chestnut soup - rich and creamy with a truffley foam on top. Deceptively large bowl, but I could've eaten 3 bowls of the stuff.4th course: Toothfish - aka Chilean sea bass, apparently. So the server informed us. This one didn't do it for me. The texture was mealy and odd. I admit ignorance here - maybe sea bass is just that way. Flavor was pretty one-note, but it was edible.5th course: Duck breast - total autumnal flavors in this one. I enjoyed it, but my wife didn't dig the pumpkin pie-like, heavily sweet-spiced taste.6th course: Angus beef - beautifully prepared, and a good conclusion to the ""main course"" portion of the menu. Excellent quality.7th course: Roquefort cheese - can't go wrong with a nice stinky cheese. I don't remember much about this course, to be honest.8th course: Cinderella pumpkin - a couple of bottles into the night, and 8 courses in, I hope you'll forgive me for not really recalling the dessert courses.9th course: Chocolate - a good grand finale. I do remember this one, which is a good thing. Can't forget a high-quality chocolate. Passion fruit and coconut added contrast.This is what I, a poor person, imagine rich people eat every day. Alfred would be cooking this stuff for Bruce Wayne, if he wasn't out fighting crime. Not to imply that the food or the space are pretentious. They're actually pretty laid back and down to earth, which I like. BYOB always earns points from me too. Although they recently raised prices to keep it BYOB, which sorta negates the benefit.I feel like a fancy restaurant - a really fancy one - should redefine what food can be. Like a car can be more than a mere tool for transportation, food can be more than calories for my food-hole. Oh wait, I don't really believe a luxury car is better than a cheap one. Then again, nor do I think it's ok to settle for a heap with no heat and no A/C. But there's a happy medium somewhere. While man cannot live on McDonald's alone, nor can he live on Goosefoot alone, unless he's one of the 1%.I've never flown 1st class. I feel like if I did, it would ruin air travel for me forever. I'd never be able to take a step back to economy class again. And since I can't afford to fly 1st class, that would be horribly depressing. Goosefoot should have changed my life. It should have ruined food for me forever. I know that's a tall order, and an awful thing to want, but for a $345 dinner (tax and tip, etc.), that's what I demand. Probably best that didn't happen.When I drive by Goosefoot in my taupe '99 Toyota Camry with the tape over the window that won't quite roll all the way up, I don't feel wistful. I don't sigh and dream of truffle-chestnut soup and preserved garlic custard in an eggshell. Would I eat that kind of haute cuisine every day if I could? Perhaps, but I've gone back to eating simpler fare without missing a beat. Excellent as it was, it wasn't life-changing. Chef Chris Nugent does great work, and I'm not implying the place is a ripoff. The food is top-notch, but I still felt some sticker shock, and later, buyer's remorse, but that's just cuz I'm a poor person. Highly recommended for those with disposable income. Don't think I'd go back - can't afford it."
"Ambience: 5Food: 3.5Service: 5Value: 3.5My first experience at a Chicago prix-fixe restaurant. Overall I thought the experience was good. I guess I was hoping to be blown away by the gastronomic experience, but I wasn't. My high hopes weren't met by the food so it lessened what I had hoped to have been a 5 star rating. A good thing compared to the others we considered: Alinea, Grace, Elizabeth, Next was that Goosefoot is byob, which helps to lessen the investment. It's a 4 hour dining experience so the chances of going through a few wine pairings is high and if you don't have your own you will indeed double or triple the overall cost of your night. I thought the quality of food was very good, but the taste was pretty good. Am interested to see how the others in Chicago compare and will continue to hunt for the 5+ star rating!"
"Goosefoot is a great addition to Lincoln Square. Serving up some inventive dishes on their 8 course menu leaves you happy and satisfied. Esp for the price - $90 for 8 courses and it's BYOB - this is quite a bargain.  My faves were the poached beet amuse-buche, lobster and scallop with curry sauce, angus sirloin with the gelatin carrot purée, and all of the desserts. Really good. We also got to visit with Chef Nuget for a little while and the was most modest cook I've ever met - he used every opportunity to give credit to the small staff at goosefoot. The whole thing took close to 2 hours capped off with a nice coffee at the end. I would go back once he updates his menu."
Some of the best customer service I've experienced. Food was unbelievable.  The chestnut soup was legendary!  Very good value for the price.
"I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of Goosefoot since I had read about Chris Nugent's decision to leave Les Nomades and open his own venue.  Tonight my wife and I had the privilege of being the first patrons at the official opening night. Goosefoot is an upscale restaurant featuring tasting menus utilizing the finest seasonal ingredients from small farms. The food is contemporary American with French influence. For now there is an eight course menu offered for $90 per/person and in the coming weeks a twelve course menu will be available as well. Goosefoot does not have a bar, but welcomes you to bring your own wine and beer and make recommendations on their website for what pairs with their current menu. Goosefoot is located in Lincoln Square and brings a fine dining option to the neighborhood. There is a small parking lot behind the restaurant, plenty of street parking and the brown line will drop you off within walking distance. Goosefoot is an intimate setting; there are just 28 seats and the decor is warm and comfortable. We were enthusiastically greeted by Nina, Chris Nugent's wife as we entered and this set the tone for what turned out to be an evening of exemplary service by the entire staff. Even Chris himself came to our table and spent a few minutes chatting with us. While this was opening night, everything appeared to already be running without a hitch. Each of the eight courses were outstanding and elegantly and artistically presented. The quality of the ingredients really popped. Each dish had interesting accompaniments that interacted perfectly with the featured ingredient. There was just the right amount of seasoning and sauces; enough to enhance the flavoring but not overpower the excellent meats and seafood. The first dish featured lobster and also included Hubbard squash, licorice root and curry. After just one bite I knew that I was in for a real treat; this dish was so amazing and yet every dish that followed remained at this high level. It was like the culinary version of a movie where you are on the edge of your seat the entire time with excitement and anticipation. The second dish, a chestnut soup with smoke, white Alba mushrooms and truffle essence was easily the best soup I have tasted. The Angus beef dish was likewise one of the best beef dishes I have enjoyed and the cheese course and desserts were home runs as well. The sign of a truly great chef is one that creates food so good that dishes one usually does not care for taste so good you crave more. I have never been drawn to chocolate desserts, but the chocolate finale to the eight course dinner was so delicious I had to fend off my wife from stealing my portion after she devoured hers! By the end of the night my taste buds felt like they were in heaven. My wife and agreed this was easily one of our top meals ever. Chris Nugent was somehow overlooked by Michelin during his tenure at Les Nomades, but I think a new star has been born in Goosefoot. I would be shocked if this venue does not rapidly ascend into one of Chicago's hottest restaurants. I highly encourage people to come here quick as with the seating being so limited, I imagine reservations will be hard to score in the very near future. This is the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or to just enjoy an all around sensational meal. Chicago is home to some of the greatest restaurants in the country and Goosefoot is right up there with the best of them.  We definitely plan to return soon to partake in the twelve course menu when it is unveiled. I want to thank Goosefoot for such an amazing dinner and wish Goosefoot much success."
"There's nothing to say that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep it brief.  Goosefoot is a must try, although you'll have to try heartily, since it's super hard to get in.  The staff is supremely friendly, though, so when I called explaining that I had a gift certificate that desperately needed using, they did allow me to bypass the midnight-90-days-in-advance-opentable dance.  But it was 90 days out nonetheless.As for the dining experience, delightful.  Not nearly as stuffy as some of the other high end pre-fix places in town, and the staff is great.  The only reason for four stars is my need to compare everything to the late Bonsoiree (RIP), which was the best pre-fix place ever.  But really, it's very very good, and I highly recommend it."
"Goosefoot, you have amazed me by exceeding every expectation in terms of food, service, and atmosphere.We arrived promptly for our 5:30 reservation with a bottle of red and white wine in tow to partake in their BYOB policy. Since we were the first to arrive, the hostess let us pick which table we wanted. Upon being seated the hostess revealed herself as the Chef's wife and told us that the menu outlined nine courses but there would be two additional samplings, making it an overall eleven courses.The first dish that came out was one of the off menu samplings from the kitchen. There was a morsel of  a beet nestled on top of a smear of goat cheese and drizzled in a citrus oil. The beet soaked up the citrus oil, and it was bursting with flavor that was mellowed out with the goat cheese which was very enjoyable.After the plates were cleared away, we were able to dive into the actual menu, which was as follows:1) lobster/scallop/licorice root/curry: What a fantastic start to the meal both in terms of taste and presentation. One perfectly seared (and non-gritty) scallop was nestled in an orange puree of lobster infused with a subtle curry flavor. Off to the side were a few colorful greens that you could incorporate as you liked to add texture to the dish. The licorice root added a nice hint of flavor and substance to the sauce. Outstanding.2) shrimp/preserved garlic/rosemary: Wow. There really isn't an easy way to put into words how outstanding this was in terms of presentation and flavor. The dish was served in a hollowed out eggshell that was filled with pureed shrimp, garlic, and rosemary. Well done, Goosefoot, well done.3) sunchoke soup/potato/truffle essence: When this dish came out it was overpoweringly aromatic with truffles due to the frothy foam on top that permeated the soup. The truffle luckily was balanced out with the small bits of potato that sunk to the bottom. I have never had sunchokes before and they didn't seem to have a strong flavor in the soup, which I can't decided was good or bad. Overall, this was probably my least favorite of the night.4) arctic char/maltake/english pea/espelette: Delicious! The arctic char was enhanced by the spicy red espelette pepper and mellowed out with the english pea that it was perched on top of. This was a small dish, but the flavors were fantastic.After this dish we were served one of the ""off menu"" courses which was a pomegranate and beet shooter that was laced with olive oil. This was tart at the beginning and then mellowed out with the pomegranate flavor at the end. It had a unique texture due to the olive oil addition, but it was a great palate cleanser and set us up for the next ""phase"" of the menu.5) duck breast/spiced beluge lentils/ginger/compressed apple: Without a doubt, the duck was one of my favorites of the evening. The duck was properly cooked at a medium rare temperature and we received a fair portion with this dish. The spiced beluge lentils were perfectly cooked and added a nice flavor and bite with the duck. Off to the side of the duck were small gelatin squares of ginger along with two compressed green apple globes which was an amazing flavor.6) angus beef/cauliflower/goosefoot/trumpet roylae/shallot jus: After thinking I had experienced the best of the meal with the duck, the angus beef gave the duck breast a run for its money. The angus beef was perfectly cooked to a nice medium and the simple seasoning was spot on, making it a truly fantastic piece of meat. The presentation on this was superb--the beef was circled by a pristine circle of shallot jus and nestled in a cauliflower puree and garnished with goosefoot. Each bite was heavenly and it was obviously a favorite as I savored every bite and it was gone within seconds by my boyfriend. 7) crispy goats milk cheese/lemon balm/red pepper/balsamic: And the awesomeness continued. The phyllo dough added a great crunch to the cheese and the richness was balanced out with the tartness of the lemon balm and the sweetness of the red peppers and balsamic. This was another favorite of the evening without a doubt.8) cinderella pumpkin/turkish coffee/cassla/citrus: I'm a sucker for pumpkin, so I LOVED this dessert. The pumpkin was moist mousse like texture that was encased in white chocolate and topped with a chocolate covered espresso bean. This was a beautiful presentation and went wonderfully with the incredibly potent citrus mousse on the side. 9) hazelnut/chocolate/caramel corn/coconut: Delicious. This again had a mousse like texture that was incredibly rich. The chocolate and the hazelnut flavors were superb, and I loved the texture profile of this dessert. The caramel corn provided a nice crunch and the coconut marshmallow was light and airy. Fantastic.We ended the meal with another surprise from the kitchen which was a gooseberry dipped in dark chocolate-this was simple but scrumptious. I can't wait to celebrate another special occasion here, thank you Goosefoot!"
"Such a unique and amazing dining experience! This is truly a form of entertainment than just a dinner. The entire dinner takes about 4 hours but at no point did I feel like things were slow. The timing was perfect.My husband and I went here for my birthday. Everything was delicious. The level of consistency was great and there was no course that didn't impress. That being said, there wasn't any one course that just made us go ""OMG best thing I've ever had"". When paying this much money for a meal I really was hoping for something to stand out as just amazing and there wasn't, which is why I took away one stay.Overall, a deliciously consistent dinner with amazing service. It's such a great experience from the moment you walk in. The BYOB option makes this style of dining more approachable for others. A great addition to Lincoln Square!"
"Goosefoot by far surpassed our expectations. Each dish that Chef Chris created did not only taste phenomenal but also visually spectacular. The meat and fish were cooked beautifully and the combination of flavors was exciting. A table favorite was the beignet filled with cherries and maytag bleu cheese was amazing. The personal call a couple days before our reservations was really nice touch and chef was able to accommodate a food allergy in our group. The service staff never missed a beat. They were attentive and personable without being overbearing.Nina, Chef Nugent's wife, runs the front of the house and is the most gracious hostess. We look forward to coming back to Goosefoot and bringing more friends with us. Thank you again to Chris and Nina for a truly memorable night!!!!"
"Delicious! For the experience, 4.5 stars! Minor imperfections though... so.. ehh why not. FIVE STARS!By some miracle, I snatched up a reservation out of what looks like maybe 2 or 3 that suddenly opened up 3 days before the date on Open Table. After around 3 months of checking periodically it happened! So don't give up if you have trouble getting in! Though I suppose your dates would have to be flexible.Walking in I immediately noticed how laid back the place felt, due to both the decor and and the way people were casually chatting, eating, having a nice time. The place is pretty loud. It made us feel very at ease. But dim. I wish it weren't so dim, but that's okay. Nina greeted us with a smile both at the beginning and end and made us feel really welcomed. It was a little weird that we chose not to B our own B, and I think that does take away from the experience a little because during some potentially long waiting time between courses, we could really use something to sip on.As for the food, I liked the first half of the menu more than the second. The warmth and richness of the chestnut soup really made me wanna food coma, go home, and take a nap and dream more about the soup. Plus that's when the long waits between the courses began. Looking back, the duck and beef were cooked beautifully (bf reallllly loved the beef and kept talking about it) but in my sleepy state they were unable to shock me out of it with explosive flavors. Oh how I wish I could go back and just reexperience those 2 dishes to truly appreciate them :( I was able to appreciate how amazing dessert was though. It made me really sad that the meal was over. Usually I'm not a huge dessert person since it's always too sweet and rich, but I could've had a lot more of both courses. Aside from the long wait time between a few of the courses in the second half, our dining experience was top notch. Everyone was nice, everything done promptly. If their menu changes at some point I'll definitely want to be back."
"KenScale: 9.5/10Wow, a truly amazing restaurant in Chicago! Goosefoot, a New American restaurant featuring locally sourced foods and French technique from Chris Nugent, was the highlight of my restaurant tour in Chicago. While I am more biased toward truly inventive cuisine that I can't eat elsewhere, I've never been to a place where the foods look simple enough yet the execution is simply flawless. I'm surprised that this place has only one Michelin star so far.Goosefoot offers single tasting menu at an absolute steal of $115 per person. Among all the tasting menu experiences I've had so far, I don't think I've had a time where each dish was so flavorful and is a class on its own. Some particularly memorable dishes were: cauliflower soup, farm egg and asparagus, angus beef (sometimes, venison is featured instead, but I'm glad I had the beef, which was ridiculously tender), and both desserts (apricot and chocolate/passion fruit). The restaurant is BYOB only, so if you're planning on drinking there, make sure to bring your own wine (the staff will graciously open the bottle and serve it on their glasses for you). Getting a reservation in this restaurant is ridiculously hard, and I feel truly blessed to have been able to get a last-minute reservation shortly before my visit to Chicago. If you want to visit this restaurant on a regular basis, it's probably smart to befriend Nina Nugent (chef's wife at the restaurant) and make reservations for the next dinner after your meal is over."
"Honestly, how does one really do Goosefoot justice even with giving them 5*. I can truly say, this may have been one of the best meals that I have ever had. It wasn't just the food, but everything included. I'm writing this a few days after coming here, and I still shake my head in awe at how great the meal and service was. I'm honestly dumbfounded and I had to immediately made reservations for my friend's birthday in march.  I guess in a way I could end it right there, butnahhhhhh. I mean, there is just soooo much to say and it's all positive. I love the general vibe as you walk in. There is a modern feel to it, but it's far from cold. Instead it's small and very relaxed. You are certainly close to other diners, but you aren't even close to on top of them.  I will also say that the staff is completely top notch. Chris Nugent's wife is the Front of House and she greets you with a smile right as you come in. The rest of the staff is just as nice and friendly. Everything was very precise and you could tell that it's a pretty well oiled machine right now. In some ways, it's hard to hit the highlights as everything was very unique and wonderful. Still, there were some obvious stand out dishes. The lobster and scallop dish was the first dish that stuck out to me. Granted, it was the second dish, but still. The scallop was done perfectly and the lobster was pure heaven in the sauce. The portion of it was exactly on point. The chestnut soup was absolutely amazing. It was extremely savory and was layered with flavors. It's rare that soup excels like this for me, but this was transcendent. The two meat dishes also stood out tremendously. The duck was done sous vide and was extremely tender. Granted, I'm a sucker for duck in the first place, but this was taking things to a completely different level. It was done medium-rare and it was beautifully tender. The beef was in a rarefied air level as well. It was rich, but without being too much. What was insane was a truffle powder that you re-hydrate with the sauce around the angus. Even with all of this great food, it was then followed up by 3 tremendous small desserts. I really can't pick between them as to what was better. I will say though, the goat cheese may have been the best. It was in a phyllo dough and was a piece of happiness. There was also a final palate refresher that was off the menu. It was a nice berry-ish plate that finished things off perfectly. The best part was Chris Nugent coming out and spending time talking to us at the end. It was a great touch and it makes you feel good. It did help that we had a later reservation, but I noticed other tables getting a chance to talk to him as well. The fact that they allow BYO is completely amazing. I absolutely love it and it makes someone like me, who does dinners when I can, make me want to go here even more. I've felt push backs before on bringing wine and doing big dinners at restaurants, but being this wine friendly doesn't make you feel like you[re doing something wrong. It's going to be a few months before I get back, but I'm already getting a slow burn of giddiness going. I can't wait and I know I'll make another reservation when I'm there next."
"The experience I had at this restaurant was wonderful.  It feels like you are eating in someone's (really, really nice) dining room in a home.  The front of the house is so warm and welcoming.  You can really tell that everyone, from the owner/chef's wife (I believe?) to the wait staff, want you to have a great experience and that they really care about every single element they are putting in front of you.The food was excellent, it had a consistency about it where everything was prepared at a high level.  I guess my knock to 4 stars comes from my expectations to be blown away by a place of this caliber.  Every dish we had was much better than I expected, but at the same time nothing completely wowed me to the point where I had to step back to take it all in.  I know this is a high bar, but given where it stands among its fine dining peers in the area, that is what one comes to expect in this town.  With that said, there have been other places I have had that ""wow"" factor that I would not put ahead of Goosefoot because of the overall consistency and dining experience that they were able to deliver."
"Goosefoot is located in a nondescript building in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago. The atmosphere is simple and straight forward. This is a fine dinning restaurant that also happens to be BYOB. They offered a nine course tasting which was very good. The corn soup course and preserved garlic served in an egg dish were my favorites. I thought all the courses were solid but none were mind blowing. The service was exceptional and your made to feel like a regular.NOTE:They recently raised their prices from $90 to $135 which is quite a bump up. The byob makes this more palatable.Recommended Dishes:Corn Soup, shrimp/preserved garlic/rosemary and roquefort cheese/goji berry/hazelnut/pear/port.- See more at: chicago.foodmafia.com/re…"
"This summer I was determined to finish up my Michelin star restaurant list. Checking off the restaurants one by one I came across Goosefoot. This place definitely belongs to the top 10 restaurants in Chicago. The food is creative and delicious.Be prepared for a long 3 hour plus dinner and don't forget that the place is BYOB. There are two liquor stores in the walking distance but selection is pretty pathetic,this fine dining experience deserves a special  bottle of wine..."
"Excellent food with beautiful ingredients with consistently GORGEOUS presentations. I've been there three times and each time has been just amazing.  BYOB helps to keep your cost low.  Goosefoot's new wine shop next door has reasonable prices on a variety of wine and champagne so buy there and corkage will be waived.  The menu price has gone up since our first visit but it's still worth every cent.  Nina takes care of you as if you've known her forever.  Timing does run a bit long, but that is because they allow you to relax and enjoy.  I don't want to be rushed through 9 delicious courses; I want to savor each one."
"Fabulous. Tiny courses served in eggshells, on birch wood, in votive-size glass bowls. Plates garnished with truffle oil foam, minuscule flowers, ice wine reductions. Each course is both a work of art and a gastrosensation, timed perfectly, presented by refined teams of discreet servers who explain each course and then leave you to discover the next bit of heaven. Special requests are graciously accommodated, a private room is available for small groups, and you bring your own wine, which allows you to tend to both your tastes and your budget."
"I've eaten at many tasting menus in my day, and goosefoot is the best. London, Paris, NYC, Los Angeles. Whatev. Seriously, there is little comparison to the quality of ingredients and genuineness of the service. It's not pretentious. The food and experience are worth it. Make the trek."
"Great place for a special occasion, the lighting was kind of off.  Too bright I would imagine with canister lighting.  Interesting concept regarding a BYOB higher end restaurant.  As a larger American citizen, I'm not totally into these types of places, ie could have crushed a double whopper with cheese post dinner), but the micro flowers were cool.  Service was great and the pre fix was great too, just not my kind of che che spot on the regular."
"We are not sure why people are so excited about this place? We bought in to the hype and waked away underwhelmed. The wait staff and the owner were super nice, but they still need much more training when it comes to serving fine dining. It just felt like a less than stellar experience from the service perspective, especially with the long wait. Half the menu was good and the other half was so-so and they definitely need to work on the tempo of how far apart each dish is served. A 9 course dinner shouldn't take 3 hours to eat. We were also quite surprised by how low key this place's decor looked. In short, food is ok, but definitely can't compete with any of the fine dining restaurants in Chicago yet."
I went right after they first opened for the first time and it was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back this month!!  I think everyone has already said everything that needs to be said!!  AMAZING!!!!!!
"Goosefoot has mastered how to provide a perfect evening.  Others have raved about the food.  Each course is delicious and inventive.  The nine or maybe 11 courses are just the right size so that at the end of the evening you are pleasantly full, not stuffed.It is important to think of dining there not only as a meal but also an evening.  Our meal took about 3 hours and it was just right.  We had brought with us 2 delicious bottles of wine, and we sipped the wine and relaxed.  No pushing for turnover here.  It was our table.  Each dish arrived at the correct moment--no  fidgets, no waiting no rush.  Nina, our hostess, has incredible skill at making one feel at home.  We had been at the restaurant once before, about a year ago, and we were treated like an old friend.The servers have just the right style.  Not stuffy, but not your buddy either.  No superfluous chattyness unless you push it.  Just  a pleasant smile and a brief explanation about the dish.We've dined all over the world, at famous restaurants and perfect little ethnic ones.  Goosefoot is equal to the best of them.  It illustrates not only how important good food is at a good restaurant, but also  the provision of a total experience."
"This place's flavor profile is very similar to les nomades for the most obvious reason. But for $90 per person plus BYOB, it's worth every penny!  I won't write about every course, my two favorites were the sunchoke soup and angus beef. The soup was probably the best soup I've had.  Creamy, flavorful, with some veggies on the plate to add texture. The angus beef, omg. I am not a steak person, and I tried to make eating out to steakhouses as least often as possible to counter my husband's obsession with steaks. But we still went to some of the good steakhouses in Chicago (Gibsons, David Burke's, Joe's, Morton's steakhouse etc.) So trust me when I say this because I have a very good sample size to compare to--this piece of angus beef is probably THE best steak you will ever have. And it's not some fancy schmancy dry aged or wet aged steak, nor does it have any sauce on it. It's pure, flavorful, perfectly cooked, and melts in your mouth.When we were done with dinner, we went outside to catch a cab. Nina came outside with us and tried to help us catch a cab. Other than Next/Alinea/Aviary, this is the only normal restaurant we've been to that actually went over and beyond to help us catch a cab. It might not mean that much to other people, but I am a sucker for that. And it speaks to their service level. I will definitely be back."
"I will tell you a (quick) funny story...and then I will elaborate as much as posisble on the exceptional meal we enjoyed at Goosefoot this past Friday night. I secured a Friday night 9pm reservation at Goosefoot 2 months ago in anticipation of our arrival back in Chicago on the good recommendations of some trusted eaters. We were going to be back in our cherished fair city, in our new home...let's celebrate! Two days before the reservation, Mrs. Nugent (hostess with the mostess!) called to confirm our reservation and asked me if we were celebrating anything special. Well, of course we were celebrating the above...but had also been discussing wedding plans, etc. There was no formal engagement, but I told her ""yes! we're engaged."" Because, we basically were...so...ok! Not to fret, I did disclose this to my boyfriend so that he wouldn't be taken off guard and I look like a freak. Well, the stars aligned and he actually proposed before that dinner (and it had been planned all along, unbeknownst to me)...so in actuality, we REALLY were celebrating our first dinner as engaged people at Goosefoot. Funny how things work out, right? Ok, pardon my setup to the real story here: the experience at Goosefoot! From the moment we entered, we were treated as treasured guests. Our coats checked, shown to a corner table, wine glasses presented (it is BYOB, bring something nice!), waters filled, menus explained. We settled in and enjoyed the fan fare of the 8-course celebration before us. It's a small (but extremely well appointed and classically decorated) restaurant just west of Western on Lawrence. Unassuming location and decor. But obviously, the treat to be had is really in the presentation, experience of the chef, passion in the staff, and overall experience of a team working thoughtfully together to make their diners feel like the most important thing to them. This really struck a chord with me. Such legitimate and genuine thought is put into everything at Goosefoot right down to the smallest detail. It's really quite rare.OK THE FOOD THE FOOD! Here's the thing, despite eating out ALL THE TIME, I'm not a typical ""foodie."" I'm not anti-foodie, I'm just not really one. I like the whole experience of dining, and that includes not having a camera, and not really paying attention to each and every ingredient in my food. However, for Goosefoot I can make an exception because they did such a fine job of explaining each course, using locally sourced items and being so gosh darned awesome. However, I did not take any photos. I'm sorry, I am not able to do this. However the girl next to me did take 7 photos of each course, so perhaps she will write a review? hehe. You'll find my comments aren't going to be super scientific on each dish, but suffice it to say: it rocked my socks off. We were lucky enough to snag the winter-turning-to-spring menu: amuse-bouche (lovely, rotates nightly) lobster/scallop/hubbard squash/licorice root/curry (heaven) sunchoke soup/potato/shrimp/truffle essence (brilliant) loup de mer/meyer lemon/leek/tapioca pearlsroasted quail/spiced beluga lentils/ginger/compressed apple (the cutest dish)angus beef/heirloom carrots/goosefoot/cumin/shallot jus (my favorite!)pleasant ridge reserve/celery-truffle caponata/almondpassion fruit/coconut/lime/vanilla cremeux (light and fluffy and fruity) chocolate/sea beans/orange/mulled wine (I died, find me in heaven) *word to the wise, if you do NOT like mushrooms/truffle, do tell them and they will accommodate. It's in many dishes, and while I love it...you may not, and they will do their best to exclude it. Obviously though it impacts the overall flavor, but it is a strong one. They do the same for food allergies, etc as well. It was a fabulous meal, capped off by a visit from Chef Nugent himself...who is quite possibly the most down to earth chef I've ever met. This includes ones that aren't very good or aren't particularly esteemed/reputable. Chris is genuine and thoughtful, and it permeates each and every nook, cranny and dish at Goosefoot. $90/pp for the 8-course tasting menu. No corkage fee. Can't get into Next? Skip the ultra-headache and super scene and dine here instead. It was right up my alley, and might tickle your fancy more than you expect...even if you ARE a foodie ;) Wait, especially if you are a foodie. Whatever, just go!"
"Over the past 24 hours since my visit to Goosefoot I've been debating how many stars to give it, and I've settled on a middle-of-the-road 3. Was it an interesting culinary experience? Sure. The 2nd course (shrimp course served in a hollowed-out egg shell) was phenomenal, and the beef was good as well. The chestnut soup was excellent (though we were perplexed as to why that 3rd course was by far the largest, when it was also one of the richest - better to give a smaller portion & leave me wanting more...) Some presentation tricks that were cool at first (""look! foam! flower petals! cool!"") got repetitive by the dessert rounds (""yep, flower petals. And...more foam."").  What really brought down the rating, though, was the service. The server team was friendly-ish enough, but the meal took FIVE HOURS. On a Thursday night. Our res was for 7:00, and we did not get our first tease (some little morsel dropped on a spoon) for 45 minutes; the first actual course did not arrive until hour two. By 11:00 I think we still had all the dessert courses left to go and I was falling asleep at the table (all the wine we drank to amuse ourselves probably contributed). The pacing was ridiculous, and judging by the other reviews here, it's not atypical. It needs to get fixed. Our group consensus was that for the price & the number of courses, it was a worthwhile/memorable experience, yet as of right now I'm in no way inclined to return."
"Run, don't walk, to get a table at Goosefoot. (This is a belated post prompted by the rediscovery of my birthday menu, which was printed on plantable seed paper!). The husband-and-wife chef/owner couple have designed a jewel box on the unlikeliest stretch of Lawrence Ave., and seem committed to expanding. Every dish on the menu was sublime, along with a few surprises -- including some of the chef's specialty chocolates at the end, which are impossible to describe but spectacular in every way. Follow the restaurant on Facebook if you have the flexibility to book a same-day table, as they sometimes come up. And BYO is a huge advantage, as you can bring your favorite vintage(s) to pair with each course. Every server gets an A-plus for being friendly but not overbearing. Eagerly await a return visit."
"I did everything I was supposed to do.  I called, emailed, stayed up until midnight, waited 2 months...finally our reservation was here and I couldn't be more excited!  We started with a tiny beet sliver right when we sat down then waited 30 min until the actual first course.  Weird, but maybe they got backed up.  The first 3 courses were amazing - the chestnut soup stands out.  It was one of the best things we had that night.  It seemed odd to me that we were still waiting 30 min in between each course.  This was way too long and I started to get antsy....The fish course was ok, but not my favorite on the menu.  This was followed by the duck breast and the beef.  Both were great, the beef was unbelievable.  But it took 45 min in between each course.  What?!  I felt like we were going to have to sleep over at the restaurant.  The waitress told us they had gotten backed up but they could speed up the dessert courses.  I told her yes, please do so.  It still took forever.  Even so, every dessert course was fantastic - I particularly loved the pear and cheese course.  The person who wrote about being annoyed by the microgreens made me laugh - they really were everywhere.At the very end of the meal, we received the check and the owner came over to tell us she was discounting our meal because of the wait.  Hallelujah!  They did realize it was unacceptable!  Then she said, the reason everything took so long was because I went to the bathroom and it screwed up the chef.  What?  The meal was 4.5 hours long - yes, I'm going to have to use the restroom during that time (and 2 bottles of wine).  If you are a coursed meal, you should know how to deal with people going to the bathroom.  I am quite positive I am not the only person to go to the bathroom during a meal at this restaurant.  I would understand if it screwed up one course - they were about to serve a course and I got up and they had to start over.  Ok.  But the long waits started from the beginning of the meal.  I left in disbelief.  To be fair, we knew this would be a long meal, but we did not think it would be over 3 hours.  It was entirely too long to sit in one place.  The food was fantastic, but to wait 45 min between some courses was ridiculous.  I would have accepted their apology had they not blamed it on me...but they did.  5 stars for the truly unbelievable food, 1 star for the service.89/365"
"They raised their price to $135 but it is well worth it! This year's menu in my opinion is taster than last, especially the duck! I really heart this place as a special occasion restaurant with a more casual and not so pretentious atmosphere. The bed part is byob! Never take that away!!!"
"I really enjoyed my experience here. Unlike it's counterparts (Schwa, Bonsoiree, EL Ideas...) it's actually quite easy to make a reservation. Chef Chris Nugent personally suggested that if in the future we have any trouble with OpenTable, to call the restaurant and they'll be able to fit us in.  Now that's love.That's kind of the feeling you get from the restaurant.  Kinda like you're eating in a friend's very nicely decorated living room. Except that your friend is an amazing chef.  Each course was plated meticulously and seasoned perfectly. While I can appreciate when a chef is conscious about how to make a course flow to the next, my one complaint is that by end of the meal, my palette was a little tired of the repeating flavors.Sometimes with these types of meals, I find that dessert can be disappointing. Fortunately dessert was fantastic. I love cheese but for whatever reason I always feel cheese courses are a ripoff.  I loved the cheese course here. I also loved the chocolate/hazelnut/orange dessert.  It was wonderfully smooth and had this delightful layer of crispy on the bottom. I want to eat that over and over again.Will definitely be back with the next season!"
"The food is absolutely exceptional; the flavors, quality, originality, presentation. Every aspect of the food is exceptional. When confirming my reservation, they asked me if I had any special requests, as the dinner is prix fix. I had seen the menu online and noticed that there were a few seafood courses, which I'm not a big fan of. I almost told them that I didn't like seafood and boy am I glad I didn't! They were probably the best courses! Also, people here complain of not enough food; that was certainly NOT my experience. I was perfectly satisfied. The courses were also spaced perfectly; we were not waiting for hours in between courses. Yes, we were there a long time; it was eleven courses!     As much as I enjoy bringing my own wine; I'm not sure I agree with having that in a fine dining restaurant (1/4 of a star deducted). The waitress was perfectly nice and smiley but was very disengaged with us; not even some small talk (another 1/4 star off). The location of the restaurant is not very attractive at all (another 1/4 star off). This was my partner's birthday; they said that they always prepare something really nice for birthdays (yay, freebies!!); well, the big surprise consisted of a lit candle in the last course, whomp, whomp (another 1/4 star off).      I hate deducting that one star with food being so sensational, but when you pay $135 pp, you expect to be wowed in every way. This place just has a few minor issues that makes them fall short of a 5-star restaurant."
"FANTASTIC dining experience! We went here with friends from San Francisco and were proud to share Chicago's #1 new restaurant. It measured up to our expectations. The food was creative and delicious, and the service was impeccable. At first I was disappointed that it was BYOB, but it turned out to be a very fun project to find the perfect bottles of wine (we brought four and left with one). They list recommendations on their site.Getting reservations is a challenge, but worth the work. Nina and Chris are two of the nicest people I have ever met. Chris came to our table and talked for quite a while and was very welcoming. Nina actually ran across the street to hail us a cab at about 1:00 am. They truly want you to have a great experience and we all did!"
"Arguably one of the most unique meals I've had in the last few years. After seeing all these raving reviews and numerous people talking about this place on Chowhound, I decided that this place was next on our radar when we visited the Chicago area. Considering that we had wanted to come here in January and saw that it was booked completely a few weeks out, I didn't want to chance our most recent visit by waiting too long to make a reservation. Sure enough, things booked up quickly, but we were able to grab a 5:30pm reservation time for a Wednesday.Prior to dining, we had driven around the area just to see what it was like, as we aren't too familiar with the Lincoln Square neighborhood. We really admired the fact that in this hipster type of neighborhood, there stood goosefoot looking unassuming. With a simple black awning on the outside with bold white letters, we knew we were in for a treat.To say that what we experienced was a treat is a true understatement. Upon entrance, we were greeted by Nina Nugent, wife of Chef Chris. Sweet, cheery, and warm, she showed us to our seat immediately, and we were lucky enough to get a corner table near the wall sconces that you see in the main restaurant photo. The decor was neutral with a pop of marigold, and simple and modern. Since we were the second table to arrive, it was very quiet. By the end of our meal though, the place was filling up quickly, and it definitely got louder.Onto the meal, or should I say experience. :) There was only the 8-course for us, even though the website says that their 12-course is supposed to debut early this year, and then Nina informed us that there would be 3 additional surprises. Our jaws nearly dropped because 8 courses already seemed like a lot! lol The wait staff seamlessly flowed through and explained each dish that came to our table, and not only were each knowledgeable, they each had their unique style in explaining it. We love those little quirky idiosyncrasies about a dining experience, and goosefoot definitely delivered. Each dish that came was amazing. Not one was superior to another, and the pacing of each was perfect all the way up to the final 11th course and dessert.I am still thinking about our evening here. Like I said, this place is definitely an experience, and I can't believe how polished the food is, having only been open for 7 months. Chef Chris is really a true talent and perfectionist (as noted by his wife) and though we didn't get a chance to personally meet him, I can only see this place going further, pushing the envelope, and offering diners a wonderful, and inspirational evening. The wait staff were welcoming and knowledgeable. Great, unpretentious atmosphere and food.Oh, and did I mention all this for $90 and BYOB? Such a great deal, so hurry and make your reservation now! It definitely books out months in advance, so if you know you'll be in the area in the distant future, I'd give them a call now! :) You certainly won't regret it."
"We went here Friday night for my husbands birthday dinner. I made reservations at the end of January for mid- April and got one of the last available tables. Plan ahead. It's worth it. We had an 8:30 reso. I will say the only downfall of this place is the location. Totally in the sketch and having a nice car we were worried about it still being there when we got done but it was and the food made us forget all our worries. We were greeted by Chef Nugent's wife Nina, who showed us to our table. I know others have gone into detail about the courses so I won't but I will say that everything, from amuse to dessert, everything was flawless. Every dish was inspired, perfectly executed and amazing. Highlights for us were the scallop, sunchoke soup with baby shrimp, and the angus beef filet. Melted in your mouth. The food is more classic and less about innovation than Next, but just focuses on great flavors. The Chef came out and talked to our table for at least 10 minutes. He really wants to meet his patrons, get feedback, and you could tell he genuinely cares. It was honestly one of the highlights for us. He's a brilliant chef and I'm happy to support his latest venture. Go here. It's amazing and for the price it's even better. You can't find this quality byob tasting often."
"This review is way overdue!  I echo a lot of the previous yelpers comments on here about the great quality of the meal we ate at Goosefoot.  This meal has become the gold standard that we judge all meals by.  We have eaten at some pricier places yet Goosefoot still remains the meal to beat.I am a vegetarian and I was concerned that this would be an issue.  They said they would accommodate dietary restrictions.  When other places have said this, what it often translates to is that they just remove whatever the protein was for that dish and serve me a subpar course or put in a ridiculous, easy, quick substitute.  I feel that I have gotten far less quality courses at other restaurants because I don't eat meat.  This was so not the case at Goosefoot.  The chef took the time to actually give me completed courses, even if it meant giving me something completely different than what my meat eating counterparts were eating.  And everything was delicious.  I also had concerns about my meal being prepared on shared surfaces with meat at other places...things tasted, well, meaty.  And I was not well immediately after consuming the meals at some other establishments.  I was also served things that vegetarians cannot consume at other restaurants.  This did not happen to me here.  I felt completely relaxed and felt that the chef actually understood what vegetarians eat and don't eat.  Both my husband, who ate from the regular menu, and I felt that the courses were terrific.  Visually, they were astounding.  So pretty you felt bad eating them... and very creative.  Some of them, we wondered if the things would really go together, but they did harmoniously!  There was clearly a lot of thought and time put into the menu, but a complete lack of pretentiousness.  Just some wonderful food.I feel very torn about the whole time thing.  Yes, the meal did take a super long time.  But everything was so beautiful and tasty, I can understand why it takes so long.  You are there for an experience, not just to shove some grub down your throat and be out the door.  I enjoyed the experience and having a wonderful night with my husband. We soaked everything in and loved it and having that time there together.  Why rush that?   My issue was that we were sitting under an air conditioning vent and I was freezing my ass off.  I have to say, they did notice that I was uncomfortable and said they turned it down, very thoughtful, but by then I was too far gone....but really that was why I cared about the meal taking long.  So, my advice would be to bring a sweater, ladies, if you are wearing something sleeveless or prone to getting cold.  Our server and everyone there for that matter was so incredibly friendly and nice.  I just can't say enough good things about them.   You never know when you are paying a bit more for a meal what it is going to be like.  It could be a bit snooty.  Not the case here at all.  Just some really nice, friendly, helpful people who are really striving to give you the best dining experience they can. I loved Goosefoot and thought it was really something special.  It was a great way to celebrate our anniversary and we would definitely go back!"
"Cliff Notes: Food was great, a fantastic blend of taste and art. Only one course was a miss out of roughly eleven. Love the small owner story of Chris (chef) and wife Nina. Only knock, the place is too warm. Staff was quick to adjust the temp. Would go back in a second. goosefoot is great for the neighborhood!"
"It doesn't get much better than this - to say I love this place is an understatement. Delicious food, amazing service, great atmosphere, great price (considering the experience), and BYOB! I could go on and on about each dish and how much I loved it, but I will spare you. All you need to know is that this place worth every penny. For me it was all the things I loved about every other fine dining experience I have had but for a fraction of the price ($90/pp). The food is inventive but with purpose, and you get a little of everything! My husband and I were super bummed when we had to leave and couldn't believe that we were there for close to 4 hours!So if you are a foodie, get your butt there and thank me later."
An incredible meal and perfect service. Not a single false note. Chef Nugent and his lovely wife are sweethearts and they cherish what they do.
"I was so pumped to get in here before the hype.  Its up north so we drove...there is tons of free street parking on the random side streets or metered right on Lawrence.Walked in and the restaurant is very small...kind of like a bonsoiree style.  We were prompted greeted by someone who took our coats and escorted us to our other guests.So this place is small and BYOB...bonus for sure.  I have to say that the service was a little slow in the beginning and they did not keep up with the BYOB service.  Which is kind of a no-no to me.  Also, the amuse bouche came out as we were getting our first glass poured so again, not the biggest fan because I would have liked to have a couple of sips of the bubbly before we actually started, but the timing was a little off...it definitely got better as the courses went on.The meal...it was pretty good.  Nothing really WOWed me, however, all of it was solid.  There were a couple of dishes that I would have liked more direction on how to eat them...ie dip this in that, taste this with that, etc.  Somethings that stick out:lobster with scallop-I thought was really good and a great starter to the dinnerchestnut soup-creamy and rich, yet still light and savory and had a heartiness to it from the mushroomsbeef-everyone at the table seemed to get different temperatures...one was slightly overdone, one was slightly underdone, two were perfectdesserts-pumpkin mousse...FABULOUS!  I love me some good pumpkin and this dessert was great.  I also liked the chocolate at the end.  It had a great crunch on the outside and creamy in the middle.  At the end, Chris came out and talked to our table...which truly was a treat at the end of the meal.  You can really tell that he loves what he does and wants to hear what you think.  Although super shy and slightly awkward at the beginning, he warmed up to us after about a minute or two.  He was a real personable guy.  No ego here.  Plus, he had no problem praising other restaurants...instead of bashing them.Overall, I thought Goosefoot was a great experience and for $90 a pop...I spent less on the whole table here than one person at Alinea so I definitely think its worth the price.  Yes, its a smaller scaleYes, you have to BYOB it...however, on the website, they give you several affordable options to pair with the foodNo, you arent going to get a WOW factor, but definitely good and solidYes, you should check it out"
"I must have been good this year because Christmas just came early.  No, I didn't get a shiny new bike or a Red Rider BB Gun.  I got a Goosefoot.  What, pray tell, is a Goosefoot?  Aside from being a species of herbaceous flowering plants (thank you wikipedia), Goosefoot is a new gem of a restaurant in Lincoln Square and quite possibly my new favorite resto in the city.  Simply put, the food is phenomenal.  I've always been a fan of seasonally focused cooking, and Goosefoot executes that to a T.  As the servers described the list of ingredients in each course I found myself wondering just how all these elements and techniques would come together, but they do on every level.  While I could easily give a mini-rave on each course, I'll just hit you with the highlights:* The delicate sweetness of the hubbard squash agnolotti, richness of the butter poached lobster, and hint of curry spice made for an excellent first course* A soup course that featured the subtle sweetness and nuttiness of chestnuts perfectly married with earthy mushrooms and a truffle foam * A nicely seared sea bass atop a velvety smooth sunchoke puree and savory melted leeks, along with a small pool of fennel puree to add yet another layer of flavor to each bite* A flavorful, butter-knife tender beef fillet sauced with a savory jus, and sweet heirloom carrots prepared with various techniques* Two fantastic desserts, including an amazing chocolate course garnished with chocolate covered sea beans (sounds strange but totally works) and paired with a vanilla orange espumaBeing their first Friday of full service, there were a few minor delays between some courses, but the good company of my wife and a modern, yet comfortable and relaxed atmosphere barely made that noticeable.  We were served by various individuals during the night and each member of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I'm sure any timing issues will get smoothed out as time progresses, but pretty solid for only their sixth day in business.  For now, Goosefoot is offering an 8-course menu, but a 12-course menu is in the works.  They're also BYOB (no corkage fee!) and check out their website for some suggested pairings.  Parking, both street and their rear lot, is ample.By the close of our meal we had a chance to chat with Chef Nugent and his wife, Nina.  They're simply two of the nicest, warmest people one could meet.  I admire and applaud their effort to bring a fine dining restaurant to this quiet stretch of Lawrence Ave.  I've been lucky to dine at some very nice restaurants and the quality of food and service at Goosefoot would easily merit Michelin star or James Beard recognition if given the chance.  I wish Goosefoot nothing but continued success so they can receive the recognition they deserve.  Welcome to the neighborhood Goosefoot and merry Christmas to me!"
"I recently went to this restaurant calling ahead to make sure they could accommodate my allergies.  They said no problem.  Also they said they would make a special vegetarian meal did my sister.  Well they failed on both parts, I got sick and my sister got a meal that was all one note.  Beautiful food yet not a safe place for people with food allergies or vegetarians.  Very disappointing for such an expensive meal.  Also they noticed I stopped eating half way through the meal and asked me no questions about it.  If I was at Denny's they would have asked.  Get your stuff together"
"I don't know if I can add anymore to the other 5 star reviews here.  We experienced Goosefoot cuisine on 11/16/13.  It was a long meal, not much longer than our experiences at Moto, Tru, ING,.... We know this isn't an 'eat and go' type of restaurant...this is the entertainment we plan around.  In attendance was my wife, a close friend of mine from high school and college, his wife, and me.  We had one vegetarian, and two 'no-red meat' meals, and the last was standard.  Of the 44 total courses served, only one was underwhelming....that was my duck course, and that is ONLY because of my aversion to duck (from a duck hunt gone afoul (you could say 'a-fowl', LOL).One bottle of pinot noir, two pints of Dogfish handcrafted beers, and a fun evening of Goosefoot dining was had by our party.  It was incredible to get face time with Chef Chris Nugent and his wife Nina....I truly wish the best for them and their restaurant.  They deserve the glory and rewards of their successes, it couldn't happen to nicer and genuine people!"
"My goodness, my delicious. It's worth it. Make a reservation. This is a dining experience I will remember forever. Tiny restaurant so definitely make a reservation. The whole experience takes a little over 2 hours. So don't be in a rush... this is an EXPERIENCE.Very relaxed atmosphere. Pretty decor, but friendly and nice people -not too fancy schmancy. The staff works as a team which I love. You don't have one specific server. All the servers come around and bring your dishes, while explaining them thoroughly and they are very knowledgeable. Your dishes are cleared immediately and you are given new silverware with each course. Also if you get up to go to the rest room they fold your napkin for you. The food is all just perfectly cooked and delicious. There weren't any weird flavors or anything I didn't like. The portions are just right. If you don't like the flavor of truffle - let them know. They use it in a lot - luckily, I love truffle. They also ask if you have any food allergies or food preferences to suit your tastes.By being BYOB it cuts the price down significantly. $90.00 for 9 main courses, plus 3 extras from the chef. Note: They DO charge extra for water and coffee or espresso. I can't say enough good things about this place. I will definitely go back for another dining extravaganza!!!"
"I agree with a lot of the other reviews below that the time between courses was waaayyyy too long and the overall length of the dinner (4 hours) made the experience not as enjoyable as it could have been.  There was just so much waiting involved.  It was so long that we almost debated leaving before the last desert course, it being a school night and all.In terms of the food, it was very good - my only complaint is that some of it was a little one note:  Many of of the courses were very creamy and salty, and were consistently a beige color.  It would have been great to get a salad or some more vegetables to brighten the meal up.If going to a fancy restuarant like this a special, rare treat (as it was for us), I might recommend going somewhere where the pace of the meal is better."
"My little 30th birthday week culinary tour finished with Goosefoot.  What a wonderful last gift (especially following Tru from a few days prior - my boyfriend and I hated that place)!Delicious/well-presented food, wonderful service, no-corkage BYO, relaxed atmosphere? I think I'm in heaven.  We plan to go back every time the menu changes.Thank you Chris and Nina!"
"An update--it's been a year since I had dined at Goosefoot and I had another chance to eat here so I took it and wanted to see if it was any different.  I thought the food was amazing--even better than I remember it last year.  But, the meal is still far too long for me.  We had a 4 top and our dinner was over 4 hours.  It's just too long for me to sit for 11 courses.  I did dine with 3 other people and it's nice to converse, share wine, etc, but I saw no difference in the amount of time it took to finish the meal.  It's a wonderful restaurant, but after going twice and the meal taking so long, not sure I'll go back. Sorry but just being honest."
"Chef of the year: Chris Nugent.Enough said. Seriously, I came into goosefoot with mild expectation that it's going to be a great meal. I mean, they just got their first Michelin Star recently and barely passed their 1 year anniversary. However, they blew away my expectation. The food here is absolutely delicious, authentic and, at times, mind blowing. The following is what I had1) Golden Beet/ Goat Cheese/ Parmigiano Reggiano2) Lobster/ Scallop/ Licorice Root/ Curry3) Shrimp/ Preserved garlic/ Rosemary/ Parmigiano Reggiano4) Chestnut soup/Alba Mushroom/Potato/Truffle Foam5) Loup De Mer/ Leek/ Yuzu6) Duck Braest/ Spiced Beluga Lentils/ Ginger/ Compressed apple7) Angus Beef/ Heirloom carrots/ Goosefoot/ Cumin/ Shallot jus8) Crispy Goats Milk Cheese/ Lemon Balm/ Red Pepper/ Balsamic Vinaigrette9) Pomegranate & Olive Shooter10) Pear/ Armagnac/ Cassia/ Pine11) Chocolate/ Passion Fruit/ Coconut/ Ice WineThey take every dish to the finest detail, from plating to flavor. The ingredient they use aren't exactly the most exotic, however, the flavor is all there. I'd have to say this is probably one of the best menu I've had since I've been to Chicago and I'm looking forward to come back when I can. Oh yea, Chris and Nina are some of the nicest chef I've met. The warmth and the food really makes it a great experience!"
"My fiance and I went there last night for my birthday. It was wonderful. Great service and excellent food. Expensive, so save for a special occasion. I will definitely be back for future special celebrations. The Chef and his wife are very kind and I wish them the best!"
"Great meal along the lines of Schwa, EL, etc...!  9 courses with an Amuse (think they're working on a 12 course) with BYOB drinks.The food was very well paced; very friendly staff, totally unpretentious.  Chef Nugent came out and chatted with us, was very nice, humble and friendly.  Ambiance was a bit bland.will be back."
"Goosefoot is a very special place - Nina and Chef Chris put great care into their restaurant from the decor to the food - we felt like we were a guest at their table. We enjoyed an amazing 12 course dinner - everything was fresh and delicious. Each plate came with a beautiful arrangement of the most delicate flowers, microgreens (grown in their home garden),  and flavored gelees.  It was too pretty to eat - but we did! We loved the symmetry and design of each plate.  Every flavor was harmonized and balanced. Our favorites were the parmesan and lobster in an egg shell, the delicate chestnut soup, the duck and angus beef were mouthwatering.  The service was excellent. The staff was so chic but not stuffy. We kept wondering how did they pull this off?   Chef Chris was a delight to meet and doled out much praise to his kitchen staff and his lovely wife who also gave us a warm greeting. We learned that Goosefoot came to life by the dreams of two people - no corporate backing, no partners. It is incredible that anyone could accomplish so much and  do it to perfection. This is a wonderful, personalized dining experience, not to be missed."
"I was so fortunate to go to Goosefoot on my birthday this year on August 9th, so this review is long overdue.  I'd been trying desperately to get a reservation, and Nina called me that morning to tell me there had been a cancellation at 9pm!Nina and Chris do an incredible job at making everyone who walks in the door feel like they are playing a part in their dream.  The restaurant has the sophistication of many other top restaurants, but a with a touch of familiarity- from the chef's wife taking the reservations to their explanation that they hired waitstaff who are new to the business and trained them to be top notch servers in-house. Chef Chris walks around at the end of each seating to talk to guests about the food, and kindly stayed by our table for more than a couple minutes answering our questions about his food.The food was delicious, and it really felt like a great deal for the price.  Each plate was extremely well executed.  I'm a pescetarian, and they happily made substitutions in the meal for me.  At the end of the dinner, Chris and Nina brought me out a signed menu wishing me a happy birthday!  What a wonderful evening. Congrats to Chris, Nina, and their team on their well-deserved Michelin star!  Everyone else....go to Goosefoot!"
Excellent service and presentation. I was very pleased with the offerings. Be prepared to spend a few hours and don't forget to BYOB. Quaint neighborhood. I didn't expect to find it next to a grocery store and drove by once before we found it. I plan to return soon.
"What a cool place!Goosefoot was such a unique experience.  The space and service were impeccable and the food can only be described as utopian.Upon arrival, we were greeted by name and promptly seated.  Then the fun really began.  Goosefoot only offers a tasting menu and is BYO.  There is no ordering a la carte and they don't have a winelist.  This was fine with us because we brought a couple bottles to enjoy.  The evening began with a couple delicacies 'from the chef,' and then they began to bring out their exceptional dishes.  The 9-course tasting menu appeared carefully choreographed with each dish having its own unique flavor profile.  The food was plentiful even though the dish sizes ranged from a spoonful to plateful.  Everything they served tasted wonderful and we left completely sated.  It could have been the 2 bottles of wine we drank, but this was one of the best dinners that I have had in a long, long time."
"Goosefoot was a delight. Stopped in on a Sunday night with some people from work who know Chris personally. Initially, we had it scheduled for a week beforehand.... The host told us we were mistaken when we called to confirm, but an email confirmation revealed their error later on. However, overlooking this customer service error, we were excited to go.I LOVE that Goosefoot's menu and wine suggestions (so helpful!) are right on the website. It made my trip to Binny's very easy. The atmosphere was beautiful when we arrived. The staff was friendly, formal and well-attired. Chris popped out once toward the beginning of the meal to say hi and again later on - what a focused chef! He is very dedicated to the restaurant and the industry.The food was delicious. I'll admit that some of it was beyond me -- lots of flavors and many ingredients I'd never tried or worked with before! - but I really did have a lovely time. I felt very treated, and it was fun to be educated on new cuisine.Overall, I'll be back - but not until the spring menu begins!"
"Absolutely amazing.  Goosefoot is the epitome of 5 stars.  Although it took three months to get reservations, celebrating my birthday here was the best gift I could have asked for.We started with a warm greeting from Nina Nugent, the chef's wife.  Then plate after plate of delicious food appeared.  Nina explained that Chris works alone, he has no sous-chef and no pastry chef - he literally does it all!  That made me extra appreciative of how brilliant the food was.  We went mid-September when the menu was halfway through switching to seasonal fall ingredients.  Of the eight courses (plus amuse bouche and intermezzo) here were my favorites in order of yumminess: -seared duck breast with beluga lentils, ginger and pickled compressed apple- literally the  most amazing duck I've ever had, even our friend who doesn't typically like duck enjoyed it.  -angus beef with cauliflower, trumpet royale and shallot jus - mushrooms (and edible flowers!) were a theme of the night, they made an appearance on most dishes.  The beef was unbelievably tender and, though more rare than I typically enjoy, I savored every bite.  This was one happy cow.  Delicious!-hazelnut, chocolate and caramel corn with coconut cream - yes, I'm putting a dessert as my second favorite of the night!  Picture a mini Dove ice cream bar, except filled with hazelnut mousse and accompanied by flavor-packed, yet light, coconut whipped cream.  Umm, yeah.  I literally dreamt about this dessert last night.  (this was even more impressive when we learned that Chef Nugent makes the desserts himself, no pastry chef!  My hours of watching Top Chef taught me that chefs view desserts as an automatic ticket home)-crispy goat cheese, lemon balm, red pepper and balsamic - gooey goat cheese wrapped in phyllo and served with balsamic?  Yes please!  This was delicious, I ate my portion and half of my friend's.-corn soup with potato, shrimp and truffle essence - I did not expect to like this, but it was amazing.  It was hearty without being too creamy, it actually tasted like a corn puree with diced potatoes, corn kernels and topped with truffle foam.  This hit the spot on a cool, windy evening.-intermezzo ""shot"" with pomegranate and yuzu - yeah, we wanted seconds.Some things like the scallops, artic-char and Cinderella pumpkin dessert were just not as mind-blowing as the above, but only because there was such stiff competition.  Had these been in a ""normal"" restaurant, they would have been very good.  As I said halfway through, it's going to be very hard eating normal food from now on...Generally, I tend to find molecular gastronomy gimmicky, but everything on the plate had a purpose.  The dehydrated powders (ie truffle or olive oil to name a couple) were packed with flavor once you ""brought them back"" in surrounding sauce.  Basically every component in every dish worked.  The servers explained how to mix ingredients together to enjoy it, this was fine dining without the pretension.  Presentation was beautiful, and the marriage of flavors was flawless.  It's funny, we got jealous of other tables when we saw which courses they were on.  Could we just hit rewind and try them all over again??This was my first multi-course meal and I was expecting to be uncomfortably full after tales of places like Arun's.  Surprisingly, I was more than satisfied, but not stuffed.  It was the perfect amount of food and well timed.The fact that it's BYOB is just icing on the cake.  At $90 for an 8 course menu, it really is the greatest deal in Chicago dining.  Thank you Goosefoot for choosing your home so close to mine.  I'll see you in 3 months for the winter menu!"
"We went here for my husband's birthday and Goosefoot absolutely exceeded our expectations. It was a bit challenging to get a reservation, but at the end of the day it was well worth the effort. Unlike some multi-course restaurants with fixed tasting menus, they were willing to accommodate food allergies and preferences (my husband doesn't eat nuts) without giving you a ""throw-away replacement"" for the standard course. The restaurant is rather expensive, but considering it's BYOB I think it evens out to a good value for the food and dining experience. The service was great and my husband even got a hand written note from the owners wishing him a happy birthday and thanking us for coming.  I will absolutely be going back and recommending it to friends."
"Definitely one of the best meals of my life. You will not find a better dining experience at this price. The food was incredible. Everything was cooked and presented perfectly, and I was blown away by the flavors. I am still dreaming about that egg!Chef Chris came out at the end of the meal and talked to us, as did his wife Nina. They told us about the restaurant but they wanted to know about us, too. They are  such humble, gracious, delightful people . They are so passionate about food and really love to make people happy, and it shows through in every detail at Goosefoot.They are opening a chocolate shop soon, and based on the chocolate dessert, I will be lining up to get my hands on some!One thing they apologized for was the long wait between courses. It's because their kitchen is so small. Be prepared and do not come starving. There is plenty of food but it takes a while to get to you. A small price to pay for an amazing meal."
"We made reservations at Goosefoot for our wedding anniversary celebrations. We received a reminder call from the restaurant and they were mindful of our dietary restrictions and reconfirmed what we had mentioned during our reservations. We brought along our wine and were promptly seated by courteous and friendly Nina Nugent. The wait staff were attentive as they served our wine and water (you can order still, tap or sparkling). The location, as several have mentioned, is not out of the ordinary. They had a power  outage earlier that evening due to weather but by the time we were seated the kitchen appeared to have caught up with any delays that may have caused as we didn't experience any glitches.We started with a palette cleanser (wasn't on the menu). It was a refreshing spoon of beet and goat cheese in olive oil. It was followed by amazing lobster and scallop in curry sauce (DELISH)! Then came the potato sun choke soup - we both thought that the quantity of the soup could be smaller considering the other portions that were yet to follow. The arctic char was very well prepared - buttery and perfectly seasoned. The next course was the duck breast with beluga lentils - this was a very balanced and perhaps one of the tastiest course for both of us. Instead of the beef we had opted for the seared tuna - very satisfied!The cheese course came next. A warm phyllo filled with goat cheese with aged balsamic and lemon balm reduction. Great way to set the stage for the two desserts to follow. They first gave us a palette cleanser - a pomegranate lemon oil and beet concoction. The first of the two desserts was a passion fruit vanilla creme on a crisp.. light and perfectly balanced. The second desert was a chocolate sea bean with orange mousse. They were thoughtful of putting a happy anniversary greeting in caramel. We ordered some espresso with hot milk (which they were kind enough to bring for us) and ended the meal with a gooseberry dipped in chocolate served on a small wooden block - great way to end the dinner. Chef Chris Nugent stopped by and greeted us and signed our menu (which by the way is printed on planting seed paper). He was very down to earth and warm. He was very appreciative of his patrons and his staff in the kitchen and wait staff. Genuinely a nice guy which makes the dining experience so much better.Overall, we couldn't have asked for more. Loved it and would visit again for sure!"
"This place is spectacular. The food is superb. The ambiance is like being in a friend's living room/dining room, like at Alinea. Came here for the first time and when I first sat down, I didn't know what to expect. The place seats about 32, and it's just one room. I sat with my party of 4 with an open mind. Once the food came out, the place blew me away!!The presentation is nice, and the food is spot-on. Sunchoke soup and the shrimp custard dishes were my favorites, but all the plates are excellent - any favorite is simply based on personal preference. This place totally beat my expectations. BYOB is amazing as well. We were there for 3.5 hours, so just go with a leisurely mindset :)"
"This is the best bang for the buck anywhere on the planet. The food is by far the best food you will get in the country right now.   For $90 per person and BYOB, you are going to have a great meal.  Go out and get yourself some decent bottles of wine, the recommendations are right there on the website.  The menu comes on paper that you can plant that will grow wild flowers. How cool is that?!?!  We had 8 courses and each one was delicious.  The menu changes regularly so your dining experience will hopefully be just as good.  Our coursesScallop over lobster and curry with licorice rootSunchoke soup with potato and shrimp and truffle essenceArctic char with morels and peasDuck breast with beluga lentilsSteak (mmmm) with heirloom carrots and shallot jus (FAVORITE COURSE)Fried goat cheese courseChocolate dessert....perfect endingBest food I've eaten so far in 2012 and maybe to date.  Highly recommend getting a reservation.  The staff was so nice from the instant you walked in until they hailed a cab for you after dinner.  We had brought a little too much wine, but we shared with the table next to us as well as the staff."
"Delicious food and very courteous service, and BYOB can't be beat. The accolades and Michelin star are well deserved, and it is worth your time to secure a reservation at this Lincoln Square hotspot. The only negative I can think of, is that the chairs were a bit uncomfortable for a four-hour meal. A seat cushion would be a welcome improvement to the hard wooden chairs. Other than that, Bon Appétit!"
Service was top notch. A few times we asked questions on how to eat a dish and they always provided helpful and non-judgemental answers. The bathroom had cloth hand towels (a nice touch). The chestnut soup was awesome. And the BYO option was great - we started with a bottle of white and moved to red mid-meal. The pumpkin dessert was awesome. Yum! The restaurant venue itself lacked a certain panache; it felt like they took floor plan and simply added some tables.
"Chris and Nina Nugent's treasure Goosefoot has quickly catapulted into one of Chicago's favorite fine dining options.  The restaurant got a Michelin star less than an year in operation.  Chef Nugent is Chicago Tribune's chef of the year and Jean Banchet's rising chef of the year .  The restaurant is intimate and endearing.  The atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming. The restaurant is BYO; a bonus if you want to enjoy fine dining without the restaurant markup on wine.  However, I do admittedly enjoy restaurant wine pairings as it is often an opportunity to experience wines I've never heard of before.This, in February was our second trip to Goosefoot.  Our first one was in August last year.  An emerging trend with Chi Town fine dining has been the surge in prices.  We paid $90/pp in August and the cost is now $115/p.p.; an increase of roughly $60 for a party of two once you include tax and tip.  This used to be a 8 course menu; it's now 9 courses plus an amuse bouche, a palate cleanser, and a one bite final berry course served on a wood stump.  Goosefoot is tough to get into.  They accept reservations via Open Table except you can never find availability.  It took multiple phone calls and e-mails over a 2 month period to secure our latest reservation.  We walked in nearly an hour early for our reservation and were immediately welcomed into our seats.  We brought bottles of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, a reserve Malbec from Mendoza Valley Argentina, and a Washington State Cabernet.  I realized a bottle of Sancerre to accompany the last three courses would have been ideal. Nina Nugent is the hostess.  She remembered this was a return trip for me and my husband and welcomed our dining companions who had not been there before.  An ultra cool feature at Goosefoot is their menu is printed on planting seed paper.  I had excitedly planted the menu after our August visit.  This go around, I had a picture of our sprouting but not yet flowering plant to share with Nina.The menu hadn't changed a lot since we were last here.  I was surprised at that.  What did change was a welcome addition.  The new dish on the menu was a blend of interesting creamy flavors with pureed shrimp, garlic, and rosemary presented in an egg shell.  We were all scraping the egg shell to get every last drop out.  The chestnut soup with mushrooms and potato is exquisite, gorgeously comforting, and the standout dish in the menu.  The duck and the beef were beautifully cooked.  I especially enjoyed the very colorful side of carrots, goosefoot, cumin, and shallot jus that accompanied the beef.  The crispy goats milk cheese is a nice break in the menu.We left about 3 hours later - satisfied but not stuffed.We did not see Chef Nugent either of the times we were at Goosefoot.  Shucks."
"I had one of the best dinners of my life at Goosefoot. No gimmicks or hype (hmm, what could I be referring to?)-- just awesome food. We spent some time talking to the chef and his wife and they are very nice people who are excited about cooking and running a restaurant. Their skill and enthusiasm are reflected in the high quality. Bonus points for having Bulls center Omer Asik in the house with the fly bottle of Veuve.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONOn another note, one of the reviews below suggests that Goosefoot is in an unsavory neighborhood. Goosefoot is in Lincoln Square. C'mon, white girls. You're better than that."
"Flawless ecstasy!  From the delectable cuisine to the hospitable service, Goosefoot was a paramount dining experience. Thoughtful, tasty, and artistic, the food was divine!  I cannot wait to book my next reservation. Bravo to this wonderful, neighborhood gem.  Go, enjoy, revel, experience!"
"What a fabulous dining experience! Each course was a unique, decadent work of art (I wish I took pictures but I was trying to play it ""cool""). The service was immaculate - not only were they swift and precise, but also made us feel so welcome (not even the slightest hint of pretentiousness). Another bonus: you can bring your own wine. In fact, you have to - they don't have any on premises. Overall, one of the best tasting menus I've ever had."
Extremely long dinner! Food was good especially the appetizers and atmosphere amazing. But 30 min interval between the courses is just unacceptable.
"Okay everybody simmer down now....I'm going to try and remain calm. I guess I should start out by saying I sat down at my table with expectations so freakishly high that there was no way I wouldn't be disappointed, impossible. Then the courses started...an amuse- a silver spoon adorned with a wedge of golden beet and flower petal. If you can make a single bite of beet that extraordinary- you've got my attention, I will follow you where ever you take me on this food journey...I am in your hands.Each course dazzled and amazed. Can they not repeat a course?!?!?! I need to have that taste again!!!!! I was torn whether or not to lick the plate...for every course. Even the final gooseberry dipped in dark chocolate and nuts- why yes I'll need a dozen to go?!?!Three of us had earlier in the year dined at Alinea....we came to the conclusion that Chef Nugent's food is simply on par with that of Chef Achatz. They may need to go on Iron Chef and battle it out. The major difference is the price tag- the total tab for four of us was still a hundred dollars less then for just one person at Alinea. It is also BYOB, they recommend on their web site what to pair with your dinner. Goosefoot was so extraordinary I will make it a point to experience each of their seasonal menus. I might even have to repeat ones I have already tried. We talked with the Chef and his wife. HE is the one personally in the kitchen preparing your food, not a sous chef. He is humble and outrageously talented. Service is delightful, the ladies are super sweet and charming."
"EVERYTHING at goosefoot is done artfully...from the warm, friendly greeting to the flawlessly executed menu. Chris and Nina Nugent's dream transports you to a wonderful place to enjoy an unforgettable experience"
"Simply put, one of the best dining experiences you will ever have for the price!Forget the pain in the you know what to get tickets for NEXT and spend $365 pp, forget restaurants that won't answer their phone to get a reservation, and come to Goosefoot for a 8 course tasting menu for $90 pp with BYOB!  Hands down the best value for upscale dinning.  Top chef quality food, professional and attentive staff, artistic and creative dishes, Goosefoot delivers an exceptional fine dining experience from start to finish.  I enjoyed every dish but the sunchoke soup with a truffle essence, angus beef with heirloom carrots, and desserts were incredible!  My only word of caution is that if you do not enjoy truffle, then tell the staff and they will do their best to accommodate.  Truffle is used in a lot of dishes.  Goosefoot gets six stars."
"I don't really want to ruin it for people by explaining how things went.  I live fairly close, and noticed this place when driving sometime last year, taking down a mental note to check it out.  Finally made it over, and this place is doing elegant, delicious, incredibly balanced food that would make anyone smile after eating it.  Also, the way it is priced, at $90 for what turned out to be 10 or 11 courses is stealing money, and the BYOB helps as well.  In a tasting menu of more that 5 or 6 courses, I usually expect there to be at least 1 item that I don't care for, simply from the diversity of ingredients, flavors etc.  Not with Goosefoot.  Not a single miss on the whole menu, and rest of the table felt the same was as I did. Read some of the other reviews, the neighborhood is fine, Lincoln Square is harmless. I enjoyed this as much as a trip to the two star Michelin restaurant Providence, in LA.  In fact, our table didn't want to admit as much, but when we compared our much hyped trip to the French Laundry in Napa, everyone preferred Goosefoot to the FL.  I might be gushing a little too much, so I am going to stop.  I don't want to spoil it by going to often, but am very excited to go back sometime soon."
"We met another couple on an off  night during the week.  The food and service were quite good and the price great for the level of craftsmanship.  The chestnut soup and the savory custard in the egg shell were both excellent.  However, the wait between courses was too long and I don't know that I would go back."
"I came here in early spring and had the 8-course menu (the web site mentioned a switch to 12 courses at some point; I'm not sure if that ever happened).  I made reservations with my wife and another couple and we had a great time!  Food was wonderful with some bonus mini-courses thrown in and we took full advantage of the BYOB pairings suggested on the web site.  Service was excellent and the chef came to visit us at the end of the meal.We rarely/never spend that much on dinner, but for $90 each it was a world-class meal we were very happy about."
"Came here for my birthday dinner and was mostly let down.For starters their air conditioning wasn't working. This didn't help when the closest CTA stop is a good five minute walk away. In the summer heat it wasn't nice to walk into a hot restaurant.The servers are all very personable and knowledgeable about the dishes. They did apologize about the a/c being out, but not until much later in our meal.The dishes themselves were all very good, however I was surprised at 1) how small they were and 2) that it took quite a long time between dishes. My wife and I finished our bottle of wine before the 4th course had even arrived.Based on the length of time it will take many to trek out here and the slowness of service, I wouldn't recommend this place to the many other fine dining options with wallet friendly prices in this city."
"I like to consider myself knowledgeable when it comes to dining in Chicago, and this spot has earned the top spot in my book. A comfortable and unpretentious environment makes the food the focus. Every single bit was incredible - which I've never said about a meal. The staff is warm, charming, cheerful, knowledgeable and unobtrusive. While they can answer any question you think of, they don't overwhelm you with information. It's also BYOB which helps with price, but I would love to see what they would recommend. I can't express how much I loved this spot. Reservations are hard to come by, but it's worth the wait!"
"My new favorite fine dining.  Boinsoree, Schwa, Moto have nothing on Goosefoot.Star #1: BYOB. Pretty self explanatoryStar #2: Beautiful and warm decorStar #3: Welcoming and knowledgeable staffStar #4: Thoughtful and exciting cuisine: Angus beef/heirloom carrots/goosefoot/cumin/shallot jus.(Side note: There was a mix up with the tables and the staff accidentally brought the beef course to our table, but we had already had the beef course. For a nanosecond I seriously considered taking the beef course for a second time. Yes, I was going I commit restaurant larceny)Star #5: Chestnut soup: chestnut soup/smoke/white alba mushrooms/truffle essenceStar #6: Did I mention  BYOB?To summarize, I predict Chef Nugent will be receiving loads of accolades, even to rival his days at Les Nomades."
"Who are these people?  They look sort of normal, but apparently don't flinch at $140/head for weird food at a BYOB.  But how do you get a reservation?  We had to e-mail and it took literally months because the ""Open Table"" and telephone didn't work at all.  We expected the crowd to be a little more chique and well behaved.  The place is loud considering it seats 32.  3.5 hours for a 9 course meal of consistently tiny little fancy plates with flowers on the side?  I think it's the drinking that makes it work, but it didn't do it for us.  OK, the all female server team in black and eyeliner is excellent, as is the food.  The deal killer is 25 minutes (I timed it) between some courses.  Are you serious?  This is for the birds...as in the portion size and the goose theme."
"This was probably the best meal of my life. I'm also not too well versed in fancy dining (see other yelp reviews), but I still like to think my palate is refined. It is minorly annoying that you can only get a reservation online- but if you call ahead of time, they can put you on a waiting list for a specific day and if something opens up, they will call you (which is how I got my reservation). Even though I thought it was far-fetched to get a valentines day reservation, I put my name on the waiting list, and to my surprise they called me two days before to let me know there was an opening! My boyfriend (who's birthday happens to be Valentines Day) and I were super excited. They recommended bringing a sparkling white wine and a good pinot noir as the complementary wines- let me reiterate how much I LOVE BYOB anything btw. The meal was about 2.5 hours long, which was great because it gave us time to digest everything and feel full, but not overly stuffed by the end. Nina Nugent (Chef Nugent's wife) was a wonderful hostess and really made us feel welcome and comfortable. She had Chef Nugent sign a menu for my boyfriend's birthday and there was a candle in the last dessert. Would love to return at some point in the future. The price was obviously a little higher, but not outlandish for the amazing food and service we received. Also- I have learned that if you ""like"" Goosefoot on Facebook, they announce when they have openings for same night tables. So if you're having trouble getting a reservation, it may be worth it to follow them on the book."
"I'm  happy to have a fine dining restaurant in the neighborhood.   We were unable to reach the restaurant by phone, so made our reservation through Open Table which only gave reservation times available as 5:30 and 9:30.  There were lots of empty tables on the Wednesday night we were there, so I might suggest, if you want to eat here, and you don't want to eat so early or so late,  don't worry about a reservation time,  just go. ( At least on weeknights. )Food was good, BYOB is fantastic.  Your bill will still  skyrocket, though.  Bottled water is $6 per bottle, espresso is $5, coffee is $5, our bill  was $222 for two before tip.The best part was the desserts.  The coffee was good, I so wanted a refill, but they bring the bill and you're done.Lots of fun if you've never been to a place like this, or even if you have."
"Probably the best meal you can possibly have for the price. The service, food and experience are on par, if not better than, any of the other fine dining restaurants in Chicago (Next, Les Nomades, L20, Trotters etc.) but at $90 per person you cannot possibly get more for your money.Add to the fact that Chef Nugent is not only actually in the kitchen making your food but comes out afterwards to talk to you. It elevates a great meal into a wonderful experience. You can really tell how much passion he, his wife and staff have for the business.The only downside is that it is pretty much booked solid for the next few months. Get on the wait list and you'll probably get in sooner rather than latter."
"Let me just start off by saying that if Goosefoot only receives one Michelin Star next year it will have gotten completely robbed!  I went into this meal expecting it to be very good, but I came out of it being absolutely blown away.  I've lived in Chicago for nearly 8 years, and not only is this the best meal I can ever recall having during that time, it's one of the best meals I can ever recall having period!  Each of the eight courses my wife and I were served were perfectly executed in flavor and technique.  In addition, they were also each aesthetically gorgeous... Like little works of art on white porcelain.  Everything was so well balanced and perfectly cooked... It was quickly evident that there were some real jedi masters at work in the kitchen.  The thoughtfulness put into the order in which the courses were served also really added to the experience and took us through a complete and well planned culinary journey. One of the other great things about this meal was that not only was everything we ate absolutely fantastic, it was also very approachable.  Although the food was highly refined, nothing came off as being hoity-toity or self indulgent... It was all about great flavors and creative combinations.  Additionally, all of the staff really matched this vibe, as did the interior of the space itself.  The restaurant is small and elegant, without coming off in any way as stuffy or pretentious.  Like the food, the space felt warm and modern, without trying to hard or being in your face about it.  And the staff were also all extremely warm, engaging, and helpful... A+ service all around!Chef Nugent came out of the kitchen and into the restaurant more than once during our meal to make sure he got to say a quick hello and thank you to each of his diners before they departed (when it was really us who needed to be thanking him!).  My wife and I had a very nice 5-minute or so conversation with him.  I have to say, not only is Chef Nugent obviously extremely talented (first at Les Nomandes and now here at his own restaurant), he is also extremely humble and sincere.  Every time we told him how unbelievable everything had been, he without hesitation credited the rest of his staff... From those in the kitchen creating the dishes with him, to the waiters/food runners delivering them.  He just seemed like such a nice guy with absolutely zero ego despite his obvious talent.  In Yiddish he'd definitely be know as a real mensch (Google it if you don't know the meaning... It's a good word to use when warranted).So yes, the location is a little off the beaten path, but don't let that deter you in the slightest from going!  In some ways I came away from the meal feeling that the location actually added to the experience... It was like a cool speakeasy that people would had to be ""in the know"" about in order to go, rather than some place plopped in the middle of Lincoln Park which could probably do 75% of its business based on the location alone.  Goosefoot has to work for it, and work for it they do!  Also, I think what Chef Nugent and his wife are saving on rent likely gets translated in to lower prices for their customers.  At $90 for eight exquisite and well sized courses, the meal felt like a bargain by the time we were only halfway through.  Add to this that the restaurant is completely BYO and street parking is plentiful out front, and you really can't ask for a better deal for such an out of this world dining experience.In summation, do yourself a favor and book a reservation while you're still lucky enough to be able to get one... You'll be very glad you did!  I've never been so happy to write a glowing review on Yelp, but they really earned it.  Congratulations to Chef Nugent, his lovely wife, and the rest of the staff at Goosefoot!  It was a privilege being able to dine with you all during your first two weeks in business, and I wish you all the success in the world over the years to come.  My wife and I are already looking forward to coming back several times a year... See you soon!"
"WOW - that's the only way you can begin a review for Goosefoot. I don't even know where to begin. Great service. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Its BYOB and they were helpful with the wine too. But the food. The food!! I'm having dreams of the chestnut soup with a Parmesan stuffed gougeres. I only eat fish and they were fantastic about that too. I got almost the same meal as my boyfriend did, but with some slight sauce changes. I cannot wait to get back here to see the seasonal menu changes."
"My visit to Goosefoot started off on a less-than-auspicious note.Dad and I began the morning with a plate of cheese fries and assorted breakfast foods. We took in a museum, then spent way too long searching for parking. To calm our frustrations, we sipped whiskeys and watched football in a dark bar. It was only when we were on our way to the restaurant that I remembered Goosefoot is BYOB. The cab driver obligingly pulled over at a corner bodega: Dad popped out, grabbed a bottle of Kendall Jackson, and we were on our way again.Needless to say, we were sort of rumpled when we showed up. But I didn't feel at all like I was defiling a shrine to gastronomy -- I felt welcomed and comfy and at peace.Goosefoot is a lovely little jewel of a restaurant, and the food was so brightly exquisite that I giggled out loud more than a few times. The servers were relaxed and friendly and didn't take overly long to describe the plate (I hate when they do that -- just let me eat already). The chef came over, the sweet wife of the chef came over...everything was warm and delicious and even though our meal took three hours, it was as restful as a spa.Basically, I want to write a love song for this place. But I can't sing, so no one else would want that.You should go. PS - Dad and I noticed that all the guests (including us) were wearing shades of blue, beige, brown...a neutral, earthy palette that went with the general theme of the place. How did we all know to do that?PPS - Don't try to eat the birch bark stumps."
"I was thrilled that I finally got a reservation after 7 months of checking Open Table almost daily. (Tip: book the week of...there might be a cancellation). The place is not in the most glamorous part of town, but charming nonetheless. I had never been to a restaurant where the food was presented so artfully (and it tasted of perfection, too). The service was impeccable--friendly, knowledgeable and definitely not stuffy. My only complaint is that the dining room is a bit loud and busy. Not exactly a dim lit and romantic atmosphere I would expect for $115 a person. Still, I highly recommend. I'd say the best part of the entire experience was meeting Chef Nugent and his wife Nina. Their sincerity, graciousness and friendliness take this restaurant above and beyond other fine dining experiences."
"This review is extremely overdue. We dined here on Thursday, December 22nd and it was perfect.You know how you hear people say ""It was like I was a guest in their home"" when they are talking about a nice, intimate  restaurant? This is the first time that I have really ever had that experience and it happened to be while I was having one of the most amazing meals ever.The courses were well thought out, perfectly timed and kept my husband and I debating for days as to which course was our favorite. i can't say that each course was better than the one before because they were all incredible. We keep checking to see when their menu is going to change because we can't wait to go back. We hope to make this one of our regular spots and it isn't even anywhere near us.As to the little things, the dining room is small and understated. It didn't come off as pretentious and was comfortable. The servers were all extremely nice. You could tell that they were proud to work there, but not in a snooty kind of way. And the owners were so gracious and kind. Chef Nugent and his wife both stopped to talk to all of the tables and it wasn't about selling themselves or the restaurant. It was about them taking a few minutes to thank you for being there and to sing the praises of the staff. They were extremely humble and personable.Highly recommend, we will be back as often as we can. Bring on the 12 courses!Side note, if you've never had a menu with a fixed number of courses than be prepared to be there a while. This isn't our longest meal to date, but we were there for about 3 hours. We would have moved in if they let us.Also, they called the day before to inquire about any dietary restrictions and food allergies, which was extremely thoughtful and considerate since my husband is allergic to fish."
2nd best restaurant in Chicago (only behind the super ridiculous Alinea).  The food is amazing and very reasonably priced considering the quality.  Some restaurants you save up for and go once....I honestly would go to Goosefoot every three months so I can experience the delicious tasting menu each time it rotates.  Keep doing whatever you are doing...as your cuisine matches up with anything my wife and I have had in Chicago (except Alinea) or during our Michelin star focused travels through Europe.
"I forgot all about the best part!  The menus are printed on seed paper.  Not only are they ""green"", but you can take them home and grow some pretty wildflowers."
