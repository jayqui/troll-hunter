Velvet Taco
"This restaurant is outstanding! Downside is that tacos range from about $4-$7 per taco, but you can rationalize this because its in the middle of the Gold Coast and they need to pay rent.  Ordered up the (spicy) Tikka Chicken, the Pork Belly, and tater tots.  I also sampled that day's special, the Elvis taco.  I give the highest marks to the Tikka, the tater tots, and the Elvis and adequate marks for the Pork Belly.  Beer goes for about $4 which is okay.  If possible, eat upstairs for people-watching-fun in the Triangle.Chatted up the clerk, she was nice and had some interesting things to say about a previous ""Velvet Taco"" opening.5 out of 5, will be back for more."
"King of Fusion Tacos !Service , Presentation, Quality of ingredients, taste - All A++The sauces and the ingredient combinations are well though out .. Eco friendly as they serve their tacos basicaly on a paperWish they can optimize their seating arrangement.. Seems very cluttered and haphazard.."
"Finally a great taco place in Gold Coast. Their fish n chips taco are light, crisp and the fish melts in your mouth. Will definitely come back here! It also helps with two story seating!"
"My friends wanted to treat me to an early birthday dinner and I suggested this place because I have only heard great things and wanted to try it out for myself. Boy was everyone right! We went to check this place out last Friday around 630PM. Even though it packed, the serve was pretty quick. Low down:- Order at the cashier and get a number.- Grab a seat and wait for your food.Everything on the menu sounded mouthwatering and it was hard to just limit myself. We ended up getting a good selection including some the cashier recommended:#17 Ahi Tuna - Light and oh so good. Being on a diet and eating out is very difficult, however with the substitution of a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla was perfect for me. I was a huge fan of the seaweed salad. Refreshing and tangy. Definitely my favorite on the menu,#6 Falafel - Also came with a lettuce wrap, which is why I ordered it. Sometimes falafel is too salty for me, but this one was on point. The tahini crema was not heavy and had a good tangy to it. #14 Shrimp & Grits (cashier recommendation) - This was one big taco. My friend enjoyed it very much. She said the grits had a lot of layers in flavor.#3 Spicy Tikka Chicken (cashier recommendation) - I don't know about you, but this was the best of both worlds, Indian food meets Mexican food. This was pretty awesome. Literally butter chicken in taco form. Just a little kick to it, but nothing overwhelming.#11 Grilled Flank Steak (cashier recommendation) - The steak was cooked perfectly and was not dry. My friend said the grilled red onions and the portobello made the steak juicy. Crisp tots & local egg - Big enough to share with 2-3 people per the cashier and he was right. Everything about this side dish is out of this world! I am pretty particular with my tots, they NEED to be crispy. If you are like me, then you don't have to worry because these tots were definitely crispy. I was worried the egg would make the tots soggy, but it didn't. When we broke the yolk, it just made the whole dish come together. On top of all this, there is bacon too! Just as crispy and with the cheese, life just made sense at that moment.Overall, I am so glad I spend my first cheat day eating here. First cheat day in 3 weeks and it was so well worth it. For someone like me, who doesn't ever crave Mexican, this place changed me. With such a unique selection of tacos that I have never seen or tasted before, I find myself drawn how they turn quality and flavor in their food in such a short amount of time. What a great addition to the neighborhood. Located in my old stomping grounds, Gold Coast, where I used to attend grammar school. Back in the day, students had the privilege of going off campus for lunch, and if this place was around, I would be here everyday! The only negative thing I can say about this place is why didn't it open sooner?!  Anyways, here's to hoping they will offer new tacos for the fall/winter or MAYBE open a spot in Andersonville. Just saying...."
"I was super excited to try this place but sadly turned out to be a mediocre experience. The inside is great, enough room to fit a good amount of people (you can go upstairs for more seating. Window seating available for people watching). The line seemed to move fast. I ordered all the fish tacos on the menu: Fish 'n chips, shrimp 'n grits and the ahi tuna. All three were a bit too much of one thing.- Shrimp n grits: too heavy- Fish and chips: This taco would've been great, but the curry sauce was a bit overpowering. If you want to try this, I suggest getting the curry on the side if you'r enot a huge fan of that curry taste- Ahi tuna: I didn't realize it came in a lettuce wrap so that's my fault, but overall it would've been better in a tortilla. The raw fish + ginger/soy sauce + seaweed just makes it too green for me. Those types of ingrediants should be in something with more substance. I wasn't satisfied after eating it.- Tots - great, but again, a bit too heavy for me. Although very creative and would order this again.Perhaps I'll try the other tacos if i return, but my experience wasn't grand."
"First off I am mad that after I placed my carry out order I waited by the counter and was able to see everyone else's order and what I missed out on. I will definitely be back to try the tater tots, red velvet cake, and one of those amazing looking drinks.I didn't have to stay jealous for too long cause my 3 taco order was delicious. I know it's on par to pay btw $3-$7 at these trendy taco places, but I can actually say these are worth it. Watching them make the tacos was like watching an artist at work. The 3 tacos I ordered were the steak, bacon cheeseburger, and the spicy chicken tinga. My favorite was the steak and whatever sauce they use is amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon cheeseburger, but the creativity around it is a plus. Chicken Tinga taco was very unique. It reminded me of orders I normally get at Middle Eastern restaurants, so great representation. I was struggling trying to finish 3 tacos as they are very filling and a decent size. This place is only 3 blocks from my house so I'll try to pace myself, but super excited to have this taco joint in the neighborhood."
We walked in shortly after they opened and Corey was such a huge help and very nice. He asked us if we've ever been there and continued to explain to us the menu and the most popular tacos. He was very helpful. I got the rotisserie chicken taco and the a pulled pork taco. Both were delicious! The margarita and tots are a MUST!
"I have friends who are crazy about this place. However, as a vegetarian, I was unfortunately disappointed. There was little to no flavor in their vegetarian options --not adding meat to a dish should not come with not adding spices or herbs. I consistently heard their beef options are great, though."
"I really enjoyed trying three different kinds of tacos at Velvet Taco. They were really creative and definitely worth the price.I tried the hamburger, pork belly, and cous cous tacos. The haburger really tasted like hamburger! The sauce in it reminded me of Big Mac sauce (although it's been eons since I've had a Big Mac so I might be wrong). The pork belly one was perfect. Loved it! But you know what? I think it was the vegetarian cous cous taco in a crisp lettuce shell that was my favorite. It was refreshing and interesting but MESSY as all get out!My buddy and I ordered our foods downstairs at the counter, paid, and were given a number. We lingered around the counter until our food was ready. Then we brought it upstairs where we could spread out at a table and delve into that goodness.I think that all of the tables were meant to be communal. They were long and could easily seat two or three pairs of diners. When we went (for dinner on a Tuesday) we had a table to ourselves.I'm excited to go again and try more tacos!"
"I really wanted to give Velvet Taco 4 stars because the food is pretty good but in my opinion you can't just take anything you want, put it in a tortilla, and call it a taco.  Some of the tacos are really fantastic and others just dont' really suit themselves as well in Taco form.  I'll give them 5 stars for creativity and diversity and 4 stars for effort of making it work.The Tikka taco is great if anyone wants a suggestion for at least 1 of them."
"Spicy Tikka Chicken taco -- the best. I've had other tacos here, but none are as good as the Tikka. Opt for the Rotisserie tacos too. Skip the mushroom & steak (it tasted like a bad crepe). Get the tatertots side. Breakfast options are also a safe choice.Velvet is from Dallas. Dallas is in Texas. Texas is the king of tacos. A piece of Texas is now in Chicago. Just wonderful."
"Before I even got my food, I knew I had to come back again.  Standing in from of the menu board I wanted to try all the the tacos.  Literally.  All of them.  Every single one.  As well as the sides.  And maybe the red velvet cake too.  Alas my tummy was not very hungry and I only ordered one taco and a side.  But I will definitely be back!I placed an order for the Spicy tikka chicken (""crisp tenders, spicy pepper sauce, buttered cilantro basil lime rice, raita crema, Thai basil, flour tortilla"") and while the cashier said both sides were delicious I splurged on the Crisp tots and local egg (with ""herbed goat cheese, smoked cheddar, avocado crema, bacon"").  They gave me a number and we kicked it on upstairs until they called the number to pick up the order.Food was delicious!  Cutting into that sunny side up egg and watching it run over the tots with cheese and bacon was quite possibly one of the sexiest things I have ever seen.This is possibly one of the only places in the city I've seen that doesn't have the usual Coke/Pepsi fountain drinks.  I kind of wanted to come back just to try the pop!There is some great people-watching to be done here, especially on the second floor when the windows are open.  Staff was helpful and friendly, decor and set up was great, it has a vintage feel without feeling dated or kitschy.  Jessica P. mentioned that the menu was a little different when she had come before, I like that keep things interesting.  I am looking forward to coming back and taking on more of the menu!"
"I ordered chicken tikka taco, steak taco, and paneer taco. Surprisingly I didn't care for the steak taco. Chicken tikka taco was good. I was expecting some amazing tacos because of all the reviews, but they were mediocre. The elotes were pretty good. I have to say the tater tots were amazing. Without the egg and bacon. So fresh and delicious.  I also got a frozen margarita. It was good I just wish it was more slushy. The one I got was frozen and too thick. Would I go back? Meh. I would want to go back to try the lobster taco and red velvet cake. If you are to get any taco it's the chicken tikka and definitely you have to get tater tots. 3 tacos, 1 elotes, and 2 frozen margaritas (I got one for a friend) cost $31. Overpriced. Expected though considering its Gold Coast. But for the quality, not worth it. I could've paid $15-$20 at a real authentic mexican restaurant for All that food for way better quality. I'm giving 5 stars for the service. Food is 3 stars (sorry). The workers there are very friendly. The girl who took my order was super helpful. And there was a guy there constantly cleaning off the tables. Very clean place."
Omg these tots! The most amazing things I have ever eaten. I am dreaming of the day I come back for them. My husband ordered the burger taco and said it was the best taco he has ever eaten. I got the buffalo chicken taco and it was the perfect spicy. Love this place and location is great. Will definitely be back soon!
"Happened upon the Velvet Taco while staying at Hotel Indigo. To be honest it was the lime sorbet margaritas that drew us in, but HOLY TACO this place is amazing for a quick lunch. Highlights include the chicken tikka taco, the falafel lettuce taco, and the fish and chips taco. They aren't traditional but they are all so good. There is something for everyone here. Order the rotisserie corn and crips tots and local egg--- woooowww. Sides you don't wanna miss! If you're in the area looking for a tasty fun lunch for cheap-- this is your joint. Each taco is about $3.75 and they are filling. I was with two guys who love to eat and they ordered three tacos and were full. Can't recommend this place enough!"
"Really really amazing tacos! I am still salivating two weeks later over the paneer taco and the corn side! The mediterranean was good too, but I was so full already with one taco and one side! Can't wait to try other options on their menu. My fiance liked their meat tacos too - liked the chicken tikka the best!"
"Really not sure what the hype is about here. I found myself hungry on this lovely Saturday afternoon, pulled up my yelp app to find a 4.5 star taco joint. Perfect! I love me some tacos. The interior is updated and clean. They have a cool vibe for sure. I was surprised to find so many unique taco options on the menu. Unfortunately, the food brings this review down. Flavors were disappointing all around, and cost didn't help things...$13 and change for three tacos!?! I tried the rotisserie chicken, annatto shredded pork, and the Cuban pig. The chicken was decent, I liked the creamy sauce on it and the meat was tender. The Annatto was just okay, nothing memorable. The Cuban pig was definitely not my taste...I ate two bites and left the rest! In the end, Velvet Tacos may be worth a try, but don't raise your expectations too high."
"In Chinese,  the word ""Crisis"" is formed by combining the Chinese characters for ""danger"" and ""opportunity"". And,  that is exactly what we have here,  a full blown crisis.  Oh so prey tell you ask,  well ok,  here goes. 1. the tacos are unique and outstanding2. the sides are sinfully delicious,  3. The people and house music are both excellent4. it is very conveniently located right around the block from my house,  5. I just lost a lot of weight and bought a new wardrobe,  which may be at risk here.So what did I have that was so delicious. ..Taco 1 - slow coooked Pulled Pork with Gyreure cheese, salsa,  white queso, fresh quacamole, roasted garlic and fresh cilantro on a fresh warm corn tortilla.Taco 2  - perfectly grilled flank steak,  grilled portobella mushrooms, white queso,  grilled red onion, Mexican oregano on a fresh warm corn tortilla,  The Killer - crispy tater tots,  local egg,  herbed goat cheese,  smoked cheddar,  avacado cream, chili butter,  bacon pieces.  (I added their special house chili ""heat sauce"" to the mix,  which was also sensational).While I may have been waffling between 4 and 5 stars for a moment,  Analisha sealed the deal. VT has a rock star of a front person who personifies the unique, contemporarized urban, retro vibe with class and dignity! VT will be a formidable player in the hood and a formidable challenge to my waistline."
"Loved this place. They get 5 stars for being creative with their tacos and making them taste sooo good. I got the Spicy chicken tikka taco and it was delicious!!! The basmati rice, chicken tikka and raita crema on top with cilantro wrapped in a tortilla - I am drooling as I am typing it out. It was fantastic. Hubby got the fried paneer and the Israeli couscous tacos. The fried paneer taco was delicious. The Israeli couscous one came as a lettuce wrap - and it tasted great too. I would recommend this place to all taco enthusiasts - these are stellar tacos - with a twist."
"3.5 starsVelvet Taco makes really interesting twists on the traditional taco, from breakfast tacos filled with bacon, egg, and cheese, to Asian ones (chicken tikka, paneer, and Ahi tuna.) I actually got the crispy tots and red velvet cake, but the tacos my friends got looked tasty and substantial. Do note that the Ahi tuna version comes wrapped in lettuce and drips a bit as you're eating it.The tots were loaded with a sunny side up egg, bacon pieces, and melted herbed goat cheese. The dish had tons of different flavors and textures going on, though next time I'd ask for less bacon because I'm not a huge bacon person. I finished the whole order in one sitting - in hindsight, this was a bad idea because of how heavy it was. Still, it was necessary comfort food for a hangover. I also indulged in a piece of the red velvet cake. I'm glad I didn't get the caramel sauce on top, since it was already sweet enough by itself. Both the tots and cake were large enough to be their own meals. There's something to be said about Midwestern serving sizes :)Velvet Taco is open until 4am on weekends, which also makes it an ideal place for a post-bar meal. I'm looking forward to coming back when I'm in the area and trying more of the menu!"
"The food was good, but they messed up in a couple ways. To begin I got the buffalo chicken and cuban pig, both had very reasonable amounts of meat and I was pretty happy with that. Taste was definitely unique and I'd come back here for the tacos. The metal pieces they serve the tacos in makes it easy to eat without it getting messy.Things they could improve on, they messed up my ticket # as well as a friends. They kept repeating numbers close to ours but not exact, so we were't sure if they messed up. After the 5th time we just went down and low and behold it was actually our food, just they entered the numbers wrong. No big deal really, I definitely like the microphone/speaker so you don't have to wait by the counter.But they had a pretty disgusting trash area, it seemed like no one emptied it for a few hours. If you have so much business, I would expect the trash to be cleaned up often so you don't have things overflowing in the garbage area."
"The menu here is definitely interesting, to say the least.  They basically took a taco and made it...really anything but Mexican?  Still, you have to applaud the creativity.  I went here with a serious craving for Mexican food, though, and didn't quite get that.  I tried three things:- the calamari taco - I don't think this is on the menu anymore, which is unfortunate, because it was my favorite of the bunch.  The flavors melded well and I was pleasantly surprised because it sounded a bit weird.- ahi poke taco - oh man, I really did not like this taco at all.  I love ahi tuna but they added way too much pepper and seaweed...the overall flavor was not pleasant.- shredded pork taco - this was okay.  Pork and pineapple are usually a good combo but the seasoning on the pork wasn't enough, and there wasn't enough avocado crema or pineapple, so this was underwhelming.Overall, I'm giving it three stars but I'm really between two and three.  The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, the food wasn't dirty or anything...I just didn't like the meal much."
"Cute corner restaurant! Clean, and the service is organized.They offer a variety of interesting tacos. The tacos are grouped into meat categories like beef, pork, etc.Okay for the price and most tacos taste good! The sauces and toppings can be a bit too much and I didn't like some combinations like the fried calamari cottage cheese taco. I actually could not finish that one. *tacos are medium size. Recommend 2, 3 if you are super hungry."
"simple. Clean. Yummy. Fresh. These are what I can describe for this place and went back for Saturday and Sunday. Twice in a row...but still good.I tried almost everything in the menu. My favoritE's are veggies falafel, chicken takamasala, cheese burger, tots and brunch menu. Soda is also different and unique options. Ski is my favorite. Only downsides are fish and chips are expensive and small. (Arouns $5.30. I remember) and first floor is small so hard to pass through to the menu area if it is crowded. But they have second floor as well."
"The tater tots w bacon and a fried egg were amazing; one of the best things I've eaten in a long time...tots were were crispy, crema was perfect consistency.  The egg was orgasmic as I popped the yolk and it drizzled into the tots.Oh yeah - and I also had a spicy chicken taco w basmati rice and peppers.  Drizzled w VT homemade spicey sauce and every sense in my mouth woke up and said ""oh HELL yeah""!Cool vibe; spotless restaurant, super nice folks.  This place is the bomb!"
So good! There are sooo many amazing things to try! I definitely recommend getting the flank steak taco and you gotta get the tots!!!
"Surprisingly good.My friend was raving about this place and to be honest, in such a touristy area, I had my doubts...but it was good!My favorite part was that you can customize the tacos to be on lettuce tacos instead of tortilla and since everything is cooked after order, you can customize anything. The margs here are so strong and worth it, although it would be helpful if the beer were a little bit cheaper =pThe upstairs open air windows are amazing for people watching!"
"Modern takes on tacos and other fun snacksAmbience/Service:  Trendy vibe to the restaurant with two rows of community seating and a long bar along the front window.  Ordering is at the cashier and you are given a number.Food: For the two of us (one vegetarian, one meat-eater) we together got 5 tacos and the crispy tots with the bacon on the side.  This was probably one taco too many.  I got all 3 veggie tacos: couscous, crispy paneer, and falafel.  The highlight was the paneer - great great flavors although it doesn't really taste like a taco.  Actually, it would make for a really great fusion burrito.  The low-point was the couscous - FAR too much couscous to other ingredients (mushrooms, peppers), making it way too starchy.  My girlfriend got a fish and pork belly taco and loved them both.  The tots were great with the egg - perhaps a tad too much smoked cheese for my taste.  Overall a really fun taco place.  Don't expect your classic taco truck type place.  If you're looking for a fun take on tacos, give this place a try"
"Velvet Taco will become one of my favorite places very quickly, so I recommend checking this place out.Food = DAMN GOOD! We got the Bacon Cheeseburger, Buffalo Chicken, Cuban Pig and Mediterranean Calamari Tacos which were all delicious. However, the Mediterranean Calamari was my least favorite because of the olive tapenade (this guy hate olives unless they are stuffed with blue cheese and sitting in a martini). The Bacon Cheeseburger Taco was a hit with my belly so that's a must try. As a side dish we got the Crisp tots & local egg. I highly recommend getting this. It was the bomb diggity.Music = They had some good music playing up in here, which had me asking my girl Siri ""Who sings this song?""Service = Spot on. Workers are friendly and more than happy to offer up suggestions.Space = Very nice indeed. Seating on the main floor, and upstairs. No need to worry about having to stand outside while you devour your tacos. Enough seats for all.Definitely check out Velvet Tacos and if you see me in there stuffing my face....don't judge."
"Oh my! This place is so good! They have a small selection of gourmet tacos of every meat choice (chicken, beef, pork, fish), and every type is sooooo delicious! I tried the rotisserie chicken and the flank steak taco. I'm hooked!!! The toppings were high quality. They do not taste like your average neighborhood taco joint. My fiancé had the cheeseburger taco and the buffalo chicken taco. They were like amazing mini sandwiches without the bun! They have a small selection of sides, but everything they do have is creative, gourmet, and tasty! The entire restaurant is geared towards going green. Everything is recyclable and they do not carry the large consumer chain brands of soft drinks . I love their take on modern and different! The late night hours are awesome as well! I will definitely be back soon!"
"Cool and casual environment. Slightly pricey, but not for the neighborhood. They need to put their menu up high so people can actually read it. Also the stools by the windows on the second floor are leaning back (extremely uncomfortable). I'm actually writing this hoping that someone from the management or an actual owner can read it and correct the flaws."
"If it was socially accepted I'd drape myself in their ahi poke taco. Yes, it's almost $7 for a tiny little thing, but between the ginger-soy vinaigrette, avocado, seaweed salad,pickled fresnos, sesame seeds, himalayan sea salt, micro greens, and lettuce wrap it's an almost perfect piece of food for you to put in your mouth. To fill up it'll cost at least $20, but it's definitely worth it. The Cuban Pig and the Flank Steak are also amazing at a slightly lower price tag and you can top off that extra space in your empty stomach with one of the sides like the rotisserie corn or tots with an egg on top. If it's not completely slammed you can get in and out of there in about 20 minutes which is pretty amazing considering that you're getting Frontera Grill quality fast casual food. Overall Velvet Taco is one of the best new restaurants I've tried in quite some time. I just wish I live a little bit closer cause I'd probably eat there all the time."
"Temper your expectations! I came here because everyone was talking about this cool new spot that has amazing tacos. In reality, it's more like this place that has a creative menu with average taste. First off, the good. Velvet Taco has awesome sodas. The soda fountain has these unique drinks that you've never heard of and even more bottles next to the register. Big props to them for going off the beaten path and doing something cool like that. Secondly, both sides are great! The tots are crispy and eggy and the corn is creamy and zingy. Prices and service were also great!Sadly, when it came to the tacos, things were not as good. The ahi lettuce wrap just tasted like ahi and seaweed. Which then just turned into mush in your mouth. The chicken tikka was dry and one note. It lacked that succulent juicyness of a good tikka. The amount of spice was good though. And the Mediterranean calamari taco was overpowered by the kalamata olive tapenade. Not to mention the lack of calamari in general.I wanted to like this place. I really did. The tacos were just overrated. Is this a 4.5 star kind of place? Not really. None of the food was ""bad"" but none of the tacos made me want to come back again either. If you really want some great tacos for a similar price, head on over to Big & Little's. If you want some great tots and corn, and wash them down with some unique drinks, you're in the right place."
"This review will probably surprise those who know me, as I have long been a Velvet Taco fanatic. I lived next to the original in Dallas and became addicted, so was ecstatic when I heard they were opening a location a block from me in Chicago! I went 3 times in the first week!While I've spent the last few months shouting their praises to everyone I know, today I'm posting a 3 star review because every time I've visited this location the quality is a little less than the time before. And that's just not a good trend. Also, when they first opened they would bring your tacos to you, which I appreciated bc of the wait. Now you get called and have to go pick them up. Small things, especially when you'll likely only find a seat upstairs.I do love the taco line up, the menu is stellar. It's super inventive. 2-3 tacos should do the trick and fill you up. The Paneer taco is really what started my love affair with Velvet Taco (try it!). The taco trays are also fun, I like this design touch on how they're served. And I like that they make their own soda, sell local brew, and make their own sauces. All great things!Prepare for a bit of a wait. Granted its all made from scratch, so just settle in. The tots at this location are a pass. I'm not sure what's different, but it's just not worth it. I'd rather have an extra taco. Also, ask for the red velvet cake without the caramel sauce. I think its just too much and over powers the flavor that you're looking for. I'll be back, but not 3x a week."
"So I love the Dallas location and have been here a few times but have to say, I most likely won't be back. We waited in a long line.. which is fine! Then we waited 30 minutes for food as we watched people behind us grab their food. We were confused. When we asked why, they said it takes a long time. Then when we waited another 10 minutes, they finally asked us our order and gave us our food. I was very disappointed."
"First off I should say that tacos of any sort are my jam, so to see that Velvet Taco opened up down the street from me, had decent prices, was fast and open 'til 4 am...well, this gave it 3 stars already before I even tried it. But, the food is actually really great! While these aren't your typical tacos, the execution and flavor is perfect! They are slightly bigger than a street taco and they offer something for everyone. My only sadness is that they don't have chips and salsa/guac, only offering tater tots which are only so-so."
That was a good taco!
"Working in the Gold Coast there are a handful of places to pick up a quick bite for lunch.  Heard this lil spot opened and was a little curious.  This place did not disappoint ;) They offer a great variety of choices whether you're looking for ""Veggie"" or Meat tacos ;)  I've tried most of them. The price range is not bad for a quick lunch. This lil spot is a nice option for the Gold Coast.  I say give it a try. It's a great place and not pretentious.. Finally the roasted corn side is a MUST!! Yummy!!"
"Velvet Taco omg in love with everything about this place. The restaurant is hip and casual, and the decor and unique color combinations (neon green and pink frames, pink and white chairs) work really well together. Huge fan of the vegetarian paneer taco, that was my favorite, and the steak flank one comes in a close second. The tater tots, however, were good but not nearly as good as the tacos I tried. I was hoping they would taste a little different than the cafeteria tots I've eaten at school, but the tots were the same, it was just the gourmet toppings that were different. However, I didn't there there was enough avocado sauce/other toppings to make the dish seem really distinct and better than the tots I've eaten for years in school.Ultimately I would definitely recommend this place. We were skeptical at first at ordering two tacos each, but despite how seemingly small they are, these tacos are delicious and fulfilling."
"If you can get over the fact that these are not really tacos so much as well-made European-sized sandwiches in a flour tortilla, then you'll be good...especially when you consider the prices.I stopped by with a large group for dinner last night and tried the Fried Paneer, Buffalo Chicken and Bacon Egg Frittata ""tacos.""  All of them were good; the paneer taco was great, and the sauces on that thing (described as tikka sauce and raita crema) were incredible.  Three tacos was enough for me; some of the folks at my table were fine with two and a split of some of the sides, like the tater tots.That said, the cheapest taco on the menu is $3.25, so as long as you know you are walking into the Gold Coast to get tacos, you'll be fine.  Dropping $5 or more per taco is easy here, especially if you want fish.  This is crazier now that I've been to NE Seafood Company in Lakeview just last Tuesday, where $2 goes a very, very long way for a fish taco.Very tasty, but I'm not rich so I can't imagine coming back unless my wife leaves me and I need to beer-and-dine a hot 26-year-old female near the Viagra Triangle and my other options are booked.  But if you do go, give that paneer taco a spin!"
"Went to this cute little place located in a very cute neighborhood for lunch. The interior is casual with mostly stools to sit on and a comfy/hip feeling to it. We ordered flank steak taco, chicken tikka taco, & buffalo chicken taco all were extremely flavorful & huge! After going through the tots, which were delicious by the way, I could barely finish the two tacos I ordered! I was so extremely impressed with the quality of the tacos and I am so glad to have found a place that takes their tacos seriously! The amount of meat was huge in each taco and the sauces were on point. We also ordered the corn side dish which was very good along with the lemon Margarita (delicious and full with the buzz)! I am drooling thinking about that place right now and I cannot wait to go there again!!"
Came here with a group of friends.. So we were able to get a variety of the tacos.. By far the chicken tikka and the veggie paneer were the best!! The fish and chips was a little salty for my taste but still delicious! We also got the tots on the side without the bacon and it definitely was an excellent choice to include!! Tots were crisp and all the sauce/toppings were perfect!! The seating upstairs with the ac on was perfect for this hot summer day!!
"The way my Texas friends talked about this place, I thought it was where Jesus Christ got his tacos. Maybe JC isn't hanging out here, but John the Baptist might be.The tacos are fun and inventive, like one based on a Cuban sandwich and another that's a play on chicken tikka. I wouldn't get more than two or else you'll leave with a food baby that rivals what you'll see in a Lamaze class. Come for the tots and corn, but stay for the Maine Root soda fountain. I love when a fast casual place switches it up, and I can try soft drinks different from the normal Pepsi/Coke options. Overall, this is definitely a fun spot. Don't let the small space fool you--there's a bigger dining room upstairs.Just don't eat too much or you'll have to invoke the Lord's name."
great location and great food! If you head up stairs you can snag a table that gives a great view of the street for people watching. the taco selection is amazing and we were impressed with all of them. I do wish they had more drink options to go along with the orders. They are young though so that may still be in the works! I am a strict vegetarian as well so I was thrilled to see a few veg options that weren't bland sounding and actually looked delicious!
"Pretty detailed, in-depth review with photography here:joehuanphoto.com/Blog/Ve…"
"Was in the area this Sunday and for some reason I never noticed it. Me and a friend were on our way to Big Bowl but I decided I would much whether have tacos and thank the Lord in Heaven that I decided that!! Those tacos were creative and delicious! It's open seating so it's easy to mingle with others and meet new people. Everyone here is friendly and the food is prepared quickly. The girl who took our order took time to make recommendations and make interesting small talk. She was wonderful! Everyone was working hard to the point that me and my friend thought one of the managers was the owner because he was going above what I've seen most restaurant managers go. I don't remember what I ordered exactly because I just wrote down the numbers but it was the 9, 10, 19 and one more that I forgot. All of them were great! I'll definitely be back to try the other stuff on the menu. It's such a cute space too!"
"I'm sorry, but I guess I'm one of the few who was extremely disappointed in the food.  I came in with some friends from Dallas who say this location is nothing like the original Dallas one. The chicken tikka masala and the mattar paneer tacos are overly spicy - so much so that it ruins your palate for the rest of your meal.  Besides, I feel like I'm just eating indian food on a really bad roti.   Even though they are popular, I found the tots to be bland.  So were the falafel  and rotisserie tacos. Perhaps I chose the wrong ones, but I just don't see myself coming back."
"Im gonna go with just ok here.  I know this bucks the trend of others. I dont discredit them and I dont think you should NOT try it (is that english?). Im just telling you there has got to be better tacos in this city.  There just has to be!  This cant be it.  Let me start by saying, this place always has a line.  At night. In the day. After work. After dinner. After dranking.  Always. Also, its not fast.  You will stand in the line to wait to order.  The person taking your order will be sweet and you will wish you didn't hate their face after waiting in the line.  Once you order, you will do a double-take on the price of your tacos because it will be more than you thought it would be.  Then, you will receive a number and wait again...  When you receive your food, you will look at the tacos, look back at your receipt and again double-take the prices on the menu.  The tacos are expensive for what you get.  At first blush, they look big, but there is very little ""filling"" in them and that sucks because most of what they give you IS tasty.  But, to account for lack the good stuff, they cover everything with white queso or crème fresco and that does not always work.  Thats a huge downer because everything is covered in some short of sauce or cheese or quac.  This doesnt have to be ""authentic"", but mexican flavors are simple and distinct.  Velvet is always, cheesy, saucy and covered in ""stuff"" (I believe that is the technical term).  I think this insults the intelligence of diners and will eventually turn people off.  Im no Bobby Flay but...I know what works long term.   Im sure the lines will continue and this place will continue to print money.  I just think you should want more for your time, your money and your taste buds. Just my dos pesos (covered in cheese and stuff)."
"FABULOSO! Truly delicious~I am a critical taco foodie and this new joint passed the test. They have a unique assortment of tacos with a wide range of flavors for the palette. Try the buffalo chicken, rotisserie chicken, and add a side of corn! They are open until 4:00 and the atmosphere is funky, chill, creative, and inviting. More seating upstairs!"
Bomb tacos open really late..One of the best late night options in the area. Lines can get long when it's late and the bars are out but the food is solid.My favorite was the chicken tikka taco and the fish one.
"I would love to give the Velvet Taco a 10 out of 5 stars it was that insanely good!!  We were only in Chicago for 2 1/2 days on a trip from CA (where the Mexican food is amazing) and Velvet Taco had THE BEST TACOS we ever tasted!!!  So great in fact that we bailed on dinner plans our last night to go to Velvet Taco a SECOND TIME in 2 days!!!!!!  YES THAT GOOD!  Between the five of us we covered many of the menu items (all excellent) but out absolute favorites were the ANATTO SHREDDED PORK, the ROTISSERIE CHICKEN and the Hamburger Taco or the Tuna Poke taco.  Also incredible was the corn side-dish!!  AND I don't care how full you think you are DO NOT SKIP the Velvet Cake With sauce drizzle!  We miss you already Velvet Taco!"
A nice addition to the neighborhood. Tacos are good and for the price in this neighborhood it's cheap eats.  I tried about 4 different tacos all were awesome don't think you can go wrong here with anything you get.  And I love red velvet cake so I'm sold and it's a keeper.
"Found this new place close to our hotel in Chicago. My sons were convinced mom was on one of her weird food expeditions, but they ended up saying it was their best meal of the trip. Interesting ingredients led to tasty tacos, however the tater tots were the star. We are still talking about them a month later. Try the sodas as well - harken back to the old days when pop was flavorful!"
"I actually went here thinking that it was just a Mexican place. I was pleasantly surprised when they had a large variety of unconventional tacos and tater tots too.I can never remember the names but I loved the steak taco, chicken tikka and pork belly taco. All had very different flavors and catered to a diverse palate. If you come here, you have to try the tots!"
"I have to come here every time I'm in Chicago. The tacos, they are just magical. My go to is the Cuban Pug, a perfect blend of ham, bacon, pickles and cheese. The flour tortilla is slightly crispy and makes the entire thing come together.Team is always helpful and friendly. I noticed they are always educating newcomers on what to do, how to order, and recommended order size. They are locked in the Gold Coast on state street and it's a great place to stop in if you are walking around the area. Highly recommended!!'"
"This place is amazing! Super quick, super creative and super good! The corn side was unbelievable. Everyone around us was raving about their various tacos. Would love to come back and try more. Yum!"
"Is it just me or this has a naughty name to it... never mind.As my friends made a logial point, tacos from Texas is a very good thing. AND it's open late till 4am. What better way to end a night in Viagra triangle than to eat at the Velvet Taco!Back to the place at hand. Awesome choices, my go to is the fish n'chips, best fish taco in the city, unfortunately, the priciest out of all the tacos, naturally. Great place any time of day. Soda machine dispenses real sugar fizzy pop.  Lots of funky wall art and signs. Watch out for the narrow staircase, it's a hike."
"I was pretty psyched when I heard that Velvet Taco was opening up a Chicago branch.  I've visited the Dallas location a couple of times, and always been a fan.  First off, if you're expecting a true authentic Mexican style taco, this isn't your place.  Secondly, prices for tacos are $4 and up.  So, if you're the cheapass AND expect Taco Bell prices, stick with what you're used to.  Also, don't compare Velet to Chipotle because it's a completely different type of concept.  Minus Mexico, Velvet Taco's offerings are like the United Nation of tacos.  I've been here enough times that I've tried just about everything on the menu.  My favorite is the poke taco - a soy marinated sashimi quality ahi in a large piece of lettuce.  Additionally, it's accompanied with avocado and a seaweed salad.  It's the priciest item on the menu (about $7), but it's SO good!  If you need a little spice in your life and enjoy Indian food, the chicken tikka may be your thing.  The chicken definitely has a nice kick to it!  The basmati rice is a nice accompaniment to this gem, which is served on a flour tortilla.  I'm also a huge fan of the pork belly taco.  It's a rather simple taco since the flavor of the pork belly doesn't require a lot of seasoning.  I really like the pickles and pickled hot Fresno peppers that accompany this taco.  If you're not solo, I'd highly recommend trying one of the two sides- rotisserie corn or the crispy tots (which in and of itself could be a meal).  Both are a little too heavy and high on the sodium to eat by yourself or at least most people.  Both are pretty darn good though.  And while you're there, get a piece of red velvet cake to share!Service is efficient and friendly.  I've been to the Chicago location several times, and the staff here couldn't be any nicer!  If the popularity of the Dallas location is any indication, it's just a matter of time before this location gets super popular and swamped, so get here soon to give this place a shot before the lines get insane!"
"Stopped in here for an early lunch last Sunday. What an interesting menu. We tried a variety of tacos but our favorite was the Chicken Tikka. It was perfect. The elote was disappointing because of all the stringy stuff from the ears of corn. While I appreciate them using fresh produce, I didn't care for the strings getting caught in my teeth. Overall, very good food."
I've eaten from here about 5 times and I can never get enough! These tacos are seriously the best. There are so many options to choose from whether you're vegetarian or a meat lover. I can eat the chicken tikka and paneer tacos back to back and still want more! Those are my favorites along with the Rotisserie chicken. I plan on trying the Israeli and Falafel one at my next trip to Velvet Taco's!LOVEEEEE this place!
What a gem! Loved this place! They have a nice handful of vegetarian options for and tons of meat options as well. The fried paneer taco was incredible - spicy and delicious with a masala type sauce. The falafel taco was also super flavorful. We ordered 3 tacos each which was more than enough food. This place is affordable with a great atmosphere- if you go upstairs in the summer they have the big windows open overlooking all of Rush Street. I'm definitely going to become a regular when I move to Chicago next month!
"The Tots are amazing, people are mix of locals to Gold Coast and clueless tourists but all there to enjoy some non snobbish quality Tacos! Interesting mixes of ethnic dishes and Tacos!"
First time here and it wasn't bad. The place used to be a subway and they did a nice job of revamping it. The interior was cute and unique. The menu was written largely on the wall and there are a lot of options. Was told to try the steak taco and it was just ok. The pulled pork taco was a lot better and tastier and it had a really great mix of pineapple and cilantro on it. I would come back for seconds & try something new.
"Shrimp and grits tacos, people. I had to stop and write this review as I'm still eating the taco. There's sauce on my phone. I don't care. Come here and eat shrimp and grits tacos! They have a lot of options. I also tried the chicken tikka which was excellent and the flank steak which was not. Skip that one. Eat shrimp and grits tacos!"
If what you want is chill atmosphere to people watch and eat some unique varietal tacos then come here! I got the #5 (tofu) it was delish. You MUST try the Egg Tater Tots
"Amazing tacos!  I met a few friends here the other night.  It was a weeknight so it  wasn't too crowded.  I arrived early and waited for my friends to get there before ordering.  The staff was super friendly and multiple people asked if I would like anything while I waited - so nice!When my friends arrived, we placed our orders and sat upstairs where there are a good number of tables, large enough for a sizable group.  We split the tater tot nachos and elote-style roasted corn side dish first - both were great.  I then had three tacos - the crisp tikka chicken (my hands down fave), the cuban pig (I can't say no to gruyere), and their WTF (weekly taco fix) which was a lobster and avocado roll (amazing!)  Will definitely be hitting this place up again!"
"Dreaming of their tacos as I type thisreview. I finally walked in after walking passed it for a couple of months now.Boy, do I regret not walking in sooner.The recipes here are interesting and so delicious. I absolutely LOVE the falafel taco. Last night, I ordered the daily taco, shrimp w feta, watermelon and arugula..amazing again! Nothing has been sub par. Their sodas are so tasty, like liquid candy ha ha! I'm so lucky that this place is down the street from me. Never going to Chipotle again and Big Star in Wicker Park is so lucky that they are in Wicker Park. 5 Stars to Velvet Taco"
"I wanted to shock my taste buds and velvet taco did just that! Chicken tikka tacos: hella good!! Being Indian and a big Mexican food fan so this was a win win for me.  well done you guys!! Buffalo chicken taco: must get! So soo good!!Tots+egg: this was very interestingly good. Never thought the egg would make such a big difference. Corn: I am big fan of corn. Though this version tasted good, there was something about it that I didn't care much for...may be the sauce. Margaritas: strong!!(really really good) Can't wait to go back!!"
"My buddies and I wanted a quick lunch and we were in the Gold Coast. This is a two story taco shop near a lot of the hubbub at the viagra triangle.  The up stairs gives a nice perch to people watch. It sits just across from the Vans store.  I had the falafel, cuban pig and pork belly tacos.  The falafel taco comes in a lettuce leaf shell.  All the tacos I had were unique and tasted fresh. I did not find this overly priced for what we got.  They serve beer and you seat yourself. I thought the staff was friendly enough.  Mind you the tacos may be gourmet but the service and restaurant isn't and they don't try to be either. I definitely would hit this place up again."
"After one of my coworkers swore by Velvet Taco's original location in Dallas, I knew had to make a stop here. While the tacos aren't priced super cheap, they DO make their own tortillas, slow roast their chicken, make everything from scratch, etc. etc. so I can let the slightly inflated price tag slide.I went here with two friends; we each ordered 3 tacos and split the two apps on the menu (elote-style corn and crisp tots with an egg). We all ordered the WTF (Weekly Taco Feature), essentially a lobster roll served in a tortilla, and loved it! I also ordered the Crisp Pork Belly taco (their play on the Chicago dog with pickles, fresno peps, mustard, tomato, red onion, poppy seeds, and celery salt) as well as the Grilled Flank Steak taco (portobello, white queso, grilled red onion, and oregeno). While I wasn't crazy about the Pork Belly taco (I felt the pork was lacking in flavor), I loved the other two I ordered! I also got a frozen margarita that was bursting with tart lime flavor--a must try.The staff was very polite, attentive, and helpful--they definitely put the cherry on top of the experience here. I will definitely be back!p.s. Head to the second floor for tons of extra seating (and a little bit less noise)!"
"Best Fish Taco in the city!!! Fish and Chips taco is so flavorful and colorful. It's crispy and filling! I've had dreams about the taco and talk about it constantly. Don't even get me started on those tots! Love this little spot. Velvet taco may be a little place, but it serves up a big flavorful item. Everyone I have ever talked to who works there was pleasant and looked like they were enjoying their job."
I was a little leary about this place because the tacos seemed very complicated. Boy was I blown away. Everything worked together perfectly. We love it.
"I work a few blocks from this spot and have been several times and have always really enjoyed it. The wait is always a little on the long side, but I've never really minded because the tacos are so good.However, tonight the wait has been unacceptable. My boyfriend and I have been here for 45 minutes and have yet to receive our food. Everyone in here is waiting an absurd amount of time. We already finished our drinks and still have no food. We thought this would be a quick stop for tacos, and it has turned into a headache. UPDATE: we have now been here 50 minutes with no food, and the girls that just sat down next to us five minutes ago just got their food already. My boyfriend went down for the third time to see where our food was, and they now said that they called our number five times and it was our fault for not hearing it. We were seated upstairs and I am 100% certain that our number was not called over the loud speaker because our hungry asses were not even talking to each other because we were listening so hard for our number. They also told us that they gave away our tots because ""they were getting cold."" I am so incredibly disappointed in the absolute lack of customer service tonight that I really don't think I'll be returning."
"I swear this used to be a Subway around Rush and Division I have been to many drunk nights years ago. Deff a upgrade, theres a subway every block nowadays anyway. Tacos after a long day of drinking is always a good idea. This a trendy spot, very wicker parkish. The menu is not that large but it does not have to be. Their tacos are unique, and soo good. Buffalo chicken, Chicken Tikka, Paneer, Bacon Burger tacos, enough said. Not to mention their tots topped with bacon, cheddar, avacado crema, and a sunnyside egg! I wanted to come back the next day, it was so good."
"Really, really good tacos! Excellent location along State Street, perfect for date night especially when sitting on their second floor by the window. Not a single bad taco but not a single taco absolutely blew my mind either. Spicy Tikka Chicken: 4.5/5 -- Possibly my favorite. Based on the famous Indian dish -- chicken tikka masala -- this taco bursts with flavor and curry. Curry not too rich. Thought the rice went pretty well too. Annatto Shredded Pig: 4/5 -- Very solid taco. How could a taco not pull it off with grilled pineapple and avocado? Buffalo Chicken: 3.5/5 -- Not my favorite at all. Buffalo chicken and tacos just did not go well together. Cuban Pig: 4.5/5 -- Pretty solid. Pulled pork, ham, and bacon together. Loved the pickles too. Shrimp and Grits: 3.5/5 -- Shrimp, grits, and tacos did not go as well as I had hoped. More pricy than the rest. I like the selection, variety, and uniqueness of the tacos. Beautiful decor. Would love to come again!"
"This place really good.Small, not an extensive menu but what they do make is delicious.Their tater tots with egg was drool worthy!!"
"My fiancé and I were surprised that we liked the velvet taco. Neither of us had tried it before and we were skeptical, to say the least. Some of them were sweet, some savory, but all were delicious. Many of them had a little bit of a tangy bite!"
"Had the Rotisserie Taco, Beef Taco and Ahi Tuna Taco and washed it down with the TaterTots.Overall excellent quality average price is about $4 to $5 per taco. The only thing keeping them from getting a Five Star was the wait. Took quite a while to get 3 tacos."
Stopped here at 12am wanted something that was open that late . To our surprise the tacos were amazing and not the typical Mexican resturant tacos . All four we ordered were gourmet in varity and amazing . This was not what I expected and I cannot wait to go back .
"Velvet Taco is a fun little joint off State with a unique, almost indie, take on some classic tacos. The menu selection is very good for bother drinks and food. I had the brunch tacos, which were rich and full of flavor. The hot sauce on each table was a favorite for me with a smokey taste and just the right amount of kick. The prices are fair enough for Chicago and seating wasn't an issue. The food is rather rich in spice and upset my stomach a bit after, which is a rare thing for me. Regardless, I plan on coming back to see what else they have to offer!"
"I thought from the look of this place, Velvet Taco would be one of those cheap Mexican places--the kind that'd be labeled a ""Tacqueria"" in other neighborhoods. Not here.Velvet Taco, your tacos are NOT that good nor filling enough to charge between $4 to $7 per taco.  Had two and a drink.  $15!!! For just two tacos and a drink that took me all of 6 minutes to finish.  Yes, the tacos were tasty, but overpriced, even for the Viagra Triangle."
"My favorite go to place for out of the blue craving for fusion tacos. This is a hipster run place, as Anthony Bourdain would call it. I would describe the establishment as trendy, casual, a better version of Chipotle with food that actually looks artistically presented. I have been here multiple times and so far the food and service is very consistent. A great addition to the neighborhood indeed! I've tried most of their tacos and you cannot go wrong with either the Pork or Beef selections. For other categories, approach with caution since they are more tailored to exploring the diverse ethnic tastes. The most delectable menu item here has to be their side item, Rotisserie Corn with queso, valentina, and lime. Get extra hot sauce (their version) and pour it all over the corn. You will not regret the burst of flavors that will go into your mouth. MMMmmmm give me some more! On another note, their margarita drinks are fantastic as well.Bottom Line: If you have not been here, your missing out!"
"Holy amazing taco! Ok....so not a big fan of chains but loved the menu and really love trying new spots, so we hit this place up last night.  What an innovative menu! They have so many unique options for everyone! There were 4 of us who tried Velvet Taco last night and the following words were used to describe the tacos we ordered: ""excellent"", ""binge worthy"", ""i want more"", ""best.taco.ever."" etc etc.Now to the tacos...all of these are highly recommended by us:Fish & Chips  - I had mine immediately and it was light and delightful.  My husband had his after it was cold and it was still crispy!! Pork Belly - the wanted moreBuffalo Chicken - melt in your mouth and great balance of ingredientsPaneer - perfect size of paneer and nice accompaniments...wanted more!Steak - ""could eat 10 of these""...and of course a rotisserie corn.  There is also a healthy option...the Falafel Taco that is served in a lettuce wrap vs tortilla.  This place really knows how to meet the needs of a diverse group! Everything was perfectly seasoned and bursting in flavor.  What I have seen lately is that veggie tacos tend to be super spicy, while I like a bit of spice, I not want my mouth on fire.  So Velvet Taco brings the right amount of heat for those who like spicy and those who don't...and everyone in the middle.  Can't wait to make this into our regular taco spot! Welcome to our old 'hood Velvet Taco!!!"
"I LOVED this place :) I went here with some friends to catch up because one of them said she heard raves about their tacos. I ordered the Cuban Pig and Grilled Flank Steak. The steak was my favorite but I will definitely come back to try the others. I have suggested the place to my mom and other friends, but maybe I should keep it to myself so only I know about it :P (just kidding). Also, the Crispy Tots & Local Egg was mouthwatering and delicious. The place also looks nice: clean and very colorful. Two floors and long tables with stools. The mural is great, too. We are all her when we eat here."
Looking for a new place to eat while visiting.... Astonishing.... Very clever menu combination. The margaritas are the bomb.
"I experienced the rotisserie chicken taco and the fish taco. I thought the flavors were balanced and thoroughly enjoyed both.  The tacos were filling. I'm looking forward to trying the pork belly taco on my next visit. Great customer service, the cashier was very helpful and accommodating."
"Tried about 5 different tacos, hamburger, steak,shrimp and grits,buffalo chicken ,pulled pork all were good and the margarita was great."
"The Spread: This ain't your traditional taco place. If you can fully embrace and enjoy the fact that tacos are a delicious vehicle for many-a-flavor (think: gruyere cheese, olive tapenade, celery leaves) then get ready for some fun. We ordered four tacos: Buffalo Chicken (#1), Crisp Tikka Chicken (#3), Fish n'Chips (#16) and the Bacon, Egg Frittata (#19). Best one in my opinion was the Tikka Chicken, in part because it carried a kick! Breaded chicken was soft but not too soggy, served on a bed of cilantro, basmati rice and topped with a pepper sauce, raita crema and a dash of thai basil. It was the perfect blend of buttery, creamy, fried, salty YUM. I also love that tacos come dressed with fresh greens/herbs. In addition to tacos, we couldn't resist a side of tots. ...Because tots. They're smothered by an egg, and drizzled in goat cheese, cheddar cheese, avocado cream and bacon. Holy moly richness. I'm glad we shared them. I love that they have corn as a side that's served more traditionally with queso fresco and they also sell rotisserie chickens. (Heyo, next time?)The Scene: Super casual place. Plenty of additional seating upstairs. There's a mix of counters, tables and stools. And there are cool sporks (spoon on one end, fork on the other) that accompany the sides. The Service: You order at the counter and then scoop your food when your order is called. The margaritas we ordered were served up right away, so we sipped on those while we waited for food. Staff seemed friendly, and one of the guys even offered to clear our tables when we asked what procedure was once we'd scarfed down our meal."
Delicious chicken tacos pork belly and the corn is going to get the manager is really nice and the food is fresh and deliciousWill be back in the future
"Last fall, I was very happy to hear that one of my favorite Dallas taco joints was going to establish a location up north in Chicago after I had recently done the same - fast forward to February 2015, and tacos are alive and well in the Gold Coast.The location itself is interesting, some seating available downstairs but much more upstairs. Similar to the Dallas/Fort Worth locations, they have a 'weekly taco feature' aka WTF, which was a rotisserie chicken / avocado cream / goat cheese / pickled red onion concoction for their opening week. Tried it along with one of my favorites, the Cuban Pig (shredded pork + bacon + mustard & cheese), and was whisked away back down to Knox-Henderson Dallas for taco bliss. I will certainly be back, and looking forward to all the taco goodness. Prices are a little higher than the Texas locations, but c'est la Chicago."
"came here for lunch today around noon with friends. amazingly there wasn't a wait to order at all. I ordered the pork belly, annetto pork and the ahi poke. I loved the racks the tacos came on to keep them folded and separate from each other. the taco themselves had so much filling and were very flavorful. I would say the ahi poke was my favorite: filling but light. I also ordered the tater tots and egg to share. really liked them as well. my friends also really enjoyed their tacos as well. Their favorite tacos were fish n chips, skirt steak and the wtf: the hangover. definitely worth the price. I would say this is my favorite taco place in Chicago thus far."
Ridiculously great tacos! Frequent diner and can't go wrong with any of the choices. Thrilled to have a location in the neighborhood.
"Wow. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place! Walked in and was greeted by the nicest staff who guided us through the menu and their style of taco-making. My mother and I are very allergic to gluten and are limited on places to eat out because most restaurants are not educated on the celiac disease and what makes victims to it sick. But this place knew their stuff! A very nice man at the register talked to us and made sure all our questions were answered, and that nothing contained gluten. Between the two of us we got the #2,#3,#17, and#16(with grilled fish instead of fried) They were hands down AMAZING! The atmosphere, music, and interior design was all very cool as well. A great view of Rush Street and the city was a great add to the experience. I will be returning here for many meals to come!"
Best frozen margarita... The tots are fantastic... Best fancy tacos... Worth every penny... Everyone is super  nice.. Chill vibe
"As a neighborhood resident, I always look out for new openings and more diversity with food. When I found out this was opening, it sounded pretty interesting to me.First thing's first - this is not authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for that, then don't come here at all or you'll be disappointed. What this concept is about is presenting some more world flavors in a tortilla - in taco form. The place is somewhat trendy (not overly though) and has a good amount of seating.I ordered the tots with egg and bacon, poke (ahi tuna) taco, Cuban pork taco, and paneer (cheese) taco. All were pretty good though nothing stood out as amazing to me. I think the flavor of the Cuban pork one was the best, though all were good. The poke one came in a lettuce wrap and was a tad bit salty, but not overly so. Just dial it down slightly and it would taste a lot better. IMO they should be highlighting the flavor of the fish more. The tots were the only thing I wasn't super impressed with. They weren't bad, but I don't think I'd get it again. Admittedly though, I'm not a huge fan of American style Bacon so that might have something to do with it. I think someone else who is may find it better than I did. They have an interesting selection of drinks too and next time I'll try the elotes dish.Staff was helpful with a woman walking me through the process before I ordered.  I'll be back to try more and I'm glad it's in the area now - especially because it's open late. Not authentic at all or even close to it, and they have some room for improvement, but a pretty good casual option if you're in the area and in the mood for this kind of food."
"Tacos are between $4-$6, so it'll cost between $10-$15/person.  For a restaurant where you go up to order and try to find a seat to eat, that seems like a lot.  But, I'd eat here for every meal if I could; the food is absolutely amazing!  Very creative combinations that make the perfect tacos!"
"Why does everything in Chicago have to be fried?  I love Velvet Taco's concept but all of their seafood tacos are fried.. the calamari, the shrimp, the fish tacos.... I am still on the hunt for an excellent grilled seafood taco... and although Velvet didn't deliver to my expectation they are a great joint and have an ever-changing ""special"" offer that will keep me coming back..."
"Long time needed addition to the Viagra Corners. Anyway, lovely spot, great service and finally we got tacos!!! Keep bringing WTF )))) inside joke"
"Great tacos, lacking in horchata department, quite literally. Tacos of the pork variety were a highlight, but seriously though, why don't they have horchata?"
Went to this place on my visit to Chicago. Since I am a vegetarian I was out off many options but try had some pretty decent choices.I loved the paneer taco and the falafel taco.
Awesomeness and complex flavors in every bite. Sure to have you craving for more. You've got to try it. I recommend my FAVORITE the Tikka Taco. Loves it! Spicy Heaven!
"This place was pretty good, but not great. The shredded pork taco was good, but kind of bland. The fish and chips taco was different, I didn't care for the sauce. The tots though we're amazing!!!!!!"
"Consider this a 4.5 star review.This is probably the best place to go if you can't decide what you want to eat because they have pretty much every kind of taco to hit those different tastebuds.There is 21 tacos ranging from tikka chicken to bacon burger to Cuban pig. I am a regular here and have now tried every taco on the menu (besides the seafood category because of an allergy).My standard order is three tacos, and usually I get tots on the side. This will easily last 1.5 meals. My favorites are the roast pork frittata/chilaquile #20 and the tikka chicken #3The tots - let me put it this way - I don't even like tater tots, but I LOVE these fancy tots. The tots have so many fixings that it's like an explosion of salty, creamy, spicy, starchy. It's crazy.I feel the same way about they're red velvet cake. Normally I despise red velvet but Velvet Taco just does it right, oh and if you're eating it without the butterscotch sauce you're doing it wrong. Furthermore, the space is cool and the drinks are worth it.Now, the only hold back I have from this rave is that the calamari taco my bf ate was no good he said. And on just a couple occasions my stuff came too wet (tots were oily and the tacos had too much sauce) BUT these are so minor and could happen anywhere that it's pretty much null.So, the next time you are arguing about what to eat, remember me and just go here! In fact, just go here in general."
Really good tasting tacos- with all of them you really can't go wrong. Prices are totally reasonable and the tacos are huge! Their Indian one is very flavorful- along with their lettuce wrapped falafel. The fish one is also amazing. There is a bit of a line- especially on Friday and Saturday nights when they stay open until 4am but it's totally worth it! Their hot sauce is also soooo good- so make sure u try it if u like spicy!
"Though it's kind of an odd name, I'd come back to Velvet Taco again, but not if I was craving actual tacos. The ""tacos"" here are more like different ingredients in a tortilla, but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the #7 which was like a Cubano sandwich and the #11 (no mushrooms which they were cool about when I asked if I could have it without). I didn't like the mex-oregano that came on it, but luckily it was a sprig of the herb so I could just take it off. Props on the melted white queso instead of just shredded. It seemed to taste a lot better melted :)I didn't get any sides because they didn't interest me. I was a little surprised there were only 2 options. I don't really like corn or tater tots, but I was pretty full after 2 tacos so I guess I didn't need them.The shining star of this place is the fountain soda. I grew up in Southern Illinois and I was delighted to find Ski (+ other Excel bottling co. cane sugar sodas) was available here! I might have been more excited for the soda than the food. Friendly service and the upstairs area is a lot less chaotic than downstairs (with fountain soda available upstairs as well). Props for having a roll of paper towels on each table and I LOVE the taco holder things that the tacos come in! It's so great that the taco doesn't sprawl out as if it were on a plate or you needed to set it down. I'd definitely come back to try some of the other taco varieties and get my Southern Illinois soda fix again :-)"
"Let me start by saying the employees were nice and the place was clean. I have no problem with how this place is run or anything like that. The food just did not taste that good. I ordered the steak taco, tuna poke, buffalo chicken, and pork belly. I only finished the buffalo chicken and steak taco, and I only really enjoyed the steak taco. The tuna and the pork belly just didn't taste pleasing. My husband got the steak, paneer, tuna, chicken tikka, and pork belly. He felt roughly the same as me on the tastes, and again, didn't finish the majority of the tacos he ordered because they just didn't taste good. The tots were fantastic, though. Eat up them tots. In the end, if I want to go to an interesting late night taco place, I'm going to end up at BIG & littles. There's just too many really good places in this city to ever go back to this one."
"I really wanted to like this place and I kind of do...but as a Texan living in California, this was not to my taste buds' liking.  The concept is great...who doesn't like tacos?  But I got the  bacon burger, which was way too salty (and I normally like salty), the cuban pig probably would have been great, except for the gruyere cheese and the grain mustard blend (blech!) was not good.  I didn't even finish that taco. The tots were ehhh okay. Kind of messy and the spork was a bit of a pain to eat with...too much goat cheese, not enough bacon or avocado sauce. So why 4 stars? The customer service! The people are all so friendly! From the European girl who rang me up to the manager (I forgot his name)...they were so freaking nice.  Food can suck (sort of) but customer service is where it's at. Kudos to them for having that!"
"Delicious!  If you're not a fan of tots, their specialty tots covered with a sunny-side up egg and garnished with a little light cheese will make you one. I like to judge a taco joint by the quality of their ahi poke tacos.  The ahi poke taco at Velvet rivaled the one at my existing Chicago favorite, Big N Littles. The difference, however, is that Velvet's comes in a leaf of lettuce rather than a hard shell, which made me skeptical at first, but entirely satiated after my first bite.I would've given them 5 stars, but there was one minor issue after we placed our order.  After a long while, our order still wasn't ready.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity (I had just worked out and was famished), a manager explained that he had to re-send our tots back to the kitchen TWICE because they kept putting bacon on, despite our request to have them without. While he did then comp the tots, it left the ahi poke tacos sitting out for about ten minutes while that was straightened out.  When it comes to sushi grade ahi poke tacos, every minute counts.I shall return soon."
"I was planning a surprise birthday party for a group of 20-25 people, so I called ahead to see if they took reservations (they don't). Since they don't take reservations and seating was on a first come first serve basis, the manager told me to rest assure that there would be seats available since the place is two stories. He was correecttooo!! .. There was plenty of seating upstairs, so our whole group was able to be together! Yayy!! Since we had such a huge party, the staff members were nice enough to bring the iPad upstairs and take all our orders individually! The amazing service doesn't just stop there! They gave us quite a few complementary tator tots w/ eggs since we had such a huge party! AND they brought all of our food upstairs! Whoever served us that night, THANK YOU. you were amazing! The food was DELICIOUS!! The taco man would be proud. I had the steal flank taco and the tater tots with egg! The tator tots is a must try!!!! They also have this delicious hot sauce that I just can't get enough of! The red velvet cake was so-so. A little too sweet for my taste, but worth trying."
Delish.  I had the rotisserie chicken taco and the shredded pork taco on my first visit. I gobbled them up so fast that I can't give details but they were both delicious.  The tacos here are hearty so don't be discouraged by the prices. I had two and was pleasantly full. Service was really great here too. A nice young man delivered our food upstairs and came back to get our trash- not something I expect in a place like this but definitely appreciate. I can't wait to go back and try more tacos.
In a great part of town!!! The place is very modern counter service I ordered 4 tacos one was the special. The special was a cheeseburger pizza taco with a fried egg it was pretty wet. I really enjoyed the pork belly taco and the flank steak taco.  The pure can sugar spas was wonderful with the tacos I will be back.
Very trendy taco place with truly unique combinations of key ingredients. This is not your typical Mexican taco joint. I ordered three different tacos and was sort of overwhelmed by all of the flavors. If you are super hungry 3 or more tacos is good. If you just need a small normal lunch then 1-2 tacos is good. Great location and they have red velvet cake of course! I did not try it but it looked good.
"Chicken Tikka Tacos.  Om to the noms.And Rotisserie corn (elotes) are bomb as well.Not your traditional taco joint (they use flour tortillas, and their flavors are internationally inspired), but highly recommend a visit to this place.Fun fact, this is a Texas transplant, so it's gotta be good, amiright!?!"
"I recently moved to the neighborhood and occasionally wall past Velvet Taco. The name alone sounded intriguing, and several friends had advised the restaurant was unique and offered a vast selection. I went with a few friends last night. I had ordered the falafel, chicken tikka, and the tots. The falafel was different. It's served in a lettuce wrap, versus a tortilla. The concept is neat, but I have had better falafel. Wasn't bad, wasn't great. The chicken tikka was really good, very flavorful. The tots were also good, large enough to sharing with several people. I didn't break the yoke, which would have made the tots even better, but still an enjoyable meal."
"Delicious tacos with a wide variety of taste choices.  The Rotisserie Chicken, Spicy Chicken Tikka and Cuban Pig were our favorites.  The local colas are fantastic, too."
"Not your typical tacos; very unique as they incorporate a wide variety of flavors from different cultures. For the Gold Coast, this is by far the best and most affordable place to eat. I would recommend the chicken tikka taco  (best one) and the flank steak taco."
"In general I love taco bars and I have loved almost all the taco bars in Chicago but had never tried this one. Glad I did and points earned for quality, uniqueness of tacos and the margarita. Not expensive but a bit more than other places... So on the border of almost too much $$ but tacos here are a bit bigger so worth it.What makes them a bit different from other places and delicious are the unique choices of tacos..... Fried paneer and tikka chicken!!! If you like Indian flavored this is a cool spin and great to try. Brilliant!Was very excited for the shrimp and grits taco( who wouldn't be) but was a bit disappointed... Still very good. I just felt by frying both the grits and the shrimp it lost some potential flavor and ended up fried on fried ( still delicious) but a creamy cheesy grit layering the shell topped with the crispy spicy shrimp was what I envisioned. I couldn't really tell where the cheesy grits were since they were fried balls.Margaritas, delicious , strong and great value. $6.50!!Who ever put that comment on here before was spot on. Get a margarita.Look forward to going back and trying more... Thumbs up."
"So im glad to know this spot is open till 4am to get a decent taco late night downtown buttttt I wouldnt come here otherwise. I tried a few tacos the cuban, hamburger, chicken Tikka, pork belly and yes all were good but it was more of a meal on a tortilla than a taco. Just a different take on a taco. I def loved the elote delish n cheesy the tater tots were just ok. The margarita is for sure worth six bucks. I would def give this place a try but it jus wasnt as good as I thought. I think many of their tacos would taste better on the lettuce option than the tortilla."
"I wanted to like Velvet Taco. I really did. I was so excited to try out this place. When I finally did, I was unbelievably disappointed. The flank steak taco was extremely dry and tasted like rubber. The rotisserie chicken taco was tastier but the corn tortilla ripped the second I tried to hold it. So... Sorry Velvet Taco, you were disappointing. I really wanted you to be better."
The food here is delicious - particularly the chicken tikka burrito and the corn is a MUST! It also has the perfect casual vibe to it - that makes it just the right kind of 'dinner joint'. Perfect for any occasion.
"the tacos here are so good! really unique flavors (my favourite is the chicken tikka) and the WTF (taco feature) is always so good.I get takeout from here at least once a week (except when they first opened this winter, it was much more lol). it's a great place to stop for a quick bite and as they get more popular, I use the online ordering - expect a wait if you walk in and order to-go."
"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Chicken tikka is to die for."
"Easily the best taco joint in Chicago. I am going to miss it when I move to the Bay Area next month. Their fish and chips taco, shrimp and grits taco, and chicken tikka taco are really delicious. Parking is a little painful given that it's in the Gold Coast and the price is a bit steep, however it's well worth it"
"Well, we went back and was really hoping for a better experience.  This is especially true because I love the Velvet Taco premise and want then to succeed.This time, rather than phoning it in, we were walking with our 5 year old daughter to the bookstore and decided to eat there.  My wife noticed a tremendous improvement with the quality of the interactions we had with the staff.  They were all very friendly and helpful as they assisted us with finding something for our finicky 5 year old - who ended up just getting some chicken strips in a tortilla.So, +1 for the improved customer service.  Allrighty!  We're off to a good start.The tacos arrived, but wait...where were the tots?  The tacos were served a good 5 minutes before the order of tots.  I know it seems like a little thing, but we like to all eat together and the tots were my snack while my wife had the tacos.In my previous review, I commented about what I felt were inferior pork preparation or products.  They were very dry and I did not enjoy the Cuban or pork belly taco nearly as much as I should have.  Well, I'm here to tell you that this experience was much better.  I had a bit of the Cuban taco that my wife ordered and it was excellent!  The pork was succulent and the bite definitely reminded me of the revered sandwich sharing the same name. +1 for the improved Cuban Taco!The tots were exactly what I remembered - very, very good and perfect for the chilly day... at least it was once it arrived.The fish n' chips taco, however was the velvet Achilles' heel.  Mushy and bland were the words I heard.  Indeed, as I pilfered a morsel, I could not have explained it any better.  It looked great, but had gone soft as it waited to be devoured - or so I assume.  In any event, it was under seasoned.  -1 for the fish n' chipper.I so wish I could give another star. My experience so far is improving service but inconsistent food - except for the tots. They're always yummy."
"..................................................­..................................................­................... That's me being speechless about how absolutely amazing their tacos are. I had two steak tacos and tatter tots. The flank steak was unreal, tender, juicy, perfectly cooked. And don't even get me started on the tots. I didn't know what to expect. I was completely caught off guard. A giant mound of tots and bacon topped with a fried egg. I'm pretty sure they invented some type of new flavor. There's something in them that I've never tasted in my life. Overall, I would recommend Velvet Taco to everyone. Death row inmates will be ordering this for their final meal."
"Delicious tacos. I live in the neighborhood so I have tried around half the tacos on the menu. My personal faves are the chicken tikka masala, Cuban, and the ahi. The Cuban has a lot of meat on it and 1 out of the four times I've had it, it turned out a little dry. I think it just needed a little more mustard that time. The chicken tikka masala has amazing texture and flavor. The pepper sauce that they put on it gives a great heat that is countered by the raita. If you find it a little spicy, I would ask for an extra side of raita.The Ahi is just delicious. I had it for the first time last night. It has a wonderful balance of flavor including a little bit of red chili that brings everything together. If you are on the fence about whether you are hungry enough for three, make this your third. It is lighter since it is fish and on a lettuce wrap.Both the tots and the elote are really good too. I had never had elote before this, and even my dad loved it! Every now and then, the wait gets a little long because I think they are still working on their processes and training, but it has improved a little every time I stop in. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the tacos on the menu!"
"Heeellllllll yaaaaaaa. Here on vacation, a friend recommended and I was not disappointed. I got the fish n chips & the rotisserie chicken. Both were awesome, the fish was my favorite. The curry mayo on the fish taco was good af. Cool place, nice employees and I didn't have to wait long which is always a bonus."
"The fish and chicken tacos are great, but don't waste your time with the pork.  These tacos are huge but sometimes less is more. All I all, a cool place but there are certainly better options for a taco in Chicago."
"I'm originally from Dallas and was ECSTATIC when I learned Velvet Taco was coming to Chicago.  And not only did it come to Chicago - it came across the street from me! This neighborhood is full of great restaurants, however it's lacking in faster food options.  I was getting tired of going to Chipotle every time I needed a quick and tasty bite to eat.Enter Velvet Taco...wow.  I am going to go ahead and tell you to ignore the other reviews that are less than 4 stars, because this location JUST opened and they are still training and learning, but boy is the food still good.  They have missed an ingredient here or there a couple of times, but once again people...THEY JUST OPENED...give them a break.I love the food, atmosphere, the hipster music, and most especially the drink options. They have fountain soda machines with locally brewed CRAFT SODSAS that use real pure cane sugar.  So delicious.  All the sodas I've tried are amazing, with my favorite being the Frostie since I'm sort of a root beer enthusiast (yes, I'm 5 yrs old at heart).The Buffalo Chicken taco and the Chicken Tikka Masala taco are amazing (although on the spicier end, so be ware if you aren't into that.  I'm REALLY into that).  I always get the elote (side of roasted corn) because I'm from Texas and it reminds me of home.  The red velvet cake here is famous too and to die for, but its pretty heavy (you can pour condensed milk on top) so I get it only when I'm really in the mood).  I miss a couple of the options from the Dallas location menu - i.e., the fried oyster taco, but hopefully this menu will add that option too.They have upstairs seating too, with great view for people watching in the Viagra Triangle.  (The stairs are steep and the floors are little bit slick up there so just be careful - I feel bad for the servers who have to keep going up and down).I think I've gone here 3 times this week already and I could still go 3 times more!!!!!!!"
"the good: I looove velvet taco in dallas, so I was pumped when they opened here! The food is really, really good and I love all the different flavors in every taco. the #3 is the best! Food is 5 starsthe bad:  I went in, ordered my tacos and a margarita, and when the guy behind the counter got my marg order, he says says ""fuck"" like I just ordered 30 and slid it across the counter to me with a ""here"" like DAMN sorry for being a customer. Its one margarita that he had to pour out! If he had to cut every lime while I watched I would understand being pissed but geez. So I'm like okay, well that guy sucks but at least my tacos are going to be awesome. So I go sit down and a woman brings me tacos that aren't what I ordered... So I say ""oh those aren't the ones I ordered"" and she tells me they are. And I say no, I ordered a #2 and #3...and she tells me that this is what she brought me. So finally I read her the dang description on the menu and she says ""oh you're right"" and walks away. Really? I'll definitely be back because the food is awesome but like come on."
Place is amazing.  I had the buffalo chicken and the spicy shrimp and they were both awesome.  The tater tots are unique and really good too.  It's fairly priced given the great location and is pretty quick on service.  You'll want to try this place out.
"I love small taco joints, makes it feel more authentic and Velvet Taco made me feel like I was back in Cabo wondering through the streets looking for the best taco. I like the construction of the menu and how every taco gets a number, makes it easy to order and navigate all the different tacos. I'm a big fan of brunch so the brunch/egg tacos were a must-try. Boy did they not disappoint. I loved the construction of the tacos. The frittata is sized perfectly to fit just inside the flour tortilla. The egg actually kind of turns into a second tortilla that holds everything together, reminding me of the double decker taco I used to get at Taco Bell (which by the way I hope you never go to again when you got tacos like these available). #19 was my favorite. Bacon, egg frittata, crispy tots, chili butter, smoked cheddar, ranchero sauce, micro greens all inside the soft flour tortilla. I've never had tots on a taco before but wow it made it so good, it's my new favorite thing. And micro greens? Talk about gourmet and at only $3.25 #19 is a great value. #20 was good as well- roast pork, egg, charred tomato-poblano salsa, queso blanco, chili powder, cilantro. Sauce was more runny on this one so be prepared to eat this one with the standard 90° head tilt, making sure to catch the drippings on the wrapper. What an enjoyable meal for $6.50. If I had it my way I'd do a Velvet Taco menu challenge and do all 20 tacos, 2 sides and red velvet cake in one sitting. That would be awesome since everything sounds so good. If you're craving a taco, skip the cheap fast food and get the best, Velvet Taco all the way. Check out the brunch taco picture I posted to see what they look like."
"The place was packed at 8:30 on a Tuesday night and I was told that's pretty typical. The wait was a bit long (35 minutes-ish), so do yourself a favor and order a delicious margarita to enjoy while you're waiting. They might come from a machine, but they're fantastic! I got a #8 (shredded pork) and #11 (grilled flank steak) and both were wonderful. The pork taco was bursting with flavor and got a nice touch of sweetness from the pineapple. The steak taco was cooked well and the queso added a nice gooey touch. I would actually rank this place a 4.5, taking off half a star for the length of time it took to get the take at order, but if you've got the time to sit and enjoy in house, it would be a 5 star experience! *edited for typos."
"After a long anticipated wait, I finally got to try Velvet Taco this weekend. My boyfriend and I each ordered three tacos along with the corn appetizer. I enjoyed my rotisserie chicken and flank steak tacos, but the shredded pork taco had a flavor to it that I didn't quite like. My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about his chicken tikka taco. He also gave good reviews to his calamari and bacon burger tacos. The corn appetizer was gone in minutes!! Aside from one disappointing taco and a slightly more pricey dinner than we would have liked, Velvet Taco was a hit. I look forward to returning and sampling some of their other menu items."
"The first time I went here right after it opened I would absolutely have given 5 stars. I loved the paneer masala taco and the elote and tater tots with fried egg, guac, and bacon. I had the pulled pork taco too but it was just ok. When I returned, the quality of my food wasn't great. The paneer masala was way too spicy (probably twice as spicy as the tiny i loved it) and the sauce was runny. The Cuban taco was pretty boring - tasted like a Cuban wrap. I don't recommend that one.I'm going to wait a month or two before I try again. I really want the tacos to be better again because the sides are incredible."
"I want more tacos!  I had the Cuban and the Steak taco.  I'd be back for a dozen of the steak tacos...oh so good.  The cuban was also tasty, but if you're in the mood for tacos - this is more like a sammy.  I also got the tots!  Mysterious goodness; spicy, bacon-ey, cheesy.  Plus I hiked the mile home in 20 degree weather and they were still warm when I got home!  I'll be back.  Some people were enjoying  a margarita, looked good; I want one."
"Went here with a friend for tacos and margaritas. I ordered the chicken tikka and wow it was brilliant-- I was skeptical about how they'd pull it off but ended up LOVING it. Frozen margaritas are worth it too but we just found it so weird that they didn't have any chips and guac/ salsa. That's like a Mexican restaurant staple but other than that, worth checking out!"
"By far one of the best taco places in the city. Their taco selection is absolutely amazing and unique. The buffalo chicken taco was so delicious. I will be going back, so Velvet Taco have one of everything ready for me."
"This place rocks! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the tacos. And oh-my-gosh, the tater tots!!!! Sooooo good. The fried egg, the bacon, the cheese....all so good. The red velvet cake was amazing too. I am super happy this place is just down the block from me. Their staff are pretty awesome also. I even got a heart drizzled on my cake. 5 stars and I will be back."
"This . Was. Awesome.  Walked by and between the smell of Delicious tacos and the draw of the smiling crowd I was hooked!Greeted by a wonderful staff and then was lead on my journey to taco heaven.Decided to go with 2 of the 3 fish tacos they offer, a interesting spin on the gyro (instead of gyro meat it was calamari!) and a class beer battered fish and chips taco. Both tasted amazing!! I got them to go and couldn't wait, so ended up finishing them on the walk back!Will 100% be back to check out the other tacos and their Margaritas!"
"I'm a big fan. As a resident of this neighborhood for the past 5 years, we desperately needed a fast casual concept outside of the sh!tty chain restaurants currently here. Although Velvet Taco is a chain, it doesn't feel like it at all.The beer selection is excellent, the menu is extremely innovative and the tacos I had were very flavorful. Very friendly staff, clean place. I will be coming often! Well done to the opening team here."
"New taco place in the Gold Coast! The staff is extremely friendly, the menu is amazing and everything is made in house including their margaritas and salsa! Officially addicted!"
"Fresh, Fast, and Friendly!Velvet Taco is a great new addition to the Rush Street Area. Sure, the name is rather groan-worthy puerile, but once you get past that offense, you're in for a real treat.A simple and straightforward wall menu clearly lays out the selections, orders are placed fast food style, and if dining in, you receive a small numbered placard with your order, and your food is brought out to you.At this first visit, of which I believe there will be many, I sampled the vegetarian Fried Paneer taco, and the Fish n' Chips taco. Both were marvelous, amply built with fresh tasting ingredients and an excellent blend of seasonings. For a side I had the Rotisserie Corn, done ""elote style"" with queso fresco, asadero cheese, Valentine hot sauce, crema, and fresh lime. This was a complete WOW! Delicious - and there's no having to chew on a cob as the corn has been removed for you.Of note, there is a nice selection of Mexican beers and margaritas available, and additional seating upstairs.Additionally, the staff was engaging and upbeat, making for an overall pleasant experience.Highly Recommended!"
"This place is INCREDIBLE. Wide array of ""not your standard taco"" - definitely an awesome and affordable spot. They also don't skimp you on the taco fillings, they must have put half a pound of ahi poke in my poke taco! Great vibe too - snag a seat upstairs looking out over the street with huge open windows."
Wow.  Read the reviews and felt obligated to try a variety of things. The Buffalo Chicken taco was our favorite. The Chicken Tikka was a close second. The Grilled Flank Steak was good but way out done by the others. The corn gets two thumbs up. The tots were good but you have to like the egg on top. The margaritas are big and delicious. The red velvet cake with the homemade caramel sauce?  OMG. Enjoy!
Cool and trendy place to eat some tacos!!! The beef taco is my favorite and I like the bottle water because it packed like vodka!!
"Underwhelmed - spicy tikka chicken was phenomenal (so much flavor and super filling), but the Annatto shredded pork and bacon egg frittata I could have done without. The latter two came in corn tortillas, which I was not a fan of! Dry and fell apart after the first bite. Pork was bland and couldn't taste the avocado cream or the queso. Bacon and eggs - egg tasted like I was dining at McDonald's. Best part were the tater tots inside, but you can't go wrong with fried tater tots. Overall, disappointed by my experience."
Best meal we had all week while in Chicago.  Heard great things about chef Franke and glad we went.  Very diverse but simple menu. All sauces and ingredients were fresh or made right there and red velvet cake with carmel sauce is addictive.  Close to our hotel in the near north side and a few blocks from the best of the gold coast shops.  This would be a winner after last call.  Recommend trying the bacon cheese burger and ahi poke tacos with the tots.  Hope they open one in Portland soon.
Incredible eclectic tacos! Very different than anything else offered in the Gold Coast! Staff is extremely friendly and efficient. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend this place for a either a quick snack or a full meal.
"There is not one reason I can give this place less than 5 stars. Great pricing. Amazing tater tots and cheese corn to start with. And a variety of fusion tacos, I tried the paneer tikka and falafel , which was amazing and my boy friend says the chicken tikka taco was spicy and very close to an Indian tikka. And the best part is the red velvet cake at the end topped with caramel. Just perfect !"
"Falafel taco was good. Not super heavy or salty like some of the other tacos I tried here. Good combination of veggies, dressing and falafel. Spicy tikka chicken was probably my favorite.  The rice evened out the spiciness and tang. Buffalo chicken taco was a little too much on the salty side for me.  Rotisserie corn was great, but I've had better from street vendors in Chicago."
"I like velvet taco, liked it more once I accepted it for what it is. Unique selection of sandwiches that just happen to be on a tortilla or sometimes lettuce wrap.  First  going in I think I was looking for a more authentic mexican taco.  Not here. But you do get a great variety of things which you wouldn't normally get at a taco joint. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The place is clean, haven't gone upstairs yet. It's a bit pricey, but it's the most convenient food late night in my opinion in the gold coast. Here's my taco breakdown:Steak- Good, not tons of meat, but tastyFalafel - Recommended by staff, I thought was not good at all.  Mushy and falvorlessChicken Tikka - Tasty, lots of some type of sauce on itRotisserie Chicken - Good, but dry, you need to add some hot sauce to itAhi Tuna - Not a big fan, maybe I was thrown by the lettuce wrapCuban- Good, maybe a little too much spicy mustard, didn't taste much of the hamPulled Pork- Top fave, didn't knock my socks off, but pretty good. About $4-$6 for a taco"
"There's been sort of a trend going on with tacos lately and I must say this one is on top of my list of taco places. They have so many different ones to try whether your looking for a vegetarian option, steak, fish, and their chicken ones are amazing! My fav is the chicken tikka and paneer which are cubes of cheese basically. The sauces and flavors are just really great too. I also recommend the corn that they have as one of the side options. It's open late too and whatever time you go the food is amazing. I've gone for lunch and even a night out at 2 am. Def hits the spot!"
"Was wandering around Chicago looking for a taco place (normal behavior) and it's safe to say I hit the jackpot. I don't eat meat other than fish and they had lots of vegetarian options. The tots were BOMB, the goat cheese topping especially  also had the falafel taco- life changing. The ahi tuna taco was good too it was pretty much a sushi taco  great atmosphere too. The only thing that would make this place better is VEGAN options  everything had some kind of dairy in it."
Very good food! My favorite was the chicken tikka masala. Cool and trendy place to eat tacos!
"Chicken tikka is the bomb! shrimp & grits, fish n chips and rotisserie chicken can't go wrong!"
I had a lot of time to kill. Filled it with these delicious tacos. Try the egg and bacon or the #2
The tacos are soo good! I love that they have such an array of flavors and options. Even have that red velvet cake that is to die for! So glad they are my neighbors in the Gold Coast. If you get the tator tots get extra goat cheese and the elote corn dish is perfect.
"Wow, great service (thanks Ariana), the food is unlike anything I've ever had (fresh, creative, healthy, delicious), cool atmosphere (seating, music, view), and it's affordable. So glad something like this is in my neighborhood."
"Met up here with some friends for dinner - great decision!  The tacos are delicious, lots of different flavors to check out!  I tried the tikka chicken and fish & chips, both were really good choices.  The tikka chicken definitely lived up to the name - pretty spicy, so fair warning!  The fish & chips was great - battered fish with this delicious curry mayo on top!  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"
