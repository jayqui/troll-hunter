The Betty
"It's all about the drinks and ambiance here. The interior decor resembles a posh library and offers a romantic, classy, and inviting mood.  Drinks: Coffee + Cigarettes (definitely get your money's worth). Drink is strong as hell, but easy to sip on. The other one that i tried was Life During War Time - super refreshing but could feel the alcohol creep up. Food: grilled squid (GREAT!) Loved the acidic coating and tasted Chinese? Not that it's a bad thing, just didn't expect it to taste Chinese. Cauliflower and buttered noodles with clams were just okay. I think they forgot to rinse the clams b/c they were packed with sand...we couldn't eat them.I would return in a heart beat for their drinks, given The Betty is only a 7 min walk from my apt, but would skip the food. Food wasn't bad, but nothing to rave about and selection is limited.Warning: slow service on bringing food out. Each dish took about 15 minutes to come out and the place was only 20% full."
"Spent 11 minutes tonite sitting at the right end of the bar inside The Betty with nary a bartender or a server bothering to acknowledge my presence or take an order. After staring in the direction of the bartenders for a few minutes (mind you: at 9:45 on a Friday night, it was pretty quiet at the bar so I'm pretty sure the two guys back there saw me), and then sitting with my hands clasped for a while to no avail, I walked out, but not before voicing my displeasure to the hostess.Chicago's a big place so I shouldn't have too much trouble finding someone to take my money, but this was the strangest experience I have had at a bar since moving here three years ago. Parts bad service, part racist (what can I tell you, watching other white customers get served while I sat and waited was a bit appalling), and part wacko? No need to come back."
"3.5 stars.  Not a bad place, not an amazing one.  It just sort of perfectly fits into that ok category.  The plates were good, octopus a bit tough and a bit too much kale in the dish.  Really nothing was bad...server did enter the wrong order but came out and told us right away.  We didn't even notice and were fine sitting outside for a while.  It's a tighter squeeze outside but hey what place with outdoor seating isn't?It's just fine really.  The decor inside is great but the it's not likely a place I would seek to go out of my way.  One note is that we did not try any drinks so cannot comment there."
"If you are into the whole lumber sexual craze, then come drink at the Betty. It must be a pre-requisite to have a full grown beard in every fashion to work here....because these beards are legit. The feel of the Betty is very 1976 chic upscale moose lodge. Does that make sense? Not really - but you will see what I mean upon arrival. It's packed with old records, cool booths, peacocks, and a serious bar! The drink menu is pretty gin heavy so if that's also your thing, then the Betty is for you.Being anything BUT a gin gal...I was happy to find a whiskey drink. The coffee + cigarettes was right up my alley. And not to mention, after just one I was feelin no pain;) my girlfriend went with the maximillion which was an unsuspecting light and delicious tequila cocktail. Both were perfect!We didn't eat at the Betty this time but judging from the unique and tasty cocktails, I could imagine their food being just as pleasing. The Betty is uber cool...I highly suggest it for good dranks and chill vibes."
"Got a hot date and don't know where to take her (....or him)? Ponder no more!The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. It has an industrial and antique feel to it. I love the library-like decor on the back wall. The lighting is dim, where the source is predominantly from small candles and lamps. If you're taking someone with you who looks better in the dark than in bright lights, look no further. This is THE spot for it (but you have to come when it's dark outside).If you're going as a group like us, try to opt for the light-colored lounge chairs on the back side of the wall instead of the high chairs/table. They're more comfy!I didn't order any drinks because I was going to be driving back to the suburbs afterward (I know, lame). Maybe that makes my review not even legit??? Buttttt, I did try out one of their desserts, which turned out to be delicious! I ordered the mini pie, which varies in selection by the day. The one I chose was chocolate malt. It was a little cool, soooo incredibly smooth and creamy on the inside and had just the right amount of sweetness. It's a small dessert that I can personally gobble up in two big bites, but you're better off taking small bites and savoring the flavor.The service was good. Our server was very attentive and wasn't overbearing but came at the right times. My water was refilled in a timely manner.Would recommend!"
Great vibe. The gimlets were the bomb. Friendly knowledgeable wait staff. Cool retro furnishings .
"I am torn on this review...its like a 3.5So I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the space.  Its like library meets bar, meets restaurant, meets lounge.  Reminds me of ""The Office"" but much easier to get into.  The chairs comfortable and the space just seemed rich.  LOVE...or as the young folk would say...its so fleek.They recently are allowing reservations but they must only have a few available online because they had none on the website, but when I called, it was no problem.  I hate having to call for a reservation...but I really wanted to check out this place.  I also suffer from FOMO.  heheheThe host staff...I have to say...I love them.  They make you feel the vibe and they make you feel like you are important.  We had a few people that looked like they were important come check on us...which was nice.  Ha.The service was spotty.  Server was nice...but just kind of absent and then all over us.  It was weird.  Like no drink refills for awhile and then trying to take full drinks away.  The tables are tiny...so I understand the need to feel like clearing the plates, drinks, water, etc...but when you have a table of 4 girls...we like to pick and talk and sip and pick.  I thought the coursing out of the meal was meh and the order of things was also odd.  This is how it was laid out.Flatbread-surprisingly delish and HUGE!  I loved the spice in the sausage.  It was perfectFried Cauliflower-people are raving...I thought it was good...but not the best dish.Croquettes-not impressed.  Not much flavor at all.Cheese board-extremely unimpressed.  It just didnt go together.Squid Salad-YUM!  It was the perfect dish.  Crisp and light.  Tikka Masala-great flavor...I wasnt a fan of the messiness of the dish.  Bones, etc.  I also didnt see any chicharones...maybe they were hidden?I know its just getting started so I think it will work out all the kinks and be fantastic.  Its just not there yet."
"I went here Thursday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The space is big and then I figured out I had been there in my clubby days when it was Lumens. What a difference a remodel makes. I didn't like the original table they had us sitting at cause it had a big pillar blocking you from the other half of the table. After we requested to sit somewhere else they moved us to the big circle area at the end of the bar and it was perfect! To eat I ordered the lamb flat bread and it was a little spicy, which I liked. I went with the Maxamillion for my drink, it's tequila based and sweet. To celebrate the bday girl I ordered the chocolate mini pie and the keylime one. In my opinion both were just okay.The thing I probably noticed besides the cute interior was the wonderful service. Our waiter was awesome! Very attentive and helpful. I have The Betty on my list of places to come back to and visit."
"Betty?  Is that your name?  Well it fits you perfectly as this bar has an old fashioned vibe just like the moniker it has.Based in the old Lumen space, trust me, there is nothing here to remind you of that contemporary offering.  For once you push past the heavy green curtain, you'll find yourself in a huge space with plenty of little places to mix and gather.  At one end, library books fill the shelves.  On another is the bar stretching across the length of the room.  And across the front are windows looking out onto the street.  And all the dark wood makes the place feel vintage although the cool light fixtures will have you thinking otherwise.We were a group of 6 and were seated in a comfy hightop booth right behind the hostess stand.  And speaking of the hostess, this place has a gem of a hostess.  I think her name was Kiera (?) and she made our night from welcoming us to the place, taking our coats and hanging them on hooks nearby, and pretty much welcoming us into ""her space"" like it was her own home.  If this was our first impression of how the night was going to go, we knew we were in for a good time.The food is all shareable and share is what we did.  We ordered a wide range of the menu from the cheese plate, to fried cauliflower, to croquettes, to the Tika Masala, to the pasta with beef ragout, and the squid salad.  All were good although the croquettes and pasta were probably the favorites.  And if that wasn't enough, we ordered one of each of the 3 desserts and all were terrific although my favorite was the pistachio cupcake.And let's not forget the drinks.  For you gin drinkers out there, this is a gin paradise.  They even do a customizable gin and tonic that you can do at the table.  If vodka is your thing, as is mine, there is a limited selection of vodka but they do a nice job in making speciality cocktails with it.  And go with the server's reccos on the cocktail list and you won't be disappointed!I also liked that the manager came over to welcome us to the bar and made sure that we had everything that we wanted.If you drive, there is valet parking out front that will run you about $14.  Also know that after 8pm there is an 18 and older rule.Check out the Betty.  She's as cool as her name suggests in that simple, old school sort of way!"
Great drinks especially gin drinks. Hot vibe. Cool music. Nice small plates....sometimes not so small.Sandy loves the flatbread....serves at least 2.Great attentive service.Cooler than cool.Have fun here.
"Okay, wow.We went to The Betty to celebrate my new job offer because we didn't want to go very far (we live in Hyde Park). Long story short The Betty is my new go-to. I can guarantee I'm going to be a regular here for multiple reasons.We arrived and came first to a curtained entry way and put our name on the wait list. We were told it would be about 30-40 minutes; It was a Saturday night so we expected it to be packed. The host suggested we run over to The Publican for a drink, which we thought was a fabulous idea, loving The Publican as well. Within 15 minutes, I got a text that they could seat us. We headed over and got to go **behind the curtain.**It was awesome. Totally 1920s speakeasy full of hip but unpretentious people and comfy seats and tables that make it great for dinner, drinks, groups, or dates. It's loud enough to feel private but we could still hear each other talk!!! That is such a rarity and seriously a major plus on our list.We didn't end up eating but I got to start the Maximillion. But when I saw my boyfriends's DIY Gin & Tonic, I knew I had to get that next. They bring you a platter with fancy tonic and gin in a beaker and little bottles with rubber droppers so you can add your own add-ins. Seriously, too much fun.This place was seriously my favorite bar EVER. I can't wait to go back."
"Had a girls night out to celebrate one of my bestie's b-day.  I picked The Betty based on their reviews and wanting to try some place new in the West Loop.  The drinks were great, the menu consists of small plates and large plates, and very limited.  We ordered the small plates so that we could try a little bit of everything.  We ordered the fried cauliflower, which had a very interesting flavor, the squid salad, and the lamb flatbread.  All were great and enough to share amongst us all.  The ambiance was nice, beautiful bar.  The service was a little slow but overall a great experience."
"I went back for a girls night out and we ordered food this time. Our birthday girl did a nice job selecting some yummy bites and had our server pace them throughout the night so we were never stuffed and were still able to make it out after dinner for drinks. The food was all quite good, but I would think of this place as more of a place for drinks with food - rather than a place for food with drinks. Make sense? That's what is driving my 5 stars, I'm not sure I'd give this a 5 star rating on the basis of food. It was good, but not 5 star good.I will definitely be back!"
"We went last night for a round of cocktails and tried some food too. The ambience is romantic and intimate and takes you back in time.  Sadly, nothing that we ordered stood out and I was disappointed with my cocktail as well as the appetizers. I got the Coffee & Cigarette, and the sweet vermouth ruined the drink for me since that's all I could taste. Had it not had Vermouth, or had very little of it, may have resulted in a more balanced drink. For food we tried the Chicken & Ham croquettes and the Lamb Flatbread. For $17, I was expecting more from the flatbread! Between a spicy sauce and a yogurt sauce, I couldn't really taste any other flavors. I was able to check the box since The Betty is new to the West Loop/Fulton Market scene but I don't see the need to return for over priced sub par food and cocktails."
"Husband and I grabbed a drink here while we were waiting for our table at The Publican next door. Holy hipster haven. I actually really like hipster-y things (sue me) and I really liked the ambiance. They were playing cool music and everyone we encountered was very friendly and nice.I loved the drink I had, Maximillion. It tasted like a cinnamon red hot. What I didn't like was the price: $13 per drink. Tastes like burning.I did see that they offered mini pies on their menu. Sometimes a bitch gotta put her beef aside and have a mini pie."
"I've been here twice now and I think The Betty is both a great spot and nice addition to the area. It's the perfect place to get some snacks and drinks, kill some time before a dinner reservation, celebrate something, or for some classier group drinking.On my first visit, I had a few rounds of the Coffee & Cigarettes (their Old Fashioned/Manhattan hybrid) which was smooth and well balanced. I also tried sips of many of the other cocktails (the names of which are lost on me) but all were very good. Not overly sweet and a good level of booziness.On the second visit, I stuck with the sparkling Vouvray they had, which was exceptionally good. Much better than I expected. I've had a fair share of champagnes/sparkling wines and I ended up having 3 and writing down the name to get some at Binny's. I also tried a sip of my girlfriend's ""A Cobbler"" - a sherry based cocktail. And it was really tasty. Dangerous on a warm day. We also tried the pierogi's and herbed cheese spread. Both were good. Didn't blow my socks off, but a nice hold-over until dinner elsewhere.Not a place I would go for a meal, but I will definitely be back."
"Accidentally ran into this place after an evening at Moto.  Thought we were peaking into Publican.  Turns out, its BETTER than publican.  A busy bar with lots of different areas of seating.  There can be a line, but it also means, the place is not so busy you can't get a drink and you can enjoy the people you are with.   Good drink list.  Ok beer list.  Bartenders are SUPER knowledgeable so they can make anything to your liking.  Will go back."
"Met a friend for happy hour and loved everything about The Betty! We came at 6:30 on a Thursday with no reservations and were seated right away. In fact, throughout my evening there, there were tables open. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely busy and ""happening"" but easy to get a seat with no reservation. The hostess and server were both very friendly and helpful. Cocktails can be hit or miss, but I loved what the server suggested. So much so that I got the same one twice. It was the Alfonso, which had my perfect balance of sparkling and not sweet. The space is much larger than I thought it would be. I'd say it's twice as big as the ""loungey"" vibe I was imagining. Love that there are plenty of hooks to hang coats/bags throughout and next to tables. The vibe and seating definitely lends itself to a first date spot if that's what you're looking for.  Looking forward to coming back again for drinks AND to try out the dinner menu!"
PERFECT - Romantic and Trendy restaurant with a Creative Vibe with the best bartenders. Small plates menu that has interesting flavors. A huge bar area and dining area. No reservations- but it's not difficult to get seats. If you appreciate mixology- then I strongly recommend Betty. I have tried 5 different cocktails on and off the menu and being a Mojito Snob I know that it was perfectly crafted. This is on 3 different occasions- twice for late weekend nights and once for happy hour. Forget that though- come anytime! They are rockstars are getting you a table no matter what time you come in and work fast. I love the vintage decor with books and pieces on shelves. I love the fried cauliflower- it's probably the BEST way to eat a cauliflower and the flatbread was perfect to share! I will always get the flatbread on every visit.
"Their food is salty AF.  The water glasses that they use are not nearly as big enough as they need to be for the way they spice and over-salt the food.  We started off with the croquettes and I thought that they were salty because croquettes are salty by nature, but then every dish thereafter was the same.  The atmosphere was trying a little too hard with dim lighting and 1950's-esque ambience.  There are plenty of other better options on Randolph and the surrounding area."
I absolutely love this place! The decor consists of a lot of candles and low lit lights. It's rustic and classy. The cocktails are on point visually as well as taste. The pineapple upside cake dessert is delish! I could definitely see this being my new drink spot.
"The food at this place can best be described as soggy. We're so disappointed. Endive was soaked in dressing/sauce. Octopus was abnormally chewy on a bed of warmed, soaked kale: it was the worst dish we had.  The spaghetti was also drowning in a clam sauce. No finesse on anything. Flavor combos made no sense: octopus had stewed tomato with wet kale. Spaghetti had olive with clams, or Endive had pear with a weird balsamic?? Server was very positive, but there's no way you really think all these small plates are actually good. Guess we ordered the wrong stuff, gross!"
"Cozy and intimate setting with some easy listening type of records, low lighting and Antique decor. Nice place to relax with a small group for some fancy drinks."
"Our server literally quit her job on the spot over another table. Awkward.Decor feels  forced, and overengineered.$25 for two well-liquor drinks is pretty dumb. But hey it's the West Loop, people love this spot."
Great for drinks and apps and will definitely be back. Wanted to stay all night!Amazing atmosphere to catch up with friends.
"I visited The Betty for the first time over the weekend to meet up with friends for a birthday.We arrived around 8:30 and the place was already packed.  We needed a table for four but only two of us were in attendance.  The staff placed us at a table to 'hold' a spot while they looked for another one.  I initially thought they'd just put us there forever, but the hostess did come back twice to give us updates and was able to move us to the more 'fun' part of the room (we were originally near the door and it was really cold and away from the more bustling part of the restaurant/bar).  In any case, we were served drinks at our original table and the staff nicely moved us and our tab to the new table, which was nice of them (and without a hint of complaint even though our servers changed - and actually all of them helped us at the new spot).I enjoyed the atmosphere.  it's dark, but not impossible to see and there are different areas.  The middle part is sort of an area with high tables near the real part of the bar.  Then there are lower tables ringing this part along the windows in front as well as around toward the bathrooms.  Then, there's an additional back part that has couches and comfy chairs.  All in all, plenty of spots to sit.  However, it does skew more restaurant than bar.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not as most of what I've read about it is that it's a bar...but apparently their food is tasty as I saw plenty of people eating it.  I did like that on the menu, there are cute little dessert items for $1 each if you want!So..on to drinks.  There are plenty of cocktails and even a gin and tonic that you mix yourself with a variety of items.  I didn't try this, but the guy at the table next to us had two of them, and we finally asked what he was drinking.  He said it was delicious and fun to mix them up.I tried some wine, which I thought was good, though their wine list does skew more unique than others.  I didn't like one of the wines I had a sip of at the end of the night when they ran out of the one I had tried earlier.  It wasn't bad, just not to my taste.  I think if you're willing to ask questions about the wines and/or know your various wine regions of the world, you'll be fine with this list, but don't expect it to be an easy read (i.e., Greek wines, Croatian wines, etc - all very good, just not as easy to know taste if you're not familiar).  I personally love to try new wines, and have tried some interesting ones before, so I enjoyed this.Service as alluded to already was great.  Friendly, attentive and was definitely there when you needed them.All in all, a good spot, but I will say that it is a bit more expensive than I expected (I guess I expected more of a broad range of prices - which didn't really exist).   However, wine pours are nicely sized and the cocktails are also generous, so it's not like one of those spots that charges a lot for a sip of something.  It's right next door to the Publican, so I expect they get a lot of pre or post dinner visitors.  Definitely worth a visit, but be prepared to wait if crowded.  Atmosphere - 5Value - 4Drinks - 5Bathrooms - 4 (and interesting/odd barber chair outside of the bathrooms makes for a good photo op)Service - 5"
"Vegans beware! This bad review is 100% based on the waitress. The ambiance was nice and drinks were good... Once I received a vegan drink. I asked the waitress if the wine was vegan. She said, ""Yes, I am absolutely certain they are vegan."" I ask again becuse most people do not know most red wine is Not vegan. She assures me again (she says she works at a winery), so I ordered it. After I drank it; I decided to check and its NOT vegan per barnivore."
"Iiiiii dunno what happened here.  Like many people, I'm sure, the sweets and I walked in here as The Publican doesn't have a bar to sit at while awaiting the remainder of your dinner party.We thought, and maybe it's because we don't visit places in this area much at all, if once a year at best, so we don't know the uh, protocol, but we thought ya know, just walk up to the bar, grab a drink, hang out and wait, ya know, like you do.  Ya know, normal.Nope.  The hostess chased us all the way down and ushered us to a table.  She seemed irritated with us for our apparent faux pas, tsk tsk'ed us a bit, grilled us on our intentions then walked away.Ok.  That was odd.  We order a round of wine, service was overly attentive, drinks took forever.Hostess comes back, grills us again about something and admonishes.  Ok, this is getting weird, we say to each other.The remainder of our dinner party arrives, the hostess corralling them to our allocated area, tells them we need to stay very close to the table, herding them with her arms, or move to another, larger table.  Everyone in the party now feels weird by her strange behavior, so we move to a larger table.Everyone orders a beverage, my sweet asked for another.  Drinks again took forever, service fell off drastically, the server forgot my sweet's wine.  Two minutes on the nose prior to our dinner reservation next door, the hostess comes back and asks us if we're leaving, do we want the check, do we want the check, are you leaving now, oh but I'm not trying to rush you out, I'll go get your check though.We all look at each other like, huh?  What the heck is going on?  I guess we're leaving.  Why is the hostess so domineering and demanding of such specific and rigid regulation?The decor is interesting but it feels a bit forced and borderline too trendy.  The space is large and dark which is cool, supports the two stars at least.We didn't get it.  Aaaand, we won't again, no worries."
"I'm teetering. On the one hand, Betty's focus was to provide a swanky place for drinks to bring back the Mad Men appeal of leather, vinyl records and cigars - without the smoke, thank goodness. The other, good food to accompany when one has too much to drink.Many of the items, be they liquid or solid has an funky appeal. Milk Punch, with clarified milk and the process described by our servers seemed less appetizing, but when it comes out looks harmless, yet packs a punch. I took sips of half the cocktail menu: Alfonso, War Time, something with red, clear and green and a giant mint tree on top fitted with a straw and coin.... Conclusion: classy, respectable, however,  too much ice and needs a swig more syrup. All ingredients are high quality, the balance was off. The star was the food. I had a bite of the chicken tikka and croquettes and they were amazing.  Most dishes were very savory paired with fantastic sauces, textures and flavors. Unfortunately, the round coffee table seating is a bit awkward for dining, but the flatware is exquisite. Clearly, this place is a big lounge meant for drinking, not eating. I get it :)TL;DR: Cocktails - $$$, fresh ingredients, most drinks veered on strong bitters (add more housemade syrups) and a few of them look like slushies (my advice: use larger ice cubes), 3 stars.  Food - surprisingly amazing 4 stars, nice work chefs. Tufted, retro, bookshelves - places like these elevates, if not, reinforces Chicago's strong status in the food and drinks scene."
What a neat place. The decor is trendy and takes you back in time. I have yet to try the food but the menu sounds great. The drinks are very good. They're different then what you will find somewhere else. They have a few craft beers but the list is very small. They mainly focus on cocktails. This is the perfect to take a date for drinks and a few small plates to share.
"Great cocktails, very attentive staff and wonderful ambiance. Drink prices were a little steep. This place would be great with some live music. Maybe bring some jazz or blues into the space."
"I like this place so don't screw up for my hipsters! Great food  ,great records! Great drinks  , and no tv's"
"Nifty spot for a cocktails (yes, plural) and appetizers!  I had a dry Rob Roy on the rocks with a twist and pretended it was 1963.  The herb cheese spread was yummy as was the lamb.  My best friend and I loved our time here.  Of rourse it doesn't hurt that they have one of the coolest displays of liquor bottles and inventive cocktail menus that I've ever seen and one of the waiters that is half my friend's age flirted with her.  We tipped him well."
"Saturday afternoon cocktails with friends...Love the space and as another reviewer pointed out, very ""Mad Men"" like vibe --- classic dark wood and subtle lighting.  Very comfortable space... I started out with the ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" - AH-MAZING!  Rye, sweet vermouth, madagascar vanilla, orange flower water.  Other drinks looked great but this one was so in my wheel house I didn't want anything else.  One of my friends ordered the ""Make Your Own Gin & Tonic which was really cool.  Thinking it will make for a great summer cocktail.  We didn't eat but glancing around the room, the food looked great.  The service was also very good and the manager came by the table to check in on us.  I also noticed a piano which I am hoping means classic lounge music in the future.  Definitely heading back here soon before it becomes impossible to get in because its so popular :)"
"Best bar ever!!! The ambiance is amazing and the drinks are even better!! It's modern but old school, and the drinks are so fancy and delicious. I can't get over the great drinks, great service, great location. We did a ""build your own gin and tonic"" and it was awesome! The cheese plate was to die for too. The red pepper chutney - YUM. Give me a jar of that and a spoon and I'll die happy.The ambiance is great. There's a bar you can sit at, and other very casual seating areas that you can cozy up to. It's huge! You don't feel like you're sitting on your neighbor's lap. It's even a great place to go alone and just relax in the corner with a high-end drink. I will absolutely be back here!! Five stars for sure!"
"WOW! What an amazing place!!! I went there with my two girlfriends and everything was PERFECT! The ambiance is exceptional! They have everything from a super cool lounge to pub tables. Their cocktail were spot on and carefully crafted. But honestly, where the place where they really shined was the menu. I'm a huge foodie and EVERYTHING really hit the spot! We started with their squid salad which was amazing! Then moved onto their homemade pierogis (yum!) and fried cauliflower, both were exquisite. And then, came the cheeeessseee!!! I love cheese and the selections Chef Rachel made could not have been better. Each was more dynamic and flavorful than the last and their homemade chutney was to die for!!!! Last, but in no way least, was their homemade peppermint patties - Yummmmmmm! Brought me back to my childhood :) Needless to say I will be recommending this place to everyone I know!Thanks for an amazing experience guys! Keep up the good work!"
"Just went there this past weekend for a friends med school graduation party and couldn't of asked for anything better. The party planner, Kara, was super nice. She was down to earth and made party planning fun, which is hard to do. We connected so well over the phone we hugged when we met. The drinks were great but my only complaint would be that they took forever to come. I started ordering my next one with half a drink left and still twenty minutes later wait for my drink. Other than that, fun chilled atmosphere!"
"This was the first stop on a Chicago West Loop bar crawl the other night and it was a comfy dark spot perfect for the first cocktail of the evening. I ordered the Coffee & Cigarettes: rye, sweet vermouth, madagascar vanilla, orange flower water because those are 2 of my favorite things. It was delicious. Light and perfectly balanced. I wish I could have tasted the whole cocktail menu! Alas, I just have an excuse to go back for more and more!"
"Small crowd yet poor service. Where or where did my waiter go? Never checked on me, nor did he come back for food order.Food menu interesting. Did not have anything so can not commentLove the fact there are no TV'S and you can have a nice conversation with friends.Good for after work drinks,"
"Let's keep a long story short: the hostess was a total B. You're in a customer service industry; maybe you had a long day, I get it, we all do, but even when I'm at work and don't wanna put up with someone, I still try and be respectful - not the case with the Betty.The hostess immediately told us that since we didn't have a reservation and we didn't have our entire party there, we had to sit at a bar and our last friend would ""just have to stand"". Ok, our bad for not knowing we had to think ahead. Our unfortunate friend then got there late, so the rest of us had to endure our withering stares the entire time said friend hadn't arrived.Drinks are ... interesting, somewhat limited in beer. Cocktails are somewhat stiff.Crowds are ... Borderline hipster/yuppie. Cool decor, but really that was it.Try the publican next door, least they're not tryna put on an air with you."
