The Reservoir
"This place really is a gem tucked into this nice little Uptown neighborhood. I love the atmosphere and aura it radiates. The dim lighting is always a plus for romantic dates. They have a great number of beers for a beer lover like myself and the food is top notch! I had the steak which was done with the perfect medium that I would expect and my fiancé had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad which I tried and thought was phenomenal. Coming from a guy who only eats meat and potatoes that means a lot!But to be honest with you, the main reason I am writing this review was for the way we were treated by our server named Miles. I have never met a more enthusiastic, attentive and entertaining server in my life. His service was the cherry on top that will keep us coming back for more. If possible, ask if Miles is working while you're there for a very entertaining night! 5 stars for this place!"
"I like this place. More like 3.75 stars though. Dim, industrial, chill. The flat screens throw it off a bit, but, I get it. Almost didn't get the calamari because of another review, but I got it anyway. Didn't disappoint. Portion size was a tad small, but certainly enough for two people with average stomachs. I mean, it IS an appetizer. In any case, the calamari was lightly fried, a plus, came with a solid cocktail sauce and....mayo. What? Yeah, threw me off. Whatever, it was still good. Split a steak sandwich and reservoir fries. The fries were tossed with truffle oil - awesome. The steak was a little rare, but that's the chance you take when you order medium rare. Still a good sandwich, I like how they halved it and served it in two plates with separate mountains of fries, but the first thing out of my mouth was ""I can make this"". The thumb down is beer related. I'm a huge fan of Belgian strong pales, especially Kwak. When I saw it on the beer list, I got excited. But for 11 bucks they can do way better than an 11oz bottle. I mean, wtf. Seriously. The service was a little above average, no complaints there.Will I return? Most likely, but I'm in no hurry."
"Interior: Nice layout, comfortable and trendy. Outdoor setup dfinitely not stellar. Food:Good looking menu lots of apps Flatbread and sandwiches. Rather disappointed in food taste. Descriptions were great but food not well executed. Beat app on the puny side. Mushroom asparagus Flatbread we sent back and got bruschetta which wasn't much better. Fries were of the frozen variety but yummy spicy ketchup and mayo. Service: Friendly, professional, attentive and on point. Overall: Was very hungry looking for some tasty food and sadly, left disappointed and unsatisfied. We might go back for a beer and appetizer if in the area."
"Our waitress had no idea what she was doing so I will give her the benefit of the doubt that it may have been her first week.We ordered the calamari $9...came with only 11 pieces and was measly they treated good just not enough for how small the pieces were. .ordered the pork shoulder Flatbread and it was just okay, not too much flavor. While we were eating on the patio, a tenants above the restaurant decided to clean off their broom by hitting it on the building, allowing all the dust and dirt fly down onto the patio....yuk!! Not blaming the restaurant of course. The drinks we ordered were good but they do need more knowledge behind the bar, again it may be their first service job. I just feel if you are going to try to ""teach"" your table about cocktails, a certain liquor etc...know your facts.Needless to say, it may be some time before return to this establishment unless the bar knowledge changes."
"Sim-puh-lee delicious!How upset I am with myself for living in the neighborhood for six months now and this is just my first time coming to dine here!I had the chicken club sandwich, which comes with avocado  (yum), chipotle mayo, and arugula, just to name a few. The meat - juicy and perfectly seasoned. I also opted to get the Reservoir fries, which come donned with white truffle oil and parmesan. The food was excellent and nothing less than fulling.This is the perfect neighborhood, local joint to go to. The lies stay lit low, no matter how dark in the evening it's getting, which is the total perfect ambiance setting. Tons of space at the bar with tvs around for viewing pleasure. May I add that the bar is fully stocked. I will totally be back and SOON!"
"Had a great dinner here tonight. Walked in around 8:15 and we were told it would be about 20 minutes for a table. I think we were taken in about 15? I had tried to make a reservation earlier in the day but they only take them for parties of 6 or more Tables are a little cramped but it's a very nice atmosphere, kind of romantic even. Our server was very friendly and got our orders in right away. I think the drinks took a little long to get to us but our food was served pretty quickly. We ordered the El Jefe burger and the Lamb Burger. Both sandwiches were very delicious and I'm happy with our choice on the Reservoir Fries. We will probably be back soon. It's a short walk for us and we were happy with our experience!"
"Very classy looking place. I came here on a Friday night with my fiancé and the place was pretty empty. They have very good food and drinks. I ordered a lemon drop martini and told the server I wanted something fruity and refreshing. All the cocktails on the menu were $11-$12 so I thought my drink may be somewhere around there if not less. They bring me a ""specialty drink"". It was pretty tasty but extremely watered down. I get the check- $14 for the drink. Wait.. What??? There goes a second visit from me. Even though I loved the food, I don't think I'll be returning to this place. It's not even downtown to be charging that much for drinks!"
"I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Typical laid back pub with not so typical pub food. My roommate and I walked over on a summer evening and were lucky to have our choice of seating as only a few tables were occupied--we picked the table closest to the big open window to get the outside feel while still being inside. They've got a great draft list with lots of local options so we started with a couple beers and the cheese plate. The waitress said they were out of Brie so there would only be two cheeses (a blue and a Gouda) but they made up for it with a larger portion. The grilled bread, pistachios, apples and some sort of fruit spread completed the cheese board nicely. We also got fish tacos and the Thai salad. The salad had a spicy dressing that paired well with the cilantro on it. Looks like they have a good brunch special so I'd like to come back and enjoy the outdoor patio! The service was good too; our waitress seemed to come at the perfect times and would just leave us to ourselves to chill and talk. I've lived within walking distance for a year and I'm really mad I've never come here before."
"Chill, neighborhood spot with good drinks, awesome food and fair prices! Wife @fabsoopark loves the Judgement Day with Pisco. Both times we've been here, we ordered the sausage board (summer sausage, mixed greens with house-made balsamic dressing, caramelized onions, and really good dark mustard). Braised pork is good... Had it in the El Jefe (sandwich) and the Braised Pork Shoulder flatbread (with brie, apples, and fig jam)... Yeah fig jam!Looking forward to our next visit! #FabFoodChicago"
Ate brunch here twice (I obviously liked it).  The first time I had pancakes and the red skin potatoes both were really good.  There was 1 guy running everything when we came in and he was killin it.  The second time I had brunch here I got the chicken and biscuits.  Blew the pancakes out of the water! Highly recommend getting the chicken and biscuits.    I of course had a mimosa which was delicious. Service was lacking a bit or I would have given them 5 stars.
"I was pleased with my first visit to The Reservoir. It's a bar, so I was leery of the food being typical ""pub grub"" quality. Not the case, though -- our food was tasty and well-prepared. Our server, Jenny, was excellent: cheerful, cordial, helpful and attentive -- really could not have been better.We started with a delicious, fresh Caesar salad, then moved on to sandwiches. My au poivre was delicious, with chunks of juicy, flavorful steak ""poivre'd"" perfectly for my taste. My companion's lamb burger was similarly juicy and nicely spiced. There's a very nice selection of beers, and an adequate wine list, at reasonable prices, well-matched to the food.I can't say much about the ambiance -- we were seated toward the front and I didn't see much of the place. It's a bar, pleasant but not fancy. I will surely return some time when I'm in the neighborhood for a play at Profiles. Good food, fair prices, great service -- what could be better?"
"I live in the area and this is one of my favorite spots. The beer list is always spot on and the food is delicious. Service is quick and always friendly. I love the pulled pork sandwich :) The atmosphere is great for dinner and drinks with friends, date night or having a beer while watching whatever game might be on. Have been here many times and will continue to do so even after I move from the area. Thank you for providing consistently pleasant experiences. :)"
"The Reservoir is a neighborhood gem in an otherwise desolate Uptown neighborhood. While it can be a bit hard to find and out of the way (especially in the middle of Winter), it's absolutely worth the trip, especially if you live in the neighborhood. The sandwich I had was excellent. For the life of me, I cannot remember the specific menu name, but it was Mexican spiced pork on Texas Toast with roasted vegetables and way too many french fries. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and I've had plenty. There's also a top-notch beer selection. The prices were definitely affordable and service at the bar was excellent. The fifth star comes for how impeccably clean this establishment is. You can tell the management, ownership, and staff actually care, becuase I couldn't even find a speck of dust, spill, or any unfavorable mess in here. Also, the environment is much more classy than you'd expect to find at sports bars, especially one in this area! If you're ever in Uptown, head here - you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to stop in again during the Summer after Montrose Beach."
I'm very excited that I just moved to the Uptown area because I found this place very close to me! I have been there 3 times in the last week. Every food item I had was amazing! My favorite so far has been the chicken club sandwich with their amazing chipolte mayo. Yum! They have great brunch with good drink specials as well. It's really a hidden gem in this up and coming area. I will probably be there about 2 times a week!!
"Looking for a place in Uptown and this gets the job done.   Everything was solid.  The service, the decor, the food, drinks, everything.  We went on an off night before heading up to the Green Mill.    Lots of different menu options, good wine and drink list.  If I was ever in the neighborhood I would look to go again.  I am not sure I would go out of my way as it wasn't Amazing, but hey if you are in the area, you should go!  Well worth the time and you will enjoy it."
Good local watering hole with better than average food. Definitely go on a Wednesday night for their half price wine (glass or bottle) and cheese board.
"The chicken wings were not cooked all the way through. The chef came and gave us a lesson on enzymes (basically an excuse) on why there was pigment and/or blood on the so called ""cooked"" wings. I have my pictures to show the truth.No type of refund or any other service offered for the wings not being cooked all the way through.The chef is a great chef but he doesn't know how to fry wings. Then, he states that he is from Louisiana, well I tell you I have never eaten red chicken anywhere else in the world but here."
"Anyone who can make salads taste good deserves at least four stars! Get the Mediterranean salad with chicken and you won't be disappointed. I usually hate my foods drowned in sauce/dressing, so I was hesitant when I forgot to ask for m dressing on the side, but was pleasantly surprised to find just the right amount. Service was okay, we weren't really checked on too often throughout our visit which is a bit sad considering the place wasn't busy at all.  Still, I'd go back as I'd like to check out their flatbread selections."
"Since I moved here from New York, I've been driving past this place over and over; but tonight I felt for a burger and I decided to check them out. To my surprise! When I entered the front door I noticed the ambiance it was the typical bar setting but beautifully design. I love the service and how fast it was; I was in and out pretty quickly. My only negative was the burger tasted a little burnt but the fries was delicious."
"My friends and I had a really nice time here! We grabbed a seat outside. I recommend doing that if weather permits. I had the au poivre which was decent. The salad that came with it though was delicious. Four stars just for the good salad. My friends got the chicken club and truffle fries and really enjoyed those. Apparently it's half off wine bottles on Wednesdays, so we'll come back Wednesdays!"
"Their chicken club is amazingly delish! I love the salad it comes with, but the Reservoir fries and regular fries are super yummy, so it's difficult to choose sometimes. Their burgers are also juicy, and the Greek salad as well as the caprese flatbread are among my faves. Everything I've tried at this local joint is on point.. love to order from here and in the summer months, it's an awesome place to have a chill patio dinner at."
"I'm a ""Reservoir DOG""!!!  Yeah, I'll eat just about anything that they have on the table.  Seriously, the food is excellent.  If I was was going to be critical about anything, it would be 2 things, #1 the Fries are sort of like McD's fries, even with the toppings....still OK...but not on par with the rest of the food there.  #2  The desserts are not made there.  The desserts are fine..... but not great.  With that said, those two quasi negatives are ""relative"".  I mean to say that everything else there really is GREAT....  Seriously, the chef really is quite creative.  The decor is a dark ""pub"" environment with wood and some exposed brick.  They have outdoor seating too.  The crowd seems to be a younger 20s-30s crowd but there were some older peeps like me in there too!  Street parking is pretty close to impossible at many times of day....so take a cab, etc...  The music is on the louder side, but I liked it.  Our waitress was a beauty with dark raven or dark chestnut hair and she was very attentive.  We ordered EVERY app on the menu.....and I suggest that you do too!  (O:"
I love this location and the ambiance of the place. I could go on about their delicious options on the menu. Resivoir fries are to die for and the Mac and cheese are among the best in the city.Highly recommend for big groups or small dates!
"Horrible Horrible HORRIBLEWent here a few hours before the Mumford Show.  While I understand that the show was near by, one would think these idiots would staff up?  Umm nope, totally understaffed, and they looked like 5 yr olds who had no idea how to run a restaurant.  Wake up ownership, there is 35K people in your area, staff up, be smart, make money! They clearly do not care about customer service!!!"
"Great atmosphere, delicious food, excellent attention and good deals on weekdays!! I loved it!! 100% recommended!!"
Good food and beer menu!
"Great neighborhood joint!  Decently priced drinks, tasty food, and good service.  Also love that it's a short walk from home...just wish the neighborhood had more places like this!"
"Holy, Sh&%, how did I not know this place existed in my hood, Uptown?!Well, apparently it's been around since 2012.  What a find!  And here it goes:The Reservoir is a bar tucked in the shadow's of the Jewel-Osco and World Gym on Montrose.  Upon walking up after a friend suggested we meet there - I must say, I had low expectations - since of course, I hadn't heard of this place until about 30 minutes before.When I opened the door, I was immediately impressed.  Lively, comfy and cozy - and if it hadn't been raining the big front windows open too.  The place was hopping, some good 90's music on and attentive service.They have some killer drink and food specials.  I happened to go on a Wednesday, and lucky me - it was 50% off wine night!  Two bottles of Malbec - check!  I had the Steak Sandwich Au Poir.... and it was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent.  My friend had one of the flat breads, that looked equally delicious.I'm already plotting a return visit, and happy to see another good bar with great food in my neighborhood.  Spread the word about this place!"
"Great neighborhood bar. It has a decent beer selection, great food thpugh the menu is a bit limited, and an  awesome laid back vibe. Lots of locals come in here. One if my favorite place to go if I want a  beer but don't want to be at a noisy sports bar."
This place was the bomb! Chill/Fancy Atmosphere with amazing food and great service. This is my new go to spot from now on!! Yay Uptown!
"My favorite bar in the neighborhood. The service nails friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, while the place brings a ""everyone is welcome "" vibe. It's versatile; I can go there for nights out with friends or alone, and it's an easy option for dates. The furnishing follows a black and wood theme, nothing distressed, and the service also matches in buttoned-up black.Something noted in a previous review that I've taken for granted is how clean the place is. It's not something that I usually think about when talking about bars, but The Res is spotless, lacking any sticky surfaces or floors, and doesn't carry any stale beer smell.The execution of the food has never blown me away, but it's reliably good and I wouldn't turn down a meal or snack there. The cocktails are creative, and the fair-sized draft list rotates regularly. Here's to easy decisions to hang out at The Res."
"Came in with friends on a Saturday night. Place was pretty empty. Menu was varied with lots of options. Great unique appetizers. Cocktail list was small but beer list seemed expansive. We had the lamb burger, which was good but a little spicier than expected. Truffle fries were a highlight. Mac n cheese was good but nothing that special. Cinnamon old fashioned is a must try. In all it was a good night and a nice option. I wish there were more cocktail options. We will probably be back because it is convenient but it didn't blow us away."
"Great place in Buena Park! I love the service and food. It is out go to place. I loved there spring and summer menu, but the fall and winter were just okay. I would always recommend this place and I will keep coming back."
"Met a friend here for dinner on a Thursday night, and I really liked the atmosphere.  Not a lot of places like this around here, but it's very loungey and hip for Uptown.  I had the Mediterranean salad with chicken, which was only $11 and really fresh and tasty.  I also ate a ton of my friend's fries (she had a huge portion with her burger) and they were totally addicting.  I really like it here!  Great addition to the neighborhood and I'd definitely come back if I was in the area.  I think you could be either casual or dressy here and still feel comfortable."
"This place was a great discovery. It seems to be in a trendy neighbourhood that doesn't have many restobars close by. Food here was super - from calamari to house made hummus to steak, I was pleasantly surprised. Drinks and service were exceptional and I got to meet the chef. A super treat"
"Well I finally returned after a year plus hiatus.This is still a hella good spot in my new hood of residence; Uptown.I came last night with a friend and we got a nice spot near the back. Lights were nice and dim and the TVs were playing sportscenter and other sports related shows.  Our server John was really helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I was conflicted between the mahi mahi with grilled asparagus vs the Uptown Burger. My dining companion decided she was going to have a lamb burger so I said what the hell I would have a burger as well. The Uptown Burger is basically an 8oz certified angus beef with fried egg, bacon, bbq sauce, onions, lettuce & tomato. Burger was filling as John said it would be and the fries were pretty good with the spicy ketchup dipping sauce. The dipping sauce tasted like ketchup blended with srirracha. Beer list is still pretty good as we had 3 each...all different ones. The also have games you can play such as Scrabble and other favoritesI really like this place and see myself spending some decent time here since I live nearby. Good stuff"
"Not a food review (although the menu looked great). Just loved the bar! It's got a slightly more upscale feel than some of the bars in the area. I mean, you can certainly get away with a hoody here, but if you felt like putting on your fav super-expensive-highest-quality Forever21 dress...you can do that too.  I drank four cosmos on the night that I went, so I guess I would say it got the job done. A few seats outside, but otherwise wide open windows, dimly lit and they played Dispatch...so I'll be back!"
"Came here yesterday after softball as this was our sponsor bar--there really aren't many spots close to Clarendon Park--but they didn't seem all that happy to see us.  The brunch menu was more than reasonably priced--my friend had the biscuits and gravy, and it looked really good--but the beer and drink prices were a little steep.  We were looking for a place that had like $3 PBR or Miller Lite for some postgame, not $7 Mimosas.  The service left a lot to be desired, and they yelled at us for moving a table.  It seems like a really nice place to take a date, but I'd probably skip it otherwise."
I have never had a bad meal here. My boyfriend and I come here wayyyy too much. We usually stop by for brunch for their bottomless-mimosas deal. Awesome. Get their pancakes.The waitstaff are all wonderful!
"I went here last night with two of my girlfriends, and we had a really nice time. We arrived early and ended up staying for more than five hours, watching the Blackhawks game on one of the HD plasma screens that are placed all over the bar and having a grand old time.The service staff was super friendly all evening. To eat, we shared the hummus appetizer. Two of us had the mac and cheese for entrees, which was SO YUMMY. (I love all the different ways you can customize it to your liking...I opted for bacon and white truffle oil in mine.) My other friend had a flatbread pizza, which she said was great. We shared an order of the Reservoir Fries, which are made with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil: delicious. We shared three bottles of wine, which was also very good and reasonably priced.For dessert, we were surprised that there was no dessert menu. Our waitress asked us to wait when she ""checked to see what they could do."" When she returned, she said we could either have chocolate cake or Nutella crepes. We opted for the cake, which was delicious but SO TINY...seriously, less than two bites each for three people. My one big gripe with this place is the bathroom. While it was impeccably clean, there was a bottle of soap on the sink that was super watered down. I truly think someone had filled the soap bottle with water because it was almost empty, and they wanted to make it last instead of taking the time to walk across the street to the Jewel and buying a new bottle. I went to the bathroom twice and each time dealt with the watery soap situation. That really bothered me. Hand hygiene is not something that can be overlooked, especially in a restaurant/bar.The lack of soap aside, however, I really did like this place. It has a warm, friendly vibe, and the food is great. We stayed forever., and never felt at all rushed. I would definitely go back, but they better buy some more soap by then."
"Great place! We stopped in here for brunch. LOVED the po boy. It's a cute atmosphere, several TVs to watch sports, and even board games! Would love to try it out in the night for some drinks."
"Pretty cool decor. The place was very hip looking. Not crowded at all. The food was great. The roasted potatoes were fantastic. I had the breakfast po' boy, which was very tasty. Scrambled eggs, andouille sausage, and creole hollandaise, I believe. It was served on a pretzel bun. The best part was my boyfriend's meal, the chicken biscuit. It was absolutely amazing. The fried chicken was perfect. I will definitely be back soon (and I will be ordering the fried chicken biscuit)."
"This is a sharp venue on an incredibly unsharp stretch of Montrose Avenue.  There is a long bar and comfortable tables and banquettes.  I ordered a cocktail called the Mexican Standoff.  It's a cross between a margarita (tequilla) and a cosmo (pink).  Served straight up it was tart, alcoholic, and a fine way to get the evening started.What I didn't like is how aggressively sports-oriented this place seems to be.  Six large screen TVs all playing different sports channels.  If even one of them had been tuned to CNN (or TCM or the Weather Channel, for that matter), I might have stayed beyond cocktail hour for something to eat."
"Great service and the burger was really good, too.  Nice atmosphere.  Will definitely come back!"
"Was pleasantly surprised!  Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere!  Will definitely make a return visit when in the area."
"This is a gem of a place in my neighborhood.  The food is really great, nice atmosphere, and most of all, exemplary service.  Nick knows how to work a bar like nobody's business.  They have a great selection of wine and beer and awesome weekly specials.  Love this place."
"I am so happy we found this place, it is amazing. We will  become regulars. The food was excellent! I had the chicken and dumplings omg delicious i say try it, perfect for this cold winter. My boyfriend had the pork sandwich and TRUFFLE parmesan fries try them also!!   The enchilada was fabulous!! The food here is delicious! Great job chef!"
"Great atmosphere.  Comfortable and casual, but classy.  You wouldn't feel out of place in a suit, or in flip flops.Also, sitting at the bar, I found the rare mix of a bar that was very much a regular's bar, but still made new customers feel welcome.  The bartender seemed to know everyone other than me at the bar by name, and was engaged in conversation with them, but was still friendly and attentive to me, a first time visitor.The beer list was pretty good.  Not huge, but a lot of selections from different styles.Menu all looked pretty good.  The food was well conceived, and cooked very well, but the seasoning was a bit off.  This would probably be a 5 star review if whoever was cooking my burger had put half of the salt from the fries on the burger instead.  It was very odd, since usually cooks have a tendency to over or under season.  My fries were so salty they were almost inedible, and the burger patty was bland.  The toppings on the Uptown Burger, though, made it a good burger anyway.  With a bit of salt and pepper it probably would have been amazing.Will definitely be back, as my only gripe with the place is something which varies from cook to cook, and maybe I just came at the wrong time."
Great neighborhood bar with good food. Staff was great with recommendations and really made us feel welcomed. Will definitely be going back.
Superior pub grub and lots of yummy beers. Chef clear knows what he's doing. We ordered several dishes and all were very tasty. Will be coming back.
"We went on a Sunday night around 7PM. I liked it.  We sat towards the back, so plenty of space between us and the other people.  The interior was mostly dark tones, and had a familiar feel.  Service-everyone was nice, the waiter was very knowledgeable, checked in on us with just the right frequency (woohoo, not waiting for beer!!), and did a good job.  Same deal with everyone else we interacted with.  Everyone was nice, and efficient. Food-Twas good.  They have a fairly diverse, but familiar menu.  My girlfriend had a flat bread with I think goat cheese and asparagus...I had the Uptown Burger.  If you've read my other reviews, you know that I go for burgers that have eggs, bacon, barbecue sauce, and well-that's about it.  This one had all of that, plus fried onion curls, cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  It was really good.  The roll/bun was a bit different than other places, it had a nice crust that kept it from feeling too soggy with my medium burger.  I'll def order that again.  Their dipping fries tasted good as well, they came with a spicy ketchup and i forget what kind of mayo stuff.  They were good, especially when mixed together to make...spicy fry sauce.  Beer-nice variety.  They had a larger draft list than I expected with a variety of craft beers-including Chicago/Chicago-land beers.  I tried the Solemn Oath Hexaphoos.  That was awesome, and the waiter described it nicely (it was one of the rotating beers).  Good prices too.  They also have craft and domestic/typical beers in bottles as well.  They have wine and cocktails...I didn't bother looking at that list for long.  I like beer.  Price-it was very affordable.  I think I paid about $60 out the door for dinner and 2 drinks each for 2 people.  I'll def go back. I could see going there for dinner & drinks, or after going somewhere else for dinner to have a night cap or three."
Excellent food and drinks.  The lamb burger had a Greek flair with little spice - be sure to get it with the reservoir fries. The Brussel sprouts small plate was amazing as well.  For drinks - try the apple cinnamon old fashioned :)
"The worst service and food ever. Warm ranch dressing, bad wings, and sorry clueless bartender."
My girlfriend and I just moved into the area and wanted to check out some of the local scene. The Reservoir is within walking distance and has received many great reviews on yelp. They couldn't be more accurate. The bar is very inviting and comfortable. The staff was wonderful and atmosphere on a Tuesday night at 8 pm was great. Our bartender was especially friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great first experience. The food was also wonderful. We had the Chicken club and the Reservoir burger with the dipping sauce and the reservoir fries. (truffle oil and tossed in parmesan). Both the chicken and the burger were cooked perfectly and the sauces for the fries were very good! This restaurant would have definitely received 5 stars but the fries were not on par with the rest of the food. Just the run of the mill out of a freezer French fries. We will definitely be going back
"I have worked in restaurant for seven years now. I know a good, professional restaurant when I see one. The menu: phenomenal. The ingredients in their food: flawless and affordable. How do they do it!!?? I love right next to this place and I should probably own at least half of the business with as much money as I spend here. Every time I dine in 9 time out of 10 I have the same waitress, I wish I knew her name. U can tell the reservoir isn't her first rodeo. The entire wait staff knows what they're doing. I recommend to anyone who is brave enough to venture into uptown for this hidden gem!!!!! Lamb burger or hanger steak!! Do it!!"
"Everything I had was awesome.  Great spot for dinner and drinks.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up, the patio opens, and make this a summer hangout. Since there are items on the menu tapas style, you can go here for dinner or for drinks and a snack. 5 stars for sure!"
"Neighborhood feel.  Comfortable relaxing, above average pub food, good beer list.  Could improve on wine list."
"Super cute restaurant! Reasonable prices, good food, a fairly wide variety of food and drinks. The place is decorated wonderfully. It's actually a pretty cute and cheap date spot despite the fact that there are tons of tvs for people wanting to watch sports. I walked in once in the middle of trivia, and they seemed to have fairly easy questions. They utilized the tvs to help with trivia, which seemed to make things more interactive and fast-paced."
"Went with a friend had the sausage board which was awesome. Then the Mac and cheese with bacon,chorizo, and caramelized onion which was really good. Great beers and cool atmosphere and knowledgeable wait staff."
"I'm going to get right to the food.Appetizer1) Sausage board - get it. Comes with three types of sausages: andouille, kielbasa, and smoked. The presentation is it comes with an apple mustard, salad with a decadent balsamic dressing.. it's good.2) Calamari - this was.... not as great as i thought it'd be. Rubbery, overcooked calamari, room temp marinara. Ehhhhh.... Great beer, ok food... Honestly, we only went there be it was in uptown and so close to where we lived."
"Came here while visiting friends who live about 2 blocks away.  We were debating restaurants when The Reservoir came up.  We went on a Wednesday so we got a bottle of wine for half off which we split between 3 peopleAppetizer: Calamari.  Was a little tough, was expecting something more 'soft' if that makes senseEntree: I got the lamb sandwich.  I liked it and ate the whole thing.  It comes with fries which didn't match the sandwich.  The fries seemed like something from McDonald's or Steak n Shake and not something more upscale.  My friend ordered a chicken sandwich and had every intention of saving half for lunch the next day, didn't make it past  a late night snack.  Friend number 2 ordered a Mediterranean sale and was one of the better salads she's ever orderedOur waitress was attentive and around all night and answered questions we had.  The place is upscale, yet reasonably price which is a plus.  Definitely make an effort to stop by!"
Best Place in Uptown. Great menu. They put a lot of $$$ and thought into the place. A diamond in the rough.
"This place is everything!I was part of a small group of three. We sat outside and took part in the feast of amazingness that is, The Reservoir. Service was excellent. Our waitress should win an award for the best in Chicago. No lie. She was great!! We ordered the ""chef special"" flatbread, cheese board, Mediterranean salad, parmesan truffle fries, chicken club sandwich, key lime pie and glasses of Pinot. An ant wouldn't have been able to eat well with the dearth of remains on the plates after we finished eating. It was THAT good!"
Food was good- we had a hard time picking what to get and ended up just getting a table full to share. Service was fantastic.
Liked it! Good drinks and food. Worth checking out. Good wine list. I would recommend it to friends.
"Incredibly affordable, and great food. Cute small atmosphere. Been here more then once and the food was delicious. Great service even though clearly very busy for staff. Our server Terry was a peach!"
"This is one of our favorite neighborhood joints for watching a game and eating some good food. The service is always friendly and they have a decent wine list too, which is a big plus. And, despite the many many TVs showing sports, it doesn't feel like a sports bar. In other words, you can totally go here for a meal and drinks with friends even if you don't care who's playing that night."
"Don't waste your money. The food I got was fine, nothing outstanding though, and definitely overpriced. I spent $8 for 10 small beet cubes. I'm very surprised they charge so much for so little! If it tasted amazing, it might be worth it, but honestly, it was just standard bar food. See photo of beets."
Yum! from the service to the food to the clientele! I love their chicken club sandwich...OMG the best anywhere!
"Great neighborhood place to eat, drink, or talk the latest scuttlebutt with friends. If you like drinking, which if you don't, we're not friends anyway, it's a cozy place."
"This place is gross. Bad staff, gross food, hours, wrong.... Who stops serving good at 10:30 on Friday? Yuck"
"Great food, friendly/attentive staff, welcoming atmosphere... Love it!  The Reservoir is a welcome respite from the crush of downtown.  It's worth finding your way uptown for some r&r."
"Good beer selection. During brunch they have a separate menu and the sandwich section from the main menu, which includes burgers.Had the Monte Cristo sandwich which is ham in a pastry crust with raspberry sauce and a Irish coffee (it was a little cold out and others in the party had some first) which they give a shot a whiskey and Irish Creme on the side to add as you wish. It was a good combo.Others in the party enjoyed their food, including the pancakes, the grilled chicken sandwich and an eggs Benedict plate.They were accommodating to our group which increased from our reservation.Will go back next time in the area."
"Amazing, meatballs (balls..lol) are crazy yummy.. Everything I have had here is great, the steak sandwich is to die for..Love this place!"
The Mac & Cheese is delicious - hint: go on Tuesdays for bottomless mac & cheese night!!Great beer list too.  Can't wait to go back and try more of the food & drink!
"How did I not know until tonight that a place like this existed in my neigborhood!! Crazy!! Really good fries and the lamb burger is on point. I was iffy at first about the lamb burger, but I'm glad I tried it! Def recommending this place to friends!"
"Everything is wonderful!! Grilled cheese sandwich, the Mac and cheese, reservoir fries, and chicken club sandwich are all great! Love the half priced bottles of wine Wednesday's! Good beer selection. Love it! Will definitely be back"
"Met a friend for drinks and to watch the Hawks game a few months ago (obviously since it's July as I'm writing this.). Ordered wings, which were meh.  The game-watching was a little challenging as well given that the TVs are not the most strategically placed with respect to seating. As a result, you should pick your dining location ever so carefully if that is important to you.  I thought I had done the smartest thing in consulting the resident expert, ie the host, and informing her of my visit that night--to watch the Hawks.  Not sure why I would bother to come back since i don't live in the 'hood."
"An absolute must try! A great neighborhood place with excellent food and an awesome beer selection. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They know the menu we'll and can always make great recommendations. Great cozy atmosphere and excellent ambiance. The beer selection is fantastic. They have a number of great beers that the keep on draft and are alway featuring some awesome seasonal brews. Great menu! My top recommendations would be the lamb burger, lamb shank and the flatbreads are excellent as we'll. and of course you have to try the reservoir fries!"
"I love this place. The cheese burgers are fantastic as well as the flatbread, wings, fish tacos and just about everything else. They have trivia night which is a blast. I love this place because it's a great hangout place and great to watch games. They've got a lot of TV's and I just love this place."
Great beer list and nice food to go with it.  The Mac and Cheese with chorizo was particularly great!  Also-great service and music to go with---a good find of you're in Uptown....
"I've lived very close for years and I've been dying for good restaurants in the neighborhood. This doesn't come close. Food: Just ok. The burger I ordered was over cooked and very small. Didn't even come close to the edges of the bun. And despite being over cooked, it wasn't very warm. The fries were very average. Thin and semi crispy. Brussel sprout small plate was the best thing we ordered, but I've definitely made better brussel sprouts at home.Service. Here is where the ball is really dropped. We were there on a Thursday night, not busy. Our waiter was very awkward. He had a hard time making eye contact with us and made the very few exchanges with us uncomfortable. My drink was never refilled, never asked us how our food was, didn't thank us for dining. Condiments were brought to the table half way through the meal and they were just set on the table with no comment. The thing that really bugged me was that the presumed owner or manager was there and he did nothing but walk around and check himself out in the mirror. Straightening utensils on empty tables and ignoring everything else. I walk by daily and I probably won't be back. Chicago is a fantastic food city and there are a million other bars/pubs/American restaurants around to avoid this one. What a shame."
Great food good beer and very friendly staff.. It's low key yet has tv's and the bathrooms are very clean. You can't go wrong!
"Good addition to a hood with limited options, the upscale bar theme works well.  Service is attentive and orders from the bar and kitchen arrive timely. They also must have some of the cleanest bar bathrooms in Chicago.Though half of the beers I ordered in their menu were already sold out. The fries that accompanied my burger were stale and cold - should've opted for a side salad instead. Yet my burger was fantastic and my GF's Mac n cheese truly decadent. Just fix your menu and treat your fries as they aren't from McDonalds and I'll mark up more stars."
"I went in last night and ordered the beet salad.  The ""salad"" if you can call it that has five (5) paper thin (and I do mean paper thin) slices of beets.    They put chunks of cheese on it and some pistachios.  It was a rip off!  Really disappointed to see what this place is turning out to be.   Oh, the grilled cheese sliders, again so poor and lackluster.  I recommend you going to another place if you're looking to eat or snack on something worth while."
The chicken club sandwich and the uptown burger is a must try. They were delicious. My friends and I also ordered the mac and cheese and it was okay. It wasn't as great as I thought it would be. It's a nice place to drink and hangout with friends. The environment was fun and our waiter was amazing.
"It is so great to see more businesses opening up and thriving in this neighborhood! We've lived in the Uptown/Buena Park area for a few years and this is one of a few new businesses that have opened up in 2013. We came in on a very cold and very snowy Friday night, and I was surprised to find that the place was pretty busy, considering the weather. The place has a nice vibe and a good amount of seating, plus a pretty large bar. My only complaint is that the music was a little loud, so that my fiance and I had to lean across the table and sort of shout to hear each other. The food was really good. We started with some brussel sprouts with bacon and they were delicious. My fiance had the Uptown Burger and I had Mac & Cheese. The burger was piled with toppings, including a fried egg, but it was totally worth it. The mac & cheese was good, but too heavy for me to finish the whole bowl. Everything was good, but it's all bar food, so don't expect anything healthy.I tried two of the cocktails - both featured whiskey and both were very good. The beer list was also pretty good with their craft and local selection (my fiance ended up with a beer from Solomn Oath in Naperville).Overall - would definately go back again and hope that this place becomes a popular destination in Uptown!"
"This is such a great addition to this area! I'm bummed I moved right after they opened, it definitely would have been a go to spot for me. Kinda hard to see from the outside but the decor is beautiful inside. Looks new and modern. Plenty of beer choices on tap as well as specialty drinks. There are tables for those who want an intimate  romantic dinner but if you sit at the bar, there are tv's for sports goers. Mac and cheese is good, but after adding everything you want, it's kinda pricy. Baos are delicious as well as the fish tacos. Flatbreads are often on the happy hour menu and they're pretty crispy and flavorful. Bartenders are super nice and they definitely remember the customers, I like that."
"The staff here is awesome. After work, there isn't even a debate about where we are going for dinner or to have a drink. The atmosphere is also amazing. Despite the number of customers they have, there is more than enough room to relax and have a decent conversation."
"I like it here.I was lured here to be a ringer on my friends' trivia team.  See, The Reservoir does a theme every week (one of the rounds is a different, fun theme voted on by trivia teams the prior week) and last night's theme was Game of Thrones.  I may or may not be a super fan of the show.  I fully realize I'm outing myself as an uber-geek to the greater Yelp community, but whatevs.So anyway... Trivia night. It's a cool situation.  First, the trivia guys are totally fun, cool, super cute and really fun.  They also keep a pretty good pace, which is much appreciated.  There are 6 rounds and the winning team of each round gets a free shot.  First time I've seen that and I was loving it.  Winning team takes a $50 gift card.  The categories are great.  Famous quotes about Chicago?  Obviously the trivia team-elected special category each week.  Picture round, music round... they've got it covered.  The questions were challenging, but not so outrageous that nothing could be answered.So while trivia rocked, I'm not sure I was in love with the food menu.  Everything seems kind of pricey and there's not a lot of diversity on the menu.  I mean... I paid $7 for a little side of truffle/parm fries I was planning on splitting with a friend that were undercooked and not that good.  Good for my diet, I guess.  On the upside, they do have bottomless mac and cheese on Tuesdays and word on the street is that it's tasty.One recommendation: Get the old fashioned they have on the menu, but be a dick and substitute blood orange bitters for the chocolate bitters.  The reason?  Blood orange ANYTHING rocks and chocolate bitters just seem weird."
"Modern, newer establishment on Montrose near the Lake.  Look for the cool blue lights out front!  Inside, large bar with two sides and quite a bit of seating.  I liked the beer list a lot, had a Chicory Stout that was one of best stouts ever!  I went at an ""Off"" time so didn't really get to see the crowd that patronizes this joint?  Also, only tried a burger..def good burger with great fries.. will update after I return to PARTY!!! GTFJD"
"YUM.  My husband and I moved to Uptown in September and this place opened almost right after we got here.  My husband used to live in Uptown and said this was a much-needed addition to the neighborhood, which I can see.  I'm not saying I don't like the bars and restaurants in Uptown now, but this place really is a nice, neighborhood watering hole.  People in Buena Park and Clarendon Park can walk here, which is super nice and convenient.  I love that there's a bar a few blocks from my house.The interior is classy and nicely furnished.  Dark wood, clean lines, long bar with comfy chairs.  Ample seating and room for groups, if that's your thing.  The first time we came here, we sat at the bar to watch a Michigan Football game, which they were more than happy to oblige.  This is a good place to bring a group of friends for a football game and enjoy some nice brews.The beer menu is huge, so be prepared.  They have a nice, rotating tap selection (but they run out of seasonal beers quickly) and a ton of bottles.  The prices could be a bit lower, but I won't complain too much.  The food menu isn't huge, but everything on it is super tasty.  If you're a first timer, get the Reservoir Frites with the garlic aioli on the side.  THEY ARE EXCELLENT.  I also recommend the beet salad and mac and cheese, both are super tasty.  Love this place.  I'm really glad it has settled itself in Uptown so we can all hang out here."
Good beer selection and good burgers.Had the Uptown Burger last time I was there.Really good.
"Great addition ot the hood.  Great beer selection and the food was really good.  I had the NY Strip with roasted taters and garlic spinach.  The steak wasn't the best, but adding the garlic butter and the carmalized onions from the taters to the steak made it really good.  My friend had bacon, burnt end Mac n Cheese and she ate the entire bowl.  I was very surprised.The place was really dark, so they could really turn the lights up a little bit.  Good size TVs and the bartenders made a great Martinie.Check the place out, you will not be dissapointed."
"Great service, uptown burger was awesome best burger I've had in a while. Good choice of drafts on tap."
"Great drinks, love the casual bar scene. Good drink selection and proves are decent. Would definitely go again"
"We have returned and are happy its improved since opening.  Our first experience the waitress offered to have the cook pry open mussels that didn't open. YUCK!!  This time our waitress was SUPER attentive.  We did the all you can eat mac and cheese, which is a fun idea but so filling you hardly can eat more than the standard order for the same price.The spinach, goat cheese salad was ok but the dressing was a bit heavily dressed w/ an overly mayonnaisey flavor.Really good beer prices.  Not a major selection but covers the bases.I want to give this place one more try before I make my final decision but I'm happy overall.  I want to check out Monday's Open Mic Comedy Night!"
"Good atmosphere, half price wine bottles on Wednesday, and good service! Our server was good and attentive. I didn't eat, but other people at my table tried the lamb burger and fries and were happy. Has a nice upscale yet comfortable bar feeling, and they didn't mind us coming in post-soccer game. The wine (pinot grigio) was only ok, but that's about what I expect from the average Chicago bar anyway. Definitely worth a stop if you are nearby!"
This is a great spot for a drink or snack. The setting is nice and there's plenty of room. The appetizer enchilada that I had was delicious and a large portion. I will absolutely return and would recommend it.
This is a cool place with Good food and a great bartender.  A nice addition to the neighborhood more businesses need to follow in there foot steps and bring more to this block. Uptown is a great neighborhood .
"A gorgeous pub in Uptown.  Who knew?  Food is great: brussels sprouts with bacon, truffle (and non-truffle) fries and truffle macaroni cheese were both very popular with our whole group.  My favorite: fish tacos.  Best fish tacos I have ever had, hands down.  The lightly breaded and super flavorful fish was a really nice surprise.  I'd say skip the burger, but, otherwise really an outstanding meal."
Excellent lamb burgers and the cheese fries are delicious! The service is very friendly and the place looks immaculate. I will definitely be back here to watch more Bulls games!
"I have to say, I'm pretty jealous of my friend. We were out barhopping and this is his local place. Granted, the Reservoir piqued my  interest early on as I like to go around the city to places that possibly have good beer selections. So, it was a natural for us to hit this up as we worked our way south and west towards my place. Let me start off by saying, they nailed the entire feel for the place right off. I really think they are ahead of the curve with the Reservoir in this area of Uptown. It's really been needed and this just feels like a place you want to hang out at. I really dug the draft list and was debating about getting something off the bottle list. But, I did decide to get a new local IPA that I hadn't seen yet. We were only staying for one or two beers, so a full dissection of the list wasn't happening. Still, I really liked what I had. The staff was also really cool. The bartender made you feel welcome from the second you got in there. We also weren't able to initially get the food we wanted as it just went out of season, but the chef came out and gave us a few other options. I couldn't help but think how cool that was and was pretty appreciative that he did that. He didn't need to and it would've been fine if the bartender told us. But, instead he came out and gave us the options. While I have plenty of great options near me, I'd be here all the time if I lived in uptown. Since my friend is nearby, in the words of arnold schwarzenegger: I'll be back."
"Great new place in Uptown, and definitely a breath of fresh air for the area!My boyfriend and I came here just after it opened on Friday around 4:30pm to try one of the Pumpkin Manhattans that Urban Daddy referenced in an article. It's not on the menu and it has essentially become their ""signature drink"" through the publishing of that article. It was a nice blend of Jim Bean, Pumpkin Puree, Simple Syrup, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and a Maraschino Cherry. It wasn't overpoweringly pumpkin flavored, but it was a pleasant drink to have on a cool Friday afternoon. Nick, the bartender, was very friendly and enthusiastic when describing the process of his creation of this drink.They have a great offering of beer on tap and in the bottles, so after polishing off our Manhattans we decided to dive into the seasonal beers. My boyfriend went with the Sierra Nevada fall beer and I tried the Southern Tier Harvest Ale, both of which were delicious. Also, we noticed that they had Hopothesis' IPA on draft, which we haven't seen ANYWHERE, so we ordered this as well.As for the food, I can't comment on this too extensively, but we did try the ""dipping frites"" which came with a tasty aioli sauce and a spicy ketchup. They were promptly served up and delicious--no complaints here.The bartender (Nick) was great and the other servers dropped by to chat, which was nice. Everyone had a great attitude about the opening and seemed happy with its progress so far.The atmosphere is amazing, a gleaming and classy bar that seems so out of place for the area, but as I said, something the area greatly needed. Everything is brand new wood with classic leather backed seating, an impressive bar with a nice selection, and huge mirrors everywhere. They also don't skimp out on the TVs, so this would be a great place to head after work or on the weekend to catch a game in a relaxed environment. I can't really do this place justice with words alone, but you should definitely go check it out.I'll be back soon enough, as I can't turn down $5 craft beers and reasonably priced food. Reservoir, I adore you."
We went on New Years so there was an abbreviated menu which was at first a bummer but it was so good!!!! We got the chicken club and burger and it was all cooked perfectly and tasted great. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back for the full menu.
"This place is a gem, and it's exactly what this area needs.I've been to the Reservoir for dinner three times now, and I haven't been disappointed in any dishes I've had there. Appetizers of note include the ceviche, which is just outstanding, and the buffalo wings, which are done really well.As far as entrees go, the mac and cheese is probably going to draw a lot of folks' eyes, and for good reason. In a city with lots of really good macaroni and cheese, The Reservoir's stands out in a good way. The flat breads, too, are especially good - I particularly love the asparagus and mushroom one, and I really cringe when people ask if I'll share.Of course, the beer selection is also wonderful and the service is great. I've just learned they have brunch, so I'm excited to try that too!"
"This place has come a long way since it opened last year, they have done a great job working out the kinks and now is, for the most part, a pretty well oiled machine. Good neighborhood fare with classic burgers, pastas, flatbreads and specials, all well prepared and presented. Great selection of beers and cocktails, friendly crowd and nice pub decor. The table service is prompt, courteous and efficient although at times ""too eager"" to please.  Too many TV monitors for my taste but sports fans seem quite happy and that's what counts. We live close by and it's great to have them within walking distance - definitely recommended!"
"They have really good food and drink specials that change depending on the day of the week. I can speak to the Sunday special as I got both the $3 mojito and half-priced flatbread.The mojito was very good and such a steal at the price. I think this place is a better bar than restaurant. The flatbread I got had asparagus and mushrooms, chavrie, toasted garlic, and shallot. It tasted okay, but honestly it was like they used one asparagus spear for the entire flatbread. the mushrooms were oddly thin. It was served on a nice cutting board. it just didn't impress me and i would be a lot more dissatisfied if it were the full price.We ordered Dippin Frites (fries) and they were out of the garlic aioli that came on the fries. and there was no spicy ketchup. so in terms of the plain fries we were served, i've had better. The other plates at the table (besides the flatbreads) looked great. I've heard from a friend I was with that the mac and cheese they serve is excellent.I would definitely go back for drinks."
"The Reservoir is, in my opinion, the best bar in the neighborhood.  By a wide margin.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over six years, and the neighborhood desperately needed this type of gem.  The food is fantastic, my personal favorite are the taco's on Thursday night and the Crab Cake Benedict for Sunday brunch.  On the everyday menu, the pork belly and the steak sandwich are world class, however, I have yet to try anything that I did not like.  What really sets The Reservoir apart is the service, all of the bartenders and servers are personable and responsive.  I highly recommend to anyone who lives in the area or is passing through."
"I think if I lived in this hood that I would be very pleased with The Reservoir.  Its nice inside, everyone is super friendly, and a great mix of beers, cocktails and food.Plus plenty of tvs to watch whatever sports you want.  I had the tilapia special which was quite good.  The mashed potatoes were super garlicky!  My friend got the beef sandwich.  She liked the taste of it but the meat was cut up into little pieces which made it difficult to eat and it was all cooked done.  They asked and she had requested medium.  The cheese truffle fries were great!The only rub is that the staff wasn't knowledgeable about the cocktails.  If you ask, ""how is the..."" the answer will be, ""I don't know I haven't had that.""  I would come back if I were in Uptown."
"I'm giving Reservoir 4 stars because I think it's really good for the neighborhood.  Uptown needs somewhere with a solid beer list and good food options.Foodwise, it was a solid 3.  I enjoyed my Au Poivre sandwich, however serving it in slices instead of as a whole steak makes it very difficult to eat.  Pieces of beef kept falling out the end of the sandwich.  Eventually I just gave up on the bun and ate the meat with a fork and knife.  They could also benefit from a meat thermometer, I had requested medium and it arrived almost well done.  Our server had no problem serving the truffle fries as my side (despite it being a higher price on the menu) and they were fantastic.  My vegetarian friend ordered the tilapia and it was alright.  Tasted like a big fishstick, but in a good way. They could use some more veggie friendly options.Drinkwise, I loved it.  The beer list is great but I opted to try cocktails.  The Pisco Sour was not the best I've had, but it hit the spit.  The Blood Orange Sidecar, however, rocked my world.  I'm not typically a brown liquor fan, but this was sweet enough to cut the edge of the cognac.Service was very friendly and the space is really cozy.  I'm a fan and will return.  With lots of tvs, this would be a good place to watch a game."
Good cocktails. I would always opt for reservoir fries if i were you. Lamb burgers tastes like a gyro. Yum. Overall good vibe for an early saturday dinner
"NICK! NICK NICK NICK NICK. Amazingness in the form of an adorable, personable, awesome server. He made our experience so much fun!!! We would have gone back just to see him!THEN, we experience the food... The Mac & cheese is seriously heaven in a bowl. My mom and aunt each got a different flatbread and they devoured them! The food is freaking incredible!THEN we meet the manager Paul. What a sweet, fantastic guy! He hung out and joked around with us for a while. It was slammed, so he helped run the food and drinks. Great teamwork here. We definitely experienced the trifecta today at Reservoir.NICK, FOOD, and PAUL. Need I say more? Nah."
"Wow!  I am so impressed and happy to welcome Reservoir to our neighborhood.  I live a couple blocks away, and am thrilled to have a good restaurant with a great beer list and delicious food come to Uptown.They snuck in under my radar - I found out they had opened by doing a double-take when walking past with my dog.  I just HAD to go for dinner.Between the three of us, we tried the steak au poive sandwich, the chicken club, and the mac-n-cheese special with burnt ends, as well as a couple drinks and the calamari starter.Everything was REALLY tasty.  The calamari was fried but very light and not greasy, the club and steak sandwich were both really good, and the mac-n-cheese was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Seriously, I wanted to lick the bowl.To top things off, our server, Nick, was super friendly and nice, but without being annoying/clingy.  He made us feel so welcome and we will definitely be back.It's a little loud and had a lot of TVs, but was gorgeous inside.  I might avoid it on a night with a popular game on, not being a fan myself.I just hope they decide to open for lunch (maybe just on Fridays?) so I could bring my coworkers here!"
Good food friendly staff yummy drinks ( a tad pricey but not too bad) small plates nice patio seating great spot for a relaxing summer evening
"never had a bad time here. this is a hidden gem & I feel bad posting about it - only because more people will know about it. kidding, of course. this place has an amazing atmosphere, great staff, & delicious food that can easily top ANY place on Michigan Ave & it is 1/2 the price!"
"Can't give this place a low rating because it really is good.  Nick is great, the food is great, but the waitstaff still leaves a lot to be desired.  My wife and  went there quite regularly, often spending $80+  in a sitting.  Thanks to poor waiting, we ended up with a pissed off Nick unceremoniously placing our check on the table, with the implication that we were to leave.  I woke up this morning and mentioned to my wife that Im glad we have a reason to not go back, since we spent so damn much there.  Not pleased at all."
Great addition to the hood.  Have been here about 10 times and always get great service.  The menu is smaller but everything is really well prepared.  TV's are nice and big at the bar and its never overly crowded.  Good crowd most nights and staff goes out of their way to get to know you.  def check it out if you havent...
"An uptown gem.  Good selection of food you definitely not expect in this neighborhood.  Have personally had salad and burger here, always great flavor.  Portions on small side, but prices reflect this.Suggestion to management: maybe offer size options on your more blue-collar menu items."
this place is delicious. cocktails are great. my boyfriend and I both love to fat out on the uptown burger. one of our favorite places in the neighborhood!
