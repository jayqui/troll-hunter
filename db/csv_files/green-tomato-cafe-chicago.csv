Green Tomato Cafe
"This is a great place for a lot of reasons. First of all, its very existence is the result of a Christian health center. The health center needed to provide food for its staff and patients. There was nothing around. Hence, Green Tomato Cafe was born. So kudos to the health center for making a difference in the community not only in providing much-needed health care but also in providing a great little cafe. Secondly, Green Tomato sources its veggies locally. And you can really taste the difference.Thirdly, the restaurant is priced really reasonably for generous portions. Fourth, it's waayyyy clean and hip in there. Lots of light, plenty of seating, some good music and a nice outdoor area.Fifth, the people working there are helpful, friendly and smile a lot. Finally, the food itself is really, really good. I had the smoked chicken salad with fresh greens, blue chess, hard boiled egg, bacon and some other stuff with a homemade cilantro lime dressing that rocked. I was told that the existence of this restaurant had a direct result on a Lou Malnati's restaurant opening down the block. So if you're in the North Lawndale area, stop in to the Green Tomato Cafe. You'll be helping a community and helping yourself to some fine food."
"Really wanted to love this place but maybe came at the wrong time. Came for lunch on a Tue and tried the chipotle chk sandwich and the chopped chk salad.  The sandwich was good but tasted like it sat around for a while. Which may explain why it took so long to get our order. The salad was good but nothing to write home about. The cilantro lime dressing was the most interesting thing about it. The atmosphere did look spacious and cozy and def good for young kids (they have a kids area). Patio seemed nice too but too cold to try. However, the tables where we sat were a bit disheveled and dirty. Overall the service seemed nice but lacking - the service at the register seems a bit overwhelmed and distracted despite the few customers in line. As I mentioned before, the order took around 10 min to come out and the sandwich seemed cold and a bit stale.   Would def try again giving the story they tell and support for the community. Just hope they can improve the service."
"This neighborhood isn't typically known for having nice, cozy cafes, but the Green Tomato Cafe definitely serves the community well.  I got off at the CTA Central Park Pink line station and was trying to locate where this place was.  The surroundings were slightly bare, but not extremely shady during the day.  Unfortunately, all the walkways leading toward the cafe weren't shoveled or plowed to a degree that pedestrians could comfortably walk on them.My arduous journey soon ended upon entering to this spacious, well-lit place.  I placed my ordered at the counter and was surprised how extensive the menu was. I got a 16 oz. mocha and the chicken po'boy.  I liked the atmosphere, but I loved the food more!  The sandwich was exquisite.  Whoever made this is so talented and deserves a big accolade from this happy customer.  The homemade chips were one of the best chips I've ever consumed in my mouth!  There's no exaggerating.  That's just how delicious they were, without a doubt.  The mocha was also spot-on.  I know it's quite a travel down to the Lawndale neighborhood, but I will be coming for those chips most definitely.  I didn't realize other than utilizing the CTA Central Park Pink line station, the CTA 82 (Kimball/Homan) bus is also accessible from Central Park and Ogden.  The CTA 82 bus (northbound) goes through the north part of Little Village--Lawndale--Garfield Park--Humboldt Park--Logan Square--Avondale--Irving Park--Albany Park--North Park and terminates in Lincolnwood, a village that borders the city of Chicago.  Thus, if you're one of the CTA bus lovers like myself, it's FYI."
"I was really looking forward to my new here as there are 4.5/5 stars as the average review. Unfortunately, I was a tad disappointed with my meal. Perhaps it was my selection but I felt that my sandwich and apple slaw both lacked flavor. I ordered the veggie sandwich and the apple slaw. The plate also came pepper potato chips and berry tea. All in all, the meal was barely mediocre. I don't think I'll be back any time soon."
This is one of my favorite places in Chicago. And they offer bottomless coffee! Why go to Starbucks when you can go to Green Tomato?
"The coffee was amazing, their $1.50 brownies were moist and delicious, the salad I ordered was crisp and fresh (actually taste the difference), and they have complementary cucumber water.. this place is a little piece of heaven on earth."
"Super awesome atmosphere, nicely located in the same area as my doctor, dentist and down the street from wic. Nice welcoming employees! Really knew how to greet a gal from California :)"
"I work in the area. I've tried their TBR and chicken chili. The chicken chili was different than I expected, but good. It was not as thick as I would have liked. The TBR is really good and a great choice for the price. I usually add avocado and its perfection. Place can be a little slow at times, but still recommend for food and a space (eating/meeting)."
This place is incredible. Excellent food in an area that you would last expect it. The people are wonderful. I support their mission. Making a difference. I will support their business ESPECIALLY since it's in my area.
"I really have no complaints. The cafe is warm, clean and spacious. The food is affordable. If you need to have a meeting or just sit and write, this is a cool place to go.Some people may be put off by the Christian music playing but it didn't bother me. The cafe is an extension to the clinics and gym in the nearby area, these facilities are all Christian based, from my understanding.I think its a great positive addition to the North Lawndale community and a good place to stop by for post workout smoothie. I've had a simple grilled cheese which comes with salt and pepper kettle chips with a smoothie. On a later date, I stopped in for a coffee. The coffee was okay, not the best I ever had but I would get it again."
"I'd never break one of my bones for a sandwich, but Green Tomato Cafe might just be incentive enough for a sprain or something. It's located inside the Lawndale Christian Health Center so if you get some bad news about your blood work at least you can get a tasty lunch, some coffee, and free wifi on your way out. It's cheap, charming, cozy, and clean. Between the fireplace, couches, and dollar fifty drips you'll feel like you're in the comfort of your own home only with way better grub. Most of the menu items are relatively healthy and all for around only 5 bones. Parking is pretty easy and there's tons of seating inside which is pretty much inviting you to go get that weird growth on your back checked out and then eat lunch here afterwards."
"This place is pretty much a hidden gem, its located in the Lawndale health center right across from their fitness center. And just the ticket after getting your workout on at the Lawndale fitness center. They have a pretty decent selection of food, and they all seem to be pretty healthy. They also have some smoothie options, all of which are delicious, and just the boost you sometimes need after an intense workout. They also have some very tasty sandwich and salad options.  I like that they are located right across from the fitness facility. And you are free to sit and use their Wi-Fi even if you don't make a purchase, it's a pretty warm and inviting space. I don't always stop by here after the gym but when I know I need a quick boost after my workout this is definitely a stop I make and I am never disappointed. I even stopped by here once just to experience their breakfast and was pleasantly surprised, they had standard breakfast fare. I had a breakfast sandwich which was really tasty and I absolutely loved the coffee. All in all this is a great little spot."
"Great, clean, mellow environment with nice food options. A great way to unwind after work and/or a great work out. The staff is friendly and fast and the food is good. It doesn't weigh you down, so you feel comfortable after a great workout."
"Green Tomato, where have you been all my life? LOL I love their salads and smoothies!!! Day 1: I had the Little Village Ensalada with their roasted chicken. It was so big that my husband and I was able to share it. Had the cup of chicken chili verde which was good to me but not to my husband. I also had the lean green smoothie which was good, not too sweet but could've been a little sweeter. Last but not least, the brownie!!!! ;-) oh so delicious!!!Day 2: Hubby went back per request for the same salad, the fruity smoothie (forgot the name), and another brownie today. The salad was missing the tortilla chips so I was kinda bummed out about it. I loved the fruity smoothie and of course the brownie was sooooo good! My hubby surprised me with their chicken po' boy and I must say that it was delicious (even though we shared it, I wanted my own). All in all, I love it and I'm so glad that it's in my own backyard!"
"Been here three times, always a super positive experience! The sandwiches are substantial and the chicken chili verde is one of the best.  sometimes the tables are wobbly but things like that are an easy fix so not real problem there.The price is unbeatable!!!"
"An absolute great deal. $4-5 salads, $1.50 cup of joe, $5 sandwiches. The garden salad with chicken and basil vinaigrette I had was fresh and tasty. Felt like I was blasting away the cholesterol from my Taco Bell meal earlier that day. Generous portions for the price. Seriously. These same exact dishes could easily cost twice as much. Plus the ambiance is great! Clean, kid friendly, comfortable... Could spend all day here."
"Ahh Green tomato cafe you have gained  a loyal costumer for life!! I'm not kidding! this place is awesome! :) fire place, couches, coffee, tea, kids friendly, free wi fi, healthy food.... You can't go wrong! I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was soooo good! I seriously considered to order another one to go!! The prices are very reasonable,  the staff is warm and attentive, the food is nutritious and tasty.Green tomato cafe..... I WILL BE BACK!!!!"
"Very nice staff. Clean. Wholesome ingredients. Real food. Healthy. Vegan. Not Vegan. A lit bit for everyone. This place has a relaxing vibe. I call it pleasant. Nice place to chill, study, share with a friend."
"This place is very strange because of the weird christian-y vibes, BUT other than that it is completely amazing. One of the only places to get healthy delicious food in the neighborhood. Everything I have ever had there was nothing short of amazing, and that Strawberry Lemonade will end your life because you are going to crave it forever. Everyone is really nice but people look at you weird in there if you are lookin like a weirdo (which I always am)"
I am so grateful to have this place in the neighborhood. The food is delicious- try the verde chicken chili soup!
Green cafe has so many options! The staff is so sweet.This place couldn't get any better!
"The po boy is a very tasty and affordable. Don't get me started on the smoothies, just pure goodness!!!"
"great place to get your morning shake!they have their green smothies and peanut butter smothie that are always great to start the day with. Unless you want some food, then their ogden or pulaski sandwhich are another choice!For lunch i always get their Po Bo Sandwhich! another great meal. the Cafe is very welcoming and friendly! FREE WIFI"
"Excellent cafe housed by an exceptional organization.The food is very tasty, & the prices are extremely reasonable. We recommend the Chicken BBQ Sandwich. Never fails to satisfy!"
"I came back and had the chicken po' boy with no mayo and the black eye pea salad, the lemonade,  the house chips and a chai latte with soy and of course, the chicken chili verde. (This was on 3 separate occasions,  of course). The sandwich was moist and grilled to perfection,  but it lacked seasoning. I did not get sick or anything.  The staff is still very friendly,  but I feel they work poor Teshauna, the foh person, to death, especially during lunch. She answers phones, makes drinks, serves frozen yogurt, collects money, takes orders, cleans the counters, bus tables. EVERYTHING. I always leave a litte tip in the tip jar, for her, SHE deserves it. Overall,  I would go back and for heavens sake, GET TESHAUNA SOME HELP!!!"
"I initially didn't have very high expections for this cafe opening up on the first floor of a health center/fitness center, but from the moment I walked in, I was blown away.All the furniture is brand new, and the cafe itself has a very modern feel to it. There are two areas within the cafe - a quiet area with high chairs and seating looking out the window as well as couches and armchairs, meant for those who will be studying and doing work. Next to this is a louder area with the usual tables and chair, meant for those who are chatting and enjoying a good meal.The service was superb - the wait staff were friendly and very attentive. I ordered a BBQ pulled chicken sandwich which came with chips and a black-eye pea salad, and everything was fresh and tasty. The cappuccino was a little sub-par, but I expect them to get better at making espresso drinks with time.Overall a great place to go, whether you're looking for a place to eat with friends or to spend an afternoon working."
"Took my daughter for breakfast and they had a kid's menu. My daughter doesn't like grilled cheese sandwiches (yes, she's a picky eater) but that's all they had. I convinced her to try it and she finished it! That was impressive because she had trouble finishing one egg. She also ordered their PB&O smoothie but it was too thick for her so she gave it to me (she was right about the thickness, but then again it IS peanut butter and oatmeal). I had a bottomless cup of Joe and it was great. The cashier seemed like she was having a bad day, though; she was not friendly towards my (very shy, nervous-to-talk-to-new-people 9yo) and when I asked her something about the soup of the day she responded in an agitated tone. When I went to get my refill for the cup of Joe, there was a different cashier and he was very amiable. I look forward to going there again, hopefully the cashier will be friendlier."
"Just tried this place for the first time yesterday and I was so excited to find a option in the neighborhood that was not only healthy, but really yummy! Try the chicken chopped salad and the lean green protein shake :)"
"What's not to love about GTC? Well, for me, it's the distance from my home in Logan Square... but if you live in the southwest side, there's no reason why this place shouldn't be your go-to cafe.First, this place is GREAT for groups. It's huge, yet cozy, with a lounge area, an area with a dozen or so tables of two, and even a long family-style table that would be perfect for study groups. Nice patio outside for sunny days.I like to decor too: clean and breezy, modern, and a bit industrial. I haven't tried the coffee yet, but I was very impressed with my BBQ sandwich. It looked a little different because the sauce is green tomato-based, but it was so, SO good!This place is also Christian-friendly, which means you can do your praisin', prayin', and hallelujah-in' here without (too many) weird looks."
"Best place to eat in the neighborhood. They are very local, healthy, sustainable and do a lot to support the community. I love love love this place. Their salads...... Oh boy!"
"I'm a fan, but the service is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W.  I only have a 30-minute window and it took almost 20 minutes from the time I ordered until it was ready, not including my commute time.  I really enjoy the soups and smoothies and the ambiance is really enjoyable...and oasis in a food desert."
"I love Green Tomato Cafe because they are a positive force in the Lawndale community. The cafe is beautiful, and warm, the staff is friendly, and it's the kind of place that you want to go and stay all day. This cafe satisfies a need in this community which would be considered a food dessert, with fresh, healthy foods. There are several food selections including salads, sandwiches, soups and desserts. I enjoyed one of their salads, and the berry cake. Very good. They also have several varieties of loose leaf tea, which I like because I enjoy tea vs. coffee.  It's under the same roof as a health center, so don't be surprised when you get there. The patrons are diverse in so many ways and I love that - everyone from professionals, students, blue collar etc. -  some of everyone just having a nice time. They also have an open mic night the last Friday of the month, which is a nice low-key alternative to going out on the town. This cafe is doing great things for the community, which is why I don't mind driving out of my way to get there - I love to support businesses that support the community! Tell your friends and check it out. It's worth it."
"Wow, definitely the new go-to cafe on the Westside. GTC is beautiful & spacious, and I love their staff - so welcoming. The prices are right, & their sammies/soups are tasty. I did note that their pastry selection is not that extensive, maybe b/c they emphasize health (they are located in a health/fitness center after all).  There's a parking lot for free parking, and unmetered street parking as well.  There's not much else to do around this area, but GTC is pretty much as good as it gets for anyone looking to camp out in a cafe."
"I am someone who works in the North Lawndale community with schools and it is wonderful to have this cafe to go to, not only because of the diverse food options they offer  but also because of the work that this cafe (and development organization) is doing in this community. Their breakfast is wonderful; try the Ogden Sammie with a side of hashbrowns! Never fails to satisfy."
"Good healthy food. Generous portions. Good prices. Employs people from the community. Fresh, clean atmosphere. Definitely recommended."
"Love the Po' Boy Sandwich but the bread is consistently really dry on all the sandwiches (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  The smoothies are great!  For being in Lawndale, the vibe/atmosphere is excellent.  If you find yourself in Lawndale and need to schedule a business appointment, the ""GTC"" is the place to go.  Also, friendly staff."
"Satisfying food, refreshing & filling but not too heavy. Love the feel of the interior, Cozy  feel and decor but very clean."
Great cafe on the southwest side of Chicago.  All of the food is delicious with a lot of different options and at reasonable prices! The front area is especially cozy in the fall/winter seasons with a fireplace and couches.  Also love the kid area!
"While this cafe was originally intended to serve as an alternatitve healthy option in a neighborhood full of fast food restaurants, I would come to the Green Tomato Cafe from my home in Lakeview. The menu isn't huge, but the items on it pack a punch. The BBQ chicken sandwich is delicious--complete with apple slaw! At price of less than $5 for a sandwich and chips, you can't beat this value. There are breakfast options until 11 AM, soups, sandwiches, salads for lunch, a full coffee & espresso bar, and even smoothies and frozen yogurt!The atmosphere is polished and peaceful, but a great space for community. The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. Since the cafe is associated with a health clinic, the staff are trained to give as good of service to the customers as the doctors do to patients.I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"
Beautiful. Clean design. Free WiFi. Super delicious smoked chicken sandwich.
