Kingsbury Street Cafe
"The breakfast/ brunch here is great. The menu has an array of unique options that are all delicious. I went with a group of 6 and we all ordered different items and nobody had any complaints. Between the deviled eggs, scrambles, pancakes and hashes, everyone was satisfied with their meals. The wait can be long and it gets really crowded inside so you may have to wait outside. They had our table ready for a while but did not seat us because they said they needed menus, which was a little odd. Overall good food and I do recommend!"
"I was hoping for great things at Kingsbury and I was disappointed.We arrived around 1:45 P.M. on Saturday. The restaurant was two-thirds full, with the outdoor tables turning over. I was hoping we would be able to get one, but we had 3 parties in front of us who arrived about 30 seconds before we hopped in line.It wasn't a good start. We waited for what it seemed to be 10 minutes just to speak to the host. We were going to have a party of 3 or 4, and when we stated that our 4th member may not come, that seemed to cause a crisis for the male host.We eventually were seated, and things did not get better. Our menus arrived and we browsed, then waited, and waited, and waited. My brother finally went up to the host and made sure that they knew our 4th wouldn't be coming (we weren't sure but we didn't want to delay service; ended up being delayed anyways!)When our waiter arrived, we were ready to order. My friend order the Piggy Moo sandwich or whatever it's called, along with a bloody Maria. My brother ordered the Kingsbury breakfast, which came with eggs, bacon, roasted potatoes, roasted tomatoes, and their whole wheat buttered toast.  I created my own omelette with leaks, mushrooms, and peppers. I had a choice of potatoes or tomatoes, and opted for the latter. The toast (whole wheat) was also included. I added a side of sautéed spinach as well.My friend's bloody Maria was terrible and he barely took 2 sips. His sandwich was good; he was full and saved his potatoes and half of his sandwich for tomorrow. My brother enjoyed his bacon the most. He also said that the hot sauce on his scrambled eggs was good. As for me, my omelette was just okay. Not great, but nothing made me go 'Wow.' I was given potatoes instead of my requested tomatoes, but was given the latter after mentioning it. They both were very good.My meal was 13.50. Our total was 49 and change. I went up with two 20s to get change and was told by the male host to go to the bar. Not a problem, but I was very irked by his overall demeanor, to be honest with you. I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this guy just rubbed me the wrong way. Our server was good; no complaints there. Food came out relatively quickly, too.There's nothing that is going to make me come back to this place, especially with x amount of restaurants in the area. The overall experience was not good."
"Went here Memorial Day weekend for lunch.It took us forever to get seated. Not only did some mature male decide to cut me in line, but the host was aloof to what was going on.We got seated by about 2 PM. We got water from the bus boy (SHOUT OUT), but our server was MIA. For about 15 minutes, we waited to get coffee and my friend got a Bloody Mary which he took two sips of and HATED!The food was actually really good. Our server didn't come by until 15 minutes in and did not come back to check on us either.They messed up my brothers' order. Food was awesome. Best toast I have had in a while. The maple glazed bacon was awesome, too.I won't be back. I'll stick to Kanela or Horizon Cafe."
"Piggy Cluck Moo sandwich is my recommendation. But you really can't order anything bad here. Bakery items won't disappoint either. Fresh ingredients with a modern ambience. The servers and baristas have always been friendly. Making a reservation is best for parties of 4 or more, especially on the busy weekends. Usual quiet during the weekday mornings  before business hours which can be conducive to breakfast meetings. Otherwise, when it's a full house, the noise level is high. Across from the Whole Foods so the traffic can be moderately heavy and the buzzer from the WF garage can be distracting, if you're seated in the outside patio."
"Great brunch! Awesome food , friendly and budget friendly as well.try the piggy moo !"
"I wanted to like it more. On my first visit a few years ago, I remembered Kingsbury as having the best chai tea latte I've ever had.  It was spicy, it was flavorful, and it was comforting.  The sandwich I tried on that occasion (cluck moo oink?) was ordinary, and I remember eyeing the pastry case on the way out.  Muffins, cookies, and the like are piled high!  Talk about eating with your eyes!Flash forward to March 2015, and I decided it was time to return for brunch with some friends.  Easy reservation on OpenTable!  Be prepared for an energetic atmosphere; the acoustics in the space will make it hard to carry on a focused conversation. I ordered the chai tea latte, and it was disappointing because it was lukewarm at best.  Also, our waiter Ben disappeared and didn't return for a while, so by the time he came back (after our meals were served), I just forgot about telling him about the temp problem.  For brunch, I usually don't opt to burger, but I was craving some heavy protein, so I went with the bacon burger, ordered medium.  Burger was really dry and took a lot of chewing; bun was also too much bread and added to the dryness.  My friend's lemon pancakes, though they looked delectable, were notably bland (whaaa!). Last note: good luck with parking!  We were lucky and found a street spot right outside, but it's a busy area by North/Clybourn with a large Whole Foods across the street."
This place is great which is in Lincoln park area. I went here two times with my husband and then with my friends. The wait wasn't long at all which we waited for 10 minutes. The restaurant decor is really nice with plenty of seating inside and some outdoor seating. Each time I went I had the same waiter and he was great and attentive to my needs. I must the say the food is amazing and so tasty and delicious. I had the tomato quiche twice which they only serve on weekends and the other time I had the kingsbury breakfast. My friends love there cheese scone and even had to take one to go. I am glad this restaurant came on check please. I would come back here in a heartbeat and recommended to others. You can't go wrong with this place and I am always trying out new breakfast places.
"Wait and location aside, this place is deserving of of 4.5 stars but our server wasn't that great either. Some may consider it pricy too, but no more than most other chic brunch spots in the city. Between 3 of us, we got a house Bloody Mary, a Cappuccino and a Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk. All our beverages were really good. For food we ordered a Kingsbury cafe eggs Benedict, the Egg white frittata and I got the salmon hash.  The BBQ chicken in the Benedict was certainly unique and very tasty. The inside of the space is bright, clean and very warm and inviting. I would certainly go back to try of the traditional lunch menu items."
"Bright, warm and inviting this place is a great spot for brunch. The food is great! however the service is a little slow. Between the three of us we ordered BBQ Chicken Benedict, Egg white shrimp frittata and Salmon Hash with poached eggs. Everything was delicious and fresh. The vietnamese coffee is a must try here, as it is not as sweet as the traditional coffee. I loved the House Bloody Mary too. This was my second visit to the place and definitely it has now become one of my new favorite brunch spots!"
Arrived 30 minutes before closing but we were still seated. Our orders taken and the food was delivered promptly. Presentation was amazing and taste even better! I had the Lemon pancakes and bacon. You don't need syrup because the Lemon sauce is perfection. My son had a burger. He doesn't really chew but sorta inhales his food. I guess it was good.  My daughter had salmon and egg benedict. She was really impressed. It was so much she couldn't eat it all. I ate here about 4 times a couple years back then had an issue with the food (hair in it) and the lack of concern by my server and management caused me to avoid it for about a year. I returned because my daughter wanted to try the place.  Glad I came back.
"Great place for brunch! Beautiful space, good service, and great food! I had an omelette with turkey bacon, spinach, & Swiss cheese. The omelette was large and it also came with potatoes and toast which where also good. Service was attentive & quick. Looking at the menu their lunch items look good as well so I will definitely be back to try out lunch."
I've only ever had their B.A.L.T (bacon avocado lettuce tomato) chicken sandwich and it is amazing!!! Their spicy mayo is so good as well. It's a huge sandwich so I don't eat the bread on the second half and I always say I'm going to save some for later but end up eating it all. So Delish!!!!
"Bright, open space and really delicious food make this the perfect spot for brunch. The Lemon Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and Kingsbury Benedict were all fantastic-the Benedict is made with pulled bbq chicken and sautéed spinach, a great twist on a classic. The pancakes were soft and fluffy and the bright lemon sauce and crème anglaise were the perfect complements. They can get fairly busy on the weekends, but don't worry-you'll have their line-up of pastries to drool over while you wait."
"Cute breakfast spot. My mother and I went here on a recommendation from the instructor at the spin studio we had just worked out at. Bright and spacious, I liked the ambiance. The food was good! We both had omelettes with veggies and cheese. I also had the veggie sausage and I thought that was pretty good too. I like the potatoes. Everything tasted fresh and healthy.Service was slow and a little spacey, but I would be back for sure!"
"Three of us went here recently and the whole experience was rather meh. We waited almost an hour (to be expected, we had no reservations and it was a Sunday). The food (breakfast sandwich, salmon hash, and chilaquiles) was all average, definitely not worth the price tag. We did have a lovely helpful waitress, and the space is bright and delightful, even on the rainy day we came. Overall okay, but won't be coming back for sit down brunch.The pastries are very good- pop in to take one to go!notjustbrunch.wordpress.…"
"This place was middle ground for us. I didnt really find the food outstanding in terms of taste or variety. I did really like the vietnamese coffee- I had it cold, I would get this each time I go there. We also liked the devilled eggs- they come with chorizo on top but that doesnt really add to the taste sadly, more the texture. We got a side of maple bacon too, this was also well made. We tried the special- the shrimp with cheddar bacon and a fried poached egg on top- while this sounds amazing, it wasnt really out of the ordinary, and we also tried the lemon pancakes. they come with a lemon sauce on top which can be rather tart but the rest of the sauce is nice. The pancakes were a little dry to me. I like the look and feel of the place, nice open space with high-ish ceilings and minimal atmosphere. The service was pretty good- only one lapse when we asked for sweetner for our coffee and that never showed but we just grabbed some from the next table."
"It was very difficult to decide what to order. Every dish that the servers brought out looked absolutely incredible. We decided to go with the eggs Benedict with pork and carrot pancakes. Every bite got better. It was hard to leave knowing that we don't have restaurants in my hometown that even remotely resemble the flavor and unique dishes that this place serves. We also had a couple bloody Mary's, which were pretty good and the perfect addition to brunch."
I enjoyed my meal and the service was friendly and timely. Sitting outside made for a nice atmosphere and we were not rushed. It's hard to imagine not liking any of the food here based on all three of us enjoying our meals.
"My husband and I were excited to try the lunch menu but didn't realize until we arrived that that menu isn't available on Saturdays. Fortunately there was something for both of us on the brunch menu that satisfied our taste buds. We had the steak and pepper sandwich, which was tender and yummy. The spring chop salad had a great light lemony dressing, which was refreshing and light."
"10 stars for kingsbury cafe.I went here recently with a date and we wanted to try so many items. My date got 2 breakfast entrees!!  What a woman!!! :D She got the salmon hash which she LOVED and the lemon pancakes which she also loved.I got a delicious breakfast sandwich called piggy moo cluck sandwich. Yum as ever! Came with breakfast potatoes.In the spirit of ordering 2 things I got a chocolate chip muffin toasted with butter. It was delightful.The only hiccup I had was when I ordered an ice mocha the person who dropped it at the table (not our waiter) said ""here is your latte"" I said this is not a mocha to the waiter and he returned some time later to say. ""They said it IS a mocha but how did you want it to be differently and they'll make you another"". I had to say ""well there was absolutely no chocolate in that drink so starting there I guess is what I would like.""  When he returned to the table he definitely had an iced mocha so I felt a lot better.  My date had an alcoholic drink which she liked but I cannot remember the type however I do remember a lot of fruit and it was very boozy. She liked it.Service was great in fact since she ordered two entrees the server offered to warm her pancakes up since she had let them cool considerably while having the salmon hash.Despite going around 11:30am on a Sunday the wait was only about 20 minutes. It was a cool rainy day tho and patio was closed."
"Luckily no wait for us (group of 3) on Friday around 12:30, but place was still quite busy.Nice that they have a counter in the front to grab a pastry and coffee to go. Loved the open space. So refreshing to go to a brunch spot and actually be somewhat intimate, without the hectic chaos of traditional brunch diners.After reading other reviews, I opted to build my own omelette. I originally was taken aback by the idea, as I tend to think that restaurants should have a clear idea of their own concoctions. However, at Kingsbury they had both. My omelette had gruyere, jalapenos, leeks and turkey sausage. This just may have been one of the best omelettes I've ever had, and I think I would say the same if I had chosen different ingredients. They just really know how to make an omelette here. Not only that, but they did not skimp on the ingredients at all. The accompanied potatoes were fine but the multigrain toast was delicious. Loved how it was in a biscotti form, as it was not only easier to eat, but looked nice as well. Also thought that the omelette option was good bang for your buck, as the portion was quite generous, and starts out at $10 for 3 ingredients and just $1 more for every additional ingredient, so mines was only $11.Sis thought her tofu miso scramble was a tad salty while cousin thought his shrimp egg white frittata was quite bland. We also shared the lemon pancakes and these were amazing. Super light and fluffy with a perfect lemony, not-too-sweet glaze.Service was pretty good. Server and staff were friendly and waters were refilled when necessary.Overall, would love to come back. Omelettes and lemon pancakes are where it's at!"
"Magnificent!  Someone recommended this wonderful  little establishment and we went on a weekday for a late breakfast. The food is OUTSTANDING!  The place has a very clean, stylish design.  There are very high ceilings, so it can be a bit noisy but you can still hear your companion without shouting. There is slightly an open kitchen and you can see the chefs working their magic.  The food is just simply devine!  We had the whole wheat carrot pancakes with cream cheese and toasted pecans.  This is an outstanding riff on carrot cake. The pancakes weren't dry, as whole wheat can be, very tender and with a small dollop of syrup (which came on the side in a cute little crock) you could taste all those wonderful flavors without getting knocked over by richness or sweetness, it was balanced and VERY tasty!  Next we had the egg white frittata with roasted tomato and kale with three perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp and a sprinkling of feta (you could choose goat cheese too). This too was simply amazing!  It was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and was light and very flavorful. The coffee comes in a huge mug and is ""Starbucks grade"" (yum!) the cream comes in its own individual chilled crock, no prepackaged creamer crap here!  We each had a small freshly squeezed OJ (double yum!). Service was nice, friendly and but just a tad slow.    The menu is diverse and I am going to make it my job to try it all!  I just don't think you can go wrong here!  There may be a wait but it is soooooo worth it.   I love this little slightly hidden gem, but it's across from whole foods so there's your landmark to find it. Double win because I can eat here and shop there!  Our tab was $46, I think that's on point for the exceptional food we had. I think the ingredients used , preparation and presentation are reflective of the price, and very ""worth it"" to me.This is a place you want on your radar, get there soon, you will be delighted you did!"
"Kingsbury Street Cafe is def a contender for one of the top brunch spots in the city. Tucked away behind some trees across from Lincoln Park Whole Foods, there's nothing too fancy about the place as an outsider. Once you walk in, you get a very modern and relaxed vibe with their 20ft ceilings and interior design. Everything is extremely creative and unique from their cocktail menu to their brunch menu to their dessert menu. I had the standard kingsbury street cafe meal with two eggs, potatoes, roasted tomatoes, hand crafted turkey patties, and a cheddar croissant. They bloody marys and mimosas here are also pretty damn good! If dessert is your thing then give the chocolate raspberry cupcake a try... It's worth it."
"Well where do I start? I wanted so bad to love this place but I'm a bit disappointed.The service was friendly. No complaints there.The food: disappointing!I had a bakon bloody and the presentation was nice but I felt it lacked some zing. My sister ordered the shrimp frittata and she said there was way too much tomato flavor, considering there was two whole plum roasted tomatoes plopped on her plate I don't doubt it. So if you're not a fan of tomato, ask them to omit when ordering that dish. I ordered the kingsbury special, 2 eggs, maple bacon, potatoes and a roasted tomato. The maple bacon was delicious, the potatoes were hard and bland. Tomato and eggs were fine, not much you can do wrong there. It came with a cheddar scone, which I also felt lacked flavor. The coffee was good.Over all, I am glad I can finally say I have been but I doubt I will be returning."
"Maybe this hit the spot because I was starving, but it was the best brunch I've had in a long time. Perfectly prepared breakfast. I ordered the Kingsbury breakfast which is simply Eggs, Potatoes, a meat, and a cheddar scone. The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked, soft, moist, eggy. The potatoes were perfectly cooked, browned on the outside, soft on the inside, nicely seasoned. The cheddar scone was to die for, moist, just a little cheesy. I had the veggie meat patties which weren't awesome but with some ketchup, passable. I don't fault the restaurant, it's soy after all. I thought the stewed tomatoes were a weird addition to the breakfast but no harm done. The service was pretty fast and attentive. Two of my fellow diners had the salmon hash with tater tots which looked amazing. There were alot of things worth trying here. Wish I could go back!"
"Really good brunch option. Would not normally come in this area for brunch but we too a chance and worked out. Great service and big dinning area with an option outdoor patio. We lucked out with beautiful whether when we were there and decided to eat outside. Great move. We then tried a latte and regular coffee which came fast then we got my son's pancakes. He was a little disapointed that the berry pancakes did not have the berries already inside but really liked them anyway. I had the kingsberry plate with eggs, potatoes, roasted tomatoes, maple bacon, and a beautiful cheddar scone. Very good. My wife had the BBQ chk Benedict and she was happy as well. We has a chocolate covered strawberry from their dessert counter and it was a nice treat to end the meal. Would come again for sure."
"Interesting menu,breakfast is good but the best thing is blueberry muffin served warm with butter.yum yum yum!"
"If you want a breakfast dining pleasure this is the place. The lemon pancakes and the whole wheat carrot pancakes are the best on the planet!! Absolutely  dangerously good. Service was good, have patience, they are always busy. The Vietnamese coffee was different( good), I would highly recommend. ( I don't ever write reviews, but had to tell the world )"
"Food is absolutely delicious.  I had their kingsbury market salad and my stomach is rumbling from just thinking about it.  Yes, it's just a salad you say, but the ingredients are so fresh it just really adds to the flavor.  Only reason I couldnt give it a 5 is that it is definitely on the pricy side and unless you can find street parking, with validation, parking is $8. ouch."
"My sweetie took me to lunch at Kingsbury St Café after hearing about it from a friend. We were especially eager to try it out because we had been big fans of  Work Of Art, it's parent. It's a very nice addition to the burgeoning shopping expanse of the Clybourn Corridor.The place serves breakfast and lunch all day on weekdays and brunch on weekends. It's a large, bright, airy space, comfortably casual. Service was friendly and a bit leisurely, which suited us on our recent visit. I think anyone could find something appealing on the menu, which features American café favorites with a few Vietnamese influences. In addition to a variety of coffees, teas and soft drinks, there was a small selection of beers not on the menu (I did not inquire about wines).We each had sandwich plates, and they were generous. My pork belly bánh mì was tasty, though a bit messy to eat; it was served on a toasted baguette rather than the traditional soft roll, and the ingredients were not uniformly distributed -- as a result, things kind of oozed out here & there. My sweetie's BLAT with chicken was more composed, and was delicious (the chicken was exemplary in its freshness and good flavor). Each came with a nice small salad of greens and carrot shreds; my only complaint was that the vinaigrette was too vinegary). The BLAT would easily have served two diners; I think it would be a smart choice if they had a half-sandwich option paired with soup or salad.We had a nice lunch. The BLAT sandwich stood out as our favorite, and all the rest was definitely A-OK. I'd surely stop by again if I were in the neighborhood at lunchtime."
"Came here for brunch on Sunday, and it was nice to be able to have a table available right away. I heard about the lemon pancakes and they were really good. I wonder if they offer a half portion though, because after a few bites I was fulfilled. The dish has a nice creme anglaise  & lemon sauce, lemon zest and blueberries, which all worked together well. My husband and I split this with a create your own egg white omelet(roasted red peppers, onions) that was nice and fluffy. The omelet came with well seasoned and roasted fingerling potatoes and some multigrain bread.  I also ordered a large orange juice, which was pricy, but I believe fresh squeezed. Overall this was a nice brunch place, a bit on the pricey side if you order beverages, but the food was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is minimalistic and very bright/airy with the high ceilings. The waitstaff was on point and friendly. We did find free street parking on the block behind the restaurant."
Awesome brunch spot! Two of my friends and I arrived at 1130a on a Sunday and we sat down at 1230p. I've heard there's always a wait on the weekends but we were prepared for that. I had the Benedict and it was so flavorful! My friends both built their own omelettes and also thought they were exceptionally good. They got mimosas and I had their regular Bloody Mary- awesome! Food came quick even tho our waitor was very busy. He did a wonderful job. Would definitely go back.
"This is a great place for breakfast and lunch.  The Benedict's are great, deviled eggs, and if there the shrimp and grits available, make sure you get that too!  This is a really kid friendly place as well.  My wife loved the lemon pancakes.  she is vegetarian and they are very accommodating and have a good selection of veggie options as well."
In ur place right now. We were here for 20 mins looking at an open outside table and u wouldn't seat me because only 2 of 3 of my party was here. I was planning on spending money regardless. Stupid rule.
"I think I had the best fresh fruit parfait I have ever had at Kingsbury Street Café!  It came with large amounts of fresh mixed berries, yummy vanilla yogurt, lots of granola, and the secret ingredient was the lemon zest that threw it over the top!  I also had a side of bacon, it was quite good with a maple flavor , but definitely dripping in grease.  I find many places in Chicago dim and narrow...Kingsbury Street Cafe's ambiance is open and airy with high ceilings, crisp white walls and they have a patio.  When I am back in Chicago I will definitely come back...their omelets looked and smelled delicious!"
"Great....but....Been to KSC several times.  The food is ALWAYS amazing.  Id kill (figuratively) for the deviled eggs.  Theres not a bad item on the menu.HOWEVERI was there yesterday with a big group for my wives birthday.  Food was great, service was perfect...until it was time to pay.  We gave the server a few credit cards to split, with simple, round numbers on each.  The server station was next to my seat, and after 10 minutes, I asked what was taking so long.  He said something about the system, but had no answer.Then I went and asked at the host stand, and was told they had a new system, and had to call the  company because they could not get it to work for us.  Every other table was checking out, but not us.Then I got REALLY upset when the server left all the credit cards laying on the server stand, and he walked away.  Left them there for anybody to steal.  He went to serve other tables, leaving us waiting.Of course, two of us had infants who needed to get home to feed, and another had to get to a class.  Once I complained AGAIN, they somehow got it to work.  But it took 30 minutes from the time I gave the server our cards to get them back. That is inexcusable.  Not sure I would go back with a group with our kids.  Im afraid of being stuck for 30 minutes waiting to pay again."
"Right across from the  Whole Foods on Kingsbury, I dropped in midweek partly out of curiosity and also because of the reviews on Yelp.  The decor is bright and very open though not as industrial as I was expecting... But that's a good thing.  It wasnt particularly busy and so I had no problems with conversation and our server Jenna (?) was solid.  No complaints, all smiles. For me,  it was a must that I try the lemon pancakes.  Heard about them, but they're better in person... trust me.  My partner in crime had the shrimp fritatta and thought it was just ""meh"" tasting, although beautifully presented.  She finished my lemon pancakes... and she doesn't even like pancakes, let her tell it. The masala Chai and fresh fruit made a nice finish to midweek brunch and I'm sure I'll return to Kingsbury Cafe next time for some moo and cluck."
"Come. Here. For. Brunch. And like everyone else has said, get the lemon pancakes - they are absolutely delicious. All of the food was fresh, wonderfully prepared, and the whole vibe of the place is fun. The coffee is delicious and so was the homemade turkey sausage. We'll be back!"
"This place is excellent! The atmosphere is really nice, yet relaxed. We waited about 10 minutes in Saturday morning for a table. Upon being seated we order a couple of house bloody Mary's. They were spicy, but not over the top. You can't governing with Tito's vodka either and that's what the house is made with. We had trouble deciding what to get so we got eggs benedict and whole wheat carrot waffles to share. Both most excellent!!!! The open kitchen made it able to see all the food coming out and we admired each plate. Everything looked so amazing! I def recommend this place!!!!"
"Get their Kingsbury eggs benedict. Just... do it. It's two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce, topped over a pile of delicious pulled BBQ chicken, rested over two fresh pieces of English muffin. Anyways, with that out of the way, I now have yet another contender for favorite brunch place in Chicago. Kingsbury Street Café is a bit misleading, because it's more diner than a café.With bright lighting, large open tables, and tall stools by the side, it's as close to a modern diner as you can get.While they are a bit lacking in the sweet department, their egg based brunch items are amazing. I've tried the Kingsbury Café Breakfast (pretty standard, but those herb potatoes are amazing), Piggy Moo Cluck sandwich (loved the smoked ham with maple glazed bacon) and Kingsbury eggs benedict (delicious on all levels).They've also got some killer coffee, notably the Vietnamese drip coffee. Just know that their Ethiopian and Vietnamese drip coffee don't come with free refills, so if you're lacking some caffeine, stick to their house coffee. They've also got an awesome assortment of pastries and deserts by the front, something I am definitely planning to explore in the future."
Great food!! Loved my order- breakfast chillaquilleMy husband order- shrimp frittata- that was great too :)
Very tasty brunch with many options on the menu. I shared the coconut french toast special and the shrimp egg white frittata with a friend and we were both very satisfied. I love how you're given the option of feta or goat cheese with the fritata and the french toast had just the right amount of sweetness with the added bananas and pudding. Definitely a great spot for brunch with your girlfriends!
"We tried this cafe based on its proximity to the shopping area at North and Clybourn. The decor was very modern and fresh. We had about a 30-minute wait, which wasn't too bad. I ordered the breakfast chilaquiles, which were good, but not great. They were not your typical chilaquiles. They seemed more like a breakfast nachos. The chips were very thick and crisp and everything else was piled on top like how you would make nachos. My girlfriend had the breakfast quinoa and also the chia seed pudding, which we both thought were okay.I wouldn't make any special trips to eat breakfast/brunch here, but it's a good option if you want to eat before shopping in the area."
There's a lot of hype surrounding this place and to me it was honestly just OK.I was 10 minutes late  because of the abysmal parking situation. What brunch place has a valet only parking lot in Lincoln Park? This is not River North or the Loop people...We had a large group and we were seated at the front table near the host stand. It was great to be out of the way except that area of the restaurant was absolutely FREEZING. Between the front door opening and closing and blowing cold air in and being seated next to the large front windows I was not warm for a moment of my time spent there.For my meal I had the steak and pepper sandwich with fries. The sandwich and fries were good but not great. The food took a quite awhile to come and I found it to be a somewhat overpriced for what we were served.Overall I think that Kingsbury is a bit overrated and I think there are a much better spots to go for brunch that are a better bang for your buck and definitely more comfortable and easily accessible.
"So there is no way that a trip to Buy Buy Baby could be even remotely tolerable without stopping first at Kingsbury Cafe. The stuffed French toast (most recently with Nutella) is fantastic. I've had the lemon pancakes and they are good but I prefer the pancakes offered at Davanti Enoteca's brunch. If for whatever silly reason, healthy is what you're going for, the shrimp dish is really good. Hubby did not care for the salmon hash when he had it but really liked the turkey burger on our last visit. Service is always great and good coffee too. At some point we plan to try the pastries."
Nice brunch spot. I had the salmon hash which was good but needed saltWife liked the Benedict but not a fan of the BBQ pork version she boughtGood homemade Bloody MaryPlace was spacious and it was easy to dine with our 1 year old.
"Salmon hash is WAY too fishy; it is blatantly obvious that they don't keep their fish fresh. They need to check their freezer temperature or talk to their provider because salmon should never taste like that.Breakfast chilaquiles is MOSTLY chips. Shouldn't the first ingredient that appears on the menu be what is dominating the dish (scrambled eggs)?? AND I paid $2 extra for chorizo, but didn't know that it meant a sprinkle of what seem to be leftover scraps.Shrimp & grits are a bit better; grits has good flavor but the shrimp is a bit overcooked. Overall, not worth the price.Benedict is very good. Great mesh of flavors and textures. The only thing on the menu I would suggest to any patron.Friendly service, mediocre ambiance. If you must go, at least go on a nice day and get outdoor seating. And smoke some weed so the food tastes better."
"We walked by about 2 pm, and decided to stop for a late lunch on a weekday.  The restaurant is very well decorated, and they lured us in with their pastries right by the door.  We were seated immediately, and given a bottle of water at the table.  Both the service and my veggie burger were great.  Overall a very pleasant experience."
"Have been here a few times but nothing was really remarkable to write about till today. The Nutella stuffed french toast with toasted hazelnuts, creme anglaise, bananas and bacon. What?  Hell yeah. I'm not a sweets person for breakfast or brunch. I'm 99.9% savory and a side order of oancakes. Or just nibble off of my kids' pancakes. But this was calling me. Tomorrow I start some clean eating so this was the last hurrah for a while. And  it was amazing. UGH-MAY-ZING!!!!I had half for brunch. Then the rest for dessert after my dinner that night and while it got gooey and soggy after microwaving it, it was still great!  I will eat Nutella off of anything.... Sh*t dawg!!!  ANYTHING!My only criticism was the impatient waitress. And it was LOUD in there!"
I've been looking for a new brunch spot and I've definitely found it!  Kingsbury Street Cafe is better than most of the popular brunch places in and around Lincoln Park!  Their dishes look like a work of art and taste delicious.  The ambiance is modern yet enjoyable.  I can't wait to go back!
"The food here was good. The cheddar scone particularly was memorable. I came here ready to try the eggs benedict but was disappointed to find out that the weekday menu was much shorter than the weekend menu. The parking situation was annoying- not really any street parking only a $6 valet option. Overall, I'm glad I checked it out."
"Back in my old hood of Chicago! What I miss most of all about Chicago is the food, and this place does not disappoint! I ordered, because I was feeling sassy on a Sunday, the house Bloody Mary (they have all different kinds with tequila, whiskey etc). It was great, spicy, and fresh! You can tell its homemade tomato juice!I had the build your own omelette with egg whites packed full of veggies. I picked the roasted tomato and toast rather than the potatoes. The toast was more like a baguette/biscotti and it was incredible! I got the whole wheat....mmmm! My friend ordered the quinoa and kale which came with an egg on top...wow, it looked amazing and she loved it! They also have lemon pancakes which we didn't order but looked at longingly and envious from afar. Will definitely get those next time I am in town! The decor is minimalist and modern and just perfect! The only thing missing was my husband who was back in Washington, sigh, can't wait to bring him here on our next visit!"
"The place is super cute on the inside and The muffins and cupcakes look like heaven on a plate. However, I was too full to engage in eating one of them. I have the spinach shrimp and egg frittata, my friend had the burger and my other friend had the chili Quiles. We started off with the lemon pancakes as an appetizer. The shrimp dish was presented beautifully but the taste was rather bland. The burger wasn't anything exceptional however the fries were great! The. Lemon pancake was okay too. I would've liked it to have been sweeter. The service was great and we didn't have to wait that long without a reservation. It is a solid brunch location!"
"Well, ended up at Kingsbury street cafe for brunch before catching a play at a nearby theater. This was an unplanned stop and it worked out perfectly.The fresh juices for $4.50 a glass were really nice and refreshing and we could feel our bodies getting healthier with a vitamin boost with every sip.The coffee was definitely the dark type, not my favorite but yet balanced enough, not too sour, not too bitter.The food was the highlight: awesome chilaquiles and good shrimp egg white frittata.Service was efficient with a smile.The only downside: the noise level in the room was awful. We had to shout to carry a conversation and I seriously think they should check the decibel level in that dining room when full. Will be back wearing ear plugs and then it will be a perfect experience."
"I don't really know what happened here, but I'm sure I won't be back.Our group of eight came for brunch this past Saturday morning.  First, I ordered the spiked raspberry lemonade.  For $10, this should have at least featured the ""spiked"" portion of the drink; I asked our server to surprise me, but I didn't realize the surprise would include no alcohol.  The lemonade was tasty, just not $10-and-no-booze-tasty.Then I ordered the Kingsbury Street Breakfast (or whatever the base eggs/toast/meat meal is called here).  But I also ordered a $3.95 Oreo Cupcake from the bakery to come out first...friends, as you will see from my hundreds of other reviews on Yelp, I eat dessert every day.  I do milkshakes and cookies professionally, but I also eat a lot of cupcakes.  The cupcake I had at Kingsbury was the single worst cupcake I have ever eaten.  I don't even know how this is possible, but it LOOKED incredible, big, and I thought it would go down real nice-like.  Uhh, no.  First, it was dry as all get out.  Second, the icing was completely flavorless.  To make sure I wasn't crazy, I let three other tablemates try it.  All agreed--terrible.  Third, it was freakin' $4.  Your sh*t better be good for that price...and it was not.  Fourth, when I sent the majority of this dry, flavorless monstrosity back to the kitchen, the server mentioned that she thought the weekend cupcakes were usually made on Fridays.  It tasted a lot more than just one day old, but hey, that's just me.The Kingsbury Street Breakfast really brought out the truth regarding my experience.  The cheese scone was the best thing I had, but even that didn't have nearly enough cheddar for me.  The sausage, potatoes, eggs and roasted tomatoes were fairly flavorless, very bland, safe, not too filling.  It's a plain breakfast, and I have a lot of friends/colleagues that are trying to watch their sugar/fat intake that would do really well at Kingsbury, if that is your thing.The space is great; the prices are so-so.  You aren't going to make a killing at Kingsbury in the value proposition department, if that is important to you (my wife and I dropped $50 with tip for our portion of this meal...let's just say we didn't get our money's worth).  And the location can be a real pain in the arse in terms of parking on weekends...with the flood-like rains on Saturday, half of the parking spots that were available were underwater!So many other great, distinctive choices for brunch in Chicago that I don't see the need to go back.  Two of my dining mates got the chilaquiles and I took a bite of those as well...that would have been a better option."
"For brunch, this is as good as it gets. The atmosphere is incredible and the food really stands out compared to other brunch places. I got the smoked salmon crostini and chilaquiles . Both to die for. Killer bloody as well"
"If you care about eating all natural, healthy cooked food- this is your destination. Came in after a facial (first notice- I was not professionally dressed and this is a nice cafe) on a weekday afternoon. Few but good amount of diners, a hostess with a friendly greeting right by the front doors, open space, with lots of sunlight coming through the windows. Clean and quiet, it's a great meet up place with a friend or in a middle of a work day. WONDERFUL menu. All natural burgers and I ordered one, and it was thick, and the patty was cooked perfectly medium as requested. Came with largely sliced tomatoes and lettuce, along with a pickle and fresh cut fries on the side. I heard brunch is amazing, and I would come back for that. The reason why I rated this restaurant a 4 instead of 5 was because I was asked by the hostess, who was very friendly, to order 'to go' by the cashier. 4 people working on the staff, and one of the cooks, after a few minutes of waiting, said '2 more minutes.' He didn't make any eye contact, no greeting, but for not being so busy, and it being during lunch hour, I felt patience was key, but i'm surprised they didn't get to me sooner. I waited for 10 minutes for my food, but that's okay. I know they cook everything fresh, and they did offer me water or to order a drink, but I should've received attention more quickly. I do believe that if I was dining here, it probably would have been a quicker notice. I think this cafe does strive to improve and do it's best. Great location next to Whole Foods. So if you want to grab lunch without it being an overwhelming experience at Whole Foods, then this is another great option!"
Loved the food !! Tight on special request over all good service
"A pal of mine jokingly said about the menu, ""So, it's white people food."" You know what I'm talking about...tea infused oatmeal, quinoa granola, etc. etc. But, I just happen to be a white people, and I loved it. We went for breakfast/brunch, and the food was amazing. The restaurant is very cute, clean lines, open space. Nice patio if you are able to snag a seat, because it's tiny. I did, in fact, have the tea infused oatmeal with all kinds of delicious toppings (goji berries, candied walnuts). My sisters had some sort of amazing moo cluck breakfast sandwich on ciabatta and an omelet. I tried both, and both were awesome. Especially the sandwich. Let's just break it down, white girl summary style:Pros:1) Great food2) Cool atmosphere3) Casual4) Patio5) Nice selection of baked goods, tooCons:1) THE COFFEE. I can't stress this enough. It was so strong and bitter that both my sister and I had to have the waitress pour half of it out and fill it with water. Apparently this is a common issue. Very sad for coffee lovers everywhere, especially since the water didn't really help.2) Cost. I don't live in Chi town anymore, so I'm not used to $7-9 for oatmeal. Eek.I would go back, but, I would not order the coffee."
The lemon pancakes & the Kingsbury cafe breakfast are delicious!  Have been a couple times and the staff is always nice and on top of things. They handled our big groups well each time and the wait usually isn't as long as they say.
"This brunch started off right when my mimosa came in a giant flute and was 70% champagne. We sat outside under the shade of a nearby tree next to window boxes of herbs. I ordered the mushroom quiche with side salad and an order of bacon. Everything was perfect. Hot, and rich with an abundance of mushrooms mixed with fresh and tangy with spicy arugula topped off with BACON! Seriously this bacon though you guys. It had a GLAZE. Possibly maple? Possibly liquid crack? 3 slices of heaven that the entire table was salivating over. If you go here and don't get bacon, go straight to the nearest sanitorium. Oh, you're vegan and don't eat bacon?? Excellent, more for me! My only regret was not getting a bloody mary in case there was bacon in it. tl;dr: go here and order a mimosa and bacon."
"This place was really cute inside - high ceilings, a little pastry section, and an open kitchen.  We were seated promptly, and our server was pretty pleasant.  I tried their Strawberry & Watermelon Fresh Fruit Cooler (had a weird aftertaste; probably from the watermelon) and their Masala Chai Tea Latte (big mug, but more foam than the tea).  For eats, we ordered the Kingsbury Cafe Breakfast (which came with 2 fresh organic eggs, roasted tomato, herb potatoes, cheddar scone, and maple glazed bacon), the Deviled Eggs (with crispy chorizo and chives), the Chia Seed Breakfast Pudding (with orange, blueberry, strawberry, almond milk, agave, and sliced almonds), Oatmeal Brulee (brown sugar crust, apple-cinnamon-raisins compote), Whole Wheat Carrot Pancakes (with maple cream cheese, pecans, and maple syrup), and a Create Your Own Omelette.  I enjoyed the cheddar scone as it was moist, tasty, and definitely not dry as I expected most scones to be.  the deviled eggs were tasty and were filled up to the max with the fillings, and the crispy chorizo strings on top were a nice added touch.  The oatmeal was pretty good, and the chia pudding tasted healthy (but would need more sprousing of the agave honey that came with).  I enjoyed the carrot pancakes with the maple cream cheese - not too sweet or not too bland.  It was a pleasant breakfast, but I thought it was a little too pricey with the serving portions they gave you as well as the cost of each of the additional sides (like $3.50 for two puny slices of the maple glazed bacon).  There are valet, garage, and metered parking around the area.+cheddar scone+deviled eggs+chia pudding+carrot pancakes with maple cream cheese+valet, garage, and metered parking available"
"Super cute café for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  I went with both of my sisters and ALL of our meals were phenomenal.  I got the piggy moo cluck sandwich.  Oh. My. Goodness.  It was absolutely incredible.  I highly recommend it.  The only big downfall of the place was their coffee.  It was extremely bitter and we all had to have our waitress cut it with half hot water.  She even told us that that is a common complaint so I know we aren't the only ones who think it's just too bitter. Coffee is my favorite part of the morning so that was truly disappointing.  But again, the food was incredible."
"Not happy.We had a group of 8 and were able to get sat immediately. The place is nice and clean. I like the decor. It's minimal, which makes the whole place feel much bigger and open. My first giant complaint was our waitress. She flaked multiple times. She forgot to bring my coffee and then blamed my friend for taking my coffee from me, even though she had ordered one as well. Then I tried to put an order in early since she said the croque madame would take a long time, and she just told me that she'll take all our orders at once and my friends could just wait for me. This led to 2 of the eggs benedicts being cold by the time they hit our table. My friend ordered the Oreo cupcake before his email. All 8 of us tried it, all 8 of us agreed that it tasted like you are eating a stick of butter. There was no flavor of Oreo anywhere in it. He also ordered the spiked lemonade but I doubt there was any alcohol in it. We smelled and taste and didn't find anything in there. The only thing that is saving this review from becoming a 1 is because the croque madame was delicious. Pricing is another problem. I ordered a piece of the chocolate covered bacon (which was also delicious) and that cost $4... 4 freaking dollars for 1 piece of bacon is insanity. The cupcakes and the drinks are also over priced. But the meals are priced appropriately. Overall, there is a couple decent parts of this place but they don't outweigh the bad and I will not be returning."
my go-to lunch spot. I've had everything on the menu and everything except the faux tuna melt and chicken claypot are delicious. My favorite being the BBQ Chicken sandwich. Salads are a great side but sometimes the steak fries are worth the extra $2.5 :)
"There's something about being in a restaurant that feels refreshing and cool that makes you feel awesome. With their high ceilings, minimalist, clean design, and modern menu, Kingsbury Cafe is one such place.I love that they take reservations, because I hate waiting for brunch. I did see a significant wait for the entire time we were there. We, however, were seated immediately and all ordered their bottomless Kingsbury Street Cafe blend coffee. It is AMAZING. Super strong, dark roasted flavor. I think I had about 47 cups while we sat there. It is so good. For the meal, my two co-brunchers ordered the veggie hash with roasted potatoes, and I got some sort of salmon hash (I can't exactly remember, and I think it was a special, because I don't see it on their online menu). It was glorious. Light, flavorful diced vegetables and potato tossed with shreds of salmon, topped with two poached eggs and served with a buttered toast. The serving size was exactly right - I wasn't overstuffed, but I wasn't underwhelmed. All of us were thrilled with our menu selections. The prices were reasonable for the area, and the service was top notch. Upon departure, I noted they have a whole sweet bakery selection at the front of the cafe, where everything looked UH-mazing and I will have to come back and sample another time.I really appreciate the way they're doing brunch here at Kingsbury Street. The light food and strong coffee power everything you have to do the rest of the day, but the welcoming environment and delicious flavors allow you to savor the time that you're there. The perfect way to catch up with friends and enjoy a great meal!"
"Such good salmon hash! The wait on a Sunday for brunch was only about 20 minutes, the service was great, and the food was even better! Would definitely recommend for brunch!"
"Lemon pancakes!! Sweet, slightly creamy lemon sauce was perfect for a sweet brunch! I love lemon flavored foods so I might be biased... modern look inside, parking was tough-er, but not impossible.  And is on par wih chicaho brunch scene."
"This is my new favorite breakfast and brunch spot in the city. We went after seeing it on Check Please. We ordered the deviled eggs, warm multi grain baguette and Chia Seed Pudding to start. All were outrageously delicious but the deviled eggs are a must. I ordered the lemon pancakes and my hubby got the pumpkin pancakes (specialty item). Both were outstanding. We took home leftovers and the pancakes are even good cold!"
"A go-to brunch spot. Think I've been there four times in the past month and a half! The ingredients are always high quality and fresh, even the bread, which is made in-house. One of the better spots for omelets, too... they ask how you prefer it cooked - soft or hard - always a nice little extra touch. The Bloody Mary with Tito's vodka is always a go-to drink to start the day and it's done right. The service is quick, friendly too. Just be prepared to wait a bit on the weekends, but it's worth it."
Very good breakfast and brunch restaurant located in the Lincoln Park (Sono) area.  I really like the interior and spacious tables.  They have very colorful and tasty food on their menu too.  So far I've tried the breakfast and the wheat pancakes.  I really like their selection of drip coffees too.  The wait to be seated can sometimes be a drag but it's a good place so I guess it's expected.  Defo a good place if your in the LP neighborhood.
"The food wasn't bad but left me wanting more out of the dining experience overall and for the price. I went with my parents and we all thought the food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I was hoping this place could've been one of my new ""go to"" places, but I doubt I'll go again."
I enjoyed breakfast here.  The wait wasn't too bad on a Sunday like 20 minutes.  It's really noisy in here.  It's very clean and standard breakfast items.  I'd definitely come by again before the crowd.
"Yummy! Be sure to get here right when it opens or during off hours, you'll be waiting for a while. We arrived at 9:15, 15 minutes after it opened on a Sunday and we had to wait 5 minutes. Not horrible, but crazy considering it was only 15 minutes after opening.Had the salmon hash and shared the lemon pancakes and a toasted muffin. All great! The lemon pancakes were pleasantly very light and delicious. The bakery items are all made in house, the muffin was amazing. melted in your mouth.My friend got the chia-seed pudding and it was so good!"
"Delicious brunch! If you plan on going, understand the parking situation is pretty dismal. Like, real bad. We had made a reservation but definitely did not need it at 11:30 on a Saturday morning. They brew their own coffee and it was fantastic, very bold. Aidan L. thought that the breakfast quinoa sounded interesting, so we ordered this to start. I liked the idea, but you can't really hide the taste of quinoa or pretend that it's as tasty as oatmeal.For brunch, I ordered the salmon hash and was incredibly pleased with my decision. The flavor of the salmon and herbs was awesome, absolutely recommend this dish. The boyfriend created his own omelet and it was gargantuan. He thought it was good, but nothing amazing. There was a lot of egg, but not a ton of fillings. The toast that came with it, however, WAS amazing. Thick bread with unbelievable raspberry preserves, this tasted more like cake than toast. The real reason for my drop down to four stars is the service. Our waiter was friendly, but was MIA for what felt like years. Tables around us were sat, ate, and left in the time we were at Kingsbury. He was just nowhere to be found for most of the meal. I'd like to come back to try some of their sweet breakfast options and the baked items in the front looked spectacular."
"If you want a perfect breakfast, this is the place.  It's absolutely beautiful, cozy and comfortable."
I saw a fat cop review the place on Check Please.  Had the very best veg burger ever--home baked bun--hand cut fries--very excellent and clean place.
"If I were writing a Seinfeld episode, this place would be the setting. George and his date would be sitting in the most poorly accoustically designed restaurant in the city. Everyone has to scream to be heard. George would be yelling trying to break up with his girlfriend and his date would be saying let's be exclusive.Later, Jerry would ask how it went. George would say beautiful- It was a very friendly break-up, she even kissed him goodbye. The woman tells Elaine that they're practically engaged.This scenario could happen at Kingsbury Street Cafe. It was so loud and disorganized I felt like I was at a rave.The waiter was very nice, but even he was unnerved. The kitchen staff- a bunch of Top Chef wannabe's, left my fiance's very unimpressive deviled eggs with a thimbleful of chorizo sausage under a heat lamp for over 20 minutes. Yes, my friends, a ""cold"" dish.I told the waiter that while I didn't cook, I could probably get up and manage to show the ""chef's"" how to make a simple bacon, avocado and onion omelet. He declined- he had more faith in them than I did.Finally, ten minutes later, after all the tables who came twenty minutes after us had finished eating, my omelet came. It was okay and they never switched out my boyfriend's mediocre eggs (we were afraid he wouldn't get any back).I'm thinking you need a manager or owner walking around asking people how things are and taking measure of the place. The high ceilings are very beautiful, but I would sue your interior designer sister-in-law because the ambience is horrific due to the noise. I wouldn't know where to begin to fix that issue. The kitchen fix is easy- Pay attention! Less on making it fancy and pretty and more on just making it and getting it out for someone to eat!!!!!"
"GO HERE.I love brunch so much that it is almost a hobby to me. I originally wanted to come to Kingsbury Street Cafe on New Year's, but went to Toast Two instead. No, don't bother going to the other restaurant. My boyfriend's friend was in town and I wanted to take her/them to a nicer place, somewhere they don't just serve eggs and toast. Kingsbury Street Cafe is a beautiful restaurant. The interior designer did a fantastic job; s/he was clever too. Upon entering, you are immediately greeted by the bakery, which displays an impressive assortment of baked goods and other delectables. Massive meringues, humongous cupcakes and muffins, ginormous turnovers, and more. While you wait for your table, the sugary goodnesses are temptations that are difficult to resist (or not). The space is reminiscent of an art gallery. It is modern and minimalist. The ceilings are high. There are beautiful large-scale abstract paintings on walls. The oak wood tables and chairs add warmth to the space. There is no harsh lighting. Mini orbit light pendants hang down around the bakery. It is a lovely restaurant.I don't come here often enough. I wish I can."
"""Eclectic diner food""Kingsbury serves breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. On the weekday menu, you will find familiar items that are reimagined with a twist. My favorite would be the Piggy Moo sandwich, over easy eggs, ham, glazed bacon on a brioche roll. On the weekend brunch menu, you will find things like salmon hash and bbq chicken benedict. If you ever need to satisfy a sweet tooth, try the lemon pancakes. No yelp reviews can ever do justice on the quality of the pancakes.I often find myself coming on a weekly basis and sometimes maybe two or three times per week."
Great omelets pancakes and coffee is better than Starbucks.   Don't miss this place!!!
"I adore everything about this place except they do not take reservations for any party under six people and the wait is pretty long if you get there anytime after 9:45ish. However it is totally worth the wait and I highly recommend the cheddar scones, they are to die for!"
"Contrary to recent reviews, we had a pleasant service experience. Sure, the acoustics aren't the best given the high ceilings and the minimalist space, it got a bit too loud for my tastes, but overall I had a great brunch. The lemon pancakes were divine! Fluffiness drenched in an anglaise topped with zest and blueberries. I'm usually wary about ordering pancakes/french toast simply because I don't know if I can handle a whole plate-o-sugary-sweetness. These pancakes were definitely an exception.  I also got a side of herbed fingerling potatoes- decent.Brunch buddy got the salmon hash with a side of maple bacon. Our server was quick to offer us ketchup and hot sauce. The hash was bit too fishy and thus warranted mucho hot sauce to accompany. The bacon was scrumptious-- of course it's tough to hate on a nice crispy strip-o-savory-piglet. We sat by the beverage bar and marveled at all of the various drinks churning out. Their bloody marys looks wonderful as well as the colorful fruit coolers. Next time when we want to make a weekend Whole Foods run, we'll skip the hot bar inside and brunch it up at Kingsbury!"
"We have weekly Monday morning breakfast meetings to kick off the work week. Since it was Memorial Day weekend, we stopped in on Tuesday instead. We typically hit places in River North like Yolk, Brunch, etc. Glad we found Kingsbury Street Cafe!They are priced very similar to the aforementioned places. The other places are great and don't mind them at all. However, for similar pricing, KSC is shoulders above!The atmosphere is modern and clean. Waitress was very friendly and there whenever we needed something (order, coffee refill, drop check, etc.) The food is awesome. I got the KSC breakfast which consisted of two eggs (scrambled for me), fingerling potatoes, giant tomato, cheddar scone, and meat (turkey sausage here). Everything was just executed well. Simple foods with tons of flavor without having to be covered in a thick gooey sauce.If you want food that is well thought out and not hidden under a blanket of sauce, KSC will do the trick. It's along the same price point as many others in the area but just better. Enjoy!"
"4.5. The food is very delicious. We got the Benedict and my goodness, the poached was was so soft and delicious. On top of that the service was great and the coffee options were amazing."
"I wanted to love this place but we came and the hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. There were not a lot of people waiting and 45 minutes later we were finally seated. It was so frustrating and ruined our meal. She seated several groups before us with no explanation. One I understood as the woman was pregnant. One was a terrible case of bad customer service--half their party wasn't even there yet as they had parked across the street at the Whole Foods and there was all this drama about moving the car because Whole Foods would tow them, blah blah blah. They had even showed up 30 minutes after we first arrived. The pancakes were good but not great. I got the lemon, my husband the carrot. They were very dense instead of fluffy.Never going back if the hostess can't do a better job. If it is going to be 45 minutes and you are going to seat others in front of me, just tell me. Don't give me some 20 minute wait story."
Lick the rim good bloody mary's. Lick your plate good brunch.
"Kingsbury Street Cafe was the perfect location and restaurant for us as an after church gathering.  We were able to make a reservation, saving us from standing around waiting to be served; and once we were seated, we were served our beverages.  The wait staff did not rush us out and offered options for our finicky eaters and those taking indulgences, alike.  We all enjoyed the food, atmosphere and pace of our meal.  The confection counter was a delight and the perfect stop before heading out to enjoy the remainder of the day and for picking up to-go items to take to other events of the day.  Really a lovely experience!!"
"I think I just found a new favorite brunch spot.  If only I could come here every day.  Perhaps a grocery trip to Whole Foods should be rewarded with a trip to KSC.  I've been here twice already just this month.  The first time I ordered the lemon pancakes and (yes, I said And - don't judge) the make-your-own-omelette.  The lemon pancakes were the bomb diggety but my omelette was just ok.  (Serves me right for trying to make my own; I should've left it up to the pros.)  My husband ordered the garden tofu.  He's not big on the vegetarian stuff (so I was surprised he even ordered it) but he thought it was quite tasty.    The second time I came here, I ordered the eggs benedict with the pulled bbq chicken and it was excellent.  Who would've thought to combine eggs benedict and bbq chicken?  The awesome chefs at KSC, that's who!   The 3rd, 4th, and 5th times I'll be visiting, I'll be trying the piggy moo cluck sandwich, the salmon hash, and the dark chocolate-stuffed French toast.  And more of the lemon pancakes.Another thing I love about this place is the drink selection, alcoholic or not.  I just want to try to everything on that menu but the sober me says to get a grip since it's only 11:00 in the morning!  Ugh, screw responsibility, I say as I order another mojito.  Sure, the prices are a little on the expensive side for brunch but it's well worth it.  On a side note, on your way to the restroom, take the time to read the news articles on the family.  They have a great story about escaping war in Vietnam and succeeding here in Chicago.  On your way out, buy some pastries to take home and enjoy a few hours later.  Me, I always get the Vietnamese coffee, my new obsession."
"I've died and gone to heaven!  This place is amazing!  Excellent service, decor, ambiance, and food!  My go to place for brunch and pastries!"
I dined here for brunch with my daughter and sister. It was good! I had the Kingsbury breakfast with turkey patties. Very good! I didn't really care for the tomatoes. I would definitely go back. This is a place where I would go if I'm in the mood for a fancy breakfast!
"I give this place a hearty ""meh.""I work down the street, so I've been to Kingsbury many times. The food is okay - definitely fresh ingredients and focused on being healthy. However, everything is pretty bland. And the pricing is out of control.Still, it's a decent place to get a decent brunch/lunch that won't clog your arteries."
"We were really looking forward to coming here, but were so disappointed. Food is not good at all... Eggs Benedict were awful, potatoes tasted like they'd been fried in really old oil. Sandwich had the saddest cheddar cheese ever, McDonald's really has better cheese on their burgers. Coffee quality is also quite poor. Service was good, they brought our order really quickly.Their service also went down so we had to walk to an ATM to get cash to pay for the check. Avoid!"
"Overrated!  Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!  Overrated!  Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!I go to breakfast/brunch about three times a week, normally...so I feel like I have a pretty good handle on what's out there, and after seeing the rave reviews it got on Check, Please!, I was excited to give it a try.  Meh.Kingsbury  reminds me of breakfast I get at a Hilton, Hyatt or some other chain hotel restaurant when I'm on the road for work.   There's nothing terrible about it,  per se, but nothing great.  If you like your breakfast at the Hotel Intercontinental Atlanta, you'll love this spot."
"Not a bad little cafe! We stopped here for a quick bite while we wandered Lincoln Park. Friend of mine had a salad, which looked good, but pieces were WAY too clunky and large. I had the deviled eggs, which was a perfect snack and was DELICIOUS! Service was a little lacking, but we did come about half an hour before they closed. Overall, I'd come back!"
"I had relatives visiting from Europe this weekend. We originally had reservations at another restaurant but we were late and they were not able to seat us. I called Kingsbury restaurant and asked if they could accommodate a group of 10  they were closing in approximately 15 minutes and said we needed to rush right over.  Once we got there (traffic was very heavy) and after valet parking 3 cars we were 5 minutes late at first they were not going to take us but after talking to the restaurant manager they agreed to serve us.   We also had a 83 year old senior citizen in our party who needed to eat in order to take some medication.  We were seated and asked to order very quickly as the kitchen staff was finishing up. We placed our order and I must say the food was wonderful.  The waitress that took care of us did so with care & grace.  It turned out to be a wonderful meal, a great experience and our very large party really did not feel rushed at all.  I have to give a Shout Out to the professional manager and all the staff of Kingsbury Street Cafe. I would definitely recommend this establishment especially large parties for brunch. Bon Appetite"
"Yes, this is a contemporary spot to get some very good food.  Don't let the  ""Now Open"" sign in the window fool you, they have BEEN open for about a year and a half.We waited about 25 minutes for a table, was it worth it?  Yes. Are the waits any shorter during the week?  Don't know.  I guess you can call ahead for a reservation and THAT is definitely the thing to do.  Everything going to other tables looked delicious and our omelettes were outstanding.  The Bloody Mary is served with cheese, pickles, and a pepper and, I am told, delicious.Just a few suggestions:  provide a larger garbage receptacle in the restrooms.  The tiny bin under the paper towels had long before my visit filled to capacity and the paper towels were now strewn on the floor.And, at peak times, somehow politely encourage your satisfied guests to move along.  With lots of people waiting for tables, for quite a while, and they can only stand, shouldn't you WANT to be courteous and be about your business.  I saw one table for 4 pay their bill just as we were seated, and left only a few minutes before we did.  They sat there, not eating, not drinking coffee, just lingering a while, and managed to knock something off the table, break to pieces, and send sugar(?) splattering over the floor and under surrounding tables.  They did not even move when staff came to clean the mess, they sat and continued talking.  Sorry, is that my suburbanism showing?"
"I heart omelette's!! Kingsbury Street Cafe just served up the best one I've had in a good while! A great omelette is really not so easy to find (or make) I've learned.You can customize your omelette and there are plenty of options to choose from. You can get 3 for $10 and if you want more it's a buck each. I had tomato, jalepeno, avocado, chedder AND pepper jack. I was feeling a little cheezy. It was fluffy, light and cooked perfectly. It comes with buttered baguette and a roasted tomato or cute little fingerling potatoes, I opted for the potatoes which are roasted, lightly seasoned and just the right portion - not too much.My companion had the shrimp and egg white frittata - he said it was delish. We both ordered the mango/orange juice it was nice and fresh and LARGE. They do serve cocktails but I wasn't in the mood (shocking).It's a big open space with a minimalist vibe and because it's so open if there a lot of people it gets a little noisy but it didn't bother me at all. It's prime time at Sunday brunch and it should be a little lively, no? The bathrooms are nice and very clean.Service was super fast and friendly. I would recommend this place and I will definitely go back again!"
I'm sure this place is better than what I experienced today. The space is large & modern looking. My service today was horrible and the food was OK. I ordered a basic breakfast meal (omelette). I will not coming back again which is a shame because it looked so promising.
"This is my go-to place when I am meeting friends for brunch and have my son in tow.  It's hard to find a place in the city that has fun, innovative food and that is extremely kid friendly.  Kingsbury Street is the place.  As a mom, I love that all the tables are spread out so much that new parents can push the strollers up right to the table.  For those who have toddlers, it's even better because they do a place setting just for the kids complete with plastic silverware and sippy cup.  However the best part?  They take reservations!  Thankfully this restaurant decided to go against the brunch norm and offer reservations because it has me returning over and over.  That and the salmon hash.I have nothing but wonderful things to say and if you want more of my experience read here:  definingtabitha.com/2013…"
"All this time, this spot was here across from Whole Foods. It's a nice open cafe. It was easy to find my friends as we were meeting a for a birthday brunch. The Masala Chai Tea Latte was delicious. I went with the Grilled Chicken sandwich that came with a side salad with a tasty dressing. I wish I had gotten more of the dressing though. The sandwich was really good and filling. The prices are average, and our waiter was pretty friendly and helpful with the recommendations."
"I had read good things about this place from Chicago food blogs with regard to their brunch.  The descriptor that I recall most, was that this place was solid in its food quality.  In addition, the reviews here seem pretty favorable, so I wanted to try this place out.Two of my friends and I went to brunch here this past weekend.  To our dismay, we found the food to be unseasoned, bland, and dry.  We cannot, for the life of us, understand the hype.We split the whole wheat carrot pancakes with the cream cheese frosting and maple syrup.  The pancakes were dense and dry, and sopped up all my saliva.Both of my friends got the tofu scramble.  They complained it was bland.  The vegan bread that came with it was super dry.  Most basic breads are vegan (country bread consists of flour, water, and salt), but they somehow manage to give bread a bad name here.I ordered their Kingsbury cafe breakfast, which comes with two eggs (I had them over-easy), roasted herb potatoes, roasted plum tomato, house-made turkey sausage, and a cheddar biscuit.  First, the eggs were unseasoned; they were also the most tasteless eggs I have ever had!  I wonder what farm they're getting their flavorless eggs from.... The roasted herb potatoes, while they looked good, were very dense, and again, tasteless.  While they were speckled with herbs, they tasted of nothing!  The house-made turkey sausage was dense and dry--unpalatable.  The biscuit tasted like the instant stuff, and sucked my mouth dry.  It was kind of unpleasant.  The tomato was by far the best part of this breakfast.Overall, this was a disappointing experience.  For me, I ordered a really basic breakfast, and none of it was prepared to a satisfactory standard."
"One of my favorite brunch spots - perfect ambiance, yummy food, and you can make reservations!!!! It's a little out of the way but it's a great brunch spot for a day out with friends since there are lots of shops around there too."
"Atmosphere! Service! Food! And, more specifically - lemon pancakes!Didn't we have it all?!That's a rhetorical question, as yes, we DID have it all. Problems are little demons I generally try to avoid in life, but my problem at Kingsbury Street Cafe was a good one to have. The menu is filled with dishes that had me changing my mind last second... do I get the banh mi? Or the turkey burger? But then, there's the piggy moo cluck sandwich! In the end, I trust what my gut tells me in the beginning so I ordered the banh mi with its tender promise of pork belly, pickled veggies, cilantro and spicy mayo nestled between a fresh-baked baguette. And WOW. I've never seen or tasted pork belly like this - it was thinly shaved and there was tons of it... the best sandwiches include falling-off-the-side-of-the-bread fixings, and this one had exactly that. Also, I liked that this pork belly was painstakingly trimmed resulting in a leaner outcome. So much flavor, so much mouth party... so much, so much!The only menu item I didn't love was my melon and ginger fruit cooler. At $4.50 a pop, I expected a bit more juice and less ice... I mean, there was so much ice I felt I could have easily taken my entire drink down in three measly sips. So I waited patiently for it to melt. However - my experience was overwhelmingly positive and I can't wait to return! Are you reading, piggy moo cluck sandwich? I've got your number and you're about to go down!"
"Tried the brunch here last Saturday with Hubby and another couple.  We had 10:30am reservations and were immediately seated.  There were no other parties waiting so it didn't seem like reservations were needed anyway (like what other Yelp reviews said).  If you were waiting, you can browse the bakery items on display near the front.  The dining space was nice and open.We split the 5 deviled eggs with crispy chorizo and chives as an appetizer.  The eggs had too much  mayo and I didn't see any chives.  I ordered the croque madame, which was just average.  Hubby had the salmon hash, which was the better dish.  I really liked the crispy tater tots which was a nice play on hash.  Definitely a unique dish.  I also had an orange and mango fresh fruit cooler which was basically a smoothie.Our server was friendly enough and took our drink and entree orders promptly.  Our water glasses were never empty throughout the meal.  In the end though, we waited a while for the check.  I'm not sure if he saw we were still talking after the plates were cleared and wanted to give us more time or if he was busy with other tables.  That's one good thing about this place, unlike other busy breakfast/brunch places, they are not trying to rush you out to turn the table over.Other note - nice, clean bathroom.  I like the design of the sinks and how everything is motion-sensored (toilets, sinks, and soap dispensers).  I do agree with the other Yelper: they need a bigger garbage can!  It is just a small rectangle receptacle immediately under the paper towel dispenser....which should be converted to motion-sensor to be consistent."
"3.5 - The space is really beautiful and has a good energy.  Servers are on the ball and helpful, almost too helpful (one of the guys kept roaming up and down aisles waiting for someone to finish their plate so he could whisk it away!)  Plus, they take reservations for brunch!Foodwise, I went with the vegetarian hash special (asparagus, mushrooms, etc)  The tater tot hash would have been on a top-something list if they hadn't been cold.  Boo!  I got a side of maple syrup bacon and wasn't disappointed, splurge on this deliciousness!  My friend enjoyed his benedict, but didn't rave about it.  His turkey sausage patties were lackluster.  Drinkwise, they have a nice variety of tea (I got the tangerine ginger which was lovely), but $6 for OJ is outrageous (I know it's fresh squeezed, but come on!)This would have been a 4 star review, but for a couple dings:-despite making a reservation, we got the worst seat in the house (i.e. beside constantly swinging kitchen door (somehow I'm always cursed with the worst seat in the house)-the food, while tasty, was pretty cold"
"Get the salmon hash.Great dish, shredded salmon isn't overly cooked and the pepper trio, poached eggs, and sour cream on top really put this over the top.  Our server, Ben, was on top of everything as well and was great.  Good recommendations and good attentiveness, while not being overbearing at all. So why not 5 stars?  When you have an open kitchen for all to see, why wouldn't everyone be wearing hats?  Kinda gets me every time and I can't get over it.  Cover your hair!!"
"Came here for brunch on Sunday at 9:10. Even though this place opens at 9, it was already packed. We were seated within a few minutes though. The restaurant has high ceilings and a lot of light so it's very comfortable. I had the lemon pancakes and my husband had the salmon and tater tot hash. Everything was delicious! We cleaned our plates and we will be back!"
"I recently heard that Kingsbury Street Cafe was ranked as one of the best brunches in the country (by who, not sure), so I had to try it out.  Although the menu doesn't look like anything that special at first, the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and really shines through.  This restaurant really makes other brunches in Chicago look like imitators.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a restaurant that serves real food."
"My new go to place for breakfast or lunch. Great menu with lots of choices. Lunches too. Very clean, bright atmosphere and chirpy looking people, all ages from mommy pushing carriages to singles and seniors. Servers very pleasant. Food is delish. Parking only steps away and across from Whole Foods. Enjoy."
"I went here for brunch, nothing really interested me on the menu so I just ordered a burger and fries. I ordered my burger well done with cheddar cheese. I received a medium rare burger with no cheese, I sent the burger back. They brought me the same burger, that was still not well done, I sent the burger back. The brought me the SAME burger for the THIRD time, and at that point I simply refused the burger. I found it quite ridiculous to have to attempt to cook a burger 3 times to get it well done, and to attempt to cook the SAME burger 3 times is even more outrageous! Needless to say, I will NOT return!"
PROS: Great & brunch place and even takes reservations. Healthy menu items.  Delicious potatoes.  Perfect omelette.  Impressive. CON: They need blinds! Last two visits were blinding!!!
"And why have I never heard of this place?GREAT breakfast/brunch find. My wife and I are always looking for new places to explore for brunch after Church on Sundays and this little gem just went to the top of our list. LOVED the menu and the Kingsbury Station Eggs Benedict was awesome. Who would of thought BBQ pulled chicken and eggs go together - simply delicious!Only complaint (as I have with MANY cool Chicago restaurants) it is soooo noisy you can't hold conversation at a table of 4 without yelling! WHY can't new restaurateurs put some fabric on the walls or ceilings to deaden the acoustical echoing so we can actually hear each other...so frustrating.  OK, I'm off my soapbox now."
Great food and service was super quick. We had a reservation for a business lunch and the table was ready when we got there.
"I have eaten at Kingsbury 2-3 times a week since it opened two years ago. I love getting here at 830am after training and opening my laptop at one of their big tables while they make me an egg white omelette with kale, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and avocado. Best salads I've ever had. Try the shaved brussels sprouts salad, or Vietnamese salad, with chicken or salmon on top. Great coffee, too. I don't know how else to describe Kingsbury other than to say that it's integral to my well being. I can't imagine getting through the week without it. It's delightful."
"So, this morning I made an appointment at the nearby Apple Store to have my iMac serviced.  I had a hankering for a hearty breakfast while waiting. So, I found this place within walking distance. It is next to the construction site for a future improv Olympic theater. The construction was a bit distracting from the actual storefront of the Kingsbury Street Café.  But the patrons that filled the many seats on the lovely patio clearly made a great impression.I walked inside and was promptly greeted by the hostess. She led me to the table that would accommodate my large white nondescript empty box that carried my iMac.  The inside was not as packed or as busy as the patio but that was to be expected for a sunny Thursday morning. Aside from the modern, polished aesthetics of the interior, I found the high ceiling to be most impressive.The menu was also impressive but what caught my attention was the piggy  moo cluck sandwich. Specifically it was the two words in the description of this lovely sandwich: eggs over-easy.  On several reality shows, if you salivate over the image of an over-easy egg yolk breaking over whatever decadent meal lied underneath, then this sammich is for you! Granted, you are not taking a fork to this meal. Instead you are picking up this lovely sandwich bursting with meats and egg held together by the ciabatta bread. Let's take a moment to talk about this bread. Whenever I had a sandwich at another establishment with ciabatta bread it was always a bit stale. I've enjoyed French bread fresh out of the oven as well as a little bit stale after sitting out for perhaps a while. But every single time I ordered a sandwich with ciabatta bread, it was hard, perhaps crunchy. This morning, this plebeian's palate became more informed by the softness of fresh ciabatta bread. As I bit into the sandwich, there was no yolk spurting all over my plate. Perhaps it had been soaked into the bread as I enjoyed every bite.  Regardless, I will definitely enjoy the sandwich again.  Although, I don't recall any beef in that sandwich. Am I missing something? Or was there an early form of this sandwich that had roast beef and the name stuck after it was dropped?  Anywho, great sandwich, great service. I want to see this place again on the weekend with a larger crowd. If I get a great experience under those conditions, then they would definitely earn a five!"
"Piggy Moo Cluck!! Piggy Moo Cluck!! Piggy Moo Cluck!!! We were in the area, and decided to drop in after all the amazing reviews from Check Please. It was a weekday and they'd just opened, so we were seated right away. Now, I am not a big fan of breakfast/brunch. It's easier for me to make delicious food at home cheaper, but for a day out, if I were to choose a place to eat brunch, this would be it. I do not like a gooey egg on anything and I decided to go the correct way and eat my cluck nice and gooey on my piggy, moo, and I am so glad I did! DELICIOUS! Now what makes this sandwich out of everything was the amazing fresh Ciabatta bread that was just baked up probably that morning. That was the icing, I tell ya! You can give me the gooiest egg in the world if you're going to serve it on freshly baked bread. Not to mention, the servers were super nice. Our waitress was wonderful and super attentive. We both joked about how we hated the gooey egg until eating this sandwich.  I left my jacket there as well and they were so kind to keep it for me until I was able to leave work at grab it too. I must say I really enjoyed the place. The atmosphere was modern and very welcoming, and the food was great. I didn't care for the side of potatoes to go along with the piggy, moo, cluck. They seemed as though they had been prepared and were just waiting to go on your plate. If they could've spiffed those up again or made them nice and crunchy, that would have been the cherry on the top, but I packed them, took them home, and did that part myself later. Definitely worth a visit for a delicious, fresh brunch with an amazing staff!"
"Checked this place out today and we could not have been happier. Food, service , space and the overall vibe of this place was fantastic. We had the most helpful server who was very considerate of our situation with a 1 year old. She really helped us cater to him and made a great experience even better."
"After seeing it on check please, decided to give it a try...disappointing on SO many levels: waiter was very friendly at first, but once he got in the weeds, we were left begging for coffee and wondering if our order was actually placed.  When it finally arrived, it was a hit and a miss-shrimp egg white frittata was very good, Brussels sprout salad with chicken was inedible.  No one came by to check on us, though when asked if we would like meals wrapped, I explained why mine was virtually untouched...he returned with both wrapped though I clearly said no, and the $17 salad was still on the bill.  Upon additional ""discussion"" it was reluctantly removed."
"Coffee and pastries are delicious. The location was extremely convenient from where we were staying. I hung out here and worked for several hours and they kept bringing me free refills. I would love to give this place another star but I only had the omeltte. Which was simple but not delicious. I heard really good things about the ""moo cluck"" but i refrained from getting it because I wanted a somewhat healthier option."
"Had the shrimp frittata and fingerling potatoes, a little heavy on the butter but quite good. Vietnamese coffee also very good. Great job!"
"I've been here a couple of time and I am a fan.  It is very spacious and a little more fancy then I thought it would be, which isn't a bad thing but was unexpected for some reason. It is kid friendly with menu items for kids and friendly staff.  They have a cool bar setup with unique options, and pastries.  Ambiance offers cool art on the walls and a unique menu.  Great brunch items and good lunch too.Although a little pricey so just be prepared, but you won't be disappointed!"
"Yummitty yum yum. Kingsbury Street Cafe is going to be my new go-to brunch place. I have been a couple of times and enjoyed the food, service and prices on both occasions. As with most brunch places there can be a bit of a wait on the weekend, but I came around 1 PM last time and walked right in. The baked goods are delectable. Picked up a couple peanut butter cup cupcakes last time - OMG. And $4 for a cupcake the size of your head? I'm not complaining. Definitely will be back."
"Maybe other than Ina's on Randolph, Kingsbury Street Cafe is as good as it gets when it comes to breakfast.  Kingsbury Street Cafe's decor is modern, very bright, and lacks pretentiousness.  But thankfully being located in Old Town/Goose Island, it also lacks the hipster crowd.  As soon as you walk in, you are hit with the sight of their amazing pastries.  I had probably the best omelette around...good sized, but light, fluffy, fresh, and loaded with fresh ingredients (I had ham, avocado, and onions).  While it is $2, make sure you ask for their fresh pico de gallo to top your omelette.  Maybe their side potatoes are amazing, but take a pass and ask for the fresh tomatoes (they give you an entire slide roma tomato) with the french baguette.Tip:  As you are walking into Kingsbury Street Cafe, you can park in the parking lot to the left of the building, but not the parking lot to the right of the building."
"Friend and i ordered the salmon hash, stuffed pumpkin french toast, and kingsbury breakfast. The salmon has was good, not too fishy w tator tots. The french toast was very good, but u only get 4 strips. I think they cut 1 bread into 4 strips and it's $12. The kingsbury breakfast is nothing special, bland. Overall i thought this place was good, but way too pricey for the lack of flavor. For 2 ppl, the bill was $60."
"I've enjoyed breakfast and lunch at Kingsbury.  The food is exceptional!  Today I tried the brussel sprout salad, added chicken and raspberry lemonade - AMAZING!"
"Ahhhhhhhh so good. So good.Lemon pancakes... fancy coffee.. some moo cow pork oink sandwich. Everything delicious and fresh.Only downside was the veggie sausage patties... not too good. They had a strange spice on them, I wasn't a fan. The service was pretty good, they forgot something, but it happens. Next time I'm going to try some of the pastries, they looked great."
Amazing whole wheat carrot pancakes :D
"My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week. We are completely in love with Kingsbury Street Cafe. I honestly don't know where to begin.They make the best lattes. I am a Starbucks fanatic, and rarely like anyone else's coffee.... but I come to Kingsbury for my morning coffee on the weekends :)Their bakery is just so great. The cookies are gorgeous and delicious. I have bought so many as gifts. The current lady bugs are too cute to even eat. LOVE.The service here is WONDERFUL. I have been here even on the busiest of busiest days and every server, employee is SO NICE. No one here is rude. The owner hires only the nicest staff obviously!The homemade burger patties are OUT OF THIS WORLD. Sorry Kuma's, these are just as good. I even ate the veggie burger during lent and was blown away (a little dry) but over all delish. My boyfriend who hates anything vegetarian even liked it.The bacon has real maple syrup caramelized on it. wow--so amazingly good.Mimoas, bloody marys, bloody marias. You name it, they got it.What a great place. What amazing food. What a spectacular owner.We are thrilled to have this gem in the neighborhood. Keep up the good work!(PS: The owner used to work for Oprah so you know this food has to be good! :)"
"I was pretty disappointed with our experience at Kingsbury Street Cafe. I booked a reservation for 6 online as a special lunch with my bridesmaids before we had to go to the ceremony rehearsal and let the front staff know we were on a tight timeframe when we arrived. 10 minutes later our waiter came for the first time to take drink orders. I again let him know that we were on a tight time frame and asked for the check as soon as the food came out so that we could bounce as soon as we were finished. One of the ladies ordered soup and a side of bread and we had to ask FIVE times to get it to the table, despite already being charged for it - we tried our hardest to be polite about it but again the time crunch made it hard to be patient. The food was great until my sister found a hair in her salad and unfortunately for us I had already tipped the server and we had packed the rest of the leftovers."
"I've experienced better. The computer for credit cards was down so I had to go inside Whole Foods across the street for cash back.  Parking is scarce as well, unless you pay $6 for their parking.  There was a 30 minute wait at noon (i'm thinking we missed the breakfast crowd).  The customer service & the ambiance was cool.  I saw some of the other dishes and decided to just try the Kingsbury Cafe Breakfast & a cafe au lait.  It reminded me of a British breakfast almost since it had grilled tomato on the side.  My friend ordered an omelet  w/feta, spinach & chicken along with a hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate and cafe au lait were bland.  I'd expect that from a cafe au lait but not hot chocolate.  The food was disappointing. Too bland, no flavor.  It just wasn't worth all the hassle today."
"I've been somewhat avoiding this spot because I have my lunch 'favs', but a colleague suggested we eat there for lunch and I happily took her up on the offer.We were there early, so there were no problems with finding a table (the spot got bustling around 12 with lots of moms and kids and a few work colleagues, etc).  Our server was very friendly.  I enjoyed the atmosphere - casual yet upscale.  However, the acoustics are rather odd - I felt as if I were talking in a tunnel to the person sitting with me.  By the way - the cakes/cookies at the front...if those don't draw you in, I don't know what will!  Atmosphere = 4.Service was good, and our server was really honest about the menu items (which I liked)...5 for service.The food was quite good - I'll go with a 4 as the portions were somewhat inconsistent.  Taste-wise, everything was tasty.Value...I'm torn as there were very good values on the menu, but also some oddities...An extra $3.50 for fries...why not just upcharge me a buck and not give me a salad?  Fries are cheap...I just don't get it.  Otherwise, many of the items are good values, but you aren't getting an inexpensive lunch.  Value is a 3.Bathrooms...I didn't visit, so I will have to ignore this category this time.I'll be back!"
Ok so my husband told me about this place and I'm glad he did. The wait to be seated was kinda crapy but worth it. My mom and I ordered the pumpkin pancakes (the best ever)Also made our own omelets which tasted very fresh.Bought some lemon pancakes to bring home to my husband. Cant wait to try those.  Also they have lots of bakery treats. I totally got some of those.  So great place price not to bad. Wait to be seated yuck. But well worth it.
"This is one of my favorite spots in the city for a casual brunch. The Kingsbury St. Cafe meets all of my criteria for an awesome dining experience: 1. great food, 2. excellent service, and 3. comfortable seating/atmosphere. I love that the cafe uses high quality and fresh ingredients. Also, you get a comp. tall pitcher of water -- not nasty tap water, but smooth, filtered water (let me explain: I can't tell you how many times I've been out and the food has been great yet the water tasted like a lead pipe flavored with dish detergent!).Portions are big! Come with your appetite. Meat and veggie lovers can find something from both worlds -- try the piggy moo cluck sandwich or veggie hash. Masala chai tea latte had just enough sweetness to balance the spice.We can never leave without sampling one of their amazing, made in-house desserts. Red velvet cupcake was divine."
"Amazing place. Really great atmosphere from the moment you walk in.I went here for brunch on fathers day and it was the perfect place. The service was fast and friendly. The chef even came out and talked to us after our meals. We ended up getting dessert since they make all of their stuff in house and they are all displayed when you walk in and everything looks delicious.Five stars for great food, service, drinks, and atmosphere."
Great breakfast place.  Modern atmosphere and good service.  I really enjoyed the Salmon Hash and Irish Coffee.  The Salmon Hash is filled with deliciousness that will keep you nose diving back into your plate for more!
"So I went back with a group of my friends after raving to them about the dark chocolate french toasts this place has, but it was disappointing experience comparing to what I had. Perhaps with what I had before, I had a high expectation going in, and yet, they were not as consistent as they should.It was just ok at best, the dark chocolate wasn't exploding as it did. It wasn't chcolate-ty at all. It was more ""eggy"". I could literally taste the egg-coating on the french toast more than the dark chocolate ""stuffed"" inside the french toast even after I smothered the french toast with all the other creamy sauce .The bbq chicken benedicts was just ok. interesting combination, but ok-favour. One of my friends' benedicts order had a well-done ""poached"" eggs!!!  After we brought that to our server's attention, she sent over 2 poached eggs,  but how could you serve a benedicts with a well-done eggs at the first place? Besides, that took a while before she got the correctly made ""poached eggs"" that my friend was too hungry to wait and almost finished the rest of the plate.The server we had was sorta rude at one point too. My friend told her that there's an ant in her coffee, and she just assumed that was a regular coffee while my friend had a decaf. She came back and literally just dropped the cup of regular coffee on the corner of the table and ran to take order of another table.I thought that was pretty rude, though maybe she's just really busy with the full house of customers. I would give her the benefit of the doubts since she was quite pleasant the rest of the time.hmmm.....i am not sure if going there on a sunday vs saturday (i went on sat. last time) made the difference!? Another thing is the 22% gratitude added to the check. I know gratitude is usually added to a check for big group of customers...but 22%? Not too sure if what we had that day worth 22% ""gratitude""....."
"i LOVE the atmosphere of kinsbury. the people are friendly, the vibe is chill an the food is delicious. HOWEVER, please please please. i implore you to please change your chairs so they don't make that horrible squeaking sound every time someone gets up or down. it is so brutally awful that it really has a very negative impact on an otherwise extremely positive experience. Also, noise absorbing boards would be a great idea as the space is so loud and echo-prone. i have hope! i will be back regardless. thank you for considering these small changes to make your diner's experience more enjoyable!!!"
"Came here with a group of 8 for brunch and it was great.  The place was crisp and bright and the service friendly.  As a table, we ordered some lemon pancakes and they were AMAZING!!  A few people at the table ordered the eggs Benedict and enjoyed the switch up with the BBQ pulled chicken.  I had the salmon hash and it was a fun mixture of flavors that incorporated fish in a breakfast dish.  Overall, all 8 people were happy and satisfied with the cafe.  Good job!"
"Calming, although not serene.  Delicious, but not pretentious. Friendly but not overbearing service.  I don't know if I was still in the ""zen moment"" of the dance class I went to before eating here or what, but Kingsbury Street Cafe delivered for me the other day.First, I called for reservations, after all, we wanted to eat on a Sunday morning and I don't like to wait.  The manager was great- telling me that they normally only take reservations for parties of 6 or more but that he would take care of me and make an exception for my party of two.  Hey folks- it's worth the ask as I was seated immediately when I walked in.Our server, Jonathon, was terrific.  Told us that they had a mimosa and a Bloody Mary special  ($2 off )and quickly brought us one of each.  Other than those two drinks it looks like the drink menu is only craft beers and wine.  It's also important to note that Jonathon wasn't the only smiling server.  Everyone from the food runner to the bus staff said hello and smiled . . .I love when that happens!The menu changes throughout the day from breakfast to brunch to lunch depending on what time you get there.   And there are so many interesting things on the menu, I didn't know what to order. We got the brunch menu at 12:30 but they let my friend order off of the breakfast menu some carrot pancakes topped with a cream cheese whip . .  .delicious!I went with a standard omelet (the quiche was a solid runner up) but I loved that they asked me if I wanted it firm or looser as I hate overdone omelets.  It came up perfectly, served with my choice of herbed roasted potatoes (eh) or grilled tomatoes.  It also came with a couple of pieces of whole grain bread (sized like a biscotti).The noise level is high as there is nothing to dim the din but somehow it works as it never gets so loud that you can't talk over it.  The decor is minimal with some art work high on the walls.  Right up front when you walk in- is the bakery bar- fresh baked goods  (try the bobka (sp?) muffin- sort of a cross between a chocolate chip and cinnamon roll) from ""Work of Art"" which was the genesis of this place as it used to be a bake shop over on Halsted and then they closed and re opened in this location as a full service restaurant.Breakfast for two with drinks ran $50.  Parking is available on the street or you can park in the VIP men's club lot located just to the north of the place.  Love that Kingsbury Cafe has everything I want . . . . and none of the things I don't.  Again . . .was I heady from my dance class?  Guess I'll have to go back again sans dance class to see!"
"Loved this place!  First, they take reservations on open table for brunch which is so nice!  We were seated promptly and had very nice and accommodating waitress.  The menu is creative and diverse with a great selection of healthy options.  Loved the decor and food.  Truly a win/win!  Plus easy valet lot next door for $5.  New favorite brunch spot!"
Not bad for brunch. Chilequiles was pretty good. Would go again.
"New favorite breakfast spot to walk to.   Yummy mummies unite!   Anyway, we shall return. It's a home run breakfast spot in the top running with our favorites of Prasino, Toast, Yolk etc.."
"The deviled eggs here are amazing! Those crispy strips of bacon were the perfect touch. The chilaquiles were a thumbs down but the lemon pancake rocked according to my table. Overall, this is a cool place with a fresh vibe - flowers were gorgeous! I was slightly disappointed with the limitations of gluten free menu options but there's enough to get by.Our server was really nice. Too bad the hostesses weren't. We were told 1 hour wait so came back in an hour and waited towards the crowded front door for another 35 minutes while FOUR 4-top tables were vacant the entire time. I asked the hostesses about it and they said they were waiting for reservations. I'm sure the place makes enough money that they don't care about turning tables, but that's just money that is thrown out the window when that many of the same size table is sitting vacant for that long (aggravating those waiting by looking at them and probably aggravating the server who is making no money off the table during that time too)."
Update:   still the absolute BEST!
"My best friend and I were probably about to give up after an adventure of one-way streets, under-construction streets, difficulty parking and horrible rash drivers. But when we finally made it, we were happy there was no wait at 11:30am. Our server was very energetic and friendly and knew the specials well. After placing our orders - lemon pancakes for me, thanks to you Yelpers, with hot chocolate, and my friend got the tofu scramble with watermelon cooler - we started to discuss the decor and vibe of truly a 'cafe' - people had laptops and folders out - but in a restaurant setting. Our food arrived promptly and what more can you ask for as you're starving on a Saturday morning. A few minutes later, we started to discuss the Yelp review and we both agreed it was 4 stars. But when I asked her why not 5, neither of us had a response. Her measure was whether she would want to bring out of town guests - that would be worthy of 5 or 'as good as it gets.'We're certainly fans, although a little pricy to frequent, and inconvenient to get to, if you don't live in the neighborhood. Food didn't disappoint and the lemon pancakes were indeed quite good."
The Kingsbury Street Cafe is a little hard to get to but worth the trip.  I was with a large group (12) and everyone enjoyed their food. The reason I did not give KSC five stars is the staff's refusal to split out  our check. Everyone enjoyed their food but we will not go back as a group bc we where running around to get cash from Whole Foods to pay out check
"Chuck (Woolery): Welcome to this installment of The Love Connection. After being courted by three brunch places, Mary opted for a date with Kingsbury Street Cafe; so Mary, how'd it go?Mary: Well Chuck, it started out so promising. My dining partner in crime (DPIC) and I found some free street parking* and were quickly escorted to a table.Chuck: Sounds good so far.Mary: Yes, it was. Once seated, we perused the menus and took in the bright, cool, minimalist, and modern decor and waited. And waited, and waited, and waited, and wai..Chuck: So there was a lot of ...waiting?Mary: Yes, they definitely seemed to be playing hard to get. Despite lots of knowing glances from servers and bussers, it took a long time before someone acknowledged us/offered us water, coffee, etc. - we eventually took bets on the over/under. Fortunately, DPIC already had his morning coffee and I had a little pre-brunch snack - otherwise, who knows what might have happened.Chuck: Oh no, making someone wait for their morning beverages, especially coffee, is a major party foul!Mary: Right? When we finally got a server, we ordered water and all of our food - we weren't taking any chances. There was even more waiting before we finally had water in hand, but I do have to give a shout out to their cool purified water system - sparkling water is free. I ordered the dark chocolate stuffed french toast and a side of potatoes (with cheese natch) and DPIC, the salmon hash, but again it seemed like it took a while for our food to arrive.Chuck: Sounds tasty, was it worth the wait?Mary: Not really Chuck, we liked KSC, but there just wasn't that spark, that chemical reaction. My meal was fine, but not noteworthy (or wait-worthy); I did love that the french toast wasn't super eggy. I was concerned that my meal might be overwhelmingly sweet - with the chocolate and the whipped cream and heaped over the top - however, my dish actually erred on the bland side. DPIC agreed, and noted you really had to slosh the french toast in the sauce to overcome the blandness. DPIC didn't complain about his meal, but then again DPIC wasn't shy with the hot sauce. I did try a little of the hash and found the flavor flat and the choice to use tater tots, instead of diced potatoes, interesting. I was disappointed to learn that they had a breakfast and lunch menu after I had eaten, it would've been nice if they were offered.Chuck: So, I guess you and Kingsbury Street Cafe didn't make a love connection?Mary: No. The service, while friendly, needs work; they might need to put another server on the floor. Also, despite the nice presentation, the food left me wanting more; especially when compared to other brunch places of similar price points. I do see us remaining friendly though - especially the bakery case.*Don't park in the lot right next door, it's not for diners."
"Between shopping at Whole Foods and music class with the little one at Bubbles* you can say I'm a regular in this neighborhood. I tend to eat at Whole Foods a lot out of convenience, but they now have some very healthy competition across the street.As soon as I walked into this spacious bright restaurant I knew I was a fan.  And the menu has so many delicious things to choose from (both for breakfast & lunch) that I wasn't sure what to get.  When in doubt...get both!My dining companions were nice enough to share the lemon pancakes with me.  And we were in 100% agreement that there were the most heavenly pancakes ever (yep, ever).  We inhaled them even though we all had full entrees on the way.  For lunch I went with the veggie burger.  I can be picky when it comes to veggie burgers, but this one was fresh and oh so good.  And the fries that came with it were uh-mazing as well.Before leaving I made a reservation for a future breakfast.  Awesome atmosphere, tasty food AND they take reservations.  Incredible!!-------* yelp.com/biz/bubbles-aca…"
"No hesitation with my five star rating here.This place is gorgeous & a perfect destination for lunch -- tons of natural light, contemporary furniture, a fresh menu & great service.The most important thing you should know is that you MUST try the lemon pancakes wit with fresh blueberries, crème anglaise & lemon sauce. These things will change your life. We ordered them for the table, but I'd easily get them on my own for brunch. I can't put into words how incredible these pancakes were -- definitely the best I've ever had.I ordered the veggie burger for lunch (mixed beans, whole wheat bulgar, beets, trio of peppers, sautéed mushrooms & onions) and it came on a huge bun with lettuce and tomato, and it was damn near perfect. You get to pick a side and I ordered the fries, and they were seasoned perfectly. Every single person at the table was head over heels for their lunch...Order one of their delicious fruit coolers, and you have the most ideal lunch possible. As Christine W noted, this place looks simple and classic, but a lot of work went into their menu and you can taste the freshness. Oh, and check in on Yelp and get a free coffee!Go. Lunch. Now."
Food amazing! I've eaten here 4 times & keep coming back. Great atmosphere. I recommend lemon pancakes and lemon chia muffins. I can say some service and hostesses are terrible. Why give attitude to your customers? The only reason I don't give it a 5.
"Terrific coffee and delightful quinoa / fruit breakfast!  Easy street parking and they have a lot as well.  Whole Foods is directly across the street.The husband and I have been here twice for a late weekday breakfast and both of us really enjoy their flavorful coffee.I'm able to get heart healthy options (I love the quinoa) and he can get his full egg and accoutrements breakfast.  The bread used for the toast is delicious.The waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable, and does a good job as do the busses.The decor is spartan, very modern, and includes lots of artwork on the wall.  The washrooms are immaculate and beautifully finished.I don't know if they offer the space for events, but I think it could easily be adapted for a large private event.There's an open kitchen that is very nicely appointed, and not terribly noisy, despite the hard surfaces throughout.. They are set up with a counter for pastries and coffee at the front.  I speculate that they may have a carry out clientele as well as the eat in group.Our waiter told us that they may open for dinner in the future.I definitely recommend the Kingsbury Street Cafe for brunch/lunch."
Every time I come here I am never let down. Wow delish breakfast n drinks. I love the mimosas and every martini they have. They have amazing pancakes and their breakfast sandwich has a weird name but omg its heaven on earth. Love this place must try.
"Brunch party. Mostly women.... probably because I was here mid day on a weekday.My date and I ate unhealthy pancakes. Post coital. Anyway, carrot cake and lemon pancakes.... YUM!!!!! If it wasn't for all the shitty construction going on in that neighborhood I'd probably drop by more often. Comparable to Orange w.a. Peel. Id say...."
"Excited to try this place from all the reviews.  Not the best service, but great food. We asked to sit outside and were told it was a ten minute wait. We then heard the hostess tell the next three walk-ins it would be ten minutes.  Unfortunately, every table outside had either not received food or was in the beginning of their meals.  The ""ten minute"" wait time turned in 20, then 30.  We just asked the hostess to seat us inside.  Really annoying.  The service was similarly disappointing.  We had to ask a busboy to get our waitress a couple times.  The food was pretty decent.  I liked the eggs benedict with pulled pork, but it didn't have that rich, zesty flavor you want in bbq, so it ended up being bland.  We ordered a warm muffin, too.  It was very nice.  The blueberries tasted fresh and it was cooked perfect.  Overall, won't be back."
"My husband and I went to Kingsbury Street Cafe for brunch on a Sunday and they were crowded. Street parking is nearly impossible in the area, however there is a lot next door that only costs $4. We made reservations and were sat almost right away upon arrival, which we really appreciated. The atmosphere is lofty, with high ceilings and large windows. The noise level was loud, but not by any means unbearable.Our server was attentive for the first half of our meal - he welcomed us within five minutes of siting down, asked if we had any questions about the menu, and took our order as soon as we were ready. However, he never came back to check on us after the food came and we had to flag him down for the check. I don't know if he was in the weeds or if it is simply lack of training, but it did leave a little bad taste in our mouths and cost him a good tip.We each ordered an omelet and both agreed that our food was good, but not excellent. The prices at Kingsbury Street Cafe are noticeably higher than average compared to other brunch spots in the city, so we were expecting greatness. I did like their coffee, which is exceptionally strong and went straight to my head.There is a glass shelf with yummy tempting freshly baked goods when you walk in. We couldn't resist ordering something from the bakery to take home with us. We ended up with a chocolate cake pop, banana cake pop, and a red velvet cup cake. The cake pops were to die for, and I would go back just to pick up more. I was a little disappointed by the red velvet cup cake - the cake was a little on the drier side and the frosting wasn't my favorite.Overall, there were some high notes for us, but not enough to bring us back."
"When you have a ""piggy moo cluck sandwich"" on your menu, im down with whatever youre serving.But seriously.. the sandwich and homemade bread it was served on was right on time.  My kids ate the chicken tenders, which could have cooled down just a tad before being brought to the table.. but if thats my only gripe.. Id say they are doing a great job.  Probably go back for lunch, as they were only serving brunch on NYE"
"Awesome spot for vegan brunch! I got the garden tofu scramble, which also came with vegan sausage, bread, vegan butter, and roasted potatoes. SO delicious. Love the that tofu scramble was packed with tons of veggies. Also had a bloody mary, which was one of the best I've ever had! My brunch companions also enjoyed their non-vegan selections. Highly recommended!"
"We went there yesterday for lunch around 1:30pm.  Waited for about 25 mins.  We shared the piggy moo cluck sandwich & lemon pancakes.  The bread was so fresh & the pancakes were very fluffy.  So delicious!!  The Vietnamese coffee was pretty good, too.  We for sure will go back to try their bakeries."
"Brunch, it is such a glorious way to spend a weekend morning yet I admit I get into a Meli's rut. I decided to give Kingsbury Street Cafe a try after reading about in the newspaper, admittedly I had attempted to go once before but the lack of free parking deterred me. Never fear! There is valet to the south and a pay to park lot just to the north of the restaurant.Now lets get onto the great stuff, the FOOD. My Mom had their lemon blueberry pancakes, and sausage. I am not a huge fan of lemon but I decided to try hers because a good pancake is the staple of any brunch spot. The pancakes were light, fluffly, delicious. The lemon was ACTUAL lemon, not nasty lemon extract- trust me I can taste the difference. I had an omelet with feta, broccoli and spinach served with potatoes. Our server (who was great by the way) asked me how firm I like my eggs. WHOOO. I HATE water-y not solid eggs and was pleased to receive a FIRM omelet. The potatoes were good, not great, and not so many but they were seasoned well. I would recommend a PASS on the muffins. Ginger D. makes a better muffin, as does Dunkin Doughnuts or Corner Bakery.I have to stop and pause to pay homage to the Ethiopian drip coffee! AHHH so good. So strong, so rich. I would go back just for the coffee.It should be noted that the decor is modern and spacious, parents with strollers or individuals in wheelchairs never fear there is plenty of room to maneuver in this establishment. Our waiter was super sweet, but not clingy or hovering. Even though it was a Saturday morning (around 11:30am) there was no wait. I look forward to going back and giving some of their more unusual breakfast items a try."
"Oh dear.Every Sunday morning my friends and I log onto Yelp, choose a new place we haven't been to before, and head out to brunch. Until today, Yelp has been a trusted and sure companion in our forays into the post-breakfast pre-lunch world of Chicago brunch. Today that all changed.Let's start at the beginning: I never call ahead, assuming that most places will not take reservations on a Sunday, but I noticed a review mentioned that Kingsbury St Cafe would take them, so I did. Sure enough the woman on the phone, who was identified as being the hostess, told me she would have a table ready for us. Great start (one star).When we arrived, there was a crowd inside the door... and no hostess. WTF KSC? No hostess?? On a Sunday?? This seemed like a bad idea. Sure enough, when the ""hostess"" - who was also acting as busser and food runner - finally appeared, she asked how many we were. No, nothing else, that was it. She just asked, nodded, and didn't write it down. ""Wait"", I said, ""I called ahead!"" But she was gone. It took another 15 minutes to catch her again, at which point it was 15 minutes before our reservation was due. We asked if our table would be ready in time, and she told us it would be close to an hour. So when they say they take reservations, they mean it in the loosest possible sense (minus that first star).As we re-grouped to determine if it was worth waiting, a group of seven arrived loudly discussing how they were 90 minutes late for their ""reservation"". ""Ha."" I thought ""90 minutes late? Join the back of the queue"". But lo and behold, when they finally tracked down the ""hostess"", they were seated within 10 minutes. Wait a minute KSC, I'm here with my party of 5, on time, no, half an hour early, and you're telling me that I have to wait another hour past my reservation time, but the 7 who turn up ridiculously late get sat almost immediately? Nope, not ok.We were tired, hungry, thirsty and more than a little annoyed, so we went to the bar to get some water. It shouldn't take almost 10 minutes and a lot of waving in your direction to get a glass of water when there's three of you standing behind the bar. But it did.As we were waiting for the water we looked around and noticed a lot of people were sat with no food in front of them. Either they were waiting a long time for breakfast, or a long time to pay. Either way that's not a winning situation.As I said before, we're seasoned brunchers... we've waited hours (yes, once or twice it has been plural) for tables on many a Sunday morning, but the difference has been that we believed that at the end of the wait there really would be a table. We believed the hostess really did know, and care, that we were waiting. We drank our water, and left. We would have told the ""hostess"" we were leaving, but we couldn't find her, so we didn't."
"If you're looking for a nice place to sit outside, enjoy great food, and not be hassled by waiters then this is your spot. It's clean, the food is of that organic/farmy type, and it tastes good! I've had the omelettes and scrambled eggs and have never been let down. It's a breakfast that you can walk away from, not have to be rolled out."
"The Kingsbury menu is why I get excited about brunch. Its a twist on traditional leaning toward gourmet. My brunch party of six women left very satisfied, and I would count them all as tough critics. Surprisingly there wasn't any whining afterward about being stuffed and wishing they avoided eating that last pancake. The meals are not weighed down by too much butter, cream, or home fries. Everyone's dish was warm, fresh, light, and used very quality ingredients. I had the Kingsbury Cafe Breakfast: two eggs, turkey sausage, a cheddar scone, roasted tomatoes, and herb potatoes. Everyone at the table was eyeing my scone, and for good reason. It was warm, fluffy, and savory. The rest of the meal is pretty standard, but better than expected. I loved the roasted tomatoes mixed with egg. My friends got the Salmon hash, the Shrimp Egg white Fritatta, the Eggs Benedict, and the Dark Chocolate French toast. Everyone was very pleased with their choices. The Shrimp Frittata was most impressive with its giant shrimp atop the fluffy eggs.We all loved the food, but we did NOT love all the noise and crying babies. The high ceilings and minimalist decor also create an echo. The interior reminds me of a museum cafeteria. Its not particularly comfortable or welcoming. I would NOT come here if I was trying to nurse a hangover or aiming for a quiet breakfast. Ideally, we could have dined on the patio, but the steady traffic from Whole Foods and the dust from the nearby construction eliminated this option. FYI, the coffee is rocket fuel. Its very bold and dark. I also walked in on a Saturday at 11AM and there were plenty of tables available. My meal was great, but the noise level and echo prevent me from making this a brunch favorite. Maybe I'll consider brunch to go??"
"Brunch from hell.   Incompetent staff.  Waited an hour, hostess needs to be trained to HOST and how to greet people and actually keep tabs... Just said ""oh I have been watching for when people get here"".  You obviously aren't...Good guess to why outdoor seating was closed... You can't even handle the main room.  Not worth my time in the slightest."
"A brunch place next to a strip club??? Hmm... not sure how to feel about that, but then again, a whole foods next to a strip club seems a little odd too :)So my friend and I met on this beautiful day for brunch at Kingsbury-- evidently they serve dinner now too!I got the salmon/poached egg hash.  It was quite delicious!  I love anything with salmon in it (well, except a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with salmon in it), and the tater tots / eggs make it delightful!  My friend had the eggs benedict and loved her meal.  We also dined outside on in the little area in front.  It'd be a super nice view if it wasn't for the construction on kingsbury and the strip club next door.... but anyway, all in all it was great!  I'd definitely come back.  Don't tell other people though, I don't want to have to wait in a long line next time I come ^ ^;;"
"Light and airy, once you step foot into KSC, you'll be overcome with a feeling of calm anticipation. The floor plan is wide open, with a high ceiling and neutral colors. There's nothing to offend or distract, which is a good thing because you're here to eat... a lot. Perfect for ladies who lunch or friends looking to grab a bite, KSC has plenty of selections from breakfast to lunch. Before you decided on ordering ANYTHING else, commit to ordering the lemon pancakes. Sweet, savory, doughy, fresh, and supremely decadent, this mix of with fresh blueberries, crème anglaise & lemon sauce atop lovingly fluffy cakes will send your mouth into fits of pure joy. I don't know anyone who can resist the power of the lemon pancake. Again, just do it.After demolishing the pancake, you have some choices. You can stay breakfasty and dig on the piggy moo cluck sandwich which consists of eggs, ham, maple glazed bacon, and cheddar cheese served on ciabatta bread. Accompanied by herb potatoes, be prepared to ask for a 'to go' bag because your stomach will be pushed to its limits. Or, if lunch is more your thing, spend some time getting to know the turkey burger. ""Really?"" Really. Served on ciabatta, this is a huge all-natural ground turkey patty (cooked to taste) that comes with avocado, sautéed mushrooms, onions, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and gruyere cheese (for a buck extra). It's a wonderfully messy burger that seems a bit out of place in such a put together establishment. While water's always in style, go a little nuts and order the fruit cooler. The refreshing blend of orange mango served in a tall, narrow glass will have you saying 'hello' to fresh flavors and make your tablemates green with envy. If you'd told me there was a cafe of such repute next door to a gentleman's club in a cold, lonely corner of the Clyborn Corridor (SoNo is *not* catching on, folks), I would have thought you were crazy. Well, pass the white jacket, cuz I'm crazy along with you... crazy for delicious food! Hyuck!"
"My husband and I went here for lunch based on a favorable review we saw on Check Please. My husband's steak sandwich was good, but my Boston bib  salad, which I ordered with grilled chicken with had many problems1.did not come with the chicken, an after letting our server know, it took 20 minutes for thechicken to come. It basically came as 2 pieces/parts,that weren't sliced and I had to attempt to do so with a butter knife.  The lettuce part was basically the huge leaves from the head that were not ripped or torn to make them anywhere near a managable sixze.  The salad was servedin a bowl so my attempts to make the lettuce smaller were pretty much futile.  We should have gone to Whole Foods across the street!  Would not go back"
"Brunch?  Vegan options?  Yes please!  Kingsbury Café is a great brunch spot and the wait is indicative of this, be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes.  When seated I couldn't help but notice how ""modern sleek"" the restaurant was, reminiscent of Karyn's on Green.  After I ordered my tofu scramble, my bf pointed out the vegan chia seed breakfast pudding on the menu.  Curiosity made me order it as well and it did not disappoint.  The chia pudding was topped with delicious fruit and we were given light agave nectar to pour atop it as well.  I loved it so much that I took it upon myself to learn how to make it at home, yum!  The tofu scramble was also really good, among one of the better tofu scrambles in town.  My bf and I will definitely be back, but the wait can be overwhelming.  P.S. They also have vegan options on the dinner menu."
"I'm giving two stars because the services was amazingly bad.  But the BBQ Chicken sandwich I had two bites of before I had to leave was pretty damn good.My wife met me out for a quick lunch on my lunch hour on a weekday.  She also brought our baby.  We knew we had to eat fast.  We were seated promptly.  Then waited nearly 20 minutes for the staff to take our drink order.  After taking the order and fleeing, the waiter did not return with my wife's drink or take our order.After additional waiting, I flagged down the waiter to take our order.  She took my wife's order for a burger medium well, no onions or mushrooms, with fries.  And my order for a BBQ sandwich with a substitution of multigrain bread for the focaccia (which was nice).The food came out and my sandwich looked amazing.  However my wife's burger was:1) not cooked - this wasn't even medium rare.  it wasn't YET rare.2) had onions and mushrooms on it.I tried to flag down our waitress again.  But the place is large and she couldn't see us.  But another waiter saw us and we told them about him about the burger.  He whisked the burger away and returned with a small plate.A few minutes pass and we realize - hmm - this burger isn't coming back soon.  About this time, our baby started to get a little fussy - about an hour has passed and that's about the limit of patience for baby out and about on a hot day.  So my wife makes the executive decision that lunch is over.  (I did mention I was out on my lunch break - so I needed to get back anyway..)We ask the waiter if they can just wrap up that burger and my mostly uneated BBQ sandwich and we'll take the check.  He tells us that the burger is being made again fresh and that he already told his manager about the issue with it.  I guess we appreciate his willingness to jump in and totally screw his workmate. (JK - this was a total dick move.)By now, the baby is heading into ""I will totally embarrass you"" mode.  My wife packs up her stuff to head to the car where she can take care of the tyke.  The manager walks up to and tells us that our meal will be comped. (What meal?  You mean my meal that I asked to have boxed up because I was waiting for my wife's burger to be served fully-cooked? Or do you mean her meal THAT SHE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT?)Incredibly generous. Really.Anyway, we walked out of there.  As we were leaving, our waitress tried to hand us the check.  I just ignored her as we walked out.Could be a fluke.  But I'm not going to bother finding out.  (Still recommend that BBQ sandwich if you do go, and would you mind terribly picking one up for me? Thanks!)"
"Across from the Mall sized Whole Foods, Kingsbury Street Cafe is no slouch.  Sleek and modern designed eatery will give you a fantastic brunch.  Choices use uncommon and healthful ingredients to perhaps woo in the average Lincoln Park or Whole Foods goer. Modern artwork on the walls provide favorable views as well as the simplistic design of the place.  Give it a go when mixing up your brunch."
"This place has a neutral colors decor with some nice details. It's beautiful and it has a good vibe. We shared - kingsbury breakfast ****Scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, baked tomatoes and potatoes and a cheese scone- dark chocolate stuffed French toast ****I loved both dishes, they were fantastic. The staff is very nice."
Set reservation at 11 and they gave away our table to another patron when we arrived and told us we would have to wait 40 minutes for another table. Extremely frustrating because we made the reservation a week in advance. Won't be coming back.
"My new pick for brunch.  This place takes reservations, is spacious but in a refreshing, modern way that doesn't amplify sound to unbearable levels.  They have valet parking ($8 at the VIP's lot - do NOT park in the spaces immediately in front of KSC or you'll be towed).  The staff are universally professional, friendly, and fast.  The bathroom looks like it belongs at the Dana, more modern hotel than breakfast cafe.  Sure, it's a little off the beaten path and currently in the middle of a construction zone, but I can forgive that.  I like field trips to new areas of the city, and since I don't frequent VIPs, this counts.  My SOLE complaint was my bloody mary.  The waitress asked if I would like cucumber vodka instead of regular vodka.  What she failed to mention was that it tacked on an extra $10 to the price of my drink.  WTF, otherwise awesome waitress?!Anyway, returning to the positives.  Namely, the carrot pancakes.  I've been dreaming of the carrot pancakes.  They come with maple-infused cream cheese frosting that will romance your socks off.  Note that I HATE restaurant pancakes very much.  I am a picky eater of breakfast foods and generally only like pancakes made by yours truly.  I don't know what stroke of impulsive, crazy decision-making lead me to the carrot pancakes but they will bring me back to KSC time and time again.  Everyone else loved their meals too, just not in the everlasting love kind of way that I feel for these pancakes.  Order them.  Thank me."
"Had brunch here today.This is a neat little place. It's tucked away in an odd location (across from an enormous Whole Foods and next to a gentleman's club). Not sure anyone would ever find it if they weren't looking for it and yet the place was pretty packed, which is always a good sign!I had their all natural beef burger with cheddar cheese and fried egg toppings. It was a nice-sized 'take a nap afterwards' portion and cooked really well. Based on this alone, they were a 4-star for me.My date had the chocolate-stuffed French toast and a side of maple bacon. Her food was good but the French toast had a sweetness I wouldn't associate with dark chocolate per se and the bacon was underwhelming. Maybe I'm spoiled by brunch at Zed 451 (which, in all fairness, is 2X as expensive as this place) but a $3.50 side of bacon should be a thicker, premium cut.All in all, pretty good. There are options closer to my home that would probably earn my brunch dollars more regularly in the future but this is a worthy stop for anyone near the madness that is the North/Clybourne/Halstead corridor."
Fantastic!  I saw it on Check Please and it was worth it.  Unlike many other brunch/breakfast places you can make a reservation here.  Their lemon pancakes were amazing.  Free parking everywhere.
"Excellent food. My brother and I came for a late brunch .. I had an omelette with turkey sausage, avocado, leeks and gruyere cheese. Went with other reviewers and opted for the roasted tomato and toast. I was pleased with my choices. My brother had the BBQ chicken sandwich and side salad. Everything was phenomenal. I will be back just for that chicken sandwich!"
"The service was pretty darn good. Everyone was friendly, nice ambiance, cool art.. high ceilings and a sweet patio.That being said..I wasn't blown away by the food. The garden tofu scramble had a mild/bland flavor, the miso undetectable and the portion much too small. The potatoes were seasoned well but overcooked so they became dry and stiff. The veggie sausage patty had a good flavor and texture but again, small portion, just one little patty. The vegan bread was also terrific.. it wasn't until I came home afterwards and looked at the menu again that I realized they'd forgotten the butter so obviously it was a little dry too. My buddy had an omelette which looked very nice and he seemed pleased. We all got down on some bloody mary's but they were weak at best.. at $8 a pop they can do better. That was maybe the biggest let down.I hate to be a complainer but my experience with the food wasn't anything to write home about. Fortunately they're demonstrating other virtuous qualities of a successful and thoughtful restaurant so perhaps I'll give them another try in the future... preferably when the road construction out front is complete and when there are some bike racks."
"great food and service.  lemon pancakes pretty amazing, and unique.  nice environment, with tables that aren't too close to one another.  would eat here again."
"This place needs to get it together.Excellent food. Everything else is horrible. I'm sorry, but don't have 4 waiters on a Sunday morning for brunch. Brunch is busy- ALWAYS. I get that. But staff for it. These people were running around like chickens with no heads. I don't mind waiting for a table or food, but when you have to wait for your waiter to even acknowledge you or literally have to get up and get things yourself, or go more than 20 minutes without water.. then we have a problem.Came here the morning after a bachelorette party. Nothing is worse than being tired and hungover and waiting for nearly 25 minutes for coffee and basically begging for water. The other downside- this place echos like crazy and it is too loud to even have a conversation. Had the eggs benedict and it kicked ass. If you want to try it, make sure you have an abundance of patience and a willingness to subject yourself to shitty service."
"Kingsbury Cafe is one of my new favorite brunch spots. I headed over here after running a half-marathon and it was the perfect post race meal. We sat on the patio which was great and all of the food I saw go by me looked amazing. I ordered a personalized omlette (with avocado, mushrooms, onions, feta) which was large and delicous. The roasted tomatoes were a nice touch and I thought the multi grain bread was a great change from plain toast. Everyone at our table devoured her meal. Cant wait to retuern!"
"Ate there twice in one day. Brunch:Admittedly, I was pretty hung over before sitting down to eat, so I didn't have my normal appetite. That said, I built my own omelette and appreciated being asked how well-done I would like it. Since I'm not a fan of runny eggs, it's nice to be asked this. The omelette was good, large and seasoned nicely. Dinner:Feeling better than I did at lunch, I started off with a Robert the Bruce Scottish Ale from Three Floyds. Nice to find it available...can be tough to find these bottles. Started off with a very good beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios. It was dressed lightly, which I prefer, and I made quick work of it. Main course was their Five Spice Chicken with orange salad. Found the chicken to be a hair too dry, but I think I prefer chicken more moist than most. Desert was their magnificent chocolate blackout cake - amazingly rich without being heavy or too dense. This paired really well with what was left of my Robert the Bruce."
I love this place for brunch!
"I had seen so much buzz about this new place on Yelp and I finally got to give it a try.  We were up early on a Sunday morning and I knew that if we got to the restaurant right when it opened at 9am we wouldn't have to wait.  We grabbed a cab and were on our way - but we have trouble finding it.  Turns out it is right across from the Whole Foods.I loved the atmosphere, it was sunny a bright.  The space is very open, it is very modern.  The first thing you see when you walk in is a big case filled with pastries.  We could not resist ordering a blueberry muffin.  The muffin was perfectly toasted and was crisp and crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I loved it and I don't even like blueberries!For breakfast, the Eggs Benedict with Chicken caught my eye.  It was far too much food to eat - but I certainly tried.  The only thing that I could comment on is that the poached eggs were a little under-cooked.I will definitely be going back to the Kingsbury Street Cafe, many of the menu items caught my eye - I had trouble choosing."
"It's a great place to meet friends to catch up, but don't go here if you're in a hurry.Although service was friendly, it was painfully slow. I think it took about an hour for our food to come out. The food was just ok. I had really high hopes for the lemon pancakes, but just found them to be all right."
I've had a lot of great eggs benedict in my life. The BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict at Kingsbury St Cafe is probably the best I've ever had.That is all.
"Spacious restaurant with clean and simple decor. What a lovely change of pace not to have tables packed into a restaurant as though they were playing a game of Tetris!The service is here is fantastic....helpful, friendly, attentive. The coffee is strong but smooth with no bitterness, a welcome treat for brunch after a LONG night out :)I was overwhelmed, in a good way, when it came to ordering. There are so many interesting options here at Kingsbury St Cafe. I had a hard time choosing between the whole wheat carrot pancakes, shrimp egg white frittata, salmon hash, and miso scramble. I EVENTUALLY settled on the salmon hash and it was delectable!! Flaky perfectly cooked salmon, mixed with fresh veggies that still had their snap and potatoes that we NOT mush!! My friend had the shrimp egg white frittata and found it to be delicious.With all the construction on Kingsbury Street I fear this little gem of a cafe might not be getting all the traffic it deserves. Do not let the construction steer you away, it is quite worth it!  I will be coming back to try all the other menu options."
"One of our favorite spots for breakfast, can't believe it took us so long to find it. Many unique items with a real hand-crafted feel make many dishes a real treat. Fun drinks, bakery, and service is always spot-on."
"I saw a policeman talk about Kingsbury Cafe on 'Check Please'; and so when I was having my auto worked on at Grossinger, i thought I would wander down there for a latte instead of drinking the coffee in the waiting room at Grossinger's. (They have a great service department, but, the coffee....well...)When I walked into the Cafe,I thought how airy and bright the place was...beautifully laid out. But, what you are welcomed with is the warmth of the Staff, Martin, who has been there since the opening where he started as a busboy, is such a gentleman. He doesn't give you the hard sell or try to push you out of there. It is a place to take your time and enjoy the food, and wonderful drinks. i took my husband there for Brunch on this past Sunday. It was a bit of a wait, but, everybody was patient because they know that what is waiting for them at the end of the wait is well worth it. Whitney, who served us, was attentive without being overbearing, and very funny without being a comedian. We enjoyed the Mimosa's which she announced as the 'Mad Hatter Mimosa' because I happened to like the name of that beer that they have listed; but I am not a fan of beer and so she renamed our order of the mimosa(how's that for thinking fast on her feet?) I loved the Croque Madame and side salad, and my husband enjoyed the Vegetable frittata. The first time that i was there, the latte was a LOT better than Grossinger's coffee...but, I don't think they can change a battery as quick as Grossinger did! Definitely a win/win day!"
"Excellent brunch location! The restaurant atmosphere and design thrives in its understated elegance. The coffee, vital for any brunch, is delightful, and I never saw myself with an empty mug. I recommend the Kingsbury Benedict which, I believe, is the definition of brunch. A happy medley of BBQ chicken and spinach adds so much flavor to the classic breakfast dish. Service was impeccable, as our server, Jenny Lynn, seemed to be everywhere at once and never without a smile."
"Kingsbury cafe is one of my favorite breakfast spots.  There's a ton of seating, so you're probably not going to have a long wait.  The inside is very bright, and airy--it's a calm,uncluttered restaurant with great quality food.  The last time I came here, I had a red quinoa oatmeal style dish.  Absolutely delicious, and it was a welcome change from the standard breakfast fare.  The baguettes are a great way to get a little appetizer in before breakfast, and the fruit plates are actually well done.  The coffee is properly strong, a rarity among brunch spots.  The staff is super friendly, and makes you feel taken care of--they come by the perfect amount of times, and are great about remembering ketchup, Tabasco sauce, and the like.  I can't think of a single other restaurant in Chicago that has a similar ambiance or style of food, and would highly recommend coming here for something a little out of the ordinary."
"Came here for breakfast one morning and we couldn't believe how nice the interior was.  It seems a bit incongruous with the prices and the plating is nicer than places like Original Pancake House.Anyway we opened up with some nice oatmeal, but nothing fantastic.  Piggy Moo Cluck Sandwich is very good, but the roasted potatoes as a side could really use some work being a bit dry and flavorless.  Our other item was a the Chocolate-Stuffed French Toast, good but doesn't beat the french toast at Bongo Room for instance.I would really give it 3.5 stars, but it is has a very nice atmosphere for a sleepy weekend morning that I rounded up."
"The lemon pancakes and maple-syrup marinated bacon are worth braving the traffic and lack of parking at this lousy location. Again - Lemon pancakes. They also have fresh baked goods for takeout or as an accompaniement to your meal. Order a fresh muffin and it comes grilled with a pat of butter. The cheddar scone is the highlight of the basic 2-egg breakfast. The restaurant is voluminous with plenty of tables. I've never had to wait. It's also very kid-friendly. The small details and fresh ingredients  (fingerling potatoes served with entrees, fresh baguettes, etc) probably make up for the high prices. I'm a major brunch fan and live in walking distance. Hopefully this place stays around."
"I am sorry to say, but I was underwhelmed by my experience here. We will start with what they did right: The feel of the restaurant is perfect. The tall ceilings, the furniture, and the open kitchen make it very pleasant to be here. The coffee is also quite tasty.Here is why they lost 3 stars: They are trying too hard. There are few people more high saditty than me, but the high brow combinations Kingsbury are trying to pull off just come off as unappealing. The Omelets are standard, and to be honest not worth coming all the way out there for. The last straw is the fact that there is no alcohol. To be fair to Kingsbury - I am probably not their targeted demographic. I believe my party was the only table without at least one baby. Also, when it comes to my brunch I prefer reliable choices with interesting add-ons (not the other way around). I am sure Kingsbury will not hurt from one so-so review."
Took my parents here for Easter Sunday Brunch.  Was able to make reservations.  The service was fantastic.  Coffee was delicious.  And food was mmm mmm good!  Love the assortment of cheese choices for the omelette!  And the baguette was amazing!!  Can't wait to go back.
"Yummy! Tofu scramble was delicious, my son loved his pancakes, The coffee was strong with great flavor.  Add in the free sparkling water, awesome decor, and crazy good pastries, and I'm hooked. I think next time we come, word will have gotten out , so there will be a long wait, but it will be worth it!"
"This might be the best brunch omelette I've very had. Seriously. It looked perfect, the egg wasn't overdone, the ingredients were also cooked well and it's pretty damn big to boot. Do they bake their own bread? Because it is amazing, love the toast that comes with it. Potatoes were decent, had some herbs and I think they use a higher quality potato or something because it actually had its own flavor going on, nice. Food took a while but the service was attentive and they recommended the fresh pastries which was also amazing. Too bad I live on the west coast..."
Went here on a Friday am for brunch.Atmosphere is cute cafe like. Service was pretty good but it wasn't busy Lots of vegetarian options on the menu- had a burger and my husband had the omelette special Bloody Mary and mimosa to start  was pretty standard stuffThey do take reservations for party of six or More.
"This might be my new fav place for brunch!  The decor is sleek and modern, service is friendly, and the menu has a few items that I never saw before and thought was pretty unique!  Real quick, let me tell you about the service.  We had a 45 minute wait for a table, so the host took our # down and called us when our table was ready! We had the option to leave and walk around while we waited for our table!  brilliant!!My friend and I got one sweet dish and one savory dish... it's how we roll.  For our savory dish, we got their deviled eggs with crispy chorizo and chives.  It was SO good! They're very decadent, so it was a perfect plate to share.  For the sweet, we ordered the dark chocolate stuffed french toast.  It was hands down amazing.  I'm a chocoholic, so it doesn't take much to please me... these were great!"
"The Kingsbury Street Café is located on the near northwest side of Chicago and is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner.  It advertises that reservations are accepted, but when I tried to make one for a party of four for Sunday brunch at 10:15 a.m., I was informed that they would not take it for that time without offering an explanation.  However, I was told that there probably would not be a waiting line at that time.  So on the Sunday morning in question my party of four arrived shortly before 10:15 a.m. and was seated quickly.   The dining room is large with a minimalist décor.  There is a bakery up front that you have to walk past to get to the dining area.  The brunch menu, which I found to be limited, has a bit of a Vietnamese influence.We started by sharing a large muffin that was fresh and delectable.  I ordered the Kingsbury Eggs Benedict, which substitutes pulled barbequed chicken for ham, based on the recommendation of our server who said it was spicy and flavorful. One of our party ordered pancakes, and the others egg dishes.  With regard to my selection, I found the chicken to be bland and tasteless.  The others found their food to be just O.K.  The overall quality of the main courses was not only disappointing but also overpriced. Although the dining room has a very high ceiling, the room noise was very loud that made it difficult to converse.  Service was friendly and fairly efficient.  Close parking is very difficult to find on the street, but there is a pay lot adjacent to the restaurant.My poor experience at the Kingsbury Street Café left me with no desire to return."
"Great place to eat in the area.  Among the many chains, this place has a story and character.  Tasty food and great service.  Check it out!"
