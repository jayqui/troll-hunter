Brianna’s Restaurant
"Wow! I'm from los angeles and this place  is definitely one of the best places I've tried for salvadorean food.Everything was delicious.  The rice perfectly cooked. The pupusas, and Beans  were as good as the ones My mom cooks I felt as if I was home .Also had a hot chocolate,  wow amazing! ! Thanks for such wonderful food."
"I came rolling in before Friday Night Karaoke at the Atlantic, and was very excited to try my first pupusas.  Sadly, they left a little to be desired.  They were okay, but rather bland.  We also had two combination platters, one with carne asada and chile relleno and the other with vegetarian options, and both were ""eh"".  The steak was very thin and tough, and the other elements were just okay.BUT!  Why still a three star review?  Because apparently the love and joy all resides in the Guatemalan section of the menu.  My friend who got the pepian chicken stew said that it was probably one of the best things he had EVER tasted.  I'd have tried it, but he made growling noises and pulled the dish away whenever anyone got close. So, I'll definitely come back, but will avoid the section of Mexican dishes put on the menu for Gringos afraid of authentic food."
"My boyfriend and I had read a lot of great things about this place.It's close to home so I we popped in this Monday. It doesn't look like much outside but the inside was very cute. BYOB. Prices were reasonable. Waitress service was decent but not amazing. Chips and salsa delivered for free but chips were a little stale tasting. Beware the green sauce is amazing but HOT! Really wish we had had crispy chips. We tried the pork, cheese, bean papususa. It was decent but really hit it's stride when we added the cole slaw like side it came with. Trust me, even if you don't like cole slaw you must add this to every bite. We both went with traditional dinners but there was more that was americanized or mexican style. Our dinners were both a type of stew with rice. Good flavors - we really enjoyed them. It was enough for us each to take enough home for second dinner the next day. Overall we enjoyed it and will try it again!"
"I was looking for something different and came to Yelp looking for a restaurant to go for my BDay and came across Brianna's. Let me qualify my knowledge about restaurant, my first 10 years of work history I worked in kitchens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado, Montana, Minnesota and more. I've worked in fast food, catering, diners and up scale formal restaurants such as Chets, Chef Paul, Blue Moon and a few other 4 and 5 star restaurants. Chef Paul was considered one of the top restaurants in the world and was located on State Street in Chicago. Some of you might know it because of it's reputation and others may know it from the movie ""The Blues Brothers"". OK I'm not going to compare Brianna's to Chef Paul although I felt that I was eating a meal prepared by a five star chef. The room is small and the food is excellent. I had never had Pupusas although I like them. The beef dish I had I wasn't real fond of, the sauce wasn't to my liking although the meat was tender and the potatoes were cook perfectly. I will return to Brianna's again to try something else on the menu. OH and the price, you won't believe value I think we were $35 for appetizers, drinks, meal and desert."
Great food. We ordered the Guatemalan leaf and ground pork skin pupusas and the chicken stew. Those dishes were delicious. It's the first time I had Guatemalan food. So I am no expert but it doesn't matter to me because we loved it. The place is tiny and clean. Highly recommended
"I don't know why this place has such good reviews. Papusas were too bready, ceviche was mediocre, the pork that came with the yuca was so dry and old you could hardly chew it,  the tamal was just all bread and no real filling, and the food took a while to come. I won't be back"
Amazing food!!!! I have been here twice and i love love their food! Pupusas and tamales de elote are to die for!! This is coming from a Salvadoran.
"I thought I had been eating the best pupusas for the past 15 years until I came to this restaurant. The food is very tasty- literary. I also has platanos fritos, in which I have to say we're better than my grandmas. I'm from a Salvadoran background and was very satisfied."
They have the best beef soup (caldo de res) i have ever tryed in my life. For a moment i thougth i was eating at home.
"We stopped in for dinner tonight FINALLY and it was SO good! I had a couple different tamals and pupusas...and the food baby to prove it:) It looks to be BYOB, so will definitely be back!"
"Being from SF I was lucky to have been exposed to a variety of Latin cuisines and quickly fell in love with Salvadorian. Coming to Chicago was hard when I could only find (Mediocre at best) Mexican food so when i drove past Brianna's I was instantly excited to try it. This is now my 4th trip back and maybe one day I'll get something different but the vegetarian combo with a horchata will always be the perfect meal. Their guacamole is how I want all avocados to taste, the pupusas are a dream, and although service is a bit slow at times it's worth it for the authentic AMAZING food!"
"Um, yeah. It's pretty fantastic! I really enjoyed my first visit. I would say it's a little cold inside but other than that? That's the only negative.They have to have the best beans on the planet, and the onions. Yummy!"
"Finally food a Guatemalan restaurant that will meet my moms (she's Guatemalan) standards. Awesome food, good prices and BYOB!!!!!!"
"Love, love, love everything about this restaurant I know there was a different owner before and it wasn't as great as it is now.  Its a super cute place and love the beautiful atmosphere and colors/decor of the place. Also the service is beyond amazing very attentive waitresses,  very kind and patient and give great recommendations when you don't know your way around the menu. Love the popusas and atole de maiz amazing!!!!! Will definitely stop by this weekend"
This place is a *HIDDEN GEM*I always order for pick up and my food is always nicely packaged and delicious.  In my opinion this is the BEST POPUSA PLACE in Chicago.  The staff is friendly too.
I think it's all been said here so I will just add....I love it when you find a place where you want to try everything on the menu.
"This place is one of the few places to get authentic pupusas in Chicago. Not only is the food delicious, the portions are extremely large. And all of the sides are phenomenal including the rice, black beans, spicy cabbage and pickled veggies. You may overlook it because of where it's located and the relatively small dining area but this is worth the trip. The only negative, and this is really not a negative, is that everything is cooked to order so please don't go in a rush."
"I give Brianna's a solid 4.5 stars!!  Seriously tasty Guatemalan and Salvadoran cuisine, and ridiculously inexpensive!!  My girlfriend and I dined at Brianna's a few days ago.  We ordered quite of few menu items...the black bean and the squash pupusas, the chicken soup, the yellow rice with chicken, and the toasted tostadas with oregano/lime guacamole.  Everything was super delicious!!  The Guatemalan Pollo Amarillo / yellow chicken with rice, potatoes, and veggies was rich and flavorful.  The chicken was perfectly tender and juicy.  This sort of reminded me of a cross between Indian Chicken Masala and a Mexican Mole Verde...both equally delicious, so this Guatemalan dish really delivered!The chicken soup was one of the very best that I've ever tasted....I will make a special trip just for the soup!!!    I couldn't believe how much tender and juicy chicken was served with this dish...crazy!!  Toasted Oregano Guacamole tostada's were blended with fresh oregano leaves with lime and cilantro (pretty sure it was fresh oregano as opposed to the overpowering dried oregano).  The oregano added a new and refreshing element to the more common traditional guac sans oregano.The vegetarian combo platter was all quite good, but rather greasy.  The refried black beans were really good, but too salty.  For this, I couldn't give them more than 4.5 stars.The service was attentive and efficient without being overpowering...just perfect!This place is teeny tiny, so get there early or call for a reservation, as it always fills up quickly!I can't wait to go back to try a few more things on the menu.Extra bonus, it's BYOB and it's in the heart of Lincoln Square, about 1.5 blocks north of the Western Avenue Brown Line stop."
I cant say how amazing everything at this restaurant was. it is very authentic and the customer service is awesome.
"Legit Central American food served in this place. Gem of a spot! Our table ordered 4 different kinds of pupusas, including the puposa loca which was HUGE and delicious. We also ordered Pepian, Jocon Cobanero, and Revolcado - all outstanding! The Revolcado was our favorite."
This is a small restaurant and if you are eating on site is alittle claustrophobic. ..but the food is awesome ...plenty and tasty.... best value for every dollar.. loroco pupusa is my favorite. U got to have one ....
One of the best spots for authentic popusas in town!
"I'd never had Guatemalan food before, but if you like Mexican food and/or Puerto Rican food you're going to LOVE this place.The food was incredible and crazy cheap for the quality that you get. Just over $10 a person for a ton of great food, and we both had lunch the next day with our leftovers.Based on Yelp reviews and our goal of getting more authentic dishes my boyfriend and I ended up ordering 3 appetizers and 1 main dish to share:* 1 pupusa. You must try the Guatemalan flower and cheese. The flavor of the ""flower"" is not floral-y, but super savory, almost like nopales. Either way, it was probably the best thing we ate--and everything we had was great!* 1 tamal guatemalteco. The second best tamale I've had in my life (after the ones at Taste of Peru). The corn wasn't dense like a typical tamale, but really light and fluffy. The pork inside was fork tender, and the giant thing was only like $3.50. Crazy!* 1 longaniza (guatemalan style pork sausage). This isn't on the menu, but when I mentioned to the waiter that I was curious about trying it (without wanting to get the meal of JUST longanizas) he said he could just sell us one by itself. I LOVE when places are flexible and will do things like that. It's a small little sausage, but packed with spices and finely chopped veggies. * Pepian (chicken stew with potatoes, green beans, and spices). This was probably one of the most mild dishes flavorwise, but it was really good. It's basically giant chunks of really tender chicken in a sauce served with rice and tortillas. It actually reminded me of middle eastern stews that we eat in the home, very home-y and comforting! We barely touched this though, we were literally full from the 3 appetizers. But it made a great lunch the next day. My boyfriend had beers that we brought (BYOB!) and I had their horchata (so good!!) I'm sad that we were too full to have their dessert, as they all sounded so good. I would have gone with the rellenitos if I had any room (described as 2 fried sweet plantain dough-balls stuffed with blended sweet beans) but next time I'm getting them FOR SURE."
"Ignore the decor, the food is the star here. I dined solo, enjoying the music and listening to a woman at the next table sing along with her child. Chips and two sauces were quickly brought out by a very pleasant server. The green sauce was excellent, just the right level of hot. I had plantains, beans, cheese, pork sausage and eggs cooked just how I like 'em. I've never had a Pupusa (tried the Mexicana) so can't tell you it was orgasmic but the slaw served alongside was great. Breakfast was prepared with care. It took a while to arrive but I saw only one woman cooking in the tiny kitchen. Savor your coffee or hot chocolate and relax. If you're coming for breakfast on a Sunday and you don't like football, get here early before the sports freaks arrive and ask for the t.v. to be turned up. Luckily, I was just finishing my Abuelita and could boogie."
"I really like this place.....there food is very authentic...my favorite items are: chuchitos, yuca frita con chicharon, hilachas & chile relleno.....I have had the pupusas but I like more there entree dinners... is a small place..my only downfall is the service, i have had a lady waitress n she was very nice & always checking up on us, but the guy server was very cold & pretty much abandoned us after giving us our food....but I still go because the food is AWESOME & I now order for pick up..."
The food is excellent but the service is lacking. We waited a while and when the food finally came the waitress was not attentive.
"I went here yesterday on a first date and we both loved it! The service was nice and the authentic food lived up to all the great reviews. I live a 10min walk from this hidden treasure, so I will def be going back! It's byob which is awesome, and for the price you can try all the traditional dishes. I had pupusa(mexican style), chicken chili rellenos, and the tamel!! All great and the guac was a great app:)"
This is one of my favorite restaurants!  The food is always so fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend the chicken chile relleno.
"Really great food, BYOB, and great prices; can't get much better than that. The food and service is a little slow, so just come prepared to hang out for a little bit. They looked like the did a lot of take-out as well. My husband and I are thrilled to have found this gem."
This is a true hole in the wall but we love it. My husband is from Guatemala and we travel there every year so we know good Guatemalan dishes. We've taken guest from out of town and they all loved it. Check it out.... You won't be disappointed.
"We started with the yuca and chicharron appetizer. This could be a entree for most people, huge portion and perfectly hot and crispy and delicious. I had the combo and my wife had the chuletas (pork chops). We took home enough food for another meal for 2. The sweet plantains with the meals was enough for dessert. The desserts offered sounded awesome, but we were too stuffed. They had fried ice cream, flan, and other tasty sounding sweets. Maybe we will save some room next time."
The decor is nothing to write home about but this is where my fiancé and I come for a delicious papusa! They are made to order and delicious. A bonus is the BYOB. Definitely a hidden gem on western.
"Its not surprising to me they have such high ratings. This place is amazing!  Everything is fresh, great variety, and amazing pricing. They are a go-to for any night. I highly recommend eating in the restaurant because they have very different and amazing salsa you need to try!"
"Best pupusas in town!I came in to take out and friendly staff warmly welcomed me.I order 2 pupusas locas (biggest pupusas I've seen) 1 cheese pupusa 1 jalapeño pupusa.They send you home with two types of salsas one is roja, I believe made out of tomato and is very mild. The other one was verde, not sure what is made from but is very tasty and has a good kick! The pupusa loca is made with various ingredients, it had cheese, beans, shredded pork Guatemalan leaves and Loroco (edible flower) by the way, delicious!!Then there is the cheese pupusa, very tasty! And last BUT not least the Mexican pupusa, get ready guys to have the most tasty pupusa ever, it has a fiery kick but you could always combine it with the coleslaw salad that they give you, it balances the spiciness. Even if i order take out, the decor is amazing. They have various colors inside, all of them screaming, a comfortable home!Yes, Brianna I'm coming back regularly and thank you for re-opening again! :) Ps readers, don't leave this place with out trying their imported beverages!"
food was great! my first time having pupusas and they were pretty good.
"I come here all the time. The pupusas are extraordinary, the desserts are amazing and so is just about anything on the menu. The service is also excellent, I love this place!! So glad they reopened."
"This is quite a discovery! Very good chicken soup and plenty of it-- full of fresh vegetables and lots of chicken. It comes with a nice side of rice with vegetables and tortillas. The flan is killer! The price is really right, the restaurant is very clean and the service is wonderful.  You won't be sorry."
