Ruxbin
We have been going to this neighborhood gem for years!  Small with a very intimate vibe. Restaurant is decorated stylishly with recycled materials. The food is excellent and never disappoints.  The menu rotates seasonally but the rabbit with bay scallops and the venison are our favorites!This year they started taking reservations. Do yourself a favor and stop by soon!
"This isn't a bad review. But it's not a good review either. Clearly, I'm confused and hangry....I want to love Ruxbin. I honestly do. The food is delicious!! I want to shout from the highest rooftops about the culinary wonder that is Ruxbin. But it's with a heavy and regretful heart, I can't. I dined at Ruxbin this summer and thoroughly enjoyed every morsel of food that was in front of me...and yet, I left hungry. I'm even a light eater and left wanting more. My date and I ordered what we thoughts were an ample number of dishes, including dessert, and while each were well worth 5+ stars for taste (the braised rabbit and octopus - OMG drool!), we were disappointed that we paid so much only to have our palates teased. It's like their starters were mere tastings and their mains were small plates. After 5 years of eating my way through this city, I can't remember any restaurant experience in Chicago where I left this hungry. Overall, I would rate them 5 stars for food and give high marks for service and ambiance, as well, but sadly, Ruxbin gets 1 star for value. Needless to say, I'm disappointed, yet conflicted.It's nice that it's BYOB because that offset the cost (seems like a wisely constructed ruse now that I think about it...). But really....I came here to eat, so please, feed me!"
"We ate there a few weeks ago and had a tremendous time.  The space is quaint and small and while the tables are close together, I feel it only adds to the intimacy.  Our server was very sweet and welcoming.  She was attentive without being smothering.  One of the highlights is that the restaurant is BYOB with only a $5 corkage fee.  We brought one bottle and probably could have dived into a second one as the meal is nicely paced.The concept of Ruxbin is small plates made for sharing.  Between my girlfriend and I, we shared 4 plates.  The highlight was definitely the rabbit.  Served with bay scallops and gnocchi, the dish was hearty without being heavy.  The rabbit was cooked to perfection and paired nicely with the anise sweet potato.While it's a decent drive from our hotel in River North, the drive was definitely worth it.  I would definitely return."
"This place is a bit overrated in my opinion. I've been there twice and both tines the food was good. The first time I went was over a year ago and I had mussels as well as a cotton candy dessert. The second time I had another seafood dish which made me sick. I have a weak stomach so it is not that surprising. But ny girlfriend got sick too, which is a remarkable feat. We called them to inform them, telling them that one of their items might be contaminated. They were nice about it.I could probably give them another shot.  I think I was unlucky"
"I loved this place. My husband and I went on a whim one night, and since they don't take reservations, it worked in our favor. The wait was long (1+ hours) but, once your inside you understand why given the limited space.  I dot really remember the exact dishes we had not because they were remarkable but because I waited waaaay too long to write this review.  I do remember that I had a fish soup which I believe was the best soup I have ever had.   The nuances of flavor that went with the very delicate pieces of fish.  I will never forget it. I know... It's soup, but that's how delicious it was.  Looking forward to eating there again in the near future."
"The food here is really really good! I tried: -prawn with squash sauce;- foie gras;- rabbit (the best!!)'- hanger steak.Honestly everything is very good, rich in flavor but not pretentious. The only problem is that the portions are very small even compared to other fine dining restaurants. The rabbit, that was my favorite, was 30$ for a little leg. I was ok after dinner but my boyfriend was still hungry even after they brought the dessert....The place is small and the interior is very nice but not special. And dont forget it is BYOB!!!!"
"YUM YUM AND ONE MORE YUM FOR GOOD MEASURE. Yes, I'm yelling about how good this place is. Ruxbin has been on my list to try for quite a while, so I was thrilled when my husband picked it for my birthday dinner this year. This little place is an absolute gem. First, BYOB- hooray! Second, they've recently begun taking reservations, which is great! We walked right in. Third, and most importantly- the food!! My husband is a venison fanatic, so he had that- I got one bite and it was awesome! I couldn't decide, so had a few of the appetizers- the watermelon salad (the ricotta!), the octopus and then split the fries w/the hubs. Everything was outstanding!! I especially loved the octopus. Because it was my birthday, they gave us dessert on the house and we had the pot de creme- it was perfect! All in all, our meal was outstanding from start to finish. The atmosphere was lovely, too. And the bathroom is a must visit- it's unique! So glad I got to celebrate my birthday at Ruxbin!"
A friend of mine told me about this Gem located on Ashland. I can't thank her enough for introducing me to another but one of the best BYOB in town! To start... It is a tiny restaurant! This isn't the type of restaurants for groups! I would say it is best for an intimate night with one other person.  They do have 2 booths that can sit 4 people and 1 large table by the kitchen. Reservations are a must! So where do I begin describing the delicious food I consumed.... I think now is a good time. First.. They bring pepper/salted popcorn to your table! Next.. They open your bottle of wine ( 5 dollar corkage fee). We ordered 2 appetizers. The first was the garlic fries. The garlic fries are definitely worth the 5 dollars! The dipping sauce was addicting! I didn't taste too much garlic but that's what made it outstanding! The second appetizer we ordered was the Foie Gras! Can't really describe it.... But was very good! I recommend it! Now as for entrees.. We ordered their special which was their Rabbit Leg and the Red Grouper! It was the first time I ate rabbit and I loved it! It tastes similar to chicken! The chef made it perfectly tender! The grouper was mouthwatering! Perfectly cooked fish! They use all sorts of ingredients that makes these dishes outstanding! Your taste buds are in for an adventure! Last but not least... DESSERT! We had the chocolate... Perfect way to end the evening! We also had their coffee! Not sure where they bought this coffee but it was best coffee I ever had! My favorite part of this place is the bathroom! Just check it out!
"After many months of looking at Ruxbin, I finally got the opportunity to take my girlfriend here for her birthday!This is definitely a trendy, down-to-earth yet intimate restaurant. The servers were very friendly, and the setting was very chic. Start by going to the bathroom that everyone talks about. We ordered the garlic fries and a foie gras appetizer, which were both excellent. Many reviewers have commented how the garlic fries were amazing, but imo.. let's not get carried away here. The plating for the foie gras was however very pretty and hard to destroy!For our courses we had steak (forgot the exact name) and duck breast. Most asian fusion dishes I had were very casual affairs, but this was the first time everything just worked under a fine dining backdrop.I highly recommend this place for special occasions, or for that one day you want to elevate your dinner to the next level. Ruxbin certainly made me a fan, and now I can't wait to try their sister restaurant Mott St.!"
"Yes...more please. That about sums it up. Everything so perfectly done. I had the rabbit, and my other 2 family members had the grouper and the duck. Everything was cooked to perfection and the waitress guided us to the perfect amount of food to order. Honestly...I'm still drooling at the memory of my meal here.Also, as crazy as this sounds - be sure to use the restroom while you are here.  It is an experience.Oh and cheap cheap corkage is a huge plus! Well done!! Bring your favorite bottle of wine with you.Make reservations well in advance. They book up quickly and it is a tiny restaurants. There won't be room for you if you walk-in without a reservation."
"Had an outstanding meal at Ruxbin last Friday night. We had an 8pm reservation and were seated immediately. The person who seated us took our bottle of champagne to put on ice right away and brought over some coupes. (Yes, it is BYOB, but there is a $5 corkage.) Our dishes were: Their house popcorn--I don't like popcorn so I didn't have any, but my husband was a big fan of the snack. Venison tartare (one of the special starters that evening)--Soooo good. I could have easily had a larger portion as my main. Garlic fries with chipotle aioli--good, no complaints, but also not something that you should come to Ruxbin for...they're just garlic fries. Duck breast--every bite was better than the next. I don't order duck often, but I'm glad I did! The blackberries gave it a nice added flavor. Braised rabbit--I thought it couldn't get any better than the duck, until I tried my husband's rabbit dish. If I could go back in time, I would probably order this instead. Pear tart--we split a dessert and, again, it was great. I can't remember the details exactly, but the ice cream it came with had a goat cheese flavor. Surprisingly welcome as I am not normally a goat cheese fan. All in all, it was a great evening. I've taken away 1 star for the service. Let me say, the server was fine, no mishaps, didn't rush us or anything like that BUT she wasn't particularly friendly either. I wasn't looking for her to become our new BFF, but I thought she might care a tiny little bit that her attitude would influence the overall experience. A little goes a long way in terms of making your table feel welcome. I'd recommend Ruxbin for a special occasion or a nicer night out. The atmosphere is very intimate, probably because it's a small space with not many tables. I'm glad we finally tried it and am looking forward to going back....but probably not for a while as it isn't exactly the type of place you go to regularly."
"Definitely as good as it gets. I don't know what was better the kitchen or the front of the house. I had an extra friend come into town early. Holding my breath I called a day in advance to increase our group to a table for 5. The hostess was charming and said she could do it if we came 15 minutes earlier. Noproblemo!From start to finish the meal was nothing short of spectacular. Starting with the savory popcorn which was a nice change from bread and butter. We swept the entire appie menu. The standouts were the foie gras, octopus and heirloom tomato app. For entrees one had the rabbit which was met with oohs and aahs. I shared the pork and skirt steak. The pork was very good but the skirt steak was amazing. We shared both desserts. Everyone was happy."
"I'm very hard to impress when it comes to steak, but the hanger steak at Ruxbin is one to remember. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, delicately sliced into thin pieces and so tender and flavorful. Even though I was pretty full already, I managed to finish every piece of steak.The other entrees my group got included the duck breast and the venison. I tried them all, but think the steak was the best. We also had the foie gras and the beets for appetizers. The foie gras truly tasted like elevated butter. I wasn't as impressed by the beets but I don't like beets normally. They give you free popcorn to start too.To finish it off, we shared two desserts - the chocolate quartet and the pear tart tatin. I liked the deconstructed look of both and they were quite tasty.Even though the steak is amazing, the decor of Ruxbin is probably the coolest thing about the restaurant. I couldn't stop looking around and wondering where they found the decor. Be sure to check out the restroom too!We had 6pm reservations, which we were able to change to 8:30pm. It was nice that the restaurant was flexible. If you're trying to come here without a wait, I'd recommend coming later on a Sunday as the place emptied out by the time we were done with our meal."
"Came here for my bday celebrations and I was impressed. I'm finding that the really great restaurants in Chicago are not located in downtown. Ruxbin has a very vintage atmosphere with really nice lighting and wallpaper. The food we ordered was made fresh and tasted amazing. I had the risotto while my group ordered everything from the lamb to steak. We also ordered desserts of course and I really enjoyed the dark chocolate custard with raspberries. When you have great food, great place and great friends you can't go wrong."
"Very delicious. I tried their tasting menu, it is so great, i love every dishes they serve, especially the main course, the beef is tender, the pork is so well cooked. They serve a little bit slowly, but compare to the taste, worth it!!!"
"If you ate here and complain about the price or portion size you truly don't understand dining. When you eat at a place like Ruxbin you aren't just paying for the amount of food that gets placed in front of you. You are paying for the quality of the ingredients, you pay for the chefs ideas and beautiful presentation and you pay for the server's genuineness and knowledge about the dishes. If you want a huge plate of food to be dumped in front of you by a server who hates his job this isn't the place for you.With that said Ruxbin is my favorite restaurant in West Town. I love the neighborhood vibe it hasand the food is always impeccable. My server yesterday, Charlie, was so passionate about what they were serving and I let  him course out my dinner for me. We started with the beats and foie gras for appetizers and then some more duck and rabbit special for our entrées. The food was fresh and packed with so many flavors. My favorite was by far the rabbit, paired with pomegranate seeds and sweet potato purée it was truly to die for. Everyone that works here from the owners to the servers are pleased to have you, which really completes your experience here. We as Chicagoans need to support locally owned and independent restaurants like Ruxbin and Mott st. (their sister restaurant). We can't let all the big chain and restaurant groups own the entire city! :) Ruxbin"
"I was enjoying a nice evening out with some friends, and after a while we decided to grab something to eat. We've heard about Ruxbin, and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to give it a try.First of all, we were given a table very fast, and it was kind of impressive considering that it was Friday. Anyway, we sat down and while we were browsing through the menu, a nice waitress came and asked us if we wanted some popcorn while doing this. She was very friendly, and she recommended us some of their best dishes. We decided to listen to her advice and we couldn't have been happier! The food was absolutely amazing, both in terms of taste and presentation. The atmosphere is very nice too at Ruxbin, and the staff is always eager to cater to your every need. They totally deserved their tip!If you go there, you have to know that you can't make reservations in advance, but if you don't find a place to sit, they will inform you how long you have to wait until a table will be ready for you. I had a really great time there and I can't wait to go and eat some delicious garlic fries at Ruxbin again!"
"Love this place. Staff is amazing. Full of knowledge, suggestions and excitement. The food is delicious and the menu is always  changing for the season. Their deserts are amazing and so creative. Anything they do with steak order. Also any chocolate desert is a must. It's byob and there is a $5 cork fee. The kitchen is tiny but those chefs make magic out of there. It does get a little loud but I really don't mind it's fun to be around others (unlike the table next to me who seemed annoyed they needed to sit next to someone else). It is a small space so make a reservation, although I've walked in twice and was accommodated. Once I was sat immediately and longest I waited was 45 mins. Come here and eat tons of great food with your favorite booze from home."
"Quick Hits:Pros - Unique, tasty dishes. Casual romantic BYOB ($5 corkage).Cons - A bit noisy. Bill for 2 - $65-$80Full SummaryCame across Ruxbin while looking for an upscale-ish BYOB spot in Chicago. Turned out to be quite the find.Setting the table:Made an 8pm reservation on a Wednesday night and was seated right away. The decor is unique, a bit artsy, and the setting is very cozy, in the sense that you are pretty close to your neighbors' tables, but at the same time it feels intimate. There are maybe 12 tables in the house total. A great date night or double-date night. Menu:The small menu (both in physical size and content), consists of 5 or 6 appetizers and 5 or 6 entrees, yet is full of unique and flavorful dishes. Personally, I love a small menu because it says we do these few things, and we do them darn well. If that were a rule (it's not), Ruxbin certainly would not be an exception.Food:Began with appetizers. Dank garlic fries. Much and more has been said of the garlic fries here, but I mean yeah, they are super. Also tried the prawn, which was good, but not something I'd write home about. Then again, I am no prawn connoisseur, so take that with a grain of salt. Main courses were the hangar steak and rabbit. My mouth is watering as I write about these plates. I only had a bite of the rabbit, but what an excellent bite it was. Juicy, tender, flavorful. The hangar steak, which I ordered, was maybe the best $30 meat I've ever tried. Ruxbin is a restaurant to visit and revisit. Worth every penny."
"What a phenomenal restaurant! Great food all around, well worth the price. BYO! No alcohol served on the premise so bring your own. Started off with the octopus and the pork belly. One of the best octopus I've had in the city (and I've had many). Tender, juicy, smoky. So many great components on the dish, I wanted to lick the plate. The pork belly was not as good but still tasty. A bit on the dryer side but the taste was good. For entrees, ordered the Nigerian prawn and veal breast. I absolutely loved the Nigerian prawn dish. Everything on the plate I devoured. Beautifully plated and substantial amount of food. The veal breast was juicy and on the sweeter side. I liked it as well. Skip the desert... It was something rocky road and it was terrible. The marshmallow was extremely sweet, the chocolate was extremely bitter like 90% dark chocolate, the brandy cherry was not good. The waitress noticed us picking at out dessert and quickly took it away. Props to her. Great staff! I want to come back here again and again. Tiny restaurant, great service, awesome bathroom by the way and don't forget to bring some booze."
"Great little place. We loved the trout, and the venison with figs and pomegranate jus. Ambience is cool (recycled-junk art) but relaxed, and the service is great. The place is small and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, so they corked our BYOB bottle for us and we sipped it while waiting outside in their makeshift sidewalk lounge. Be sure to visit the bathroom too!"
"This was my wife's idea ... I don't say that to segue into a negative review, I liked the food and the experience.  But this isn't a place I would ordinarily go.  It's byob (which is fine) with emphasis on the quality of the ingredients (also fine) but it is pricey still.  Then there is the ransom you have to pay for the privilege of making a reservation (you must show or cancel 48 hours in advance and if you don't you lose your ransom) which I completely get now that i've been there and see how small the space is and the care they put into making sure that those who DO show have a memorable dining experience.  But as the parent of two under 6 where ""anything can happen"" at the last minute ... ... but of course nobody put a gun to my head to make the reservation either.  Highly recommend this restaurant, check out the menu, or call to find out if there are any changes to it, so that you can intelligently byob.  I would have made different decisions had we done that, although they were super accommodating of all the different brews and wines we brought."
"I've gone back to Ruxbin a handful of times since my initial 5-star review and I'm happy to say that the food is still as good as ever.Pros: Imaginative, flavorful dishes, BYOB, cool atmosphere.Cons: Small portions.Food: The food here is the star of the show.  The flavor combinations are interesting, the food is well plated and most importantly, it's tasty as all get out.  The menu changes seasonally, but it is consistently excellent.  Duck and seafood preparations are almost always superb.  The food is on par with most fine dining establishments.  Portion side is a bit small, but I felt prices fair given the quality.Service: Warm, welcoming, down to earth.  The staff know when it's ok to joke around and when they need to allow the guests room to breathe.  I've never had a bad server.Ambience: The place has somewhat of a steampunk vibe and it's refreshingly unpretentious.  Not good for groups of 6+ due to the small size/layout.  Ruxbin is a great place for a date, unless you're going with someone who expects white table cloths and snooty waiters -- in which case, you really need to rethink your date.Overall: One of my favorite places to dine in Chicago.  It's a winner, winner chicken dinner (but get the duck...trust me)."
"After many months of wanting to dine here, we finally made it to Ruxbin last night.  The food, service, decor were all five star worthy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the oysters, fries, octopus, steak, chocolate dessert.  All were fantastic.  The steak was perfectly cooked, presented beautifully, and a true treat.  The other diners at the table loved their selections, as well. Our server was amazingly helpful and good about checking on us. The decor in this place is original and fun.  I almost felt like I was in a train car.  Loved the seats that were made into lights.  Loved the bathroom...pretty cool!Literally, the only reason I knocked off a star and maybe a reason for not returning is the reservation policy.  This place is TINY, so you need a reservation.  If you cancel within 48 hours, there is a 25 dollar per person charge.  Plus, you get a reminder email the day of the reservation, so it is already too late to cancel.  Not sure what the point of the reminder email is at that point.  As a small business owner, I understand why they have incorporated this policy.  However, it would be very easy for Ruxbin to fill the table if there was a cancellation.  The place was packed.  If your babysitter cancels, you get sick, a family member is sick....you pay the fee.  This makes it very hard for me to feel comfortable about making a reservation and coming back.  Things happen within 48 hours.....and there are no exceptions to this rule.  Five stars for food, decor, service!  One star for the reservation policy."
"Although the food at this place is top notch and it is very cute inside (and outside) our night was absolutely ruined because they ONLY ALLOW YOU 1 hour  and 30 minutes to inhale your meal. Their chef is outstanding, so not being able to savor every bite is especially difficult. They do not mention this small detail when you make reservations, but drop this on you when you are already sitting there with your bottle of wine, looking over the menu... How thoughtful! So, if you are looking for an amazing but VERY FAST meal, this is your place. However, if you one of those weirdos, who goes out to eat for the sake of the experience such as a date-night, celebration or catching up with a friend, then I would suggest finding a different venue. Otherwise you might have to brown-bag your left-over wine and join the homeless for the rest of your evening. Hope the weather is on your side:)"
"I FINALLY got to come here thanks to them starting an online reservation system!Alright lets get into it, we were seated right away and got a booth for 4. Good start.We started off with the roof top greens and garlic fries. The garlic fries stood out as the clear winner. Someone said ""they are just garlic fries"" in a review below. No. These are better than just garlic fries. I've had 100 different garlic fries before, this dip was the best, and they were seasoned perfectly. Now lets dive into the main dishes...Rabbit - I regret getting this, the scallops it came with were super salty, and the rabbit, was good but not as good as the other dishes we ordered. I mean I just ordered it because I've never had rabbit before, so I guess that was a something to check off my food list..Rohan Duck Breast - Very good! So good!Hanger Steak - Cooked to perfection! Amazing! For dessert we got the pear tart. It was veryyy good, except I have one complaint. They sprinkle a bunch of leafs on it, I forget exactly what it was, there were like 100 dry leafs of cilantro on it or something but it wasn't cilantro.. The leafs kept getting stuck in everyone's throats and we were coughing. Dry leafs don't mix well with icecream you are swallowing.."
"I ""get"" why people love Ruxbin. It's a small neighborhood restaurant that appears to be a gem in West Town. It's local, not commercialized, not owned by a restaurant group. It's one of those neighborhood places that people love to love. And, it's BYO so I can see how it gets brownie points from people. The food though for me, while it was good, it didn't blow me away. Also, I rarely comment on pricing but felt the need to here. $32 for the sea bass entree. It came as a small piece that could be finished in 4-5 bites. Not even at least a fillet size for that price? I can get a whole fish for about $10 more at other finer dining restaurants. There's too much effort needed to dine here (limited reservations, mostly walk-ins, and out of the way location) to make me want to return."
"I'm struggling with how to rate this.  I'm between 3 and 4 stars but notching down only because Ruxbin is in the league of non-Michelin star spots that are better than some Michelin star spots (Purple Pig, Maudes, etc.).  Compared to these, it's just okay.  The service was very good and ambiance nice.  The food was hit and miss.  They did bring us different glasses for the different wines we brought and the complimentary popcorn was good.  Overall I did enjoy it but just based on other reviews, I was just expecting more.  I'd definitely go back.We tried the fries, which we all agreed were fries.  They were tasty but didn't blow any of us away.  There were 4 of us so we got to try a bunch of stuff.  The prawn was small but she managed our expectations that it would be and it was very good.  The buttery pumpkin sauce is the bottom of the bowl was like crack.  The foie was very nice as well.  Overall we all agreed that the starters were superior to the entrees.  My favorite entree was the grouper.  I would highly recommend.  The pork belly was good (as all pork belly tends to be) but the squid with it had no seasoning and was a tad rubbery.  Had that squid been really good, this would have been a wonderful dish.  Overall we were all disappointed with the venison and the duck.  They both fell a bit flat to us and we get both types quite  often, both at restaurants as well as to prepare at home.  I feel these are two proteins where there is a potential 'wow' factor but neither one had that.  They were cooked very well, but just the flavor was not really as great as it could have been.  We got a flourless chocolate cake for dessert and this was solid.  There was really nothing that was bad, but with the reputation that Ruxbin has, I would have expected more than just two standout dishes (both seafood, I might add).  The menu changes often so I will go back and see if I might have a more outstanding experience next time."
"4.5 Stars. We really really liked our entrees a lot, the rabbit especially but the venison not far behind. We also got garlic fries and a chocolate dessert of some kind both of which were unremarkable, but we didn't care much. It's a pretty casual but cool environment. All the furnishings and decor are made out of repurposed materials. Booth backs made out of old seatbelts, etc. It's fun, but very small, which we liked. It's also cool that it's BYOB so you can bring in your own wine or beer and they will put it on ice for you."
Loved everything about this place. It is cozy and chic and great for a date! Our service was excellent. The food was interesting and delicious. So happy I finally checked it out. And BYOB--does not get any better! Would definitely recommend!
"Ruxbin is a tiny, cool restaurant that feels very romantic. They are BYOB, which makes it a cheaper date option than a lot of other places that are on the same food level. We tried the corn soup, grilled octopus, hanger steak, ravioli, and peach cake. YUM. Everything was super tasty, but my favorite of the night was the hanger steak. It was perfectly cooked medium rare, and it was served with purple potatoes and grilled broccoli. There was a chimichurri sauce and some other zesty little sauce on the plate that were also both excellent.Make a reservation for 2 or 4 (any larger really can't be accommodated in the small space) and of course, check out the bathrooms!"
"If you only go here to see the Tardis-like restroom, it will be worth it.Seriously- what a fun, steam-punk inspired setting, matched equally by imaginative, delicious entrees and excellent service.We started with Octopus with chick peas, garlic fries (I could have just stuck with those and been a happy camper) and Pork Belly paired with grapefruit and corn bread. We followed that with an assortment of entrees including melt in your mouth hangar steak and prawn and pulled pork. Nice sized portions and beautiful presentation.That fell apart with the dessert: bland peach cake and bizarre ""deconstructed"" chocolate cake. It looked as though they started scraping a real piece of chocolate cake off the plate of someone's dessert and said ""wait a minute, wouldn't it be cool to serve it?"". Ok,  joking, but the presentation was a little too hipster for my tastes. All in all, dessert was not a deal breaker because the meal, the apps, the service, and atmosphere were all top drawer. We will go back!"
"Took the gf here for her birthday last week and it did not disappoint. Actually... it blew our socks off!    Our meal consisted of:-Garlic Fries: -Octopus: -Pork Belly: -Nigerian Prawn & Pulled Pork:-Hanger SteakI highly, highly recommend the Hanger Steak, Octopus, and Garlic Fries.  The Steak was soooo good.  Great tenderness on the meat, with delectable marinade/spice. Then matched with the chimichurri, perfection. But from everything we ate -  just like kindergarten, they ALL GET A STAR!  5 stars!BYOB is a great plus to help keep the price of a nice meal within reason.Also, this year they started to take reservations online and I  was able to make one a few days in advance. EZ-PZ."
"I wish my wallet would allow me to come here every weekend (especially now that they accept reservations). Ruxbin is one of my favorite restaurants, ever. It's small, but cozy. Not pretentious. I really love the BYOB.I am not a steak person by any means, but I can't NOT order the hangar steak every time I come here. It's delicious. The garlic fries, another menu staple, are also a must. Everything I've had here has been wonderful."
"A great little byob restaurant! Reservations taken 30 days out; definitely recommend having a reservation. The decor is simple, but very warm and inviting. Our service was simple and fine for the evening. The food took a bit more time than expected, but the presentation and taste definitely hit the mark. We started sharing appetizers for our party of four: two orders of oysters, fried octopus and the pork belly. The favorite was definitely the pork belly, followed close behind by the octopus. The oysters were a flat out disappointment. They were prepared as a trio, but none of the preparations really worked for us, especially the smoked oyster which tasted like pure salt.Our entrees were awesome - sea bass, duck, and hanger steak. The temperatures of the meats was perfect, the side dishes were fabulous and the portion sizes were very nice. We only had room left for one dessert so we went for the chocolate, which was delicious!I had read in plenty reviews about the bathroom, so we each paid a visit! I felt like I was on the Jetsons, quite a unique entry to the loo! Don't forget to lock the revolving door once you're inside, or you could have an unexpected visitor!"
"Was not sure what to expect from this place. But wow was I surprised, the food is amazing and the wait staff is on point. They all know what is being served and they do not give you any bs! I highly recommend coming here and trying it out. The bathroom is a must check out here! Very cool!I cannot wait to go again!"
"Went last night for my birthday dinner...and at long last have found my favorite place!!  Started with the foie gras, which I initially didn't want to order, as I thought it might be rich and heavy.  It was light but still creamy.  Far exceeded my expectations.  Then garlic fries that were fun and delicious.    After reading intrepid yelper reviews, decided to go for the frog leg dish figuring if you're going to eat frog...this is the place to try it.  To die for!!!  So many little flavors and sensations all happening in one dish...My husband had the hanger steak which is beautifully seasoned and prepared.  It will be hard for me to choose between these dishes next time.  Pear dessert was creative and excellent.  It's a fun, unpretentious place and I can't wait to go back!!!"
"I've been taking my time to review the restaurants that my friend and I visited during our foodie crawl weekend to Chicago in mid-Sept.  Given our ambitious itinerary (We made it to 17 spots total in less than 72 hours) and with the sheer saturation of taste buds, I wanted to make sure I gave each spot a fair assessment.  Ruxbin was one of the (many) spots where we ate quite light as we were having a late-ish dinner a few hours later at Girl & the Goat with a nightcap at the Aviary afterwards.  The menu was quite subtle and I didn't appreciate it at the time.  But after a bit of reflection, it is clear that the flavors were quite complex and delicious.  We ordered only 2 things-- the daily crudo and an apple and plum salad (w/ baby arugula, shaved celery, almonds, manchego, and a walnut-sherry vinaigrette).  I love that a clearly popular restaurant is BYOB... that's true restraint not to make that kind of easy money! :)Most memorable for me about Ruxbin was the restroom (Yes, the restroom!)-- no door, just a re-purposed darkroom entryway-- how very nostalgic (at least for those of us old enough to remember using non-digital cameras and developing the film and photos ourselves, it took me right back to high school photography!)"
"Ruxbin is easily in my top 3 of Chicago restaurants! I have been here twice now and have been blown away both times. It is a small restaurant with less than 20 tables including the chefs table. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, nothing I've seen around Chicago.They are byob too which is always a plus. It's hard to find a nice byob that isn't either overly pricey or Asian/cheap. Ruxbin is definitely a nice restaurant i would recommend for an event or special occasion but it is not snobby like a river north restaurant.  The best part, the food! OMG is it good. I've had the halibut and sea bass. I don't normally order fish at a restaurant but their fish is out of this world, it's a mouth watering experience. I eat slowly just to make it last longer, no joke. The flavors are vibrant and work great together. They always start you off with a popcorn topped with herbs, which is wonderful. My date got the hanger steak which was equally as amazing. We also got the grilled calamari which was epic. For dessert we got the chocolate trio- lets just say we were fighting to lick the plate, that good. I love this place so much I almost don't want to tell people about it since it can be difficult to get a reservation. But it's too good not to share. Do yourself a favor and go here. Enjoy!"
"I think my 3.5 star rating for Ruxbin is another reason I should NOT wait too long to visit a restaurant. The longer I wait, the higher my expectations, and the more likely I'll be underwhelmed. We had a party of 4 and got there early enough before the place filled up. We also had a reservation, so we were seated promptly. Food-wise we ordered the octopus and garlic fries as appetizers, halibut, hanger steak, prawns & pulled pork and lamb. While the flavors were excellent, I thought the portion sizes were definitely smaller than what I expected for the price point. I have a healthy appetite and left hungry at the end of the meal. Service was excellent: servers were very knowledgeable of the dishes and made sure to explain them to us as they came out. I'd recommend it because the quality of the food was great, but don't come hungry or have an after-dinner plan!"
"While the food is quite tasty, the menu is limited and rather over-priced.  One of the items I ordered was their sea bass priced at $32 and you only get a small piece of fish.  Also, I did not really like the how they give you popcorn instead of a bread service.It is always difficult to write a poor review for a place that regularly receives 4- or 5-star reviews.  So it is unfortunate that my personal experience was one where I would say ""Meh, I've experienced better.""  Exactly what Yelp's definition of a 2-star review is.    I know BYOB places tend to get higher Yelp reviews, but I judge the establishment from a completely objective point of view and my experience wasn't great."
"Oh, so many emotions going on thinking about this place.Ok, so, like, this place is small.  As in, not La Gondola on Ashland teensy, but small spaces and close quarters.  So close, in fact, that we had the pleasure of overhearing the thrilling conversations of the neighbors on each side of us.  To the right of us were two lawyers who were likely married to each other (or were married to others and sought a small restaurant like Ruxbin out to commit their passionate crime) and only talked about one thing:  their jobs.  Ugh, are people so uninteresting that all they can talk about is how big of a settlement they just closed on or how they love working 6 bajillion billable hours a week?  Like, gag me with a bowl of popcorn.  Oh, speaking of that, the next couple who sat to the right of us, likely a blind date, featured a woman who expressed concern over the popcorn as it may contain something that would send her into anaphylactic shock.  I. Kid. You. Not.  So let's just say a good portion of our meal was spent figuring out how to save these poor people from their crazy dates.I tried not to let these weirdos get in the way of the beauty of each plate that came before us.  And, mark my word, the plates are beautiful, and the waitresses will offer you a very detailed explanation of just how beautiful they are.  Too pretty to eat?  Not when you're starving.  And don't be tacky and take a photo.  It's a small restaurant, ya know.The menu is small, maybe 6 appetizers and 6 entrees, all sounded good, nothing overly daring.  The garlic fries are a must, though I passed on the aioli since mayo-based sauces are Satan's work.  The pork belly was the star of my night sky and was easily the best I have had.  For mains, the SO went with the duck and I the sea bass.  The duck was phenomenal.  I normally steer clear of duck because it's a bit too fatty for me and I can only handle it if it's super crispy or pretty close to well-done.  I am confident the waitress said this was more towards the rare side and I still thought it was delicious.  My sea bass was so pretty, although either the table or the floor is uneven because the black tea/ginger broth slid a little too much to the left.  It was like a small little white fishy decorated with a pureed potato dress decorated with crispy little sweet potato wedges.  Cute, right?  Tiny, yes.  I enjoyed every bite as I slowly, slowly, slowly ate it, because I was so hungry I thought that, by eating it slower, it would trick my stomach into thinking it was a much larger meal.  Truth is, I would have had no problem ordering myself an extra bucket o' garlic fries because, after splitting two bottles of really, really good wine, I was a bit tipsy and sustenance was key.  But it was really good...The one ding I am giving is a general, nit-picky type critique.  Hear me out.  The interior of Ruxbin is awesome.  The lights are really cool, the walls are decorated really fun.. I mean, it's just neat.  The SO asked the waitress who designed the interior, or what inspired the designs for certain aspects of the interior, and the answer we were given was an ""I don't know.""  But not like an ""Oh, I am not sure, let me check for you"", just kind of like a apathetic hipster-type response.  I mean, that's fine, I GUESS... but do what the rest of us do when we ""don't know"" something: get the info, or make up some ridiculously crazy story.  I mean, we won't really know the truth anyway, right?!It's BYOB which is great because the restaurant isn't cheap and we easily would have run up a crazy bill.  $5 for the corkage though.  I swear that's illegal.Great place for a date or a small group or crazy date watching.  Not a great place if you don't wanna be a part of your neighbor's conversation."
"Let me start by saying that the food here is excellent. If I were only rating the food, I would have given a 4 star rating. It would have just missed 5 stars because of the portion size, which is quite small. I'm giving the restaurant an overall 3 star rating largely because the pretentiousness, at least for me, detracted from the experience. There are a lot of rules, including refusal to prepare meat at a different temperature than the chef wants to. I was also required to provide a credit card number and agree to a $25 per guest charge if I cancelled my reservation less than 48 hours in advance (this would have cost $100 for my party). Additionally, the menu is tiny and there were no entree specials. People with dietary restrictions may want to eat elsewhere, as there are limited choices and no substitutions. Lastly, while the food is excellent, it was grossly overpriced. The only reason they don't get a 4th $ in the price rating is they don't service alcohol. Overall, I would only consider visiting this restaurant again if they had an entirely new menu. For me, repeating the same choices wouldn't be worth it."
"(This review would be 4.5 stars if that was possible.)My wife and I went to Ruxbin on Oct. 14 to celebrate her birthday. She had been there previously and raved about it, and it was my first trip.The setting is intimate and non-obnoxiously quirky (the decor is all repurposed/recycled materials and the door into the restroom is a lot of fun). We were seated promptly and greeted with a bowl of seasoned popcorn to get things started. It's BYOB (with a $5 corking fee), and our waitress opened the bottle for us while talking through the specials.We ordered the garlic fries as an appetizer (perfect size for sharing). The fries were delicious -- perfectly cooked and with a garlicky kick that lived up to their name. They came out piping hot and not at all greasy. For our entrees, she ordered the sea bass and I ordered the duck breast (both of which went nicely with the Pinot Noir we brought). There was a bit of a backlog in the kitchen, so they sent out an heirloom tomato salad on the house while we waited, which was a nice gesture that was well-appreciated (and the salad was delicious too -- well-balanced mix of citrus, apple and cheese with the tomatoes).The sea bass came with a robust broth and crisp ginger, which gave a brisk counterpoint to the rich fish. There were little bits of pickled plum on the plate, which really seemed to complete the dish. The duck breast was delicious as well. It's cooked medium-rare with crispy skin and came with roasted apples and crispy Brussels sprouts. An unexpected highlight of the dish was the pieces cheddar pain perdu (cheesy french toast). It was a mouthful of creamy richness that paired perfectly with the fall flavors in the sprouts, apples and pecans. Some reviews express disappointment at portion size. If you're an adherent to the Trough Mentality of dining out, then yes, you might be disappointed that the dishes aren't served with a shovel on a cafeteria tray. But in our opinions the dishes were perfectly sized entrees for a rational human.Ruxbin is a great experience and a fair value -- it's not everyday-cheap, but the prices are considerably better for comparable dishes at other nice Chicago restaurants. The service was great and the food was perfectly cooked."
"Reservations at this place are tough, we had reservations @ 6:15 Saturday night and that was perfect! We avoided the madness of the post 7pm crowd. For apps we had the octopus, squash, garlic fries and of course the pork belly. All 5 stars! Then proceeded to have the duck, scallops, bass, and raviolo. All were 4.5 stars or better, except for the raviolo, it was a 3.5 stars. The dish had too many strong flavors and not one solid one. So I would give our visit a 5 star for the delightful service and a 4 star for the food. This time I'm rounding down to 4 stars overall!"
"I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. In many ways, I now feel fully relieved having come to Ruxbin. Why you ask? Well, I've recommended this place sooooo many times on the basis of what others have told me, and yet I only recently went here. /Sigh. While I wouldn't call that one of my deepest and darkest secrets, it was a bit of a secret and now it isn't anymore. This honesty thing feels very very good.You know what else is very very good......Ruxbin. I'm not gonna lie, there is a lot of satisfaction, but mostly, there is elation. This place utterly rocks. I had been meaning to come here for way too long, and with my friends in town, this was finally the perfect chance. We made sure to do a Sunday reservation. We had an 8 month preggers woman with us, so getting there really early and waiting for a seat wasn't going to work. We made sure to get later reservations for our small group. On top of that, there was no way we weren't gonna take advantage of the BYO offer. See, now this is another thing that puts Ruxbin in to that special category.  It's rare to have a place with such high quality food and be completely free of corkage. This rarity is something that really adds to the overall experience. Back to the food. We started off with the pork belly and garlic fries. The pork belly was just absolutely killer. In some ways it was hard for the garlic fries to compete with the awesome the pork belly brought. But, for me, when there is the combination of garlic and fries, I'm gonna be in my happy place. Garlic is just one of those things that I absolutely love to my core (basil being the other). So, to have garlic and fries together are a match made in Keith A. heaven. Onto the entrees. Since my friends and I generally treat things as small plates and share, we were to share our entrees. My friend had been eyeing up the etouffee, and, well, who were any of us to argue? His yearning for it was certainly the way to go as it was absolutely delicious. We then moved onto the hanger steak. We had a few cali cabs and this was just a natural thing to have. Good thing we weren't let down by either the wine or the steak. This was cooked perfectly and was everything we all wanted. Ruxbin is a major win in my book. They are small, so smaller groups are needed, but that doesn't stop it from being a major win. In the words of Ahnuld Schwarznegger: I vill be bahq."
"Pros: small and comfy, scallop, deer leg and garlic fries are must -eats;Cons: I think the form of the dish is too overemphasized compared to its decorations and displayed atmosphere; for example, Black Forest cake is decorated too much that it lost its point. But in general we enjoyed the place, might not come back in the near future tho.."
"All I can say is wow, what an exceptional dining experience. If you are looking for fancy decor and an over priced wine list this is not your place. The modest, repurposed interior is part vintage and part junk yard art and it works. The menu is short and simple, allowing the kitchen to focus on quality. You have to try the pork belly starter. With corn bread and jicama the taste combination is exceptional. We both had the salmon entree which was cooked medium rare with an exterior crust giving you the impression the filet is over cooked but not so. The onion and fried green tomato were a flavorful accompaniment. The panne cotta was light and a wonderful ending to a great dinner. The staff was well informed and easily worked as a team moving from table to table. With seating for about 40 in a small space the coverage worked well. BYOB allows you to add your own wine without the restaurant markup. Don't miss the rest room, the entrance is special."
"Dishes enjoyed:PopcornPork Belly - Cornbread, Jicama, Grapefruit, Danablu Cheese, Citrus VinaigretteFlatbread - Prosciutto, Goat Cheese, Persimmon, Hazelnuts, Fennel SeedCarrot Soup Shooter - Carrot Juice, Pork Rillettes, CrackerDuck Breast - Baby Greens, Shaved Fennel, Snow Peas, Orange, Mustard Vinaigrette, Zucchini BreadRocky Road - Brownies, Smoked Cherries, Juniper Ice Cream, Almonds, Marshmallow Fluff, Cotton Candy, Creme Fraiche CaramelPineapple Upside Down Cake - Coconut Sorbet, Cumin Tuile, Thai Basil Seeds, Cured PecansWith just 32 seats and enough critical acclaim to fill them each night I will start with one suggestion and move right to the next.  First, plan in advance and make a reservation for Sunday since it is the only day Ed Kim's ""American bistro"" will guarantee you a seat without the possibility of waiting in line.  Second, go with an open mind, close your eyes, and just point at anything on the menu because no matter what you order there is a good chance it will look little like what you expected and taste far better than you'd have guessed.Small,  long, and dark with the kitchen up a flight of stairs and the diners below I requested a seat near the back and within minutes received the night's menu and a list of specials from one of three friendly servers, each personable yet professional and more than capable of describing the ins and out of the menu.  Not telling them that this was a pre-dinner it was suggested that 2-4 plates per guest was advised and after a short discussion opted for a quintet that would begin to arrive shortly following the restaurant's oft raved sweet and salty popcorn.Featuring reclaimed woods, menus, cookbooks, and even forks to support the mirrors in the (awesome - check it out) restroom  the décor of Ruxbin could best be described as shabby-modern while the food, a testament to Chef Kim's tenure in some of America's best kitchens and excellent sourcing, is anything but...the flavors and textures sharp and bright while presentations are that of comfort foods, familiarity with finesse - a palate cleansing carrot soup shooter topped with cracklin' pork and a light, balanced, and truly impressive flatbread proving ample skills in melding sweet with savory while the duck and pork dishes both took heavier proteins and brought their subtleties into focus with crunchy vegetables and the restrained use of acid; the pork belly especially impressive as the grapefruit and cornbread melded with the melting fat to great effect in both flavor and mouthfeel.Never one to pass on desserts I was equally impressed by the pastry side of Ruxbin as I was by the savories, both dishes the sort of situation where reading the ingredients may give one pause (as it did for my family who opted to sit out this meal) but both rustic in structure but refined in taste and texture; the cake 'deconstructed' at best with hints of earth and spice hiding behind the sweetness, all mellowed by the coconut and the Rocky Road without a doubt one of the best desserts I've had in 2013 - a sweet and smoky pudding that played like a fudgy sundae spread across a long plate; a plate that my seat at the back wall allowed me to scrape clean (and briefly debate licking until I realized I could use my finger to similar effect."
"My friends LOVE Ruxbin, so I was excited to give this place a whirl. Unfortunately, while I enjoyed the food, nothing outstanding or amazing comes to mind.+Sure, they've got a neat bathroom that's got a darkroom door and endless music posters.+Yeah, you can have your bottle of wine delivered to your table, since they're BYOB-only.+OK, the food and service are pretty good.Maybe I've become jaded with my food experiences (woe is me, I know), so nothing spectacular happened here. Definitely stop by, but keep the expectations in check."
"I had a truly beautiful experience at Ruxbin, in all ways possible. First impressions upon walking in -- I loved the intimate feeling of the space and the decor, especially the re-purposed materials (seat belts for chair backs? so creative!). AND (this sounds so strange on a review for a restaurant), I would definitely make a trip to the bathroom, which is so unique with a darkroom door!The food itself was really like a work of art. My boyfriend and I each had an oyster appetizer. The plating itself was gorgeous -- three oysters on a bed of coarse salt with live thyme wound throughout. The oysters were meant to be eaten in succession (mignonette, sambal picked ginger, and applewood-smoked with pork belly and wild rice). The final one was served under a glass cloche and was divine -- the flavors (the smoke, wood, oyster sea-taste, crunch of the pork belly and rice) reminded me of eating an oyster straight from the ocean on a wet pier.I ordered the spring raviolo entree, which I felt brought all the flavors of spring together in my mouth in one beautiful medley. The multitude of textures worked together so well -- the velvety soft pasta, the lightness of the foam, the thickness of the egg yolk and ricotta, the crispiness of the vegetables, and the extra crunch of red quinoa on top, which added just the perfect amount of nuttiness to the whole dish. I loved that the whole dish was covered in ramp pistou -- what else says spring more than ramps?My boyfriend's halibut entree, perhaps compared to my raviolo, did appear more underwhelming. The halibut was done well, but just seemed more bland in terms of flavors and textures.My boyfriend and I splurged on both desserts, and I honestly can't decide which one I enjoyed more. I loved the apple sorbet in the taffy apple dessert, and the chocolate semifreddo in the black forest cake dessert. The plating for both desserts was done so well, and I found myself feeling sad that I couldn't take more pictures on my phone before the ice creams starting melting!P.S. So glad that a friend tipped us off that this place is BYOB! Don't forget to bring a good bottle of wine to go with the amazing food at this place!"
"Lovely, warm and inviting atmosphere. It's quite hard to describe the theme that they're going for but it really works. The place is really small (as are the portions unfortunately) but the flavors are exquisite.First of all, order the garlic fries but skip the aioli. For someone who likes value but is worth paying the extra amount for quality, it was definitely worth the flavor. They would make great steak-frites.The waitress also recommended the Mushroom Toast, and they were YUM. The soft baked biscuit with pine nuts and mushroom on top not only had a lot of flavor but was very memorable. Much better than the main in my opinion.Lastly, we ordered the steak and I almost cried when I saw the portions. Yes, they were tender but come'on that's not gonna fill me up! Yes, I may be a college student but I also could have bought a pair of shoes  that would give me greater utility in the long run. That aside, I liked the flavors of the sauces on the plate. They paired well with the broccoli, the steak, and the potato."
"Had dinner here this past weekend for my birthday. I was really impressed. This is definitely the type of place where the hostess to the chef have made an art out of what they serve and how they treat you. They only take reservations, no walk ins. The other thing is you can only call on Sunday's to make reservations. They're typically pretty booked so call in advance. They know what they're doing when it comes to good food and they definitely know how to keep a good vibe.Personally, I love the atmosphere. It has a super chill classic rustic feel to it but they're still pretty high end. it's BYOB and they have a store near by that delivers directly to your table. You just need to call and order from their selection. I definitely recommend this place."
"This place was culinary perfection. Such creative dishes that are constantly changing. That means - if you see something you wanna try, get it! It won't be around for long. The oysters tonight were prepared three radically different ways, all wonderful. One involved candied bacon. That is all I'll say about that. The pork belly salad stole the show for me. Crisped and caramelized pork belly balanced by the citrus of pomelo, and all paired with fresh slices of dense, sweet cornbread. I could die. My advice would be to order A LOT of different things to share so you can get a taste of everything that Chef Kim has to offer. Special thanks to his sister and owner Vicki for putting a wonderful night together for us!"
"From start to finish this place was awesome. I had the endive ceasar which was very fresh and was a great twist on the original. My mom and sister had the salmon tartare which was the appetizer special. It was so fresh and balanced!! For the entree I had the curry quinoa which was so fantastic. It was rich and well balanced with just the right amount of heat. The other dishes at the table were the pork loin and the hanger steak which were both well liked. Did I mention they brought us a small bowl of complimentary garlic fries. I don't even like fries and these were scrumptious. Everyone else was full, but my gluttony convinced me to order dessert. I had the mixed berry shortcake. Now I have been to a lot good restaurants that have great savory dishes and then treat the dessert like an afterthought. I like dessert. This dessert was de-licious!! I like the BYOB minus the corkage fee. Only minor complaint was the napkins left a substantial amount on my sisters' knit clothing."
"Ruxbin is one of my favorite BYOB's in Chicago. I like them even more now, because they now take reservations. Some of my favorites include the apple and plum salad, the hangar steak, and the trout. The trout hasn't been on the menu for quite some time because the menu does change from time to time. This place is also a great date-night spot. My girlfriend loves it every time we come here. Highly recommended!"
"There are a lot of restaurants in Chicago that are on the ""national"" foodie scene. Alinea. Avec. After a long travel day and another of meetings, I was too tired for a high church dinning experience. Even the most avid foodie, once in a while says, ""I am not up for lavender and sea salt foam tonight."" A little research brought me to Ruxbin, a small, cozy neighborhood spot whose reputation sits just under the national radar. What a find. The food was remarkable. There is real innovation happening in the kitchen. As an amuse bouche, they served me a smoked oyster. It arrived under glass bowl. The bivalve sat on a pile of sea salt and burned wood chips. The bowl held in the smoke. There were tiny croutons of something delicious in the shell. OK. It was a novel presentation, but the bite was excellent. The carrot soup was full of cardamon essence, and it was creamy and delicious. The soup comes with a pumpernickel crouton on the side. You will begin to notice that there is a ""deconstructed"" nature to many of the dishes. The waiter remarked to me, ""yeah, that is sort chef's thing."" I also tried the mushroom toast. The mushrooms were lightly marinated in balsamic vinegar and served with greens and sliver of manchego. For dinner, I tried the black cod. It was beautifully cooked. They chef respected the fish. The Asian mushrooms and flavor profile was nice variation on the now common grilled black cod with miso that has popped up all over the place. Dessert was a deconstructed black forest cake. It was a fun approach, allowing you to construct your own bites from the cake, cherries, and frosting. Coffee is French press style. They do not take reservations, and they do not have a liquor license. The waiter will tell you about a wine shop that will deliver for a small fee. I did not opt for it. If you're out on a date, remember to stop in advance for wine."
"My wife and I celebrated our One Year Anniversary at Ruxbin this past Saturday. We had a truly amazing time! The restaurant is small and off the beaten path, and still incredibly delicious! The food could not have been better and the service was impeccable. The restaurant is also BYOB, making it a very affordable, luxury meal. Hint: While this may be strange to read, I highly recommend using their bathroom! In order to enter the one person room, you need to go through an old school functioning dark room door!"
"PERFECTION! I was looking for somewhere to take my fiance for his Birthday as a surprise. I was looking at a few options and stumbled upon Ruxbin. I decided ""why not!"" The reviews were great and I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. We were NOT disappointed. A huge pro is that they are BYOB! This is tremendously helpful! We started with the octopus and pork belly, both delicious!! Then on to the main courses. The scallops were literally the most well prepared scallops we have ever had, hands down. They were cooked to perfection! It is very easy to over or under cook scallops, so I was seriously in awe. The flank steak was also amazing! It had such great flavor to it and was cooked perfectly, also.I already have recommended this place, and will continue to, to multiple people. We will be back soon!"
"Came here with my girls and we all loved it!  So sexy, so delicious....the swag in this place is just SICK. We tried a number of things and the presentation alone was impressive.  I was a total fan of most of what we had and some things were just ok. Definitely worth a comeback and hey, great chefs!"
"I've heard great things about this place and I am happy to say that the boy and I enjoyed ourselves very much! We brought 2 bottles of wine (which was a bad idea by the end of dinner) and snagged a table with zero minutes of waiting because of the rainy weather. We ordered 2 of the crudo (oysters prepared 3 different ways), octopus appetizer, pork belly appetizer, salmon entree for me and the duck for him. The food was amazing. Albeit kind of small since we ended up ordering a side of fries at the end of our meal. 6-7 dishes total for dinner seems a bit much to me. The popcorn was kind of bland. I liked the atmosphere and how eclectic things are but it's hard to see your food in such dim lighting and we were kind of cramped at our table. The waitress was helpful and the bathroom remind me of Superman and his changing room/phone booth. Ruxbin, I had a wonderful time. The food was tasty and the wine wouldn't stop flowing. I just won't come here absolutely starving."
"What an amazing EXPERIENCE! From the hostess to the food runner and of course our server Cassie. Everything was outstanding. I had been hearing about Ruxbin ever since I moved down the block and had never had the opportunity to try it out. My boyfriend and I made 8:30 reso's and knew it was BYO and brought a bottle of wine and champagne. We arrived about an hour and a half earlier then our set time (we were hungry) but the hostess told us we wouldn't be seated until our timed reso (totally understandable), she then asked if we had any wine that we would like to leave there and we gave her the bottles that were kept cool as we traveled off to The Chipp Inn. We arrived back at 830 and were sat immediately with our bottles waiting for us at the table. We started with the fries and oysters, and the fries were probably the best I've ever had. For our mains we had the steak and salmon both extremely delicious and for dessert we had the chocolate cake option. All the food was phenomenal. The setting is very small and intimate, a great place for a date night dinner, and the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of the meal. Thank you Cassie for making our anniversary dinner so amazing, we will be back!"
"Where does one begin? I could start at the tight quarters that enabled me to listen to every single word of the the conversation at the table next to me. But, that would be too easy. We could then move to the fact it's BYOB (with a $6 corkage fee) and offer no other beverages, except their overpriced house made sodas, water and coffee. But, that would be too easy as well. So instead let's focus on the fact the ""kitchen"" will not cook any meat to your desired temp. I ordered the Lamb and Pork Belly. Was very excited. Sounded amazing. I like my meat medium well to well. If I'm paying for it, I should be able to get it like I prefer. But, no, Ruxbin would have none of that. I was told the kitchen only makes the lamb rare. Obviously, they're capable of making it medium, medium well, well, etc. They simply choose not to. To me, that's simply pretentious. This was the same case with my wife's hangar steak. She wanted it medium. They would ONLY cook it medium rare. I'm sorry, that's just bullshit. The fries from the appetizer menu and the beet salad, were very good. Thank god, we didn't need to ask for a cooking temp preference for those.I left hungry, which is ridiculous, and went to Green Street Meats to satisfy that hunger.If you're into this type of snotty attitude, Ruxbin is a delight. If you instead, believe, that since you're paying for it, you should be able to have it your way...well, head to Burger King."
"Really people, you have to get the octopus here. Aaaaand they've recently started taking reservations. Go for it."
"My boyfriend made a reservation for tonight for my birthday. Trying to be responsible, he called ahead to confirm the reservation. That's when we found out that they don't accept Amex. Since that's his only CC, he asked to cancel the reservation. While they don't accept Amex, they did charge a $50 cancellation fee on his Amex. WHAT. And it's not like we can get that reservation back now. I've been looking forward to eating at Ruxbin for over a year, but now they've left a bad taste in my mouth. :("
I've been multiple times - one of my favs. Small and intimate with terrific (and consistent) food. I hope them now taking reservations doesn't change the dynamic.
"Nom nom nom. This place was on my list for a while but I avoided it because I heard the wait was long/I get hangry easily. Now they take reservations! Hooray!Get the octopus and garlic fries. Octopus was really tender and flavorful, loved the black bean sauce. Garlic fries are always good.I had the lamb as an entree and it was fantastic.Interesting but nice ambience, I felt like I was in a cozy industrial workshop of sorts, but in a good way :)Pricey for the portion size, but I was comfortably full. I think the boys were probably still a little hungry afterwards...fill up on wine and beer?(it's Byob!)P.S. Check out the bathroom!"
We were really excited to go to Ruxbin because we had heard such good things. Our first course - the squash- was very good. The entrees were so disappointing - pretty bland and very expensive for what you are getting. Portions were so small that we left hungry. We went to a taco place next door and had a better meal.
"Good food; genuinely awful service. The food was inventive and fresh...when we got it. We waited 22 min for a table, even though we showed up on time for a reservation. Then we barely ever saw the waitress, even though there were a ton of them walking around. When we finally got the food, one of our dishes was good, one was lukewarm and one was so cold it needed to be sent back.When we actually ate the food, it was pretty good. But, as good as it was, it doesn't justify the service. It was a cool restaurant, if you care more about atmosphere than food or service, but otherwise, I would go elsewhere. There are far too many great restaurants in this city to bother with this one."
"First things first, Ruxbin just started taking reservations the beginning of this year, so that was one of the reasons we had held off going prior... secondly, it's BYOB with a $6 corkage fee.Ruxbin is a culinary treat. The flavors and presentation is exceptional. The prices are not. This is a must try place, but probably not a place you will frequent often. The appetizers are pretty small, again, because they are impeccably presented. The oyster trio was delicious, including one oyster atop smoking wood, covered with it's own glass bowl to allow the smoke to permeate the oyster. That's the kind of presentation I'm talking about. For my entree, I had the lam belly and saddle. This was hands down one of the most flavorful and wonderful dishes I've ever had. I all but licked the plate clean. I would definitely recommend this dish.I would skip the desserts unless you want a deconstructed small place full of fanciness and poshness. I prefer my desserts to be full and grand and gooey and wonderful, not pretentious. Overall, this place has wonderful and knowledgeable staff, great entrees and fantastic small deconstructed presentation, which comes at a very high cost, making this restaurant a one time deal for m."
The food was good but not like 'WHOA! That was amazing!' It was definitely pricey. The oyster trio was very interesting experience. Let me tell you. It was not really an appetizer. It was more like food that teased your palate and that was it. I really liked the apple mignonette and the applewood quick-smoked with wild rice & pork belly. A tint of apple and vinegar went well with the oyster. The latter had 3 grains of rice with a smaller than bite size pork belly and you eat it in one bite to get the flavor and texture. We got garlic fries since you can never go wrong with fries and aioli. The sea bass and duck breast entrees were good. Chocolate quartet was delish! Get it!
"We went here for my birthday and everything was so full of flavors - complex, but in a great way. We savored every bite and will be back!! Some of what we had between the two of us: pork belly (my first time eating pork belly...It was amazing here), octopus, hanger steak, lamb saddle, panne cotta. oh- AND it's BYOB!!!! :)"
"Though I've only been once, Ruxbin is easily my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Having read stellar Yelp reviews, I made reservations for two to celebrate my 2nd anniversary with my girlfriend. I was not disappointed.  The food was artfully presented and exceptionally prepared.  Their lamb is easily the best I've ever tasted.  I was so impressed, I walked over to the kitchen to pay my compliments to the staff.  What impressed me most was their response.  After accepting my compliments, the sous chef asked me ""Are you part of the couple that's here for an anniversary?""  I was floored.  Any restaurant that attuned to what is going on in the dining room is one I'd like to frequent often.  We have reservations for a 2nd visit in a couple of weeks."
"Great food and great atmosphere.  I understand why it's been so hard to get in for the years it's been open, the place it mini!"
"After the Yelp event this past Wednesday, my boyfriend and I were starving and in search of a place to grab dinner.  He suggested Ruxbin based on location but couldn't remember the name, so I really didn't know what I was walking into.  We got there around 9pm, and there was a forty-five minute wait for a table.  But, they did have seats a the community table near the kitchen. There was only one other couple up there, and we were starving, so they sat us there right away.  The bathroom is nearby and super cool in that the door is a darkroom door, which I thought was super cool.  The whole place has a very cool, intimate vibe that I loved.  Next time, I hope to sit at an actual table.We were told by our server that it was BYOB, which we weren't aware of before walking in.  If I had known it was BYOB, I would have loved it even more.  It's nice to be able to go out for a fancy meal and not have to pay for pricey drinks.  Our server brought over some seaweed infused popcorn that was nice to munch on while we waited for our meals. The ticket times were running a little long, so we were also brought out a salad on the house.I ordered the bourride at the server's suggestion, and he got the pork loin.  My the cod and clams were extremely delicious and packed full of flavor.  It was a tad on the salty side, but I think I may just have been sensitive to salt that night.  He raved about the pork loin and said it was one of the best meals he's had.  Sweet.I would definitely go back to Ruxbin.  It was unexpectedly awesome.  The service was great, and our server made me feel like I was on Portlandia.  What a great spot for a date night."
Been here multiple times and by far this is one of my favorite places to go to. Never had a bad meal here. Get there early in the evening and you will find plenty of seating. Not food related but they have an excellent decor and their restroom entrance is a must see !!
"Ruxbin is definitely an one-of-a-kind gem in Chicago, and there's no other restaurant like it in Chi-town. Ruxbin is positioned on the quiet side of Ashland in Ukrainian Village, which can be easily missed. The space is very small, dark, and intimate. It might take a few seconds to readjust your eyes because there's a lot to take in from the interior. Vintage cookbook pages are plastered on the walls and beautiful repurposed materials accented the room. Also the modern Eames chairs were upholstered with colored fabric. The interior seems mindfully-designed, and every object seems to have a purpose of existing in that space. One thing I like to note is that you have to check out the revolving door for the restroom entrance. Say what? You don't see that every day. :) From their eclectically-designed interior to their carefully-crafted food, you can sense the creative energy flowing from the space. Words can't describe the food at Ruxbin. My dining companion and I started with several appetizers. Actually we ate pretty much the whole menu. The appetizers were small but definitely share-able between two people. The mushroom toasts ($12)  were a savory-goodness. The caramelized mushrooms with the crisp greens was textually pleasing. I loved how the flaky biscuit soaked up all the flavors. The pork belly salad ($12) was refreshing with the grapefruit, which went well with the bitter arugula. The oyster trios ($12) were also a neat treat. I would definitely recommend ordering the octopus ($12) as starters. The octopus was grilled and had a lot of flavor. The meaty octopus made me forget I was actually eating octopus, which I usually try to stay away from on menus. For dinner, I ordered the scallops ($28) which was the showstopper of the evening. My dining companion had the sea bass ($30). Then we ended the meal with the two dessert on the menu. (Yep. We pretty much ate the whole menu.) I would go more into detail on the entree and dessert, but from the looks of the length of my review, I feel like I have been rambling. Overall, every dish felt very comforting and well-balanced. I appreciate the chef's approach to simple ingredients, transforming them into memorable dishes with such cleverness and impeccability. Every dish was beautiful and tasted wonderful. As for the bill at the end of the meal, it got REALLY pricey, but it was SOOOO worth it. Thank you, Ruxbin. I shall return soon.Also plus star for being BYOB. :)"
"Yes, the bathroom is cool.  Let's move on folks.BYOB - a reason enough to go here.  So refreshing to not overpay for wine that you can buy yourself.It was four of us and it was good that they now take reservations.  It was Saturday night after all.  We settled in at the table near the kitchen and the many-mentioned bathroom.  Our service was excellent - happy, knowledgeable, attentive but invisible.  The best!  We ordered four appetizers - the daily special (escolar tuna - kinda tartar and kinda ceviche - with a rosemary potato chip), the pork belly, the octopus and the garlic fries.  Wow.  All four fired really nicely.  We thought the pork belly was slightly overcooked, but we were critiquing.  The cornbread accompaniment was right on! And who doesn't like the refreshment of jicama? Octopus grill flavors were nice.  And we devoured the garlic fries.  The ladies thought they might have been a little garlicky.Main courses were the hanger steak, the Nigerian prawns and pulled pork, the lamb saddle and the ravioli.  Portion sizes were well crafted, execution was right on, flavors were balanced but vibrant.  It was all really tasty.  I can't say I was a fan of the prawns/pulled pork combination (it tasted just like I thought it would) but the flavors were well defined.  Just not a fan of that combination.Overall, this was excellent food and a great value.  Go and go quickly!!"
"I was finally willing to chance Ruxbin given that they removed the uncertainty of scoring a table by reversing their no reservations policy. The space has an unfinished feel that matches perfectly the deconstructed nature of their plates. Definitely check out their bathroom only to witness one of the most creative entries I've seen. The food, excellent, we shared the persimmon and apple salad, mushroom toast, and etouffee and grits. These dishes are amazingly executed deconstructed options with care given to each individual piece added to the plate. The kale accompanying the etouffee was perfectly crispy and the savory biscuits that formed the base of the mushroom toast was exceptional. The place is BYOB but does charge a $5 corkage fee (kinda weak) but this still turns out to be a good value for a place of this caliber. So go ahead and take advantage of the reservations!"
"Fantastic spot. Only have been in a few times since it's difficult to get a table on weekends & they don't accept reservations, but it's been a great experience each visit. BYOB, friendly staff, fun ambiance, easy parking. The bathroom entrance is a darkroom door - as a photographer, that was extra exciting."
"Really nice and small restaurant. BYOB is always a big BIG plus!!We shared the octopus and we loved it!! Tender and soft, and the black bean sauce gave it a special touch!! Then we had the salmon (loved it!) and the prawn with pulled pork. Wished it had a little more pork, cause it was amazing! For dessert we shared the taffy apple, and being a fan of chocolate desserts, this totally blew my mind! Would love to come back and try more things!"
"I absolutely love everything at Ruxbin! The chefs, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere and the ambience!!"
"I've been meaning to go to Ruxbin for a very long while now, but was deterred by the no reservation policy and rumored long wait time. My fiance and I finally ventured here on Friday night.The key is to be able to go ahead of time to put down your name with the friendly hostess who will give you the heads up and call you 10 minutes before your table is available. In a cab, I dropped by on my way home from work on a Friday at 6pm and was told that it would be a 1.5 hour wait. With the cab still waiting, I went home which is relatively close by (Wicker Park). The estimate was accurate and I got a call at home shortly before 7:30pm. Fiance and I headed over with our BYOB wine and were seated immediately upon arrival.The restaurant itself is small and intimate - seating capacity is about 30 people. The tables are set close together so if you are claustrophobic, this is probably not ideal for you. I personally really like a communal, family style feel so it was fine in my book. Our server Holly was attentive and amicable. Food is served as ready from the kitchen. We ordered:-The Crudo - trio of oysters done in 3 different preparations. Beautiful presentation and incredibly fresh and delicious. The last preparation was smoked so it was covered in a glass cup and the oyster was placed on top of wood chips. -Garlic Fries - exceptionally tasty. I am not a mayo fan but could eat a bucket of the aioli dipping sauce. A must get.-Tomato & Eggplant Tart - I almost didn't get this thinking the Branzino would be more substantial. However, I'm glad I changed my mind because this entree was absolutely amazing! Like a re-envisioned eggplant parmesan with market fresh fire roasted vegetables. I could not be more pleased. -Pork Loin - really flavorful and delicious. Well seasoned and tender. The accompaniments complimented the star, The Pork, really well.-Fruit Cake - it was hard to pass up a fried apple pie. It was likable, more tart then sweet. However, I do somewhat regret passing on the Rocky Road. With a bill that came out to $60/pp and Michelin quality food, I'd say Ruxbin has made it onto my all-star team."
"After hearing a friend describe Ruxbin as her favorite place in Chicago and wanting to try it for the last year, I finally had my chance last night and slipped in for dinner on a last minute whim while in the neighborhood.This was one of the best meals I've had in Chicago.  Holy shit.The crudo last night was white tuna.  The fish was impeccable and the prep was perfectly balanced.  They brought me one of their oysters to try - it was served under a glass with applewood chips burning.  Delicious!If I had been wearing socks, my entree would have blown them off.  I had the pork loin with the apple cider au jus and chickpea puree.  The best pork loin I've ever had.  Moist and so tender.The service was great. I was in a hurry and they did a great job ensuring I would get out within the hour, without making me feel rushed.  So friendly.If you are not drinking, try one of their house-made sodas.  The celery soda was awesome.I will definitely be going back, I just wish they took reservations.  Like others have said, you'll have the best luck if your party is 1 or 2."
"Ruxbin is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I'm a restaurant junkie with an increasingly fickle sensibility, and I've been to a fair amount of Chicago's high-end, Michelin Star restaurants (blah blah) but Ruxbin is without a doubt my absolute favorite. It's a mid tier, unpretentious place with quirky details. Personality and 'vibe' aside, if your goal in picking a restaurant is to impress a date, friend or family member with your excellent taste, or if it's simply to experience a one-of-a-kind, knockout dining experience look no further. Just don't be stupid and try to get a table on a Saturday night at 9PM because it's not going to happen.Bring your own wine. No one's going to look at the label because it's dark as hell, so don't worry about that. Rejoice in the flurry of elegant presentations, snacks and complex, rich flavors headed your way. Keep an open mind and try to appreciate the Chef's creativity. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but I really resent reading whiny reviews about portions and prices with regard to Ruxbin. Do your research, this isn't the Cheesecake Factory, bro. I for one, have never left this establishment hungry.The Black Cod is incredible. The Pork Loin, just ridiculous. Plenty of others have reviewed the menu items. These dishes are designed to trigger the pleasure switch in your brain, if only for a moment. Isn't that what pleasure is all about? Good timing, and the bittersweet longing for just...a...bit...more. Be smart and go on a Tuesday at 6PM, or something. Ruxbin is the ability to experience well-crafted, luxurious fine dining without having to figure out which fork to use. Enjoy it for what it is."
"I can understand why this was rated the best new ""Asian"" restaurant (by some publication somewhere) even though the menu is decidedly American.I'd consider it American ingredients with Asian flavors.  Not the sort of place where you can customize stuff.  Everything belongs in the dish, so deal.The octopus starter was delicious as was the hanger steak.  The corn pop panna cotta is a decidely Asian style dessert-- not too sweet, with hints of salty.  Perfect for my palate.Portions are on the small side, but not unreasonable for this type of restaurant.  Wouldn't be surprised if it showed up on the Michelin bib gourmand list in 2014."
"This might be my favorite fine-dining stop in Chicago. The food is inventive and changes with the season. While the menu is relatively small, there is something to appeal to all palettes.  I've enjoyed oysters here, duck, vegetarian pastas, and fish. (I will update with more detailed dish descriptions next time I go back.)  The portions aren't overwhelming, which is a plus in my book, and the accompaniments are creative and perfectly prepared.  The chef, Edward Kim, really takes advantage of seasonal ingredients and employes them in fresh new ways.  The first time I went, I literally texted someone that I had oooh'd and ahh'd at practically every single bite.  It's also BYOB, which is fantastic, and allows you to have a gourmet meal without breaking the bank.  Lush and Noble Grape are at Chicago and Noble if you happened to forget your provisions.  They don't take reservations (except on Sundays) and the place -- raffish and funky  -- is quite small. They will take your number and text you when your table is ready, though, so you can put your name in, head up to Division to grab a drink at The Bedford or Bangers & Lace (or over to Chicago Ave for Five Star, Lush, etc.) and then Ruxbin will give you about 10 minutes to get back and be seated.  But show up early enough (before 6:30) or you may not even be able to get ON the list.  There gets to a point on weekend nights where they stop taking names for the list."
"So, I am writing another review because, the food is very good and with the changes in menu it's like going to a whole new restaurant and since it's an update I can just write about what we had and how awesome it was.The Apple and Plum was a great, light appetizer with which was neither overpoweringly sweet from the fruit or too sharp/salty from the manchego. We also had the escolar, which had this thick, creamy texture to it with these crunchy/salt bites of bacon in it, it was like bacon surprise because it looked small but ended up in a BIG way. I've always gotten their housemade soda but the one this past Sunday, passionfruit/earl grey with almond. Terrific, I've always cut myself off at 1 but it was so good, with the almond giving the soda a nice body to it that I had a second one, my sister and GF did steal sips both times though. Main course I got the hangar steak-only served medium rare-which was like telling a fat kid to eat more cake, mini potatoes, brocolini. Delicious.My sister got the halibut and was served with rice, with just a little crispy rice.The gf got the dayboat scallops-also tasty with the greens and the corn. Tasty, but I really, really, really liked my hangar steak.For dessert we got both the brownie and the 'pretzel and beer.' The brownie had juniper ice cream. ""THIS TASTES LIKE GIN!!!"" My sister loudly exclaimed, with their housemade brownie with the smoked cherries and potato chips-weird to the ears but tasty to the mouth.The Pretzel and beer, a beer-sorbet, creamy, smooth and then the doughnut itself with a sweet raspberry filling. Amazing. With all the changes though the one constant was the service-which is always excellent and the presentation, it's like everything is plated just right, pretty to look at and better to eat."
"I've heard good reviews but I didn't know how much of a treat I was in for! The food was amazing, I highly recommend you get the oysters and you can't share. The trio is awesome and it's an experience from one to the next. The Octopus is another dish I'd come back for, the flavors were excellent and the tenderness of the octopus was perfect, great texture and was cooked perfectly. Two thumbs up on food, attention to details, atmosphere & overall experience."
"One of the BEST places I've gone to in Chicago.  This place is tiny yet cozy.  You can probably only fit about 50 people in there at once.  However, it's not loud or uncomfortable.  This was the absolute perfect place for my boyfriend to take me for my birthday!We ordered the Mushroom Toast and Garlic fries for appetizers (we can never decide on just one).  We almost had to sit back from the Garlic Fries because they were so unbelievably delicious and we were already over consuming!  However we couldn't stop.  The Mushroom Toast was equally as good.For the entree I got the Venison (my first time trying)!  I figured if the apps were that good then the Venison was going to be good too.  Never order food you've never tried before unless you know the restaurant is good. I made a great decision!  The Venison was perfectly cooked and nearly melted in my mouth.  Where did they get these deer!?The service was outstanding, the decor was unique, fun, and intriguing. I'm sure everyone has mentioned the bathroom on here so I won't go into detail. But it was pretty cool.  Overall, a GREAT experience and I will definitely be back."
"Oysters and Garlic Fries are a must. There's no such thing as too garlicky - they're amazing. The 3rd of the trio of oysters was one of the best bites of food I've ever had (and I eat a LOT). Entrees were delicious as well - lamb was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and my husband loved the prawns dish. Dessert was mediocre (peach cake), but they were nice and took it off our bill (so we extra-tipped the waitress). Awesome ambience - intimate and romantic. Perfect for my husband's birthday dinner. NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. I don't know how restaurants can say that when there is a step to get in. My husband is in a manual chair and I can get him up a step or 2, but if you have a power chair or are unable to maneuver your manual chair up stairs, then this is NOT the place for you. The bathroom is upstairs and completely inaccessible. It's an old building and the hostess was nice enough to call me and let me know about the bathroom ahead of time, but definitely something to keep in mind."
"1 hour, 15 minutes (total wait) on a Friday around 6pm. We bought a bottle from Noble Grape (a bit overpriced but helpful employees when you ask). We still had time to kill so we went to this dive bar (I forget the name) for a drink.The tables are crammed next to one another; pray beforehand (or during) that you don't get an annoying couple next to you. No need to dress up; it's very casual. Besides, you don't want to be flashing anything halfway decent since the neighborhood looks a bit rough (a nearby liquor has a sign posted that reads ""No hoodies or masks allowed""). Go figure.The food was excellent. We had the pork belly for our appetizer. With pork belly becoming more common, it's more important than ever to serve the perfect pork belly. And this was good.The duck was excellent and came with a salad that I could have easily mistaken for crack cocaine since it was so enjoyable (I would imagine crack cocaine to be enjoyable? Take a joke...).I wasn't a big fan of the hanger steak because it had a pastrami-like rub on it. I love pastrami rubs but for some reason, it wasn't enjoyable for me (though my gf enjoyed it).Dessert was spot on, good ending to our meal.Ruxbin is not BYOB; $5 corkage fee per bottle.Overall 8/10Food 9/10Atmosphere/setting 6/10Service 9/10"
"This was good food at an expensive price. I think I'm just tired of spending $100 for a meal for two. I expect the food to be twice as good as a $50 meal, and I haven't yet found a place that lives up to the expectations that I have at this price point. I did really like the interior, but was surprised that they wouldn't allow the couple next to us order their steak ""medium."" Medium rare was the most done they would allow her to go. Which is absurd. I like my steak medium rare, as does my wife, but isn't the customer always right? If the lady wants her steak medium, cook it that way!"
"Ruxbin has been on my list for 2 years, so my expectations going in were SUPER high, and shockingly it exceeded my expectations!The food was excellent, the service was great, and it's BYOB!Yes, the place is small. Yes, it's a pain that you can't make a reservation, however the way we did it was to have 2 people go early when it opened at 5:30 to put our name in for a table at 7:30. It worked out great! When our table was ready, they called us as we sat and had drinks at the bar around the corner. No complaints there!Highlights of the meal:- The Octopus. I don't usually even love octopus, however they prepare it perfectly!- The Garlic Fries - YUMMMM-Hanger Steak - deliciously preparedOnly advice - skip dessert (we didn't really care for the PB & J or the Panna Cotta). Do what we did after and go a few blocks to Black Dog  gelato instead :)"
"I've been waiting to come here for years, always a hard table to get.  It didn't blow me away but it was solid.  A good value with the no fee BYOB policy.  Octopus and pork belly dishes were ok, a bit on the small side.  The garlic fries were great.  The best dish was the signature hanger steak entree.  Glad to try it but wouldn't bother to come back again."
"Ruxbin was everything I hoped it would be! A few friends and I have been wanting to try this place so we stopped in around 7pm on a Thursday. Our group quickly grew from three to six (word caught on and our friends really wanted to join I guess!), but we only had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table. We sat in the communal area, where you are able to drink while waiting. This was also the table we had for the night.The communal table is for large groups and faces the kitchen. It's cool to see the servers putting finishing touches on dishes but maaan did it make us hungry! The wait for food wasn't horribly long though. We were too busy chatting to notice. For appetizers we had:-Apple & Plum salad: this was pretty good but nothing exciting-Tuna: very tasty. the flavors went well together-Octopus: I love eating cephalopods so of course I liked this! -Quail: anything fried is good to me! The watermelon and mint added an interesting flavor, but they worked well together-Garlic Fries: these were good and I liked the chipotle aioli dipping sauceFor dinner I had the day boat scallops, which comes with pork belly. That combination really is as heavenly as it sounds. The scallops were huge and I was pretty full after my meal. I liked the hint of spicyness from the poblano sauce. I was able to try my friends' dishes (beef & broccoli, duck breast and tomato tart) and all were very good. Everyone enjoyed their meal and thought the portions were good. Our server was friendly and didn't mind splitting the check five ways.I really wanted that pretzel for dessert but we were all so full! I'm already looking forward to coming back!p.s. This place is BYOB!! :D"
"Note: we went to Mott Street two weeks ago and I gave it 5 stars.  I prefer Mott Street to Ruxbin although the two are different it's hard not to compare them!The last time I was at Ruxbin was two years ago and I thought it was good, not great, which is why it's taken so long for me to return.  Back then it had more of a Korean influence but nowadays the menu seems heavier with more of a French influence with Asian accents.The appetizers were the highlight of the meal: the grilled octopus with fermented soybean sauce was great and filling.  The octopus was cooked perfectly, not rubbery.  We also ordered the venison tartare that was a special on the menu - this was the best item!  I love tartare and it was awesome, flavorful and slightly leaner than beef tartare.  Our mains were ok.  We shared the pork loin in a mushroom and greens sauce.  It was lighter than we expected.  We also had the black cod which was prepared not in a sweet miso sauce which I'm used to.  The cod was accompanied with other seafood flavors.  Both were good, not great.  Bottom line, I'll probably be at Mott Street again in the next month and Ruxbin....who knows."
"Ruxbin is a hidden gem that could easily be overlooked.  Let me just say, it is completely worth your effort to seek this place out and dine here no matter where you live!  Yes, it is a tiny place accommodating maybe 30 people max, but because of the small quarters it is very intimate and the food is outstanding.  To start, they serve a small dish of popcorn with some sort of seasoning on it, while you peruse the menu.  Everything on the menu sounded fabulous, but my friend and I decided to share a few different small plates.  We started with the pork belly, as many reviews raved about this dish.  Absolutely fabulous.  Well executed and the flavors burst in your mouth.  The pork belly literally fell apart when your knife hit the meat and  it was cooked perfectly with a nice sear on the outside.  It came with a little square of cornbread and accompanied by grapefruit and jicama, adding a nice acidic touch.  We then progressed to the mushroom toast.  Loved it!  The savory biscuit base was more like a flatbread than biscuit and the oyster mushrooms added a meaty texture making it a heavier small plate.  The house ricotta was the perfect balance of salt to the lovely mushroom toast.  Our final small plate was the venison tartare, which was a special that night.  The meat was seasoned well and was served with pumpernickel toast.  However, the first set of toast brought was so hard that we could have chipped a tooth, thus lowering my review to 4 stars.  My friend also had the ÉTOUFFÉE AND GRITS, which was an outstanding dish.  The cauliflower, which if not done well can be bland.  This dish was an explosion of flavors and the mushroom étouffée was delicious!  I can't wait to go back and I like that they change some of the menu items depending on what is in season.  One other draw back, (beside our hard toast!) is that they charge a $5 corkage fee when they are BYOB.  Seemed odd.All in all totally worth it and can't wait to go back!"
"Everything was absolutely amazing. The space is eclectic and their online booking is quite simple. I wish I could eat here every week! We had the garlic fries, pork belly, sea bass, duck breast, and a chocolate cake dessert. The broth the sea bass was in was unique and made with black tea. I hope to come back again for a special occasion."
"I found out about this place while dining at their sister restaurant, Mott St. I got the same day reservation on Saturday night so that was a good start. From the minute me and my husband walked in to the restaurant to the last bite of my yummy desert this place did not disappoint us at all. Make sure to bring your own booze, its BYOB. Our favorite appetizers: Crudo,octopus,pork belly. Main course: YOU HAVE TO TRY LAMB SADDLE AND BELLY...just trust me on that one. NIGERIAN PRAWN & PULLED PORK was also very good. We finished up our fabulous dinner with GOAT CHEESE PANNA COTTA and French press coffee. Yes,we are coming back!"
"Small place with a great vibe and charming decor. Good service. BYO which keeps the overall bill in check. Like everyone says on here, the food is the star. We'd never been so we tried a lot of things. Started with the garlic fries, pork belly, and a third one I don't recall. All I remember about the third one was the depth of the flavors and I found myself wondering ""what is that flavor... what is that... oh that's candied bacon!""Appetizers are made one at a time and brought out as they're ready, so the timing really lets you enjoy them one at a time--  a big plus. We followed the rec's on here and ordered the duck and hanger steak. Both were great and we playfully bickered about who got the better entrée. We ordered both deserts and, they too, were made individually and brought out one at a time. Overall, all the food was fantastic, rich complicated flavors all perfectly balanced. We already have reservations to go back with some friends."
"Ruxbin is, by far, the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. I went here with a friend who knows his food, and we both agreed that it was the best meal we've had in Chicago (personally, they beat out all the fancy and more famous establishments including next, mk, nomi, acadia, etc). We went on a Sunday night with a reservation (Sundays only), so there was no wait. Highly recommend doing so, since the wait at Ruxbin is notoriously long. We brought with us some drinks since it was BYOB. The restaurant was small, but very unique and the chairs/bench was surprisingly comfy. Services were relaxing and simple - our server brought us water, glasses for beer, and explained some simple rules of the house (ordering both appetizers and entrees at the same time). We shared the pork belly, fries, venison, and etouffee. Portion was small (to medium for the entrees), but the food was very very well executed. The pork belly was absolutely delicious and balanced with hints of sweetness and acid. I do wish the skin was a little crispier, as pork belly should be a little crisp IMO. Venison was tender (cooked medium rare) and flavorful, as well as the etoufee & grits. I was very impressed with the many ingredients that came into each dish. Each bite was an explosion of flavor and texture in my mouth, and I kept digging back into my plate looking for more surprises - this was a sign of a perfect meal.The house sent us PB&J for dessert. I am not a big PB&J, but I couldn't complain, and really, their dessert might have converted me into a PB&J fan. I can not rave enough about my meal here. Well worth the money spent, and even with the small portion we left both really full. They kept things very simple here - cozy, no loud music, not a ton of servers/bussers walking around, and the ambiance reflects that - very relaxed and intimate. I am in love!!!!"
"good food, cool interior & SUPER cool bathroom. portions were small but well made. I was mostly impressed by how much detail went into the design of the restaurant. definitely worth a try!"
Great food! Had the prawn and pulled pork and it was pure deliciousness. Knocking it to 4 stars as the service was slow.
"It's my second visit to Ruxbin..the place is quiet, intimate and the food is off the charts.  the reservation system could use improvement. We were told that it was a 2 hour wait and then when we picked another place, we received a call in 30 mins saying our table was ready. The seaweed popcorn is perfect. Ordered the venison tartar and the octopus as starters. I have to say that the pumpernickel taost helped take some of the bite off  the venison. The octopus was delicious. Would definitely order it again. Bourbon with the meal wasn't a bad choice either."
"Very solid. Came here on a Sunday night, heard all the stories so my husband and I got here 5:15 and there were still about 4 parties ahead of us. The place is surprisingly small but there was no compromise in comfort. The decor is nice and unique, service was quick, and for the most part the food was delicious. We ordered the following as appetizers:- Octopus (Best dish of the three by far. Great flavor and textures all around, 5/5)- Quail (Didn't quite understand the contrast with the watermelon, but would definately get again, 5/5)- Fries (While very good, this was least impressive as I felt like you could go to any bar and get the same thing. Felt a little out of place, 3/5)Entrees:- Duck (The dish was OK. Everything on the plate worked well together, but was a little dissapointed in the execution of the duck itself. It was very chewy and I had to spit out chunks because I just could not swallow. Wasn't the worst, but definately not the best. Also I may be a little biased because the night before, I ate duck at Takashi which was upper-echelon quality. 2.5/5)- Pork loin (By far, the most memorable of all the dishes. I've never quite tasted pork that was that tender. The caramelized  figs fit perfectly to compliment the dish, 10/5 if i could, 5/5)Desserts:- Donuts (Maybe it was the expectation? But I thought it fell a little short. There was nothing about this plate that ""wowed"" me. Wish the beer flavor came through a bit more, 2.5/5)- Shortcake (Not a huge fan of savory desserts so I'm not able to judge too well.)So overall, some hits and misses. The hits were VERY memorable and the misses were not the worst. I don't like 'no reservations' idea and if there were tons of people waiting, I'm not sure I'd want to go through with it. But if you have a chance to go on a weekday, offnight, this is a strongly-recommended restaurant."
"I've tried to dine here a few times and always ended up going elsewhere, since the wait was either too long or their waiting list was maxed out.  This is because they don't take any reservations and it doesn't help that the restaurant itself is small.  There's a few 4-people booths, but the majority of the tables are for 2.  So the key is to go with one other person and close to 5:30 PM (when they open).  What I like about Ruxbin - the food, which flows out of the kitchen, very friendly service, BYOB w/ $5 corkage fee, and they have one of the niftiest bathrooms in the city.  Entering involves a capsule you step into, with a door that spins around you.  It's hard to explain, but definitely check it out.I ordered the soup of the day, which was the amazing Roasted Acorn Squash soup.  It was so freaking good!  It's creamy, has great flavor, and the hint of brown sugar makes for a delicious soup.  Easily one of the best soups I've ever had!  I'd go back just for another bowl.  The Pork Belly salad w/ Cornbread was delicious, especially with the bits of grapefruit.  The Mushroom Etouffe was also delicious and a great vegetarian option.  I loved every bite and the flavor combinations were perfect.  The Bucatini and Clams was good, but was a little underwhelming compared to the rest of the food.  It was an unique Korean fusion dish, with al dente bucatini pasta in a Korean jja jang (black bean) sauce, topped with clams.Overall, I loved the food and can't wait to go back, especially for that tasty tasty soup."
"We had a great experience at Ruxbin! They take reservations for Sunday (big plus, since it was my husband's birthday) and we were promptly seated. The place is tiny! We didn't mind the intimacy at all, but in case you're not into hearing the conversation the couple at the next two-top is having, then you might want to avoid this place. This is what we ordered:Garlic fries with chipotle aioliMushroom toast- Oyster Mushrooms, House Ricotta, Savory Biscuit, Giardinera, hazelnutsDay boat scallops (me, me, me!)-Pine Nut, Roasted Carrot, Pork Carnitas, Black Raisin Emulsion, Celeriac, Pommes Puree Pork loin (husband)- Grilled Plums, Chickpea puree, Apple Cider Jus, Crispy Hominy, Coffee Chili Salt Everything was delicious. The fries were a little too greasy for my taste, but the chipotle aioli sauce was a great combination. I absolutely loved the mushroom toast (3 pieces), they were totally worth the wait. The Day boat scallops were to die for (2 huge scallops). My husband really enjoyed the pork loin. He says it was just right. The appetizer sizes weren't bad (three could share what we ordered--enough to taste everything). The entrees were small, but luckily we had been celebrating prior to arriving with wine & snacks so we were completely satisfied by our meal. We didn't have room for desserts (although we weren't keen on the PB&J or the Granny Smith Taffy apple options----we love chocolate!). The wait was a little long--they have a small kitchen and everything is made to order so expect to wait a bit. The service was great--our server was very nice and they all seemed to help each other out (the other server came around and replaced our empty bottle of water when we finished it). The bathroom is really cool! It's a dark room entrance (without the dark part) and there's a deadbolt so that no one can come in while you're doing your business. The walls are plastered with album covers.  All in all, it was a fabulous place. My husband really enjoyed the dinner surprise and we would definitely like to come back. Highly recommend it!"
"The first time I went to Ruxbin, I went with two girlfriends and got rejected at 7pm as they weren't taking any more names for the waitlist that night. Wahwah, we were so sad & disappointed. So last night when I went & was seated immediately at 615, I was thrilled!!!Our waitress was so friendly & knowledgable about the food which is always highly appreciated at a restaurant. She described everything to us and when we asked about a couple different things, she was able to list ALL the ingredients in it which was highly impressive. Ruxbin is BYOB!!! I lovvvve BYOB places! We brought our own wine & paid the corkage fee of $5 happily.They have popcorn on the table when you sit down with a yummy seasoning on top that we found out has nori paper in it among other things. I loved that! I'm going to try it on my popcorn at home.As my first dish I had the Pork Belly Salad which has Jicama, Grapefruit and arugula in it topped with a citrus vinaigrette for $12. It was delicious! I'm a pork belly enthusiast & snob and this pork belly was cooked so nicely! It came with some cornbread on the side which was probably the best I've ever had!  Some of that cornbread, salad, grapefruit & pork belly on the the fork made for fireworks in my mouth.We also tried the soup of the night ($7) which was Acorn Squash Soup. It was one of the best soups I've ever had in my life! So creamy & rich with amazing flavor. I do not like squash normally but this soup was just packed with fantastic layers of yum. Do not miss getting this on your trip to Ruxbin!!!For my main entree I had the Mushroom Etouffe which came with a Polenta Cake, Roasted Cauliflower Steak, and Chow-Chow for $18. I absolutely loved this dish. It didn't feel heavy to me which I loved and Id never had anything like it before. I am a bit obsessed with mushrooms and with this dish using them in such an inventive way made it like a dream.All in all, I've fallen in live with Ruxbin. I didn't get a chance to see the bathroom so that gives me an excuse to come back!"
"Great good, nice service. I left hungry.I am not a person with a giant appetite and felt like I needed to stop on the way home to get more food. For the price I wish the portions were bigger."
"Everything about this place is amazing.  I loved the ambience, the service, the decor, the FOOD.  They don't serve alcohol, but it's BYOB.  $5 corking fee I believe?  Not sure, we forgot about the BYOB rule and didn't come with our own wine.  But that's not an issue.  The space is super cozy; not a huge staff or personnel and you can tell.  Because of that, everything seems super personal.  Anyway, we started with the heirloom tomato salad, grilled octopus, and oysters.  Heirloom tomato salad was just that: an heirloom tomato salad.  Can't really mess that up, I guess.  I didn't have the oysters, but the presentation was pretty cool (my husband did like them).  One of the oysters came in a glass bell jar, sitting on top of wood chips, as if it were being smoked.  My husband said the flavor was good.  He approved.The grilled octopus was really unique.  I've never had flavors like that before.  The char and smokiness of the octopus paired very well with the reduction smear that it was plated on.  The radish greens were dressed very nicely.  If I were alone in my home, I probably would've licked the plate clean.For entree, I had the duck and my husband had the hanger steak.  The duck was served pretty rare, which was fine for me.  And the hanger steak was served medium rare, which was also fine for my husband.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The duck was pretty rich, but it's duck.  How else is it supposed to taste?  My dish had so many fall flavors, it was like October exploded in my mouth.  Crispy brussel sprouts, apple-flavored mashed potatoes, roasted celery.  It was great.  It was a cold weekend in Chicago when we visited; this warmed my SOUL. The hanger steak was also really good.  I was originally concerned how the bacon, chimichurri, and broccolini would go together, but the flavors were all pretty mild.  I'm not a huge bacon fan, but it added a nice smokey element without being too overbearing.  I think Ruxbin's menu is seasonal.  If I'm ever back in Chicago, I hope I can come back and try other things on their menu!  There were so many things on the current menu that I wanted to try.  It was difficult making a decision!  I imagine that no matter what you order, you will not be disappointed."
"I wanted to eat at Ruxbin until I learned from other Yelpers that the chef insists on serving meat cooked rare or, at most, medium rare. What an ego! Does he also insist that diners forego cream and sugar and drink only black coffee?"
"I am thrilled this place started taking reservations. It took me a few years to get here, only because there were no reservations. This cozy, quiet joint has a wonderful serving staff, including the hostess who immediately offered to take our jackets and open our bottle of wine. Yes, this place is BYOB which only makes me like it more. Yes, there is a $5 corkage fee, but it's better than paying for 2 glasses of wine. We ordered the garlic fries, pork belly, venison tar tar, and the hanger steak. The garlic fries were delicious and garlicky. I could have munched on them for hours. The pork belly came next. The pork and grapefruit went wonderfully together, while the cornbread was delicious on it's own. This dish was on the smaller side, but tasty none the less. The venison tar tar is a must. I am an avid fan of any tar tar, but the venison is lean, but tender and when you add all the components of the dish, yum! The hanger steak was almost perfect. I say almost because I wish there was more of it! I want the taste of the chimichurri/red wine reduction in my mouth forever. The steak was done so perfectly it melted in my mouth. I will dream of this dish for a while.This place is very cute and the flavors are bold and comforting all in the same bite. I will be looking forward to going back!"
"So happy, they take reservations and we can finally try this place that we've heard about for a couple of years. Four of us, early reservation, 6:45 on a Friday.  Our waitress was terrific, helpful, didn't rush us or make us feel like we needed to order, eat and get out to turn the table. Fries were some of the best we've had. Rest of the food was good, but certainly not outstanding. Normally would be happy to go give it another try, but we won't. One of our party wanted the steak, well done. Never would I destroy a nice piece of meat, but that is how she has ordered it all over the world. In many three star restaurants. Have heard  them say, we don't recommend this however if that is what the customer wants, they oblige. We were told the chef will not cook the steak past med rare. Period, the end, our waitress won't even ask. He obviously has been reading past reviews about how great they are because why else would he treat a customer this way. Plenty of other terrific options in Chicago where the chef doesn't feel he needs to educate us. The crowd was very young, seasoned diners know better than to take that from a chef.  Very disappointed."
"Ruxbin has the best food in the city! My husband and I compare every meal we have out to it, and nothing ever beats it. I have  tried the oysters, mushroom toast, octopus, pork belly, garlic fries, pork, shrimp and grits, black cod, scallops and the best of all... the hanger steak!  It is cooked to perfection and comes with a delicious sauce. Every dish is perfectly executed- flavors and presentation. The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. If you go, you will leave extremely satisfied! It is a taste of heaven!"
"Really liked the food, which is quite artistic. We enjoyed our scallops, hangar steak, venison, pork entrees, as well as our appetizers (octopus and another one I can't remember now). I absolutely loved my venison, best I have ever had (granted, not that many times before). The meat is seasoned well and very tender. We also shared a small dessert, which I think is a chocolate cake with raspberry gelato (?).It is BYOB, but we didn't remember that until we were at the doorstep. So, we had their home-made soda, which is pretty good.Portions are smaller than what we expected, so the three of us (2 guys and 1 gal) had to order a 4th entree, otherwise my guy friends would have gone home still hungry. ;-) I wouldn't say it's a big problem, but just a little unusual because we usually have the opposite problem - not being able to finish food in our plate.They don't take reservations, and only complete parties can be seated. This made it a little hard in winter times, when the two of us had to wait for one friend outside... I wish they had at least some warmer alternative (bar, even just expand you entry way or cover it up) for people waiting."
"I am very surprised by all of the great reviews for Ruxbin. The truth is, this place is really overpriced. I eat at a lot of fine restaurants and rarely have I felt so unsatisfied when leaving a restaurant of this caliber. We ordered two appetizers (the octopus and the mushroom toast) as well as two entrees (the steak and the branzino) and a dessert (the PB&J). All of the portions were incredibly small. Actually, the smallest portions I've seen outside a tapas place. The octopus had at best 5-6 bites. The branzino was a small sliver of fish. The steak was maybe 5 ounces of meat. All for $25-27 an entree. Crazy! The dessert was a complete joke. While it looked pretty, it was smaller than the smallest brownie at a kid's bake sale. The food was pretty good, but not amazing.I'm sorry, but at the prices we paid, this place was far from generous. It just felt like they were being cheap in every way possible. Popcorn instead of bread. Come on! Everyone knows the popcorn is the cheapest food out there. They wouldn't take American Express either. Loved the BYOB but it's an all around very mediocre place that was probably 2x overpriced."
"A small comfi restaurant with great atmosphere. We started with the octopus salad which was ok. Then we order the beet salad with orange which was fresh and amazing. Then we continue with the raviolos and the clams., both were delicious!! We ended we both dessert on the menu...a perfect ending to an increible dinner!!"
"I have been meaning to come check out Ruxbin for almost two years, and finally was able to come for my birthday dinner a couple weeks ago.  Despite having six people in our party, we were seated right away at the table at top of steps right by the kitchen - awesome!The food, quite honestly, lives up to the standard expressed by all of the other reviews here.  The reason why I took away a star from this rating was our experience with our server.  First of all, when explaining the menu to us, the server mentioned that plates tend to be small, and that she would suggest ordering one appetizer per person.  We took this into consideration, but decided as a group to only order three appetizers: the octopus, the pork belly, and the garlic fries.  Here's how our conversation went:us: For the appetizers, we'd like to get the octopus, the pork belly, and the garlic fries.server: okay, you know, as I said earlier, the appetizers are small dishes, and the octopus is a small dish.  So if you want ALL of you to get a bite, I'd suggest getting two...us: yeah, we know.  but we're okay with that, we'll just get the one.server: okay.....and also, for the pork belly, it is also a really small dish.  if you REALLY WANT to try it, you should get two.us: uhhhh, yeah we know...we'll just get the one.  and the garlic fries, please.server: oKAYYYat this point, we ordered the rest of our meal.  our server walks away, and comes back not two minutes later, saying, ""you know, if you're not going to order two of the other appetizers, i would REALLY suggest that you at least order two of the garlic fries.""what the heck, lady!  I've never had a server so pointedly pressure us, and needless to say, our group was VERY miffed and had already lost much of our excitement for this meal thanks to this server.  The food was incredible, but still left us with a bad impression thanks to our lovely server."
"I have been wanting to come here for over a year and it was even better than expected! Different decor, really small and great service.Started with the octopus (sooo tender), carrot soup special and garlic fries. The fries really stood out. Perfectly crisp and seasoned. I split the hanger steak and the fish stew. Both were absolutely incredible. The flavor combinations were so different and complimented each other perfectly. Save room for dessert because those were out of this world as well. Corn pop panna cotta and rocky road heaven."
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Came here at 5:25 on a weekday (they open at 5:30) so we sat right away, but I could see the crazy wait others have written about being a little annoying. Especially since there's no good bar solution or place to wait if the weather isn't nice.Service was great, though, and I love the BYOB. Calamari Appetizer - REALLY delicious. Amazing complexity and layers of flavor, and the calamari was cooked very perfectly. Lamb Entree (shared) - There was nothing about this dish that wasn't good. They presented the meat beforehand. Meat was cooked perfectly. I loved the fennel and Israeli couscous and the cherries. Really quite well done!Rocky Road dessert - YUM. Caramel and ice cream were perfect compliments. I thought the cotton candy was unnecessary though.I see why people come here but it did feel cramped (they sat us in the very back of the restaurant even though there were multiple tables open in the middle). Cosy is nice, cramped is not great. I will be back, though! But hopefully not on a day with bad weather if I have to wait outside...."
Everything about Ruxbin seems unique! It is a great place to go with a group of friends or straight from work for the 5:30 seating.
This is an overrated place. Great atmosphere but what you are really there for which is food its definitely not worth the hype. Expensive and food tasted weird was not hot or even warm. Garlic fries were good but too garlicky. Complimentary popcorn seriously tasted stale. My husband ordered lamb belly dish it tasted really odd. I ordered the salmon it tasted good but was cold. I don't think we will be coming back again. Though the service was great food presentation was good its just missing the taste.
"Allow me to preface this three-star review by saying: You should visit Ruxbin at least once. You'll have a lot of fun with your blind date/best friend/significant other. If you plan on coming on a Friday or Saturday night, try to beat the rush of diners past 7 PM to lessen your wait. But then again, they offer to open and pour your bottle of wine ($5 corking fee) while you stand by for a table - so... two minutes, two hours, what's the difference?The decor of the small restaurant has a tasteful, vintage hue. The menu isn't extensive, but everything on it seems to lean on the savory side: Oysters (with bacon), Spring Lamb, Garlic Fries, Shrimp and Grits, Pork Belly, Prosciutto Flatbread.The food is where a few stars fell off for me. I found the Pork Belly extremely salty, completely deafening any other ingredients that were in the dish. The Octopus appetizer we got was also overcooked and disjointed: A few fried chickpeas here and there, half a grape, some more octopus. On the other hand, the Prosciutto Flatbread, topped with thin slices of apple and goat cheese, is phenom.The waitstaff was also awesome; everyone seemed to be having a great time, a testament to their professionalism. All in all, we are rooting for the chef. It may have been the recent menu or our menu choices, but we are hoping the food will rock our world the next time we visit."
"Fantastic, small gem in Chicago's hip Wicker Park area. They don't take reservations, but you can put your name on a list and have them give you a ring when there's a table available. We didn't know it was BYOB until we were seated, but, not to worry, the waitress gave us a list of local wine shops that deliver (nice touch, Ruxbin). We called them up and within 15 minutes, we were savoring some delicious, inexpensive red wine recommended by our waitress (again, nice touch, Ruxbin--having a helpful, knowledgeable staff is key to any restaurants staff). Now on to the food: Amazing. While I fully agree with the comedian Louie CK when he says that the term ""amazing"" is overused, this is the first adjective that comes to mind when I think of the food at Ruxbin. My boyfriend and I shared the grilled octopus and we both had the pork loin. I remember some sort of dessert being served, but was so stuffed from the other two courses, I only had a bite (by then I was deep in a food coma, but, according to my boyfriend, I enjoyed the little sample of the dessert that I had). Next time I venture to Chitown, I will surely stop by Ruxbin--this time with a bottle in hand."
"Ok, the night I went here might have been the perfect storm of awesomeness, but either way, the food was extremely flavorful!Came here on the Friday before Christmas around 6:30. Prepared with a bottle of wine and a bar around the corner in mind anticipating an hour or more wait, we were surprisingly sat upon arrival.The tiny restaurant hung our coats at the coat rack by the entrance and showed us to our small two person table. The setup is great to maximize the small space and it didn't feel too cramped. The only negative thing I can really say about this place is that the waitress had a sort of rushed sense about her. As a former server, I know turning tables is important to having a successful money making night. However, this is a special place and it was a special occasion. It wasn't like we were making out over the table for an hour before placing our order. We had to decide our entire meal so that it can be placed and spaced out to accommodate for the small kitchen. After turning her away about five times in fifteen minutes, we were finally ready to order. Everything was delicious!!!Starter: Braised beef chili with fresh homemade cornbreadDinner: Duck Brest and Short RibsDesert: Fried Apple PieHoly cow, the food was amazing! Take someone here for a special evening. It is a great date place and is very romantic."
"3.5 UBER pretentious, but delicious. I had the Octopus, Hanger steak and corn pop panna cotta. I would recommend all of them, but beware, they get a little dramatic if you want to change anything about their dishes. The seating is also very tight (not great if you want a private conversation). Also the portions are TINY...I mean TINY. Be prepared to want a second dinner somewhere else."
"What a treat!Got a seat near the kitchen window. Enjoyed watching the chef prepare dishes at the pass. Eclectic atmosphere with down to earth service. The food is very good and the service is friendly, warm and engaging. The octopus app cannot be missed."
"The food varied from tasty to very tasty (to describe it quite simply) but there was nothing that we found at all ""exceptional."" Even after four dishes - octopus, pork and two others (between two of us) - we were still hungry. This could have led to dessert had anything been that impressive or had the table next to us had more a more favorable review of their dessert. Given the price point and the location (a bit out of the way for us over on Ashland), it was just not worth the trip. Our bill was hefty and that was even with BYOBing!Like certain other reviewers, we too, found the staff less than accommodating - a bit brusque in telling us how to place our order (all at one time), for example. Also, we'd arrived just after a downpour and were noticeably soaked. I appreciate the quirkiness of the restroom entrance, but honestly didn't get it at first. The line (kitchen window) is right next to it and one of the servers was pretty much a jerk about the fact that I didn't put two and two together on the first try. I think that when you have a novelty in the building and a guest doesn't figure it out right away - you shouldn't be snarky about it. The ambience overall of the restaurant is nice, if not a bit tight when it comes to seating - not a place to linger and enjoy a meal. I got the vibe that they (well, our server anyway) would rather cater to neighborhood locals and not deal with those who aren't acquainted with the place.  This is fine by me.(Also, just an aside - this is listed as ""steakhouse"" in Yelp category and I'm not sure that's accurate.)"
"I don't really want you to know about Ruxbin but when it's voted 5th Best New Restaurant by Bon Appetite.  I suppose the cat's already been let out of the bag...So We ordered...Apps - Apple & Plum, Calamari*, Entrees - 9 Spice Quinoa, Bucatini and Clams*, Pork Loin*, Sablefish*, Hangar Steak, and Amish ChickenAll of our dishes had just enough weight, heat and flavor.  We ate it family style so, we all sampled everything. I had the odd sensation of feeling like I was on the old Iron Chef.  Appreciating the plating, interesting twists on korean dishes like Buccatini (jjajjang myun).  All very well done but the Calamari, Buccatini, Pork Loin and the Sablefish were our favorites.  I normally don't like fusion but Ruxbin does it very well.  The entrees were well balanced in what they took as inspiration from korean cooking and had almost a nice comfort food quality to what was prepared.  Perfect for a cold night.No Bar. If you bring your wine, they will chill it for you while you wait. =)No RSVP's. Come with a large party and you may not be seated all together but our part of 6 were! Thank you! thank you!  The restaurant is terribly small but I appreciate how much thought went into the function of the restaurant and their yummy food.  Many Thanks Teddy! =)"
"Great food, lovely romantic space, perfect service and byob. All around an excellent experience. Appetizers- mushroom toast and octopus, the octopus left an impression.We had a pork loin and étouffée and grits. Both delicious but loved the étouffée.There is usually a wait but you can go across the street and have drink- they'll give you a call."
"Hmmm...I wish I had reviewed this place sooner after I went so I could more clearly remember the menu.  Came here for a birthday celebration and this place certainly delivered.  Everything we had was amazing, both in terms of taste and presentation, and the service was impeccable.  I think the prices were not cheap by any means, but definitely worth it for the quality of food you're getting.  Highly recommended!!!!"
"The food here is delicious, delectable and delightful. It is a little expensive but the fact that it is BYOB helps. The portions are small but it almost makes you enjoy it just a little bit more. Went with my boyfriend for a date night and the dim light and cute interior made our night a little more romantic."
"Because I believe in being brainwashed by the media, I've been looking forward to this place since I saw it featured on ""Check, pls.""  I must admit that I'm not a big fan of places that don't take reservations, let alone one for which I have to get in line.  But I must've been in a happy mood on Saturday when we decided to go to Ruxbin at the last minute for a double date with another couple.They open at 5:30 and we were there just a tad before.  It took about 20 minutes before we scored a lovely booth.  Service was prompt but impersonal- one doesn't need to be overly chatty but a nice, friendly attitude is always a good thing.  It's one thing to be a restaurant of the ""small plate"" concept, it's another to charge nearly $30 per dish for barely a couple of bites.  For starters, we had the octopus, the quail, beets, and garlic fries.  Winner of the first round were the fries! I so wanted it to be the quail but it simply lacked taste.  For our main entree, we ordered the hangar steak, the scallops, duck breast, and the pork loin.  We somehow felt compelled to share what we ordered with each other so after giving everyone a taste, there wasn't enough of our own dish to appreciate.  Dessert was so unforgettable, it's not even worth writing about.  Thank goodness for the BYO policy as after we finished the 2 bottles we brought, the hubbies went down the street to a liquor store that simply had no selection.  Alas, Ruxbin will go down as a nice to try experience but I'd have to think twice before lining up again!"
"Ruxbin is a fun, quarky, byob that's worth checking out. The first thing you notice about Ruxbin is the people, they are all beyond friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They make you feel welcome in a legitimate way.  The next thing you notice is the awesome ambiance. Cookbooks, and a weaved wood panel wall grab your attention indefinitely.  The bath room is a combination space ship and phone booth. Even if you don't have to go, you have to go to the bath room.  The fresh seasonal menu is constantly changing so you can come here weekly and try new stuff each time.  When I come  I tend to order everything on the menu with a group of four.  Its just the right amount of food and gives you a huge variety.  Everything is good, no specific recommendations here, if it sounds good to you, just try it.  Its reasonably priced and being a byob you can eat your fill, drink all you want and be out the door in under $100 for 2 people. This is a staple place you can and will enjoy regularly."
"I have come here many times in the last three years. This is the worse experience EVER. Ordered Octopus appetizer, small with fingernail sized bits of octopus. Entree order of Scallops' consists of two small scallops for $30.00. Hanger steak entree for companion was cold but on a hot plate-it had been sitting. Dessert [tastes of chocolate] sized for a baby not an adult-very disappointing. Either Ruxbin needs to really get its act together or close up shop. Terrible food for over $100.00 price tag=Big Rip Off."
"I normally wouldn't bother with a ""no reservations"" place, but decided to try it out based upon the rave reviews and BYOB policy.  Space is funky and has a cool vibe.  Beyond that, the star of the show - the food - was a bit off.  Nothing really bad, but nothing that stood out.  Flavors didn't always mesh. Oh, did I mention no reservations?  Meh.  Never again."
"I've been living in chicago for three years now, and this is by far the first place to blow me away. Small and intimate. Very good service and awesome layout with cool decorations. Food was out of this world. Not to mention its BYOB."
Not much food for the price. I took my husband here for his birthday and we were both still hungry when we left. Not a feel good. If you want a cute place with fun flavors this is for you. If you actually want dinner go somewhere else!
"Ruxbin surprised me. The food is both artistic and artisan. The dish size is small but the flavor is well worth the big ticket price. It is also my first taste of venison. I would prefer hangar steak to it, but it is juicy nevertheless.Remember it is BYOB! We forgot it to our own peril."
"We arrived early (5:30) with and without reservations. Obviously, the restaurant does not reserve tables, but I was more concerned that the menu would shun my vegetarianism, laugh at it in the face so to speak.  Well, let me say that I was pleasantly surprised by the non-carnivorous concoction I ordered; a delectable and interesting take on gnocchi, which required a special broth pouring ceremony. Sweet. I always appreciate broth pour action over pillows of potato loveliness. Since visiting, I've tracked the restaurant's seasonal, ever-changing menu and it appears that there is always at least one hearty vegetarian selection featured. File this in the ""good to know"" folder.The BYOB option was definitely a perk too because we were able to supply our own special bottle of wine for the occasion without the markup."
"Can't understand about the hype.I had so much expectation expecially because my ex-roommate, who knew a lot about the restaurant scene, totally recommended this place.  Went there with my wife and SIL.  We had a crab cake, pork and salad.  They were barely good, but nothing special at all.  And then the server barely cared about us either.  Really didn't help the case much."
"The food here was excellent.  The main course I ate was the duck, it was amazing.  The Garlic fries were very good as well, if you are eating with 4 people, 1 order is enough, however.  All of the appetizers are excellent as well.  Great date spot."
"Top-shelf and savory clam bake, tender peach pork roast, blissful dill Amish chicken tied together with possibly the best lychee panna cotta with toasted coconut shavings on this planet. And oh, don't forget the intriguing Korean style red chili pepper calamari and order that side of comforting garlic fries. Thank God for a perplexing Friday afterwork rush hour Chicago traffic experience along with a 5:30pm hail storm, because is mayhaps why we were able to stroll up to Ruxbin around 5:45pm and be immediately seated. Could have been the sous chef I talked to, stationed at the door with his clipboard and courteous smile... but the food is the real subject here. Ruxbin looks sorta like a smaller, kicked up Earwax cafe (booths) mixed with both Nightwood restaurant and Simone's bar, both in Pilsen.  Someone's definitely put their money and love into this tiny slice around Humboldt Park. The light fixtures look like old grade school desk seat bottoms styled in a Hollywood movie set spotlight and the single bathroom with swiveling door is an entertaining touch.. especially after a bit of nice wine.The service is attentive, quick and the food definitely justifies all of the praise Ruxbin's recently received, if you're into modern culinary types pushing the proverbial envelope.. and succeeding!"
"This would actually be a 3.5.  The flavors in the food were great; however, the portion sizes were lacking.  Eat a meal before you come here, or expect to spend some big money to actually feel full.  I also don't recommend the garlic fries - the oil started making me sick a quarter of the way in.  The full blast air conditioning at the back of my calves was also unpleasant.  Also - having a creepy poster staring at you in what seems like a dark-room-turned-toilet isn't the best bathroom experience."
"So disappointed, and really wish that I could write a stellar review.At 8 months pregnant, and perusing the menu before arriving, I did not think that I would have a problem with ordering something ""allowed"". Now, I totally understand, and respect, when the chef recommends/suggests a way that the meat should be cooked. However, the chef refuses to cook any of the entrees outside of his liking. I originally asked to order the steak, but was told that they would ONLY serve it medium-rare. Not even medium. Pregnant or not, I would not like to eat a steak medium-rare. I was then told that the lamb and fish is also only served medium-rare. This left the pork or the veal. I opted for the salad and the pork belly appetizer as my entree, neither of which were anything to write home about.The service left very little to be desired, as well. She was very rude and unhelpful, making us feel as if we were a nuisance to be sitting at her table.We did have the garlic fries, which were delicious. I'm pretty sure I could get good fries just about anywhere."
"This place was really unique and the bathroom is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time (once you check it out, you'll know what I mean).  Everything we ordered was great and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  Very small establishment and by the looks of it, you wouldn't think it's anything special until of course, your meal comes out.We had to wait a LONG time but I have to say, it was worth the wait.  Great place for a unique date-guys, you'll impress her that 1. you knew this place existed and 2. you're edgy and think outside the box."
"Walked in around 8:30pm and was greeted by a very friendly host who recommended we grab a bottle of wine at the Naked Grape around the corner while we waited for our table since they are BYOB. Once we got our table, we were greeted by our server, Grace, who is one of the best servers we've had in a long time. Her food recommendations, not only to us but to the table next to us, were spot on. I'd come back to Ruxbin just to have her as a server/to provide recommendations! She was so personable I wanted to offer her some wine to sit down and hang out with us. On top of the great service, the food was fantastic!! Every dish was perfectly executed with fabulous taste profiles. Ruxbin thank you for great food and great service!!!"
"Overall, I really liked Ruxbin.Pros:- 2 out of the 3 entrees ordered at our table were delicious (the scallops & the sea bass). The etouffee was just ok.- All 3 appetizers we ordered were great (apple plum salad, garlic fries & octopus)- We had great service and they were very tolerant with making a lot of changes to the menu to accommodate dietary restrictions- Best of all, it's BYOB!Cons:- It's very small & they don't take reservations, so it's a gamble. We went on a week night and only waited about 20 minutes. It definitely wouldn't be good for a group larger than 4."
"Having heard alot about Ruxbin I went with high hopes and was prepared to be blown away.  What we found was a cool, quirky restaurant that had delicious, inventive food but for some reason fell a little short of great.  We had many delicious, well prepared dishes, but for some reason nothing knocked my socks off in that ""oh my god, I must eat this again"" manner.First off, we sat at the communal table at the top of the stairs, which is an awesome experience, and provides several levels of entertainment throughout the meal.  The first is watching into the kitchen (which is remarkably small and is run like a well oiled machine to make sure all goes smoothly) and the second is watching confused diners attempt to figure out how the door to the restroom works.  Worth the price of admission.We started with Tuna, Beets, and Garlic Fries.  The fries were so good we got a second order.  Both other dishes were excellent - the ricotta, beets, anchovy, orange was a very nice plate of food.  I am a push over for all things beet (can you really ever eat enough Borscht?) and this was a good one.For main course we had Pork Loin and Duck Breast.  The one real standout moment for me in the meal was how absolutely perfectly the pork was cooked.  I've never had anything like it - perfectly pink, moist, tender, and flavorful.  Wow - I'm not sure how they did this, but it was a work of art. And the cream of wheat that went with it was pretty damn good too.  Duck was good and very nicely seasoned with outstanding greens to accompany it.I think Ruxbin is definitely capable of 5 stars.  I'm going to try and go back (the no reservation policy is, frankly, kind of a drag so I'm not sure when this will be) and see if I'm more wowed next time."
"Thank you, Ruxbin, for the wonderful evening on Sunday, Sept 1. Upon our arrival, my party of four was informed by a smiling individual that a table was ready for us. We were seated cozily adjacent to other diners but well out of range of any enthusiastic elbows or animated appendages. Our server tactfully explained the pacing of the food, highlighted the off-menu special, and described all of the DAILY SELECTION items.1st Course* Garlic Fries - great texture, delicious aioli* Octopus - wonderful flavors; my favorite dish of the evening2nd Course* Hanger Steak - exceptionally tender and flavorful; the (I think) miso on the green beans was really special* (2) Bourride - great, fresh seafood; perhaps it was the sake, but the broth had an extra tasty flavor* Branzino - I did not try this, but the consumer praised the dish's flavor and the moistness of the fish.3rd Course - sometime desserts can be lackluster or just not on par with the rest of the menu. That is not the case at Ruxbin, which has made sure that their two dessert options spectacular.* Panna Cotta - cool presentation; new flavors for a classic dish* PB & J  - I enjoyed putting the elements together in order to taste the most gourmet version of familiar sandwich.Lastly, I want to say that I appreciated the volume of the restaurant. Perhaps Ruxbin was blessed with appropriate acoustics or maybe their steam-punk decor had been placed in a way to control the noise well. Whatever it was, the small and completely packed dining room produced only a lively buzz that made it possible to talk to those across from you without any strain.Thank you for a great time. I will be back."
"Ruxbin is a perfect date night restaurant.  It's cozy and intimate with great service and outstanding food.  What more can you ask for?We arrived with our bottle of wine (Ruxbin is BYOB) around 8:45 on a Friday night.  Our table was ready so we sat down and started to peruse the menu.  So many mouth watering choices!  After we gave up on trying to decide we asked the server to decide for us.  Oh how I love letting the professionals make decisions for me.  She picked well.  I have no idea what we ate, but it was all delicious.  The entrees were some kind of fish that was very good and pork tenderloin?  They were wonderful.  The best part of the evening, well, the dinner...dessert.  Chocolate pot de creme topped with cotton candy, the perfect amount of bacon flavored saltiness, and tiny basil leaves.  Oh my that was heavenly.  As I said earlier, the service was fantastic.  We took more than our fair share of time trying to decide what to order and our server was nothing but kind and patient with us.  Her choices and knowledge of the menu were great.  The decor is entertaining yet not overwhelming.  Clearly a flair for the kitschy while feeling homey and welcoming.  It's a lot to look at and will keep your eyes entertained if they wander from the table."
"My only complaint is that you won't get to eat until 30 minutes after you arrive because the place is tiny and there is a lot of demand for the great food, service and atmosphere. Other than that, I can't think of a better place to go to when I want a fantastic dish. From appetizers, to main course and finally the dessert, the food is out of this world.For starters, I ordered the octopus while my girlfriend had the raw oyster special. We could have gone on and on forgetting the main course. Then we had the hangar steak that was well marinated and sooo tasty! Finally, we settled for the Rocky Road dessert which I would describe as ecstasy on the table.Another awesome thing is that it is BYOB so you get to enjoy yourself without worrying about the drinks and all for an experience you'll want to have again and again!"
"Every since I first heard the name, and knew nothing more about it, I've wanted to come. And now that so many others have paved the way, provided menu guidance and strategic recommendations for getting in, I've made it. To a place named after a Teddy Bear!Ruxbin is by far my favorite type of urban dining experience. The casual, intimate, and maybe a little funky environs, the sweetest staff, and fresh food with flavor dynamics which are definitely upscale; the easy view into the kitchen, the camaraderie amongst diners, who are squished closely together in that New York style. People gazing at each others choices, asking questions, everyone excited as if they are at a party.  That's what I told my friend Doug who took me here. It was like a party with great food and great people.We sampled the appetizers quite thouroughly. We ordered the octopus dish, the ""Crudo"" salmon tartare, and a plate of mixed snails and frog legs. The flavors of the first two danced on the tongue and melted in our mouths. The frog/snail combo we were not so excited about as the earthy sauce kind of upstaged the other elements of the dish. Doug got the trout which was served on a grain called ""spelt,"" which was similar to barley or quinoa. The crispy skin, the sweet fish meat and the grain and sauce made for an exquisite blend. I ordered (or knew I wanted at least) the hangar steak months before arriving.  6-7 ounces of mouth-watering slices of beef in an unforgettable sauce. Baby broccoli on the side. The high expectations I brought with me were met - hands-down. We shared two desserts: the pot-de-creme chocolat, delivered with specific instructions from our server on how to combine the creme, the chunk of cotton candy on top and the baby basil leaves for scintillating mouthful. The poached pear was just as exciting, and neither one lasted long as we played at taking bites of each, and trying to leave the last spoonful for each other. Sheer gluttony over took politeness, though, in the end.A happy man am I, that I made it to Ruxbin. See what you can do with excellent ingredients, a creative touch with a small room (and of course we can't forget the Star Trek-ish bathroom solution either), a well-trained and enthusiastic yet unpretentious staff, and  superb cooks in the kitchen. The party continues and the hungry populace lines up everyday for Ruxbin. As it should be. Now and forever. Amen."
Apparently I was wrong (said the briefest YELP review ever).
"You know that question, ""If you went to dinner with four historical figures, who would they be?"" I don't have the answer to that, but I know that we'd dine here."
"One of GQ's AND Bon Appetit's Ten Best New Restaurants in America?  Don't mind if I do!Like Girl & the Goat, Ruxbin turned out to be a meal worth starving pretty much all day for.  I made my way in around opening time and I couldn't have found a better place to celebrate the completion of Step 2 CS.  I began the meal with the Octopus that was mind-blowingly delicious!  The perfect char combined with the braised, tender meat within was simply unreal.  Elevate this even further with the black soybean smear, grapes and ginger-scallion vinaigrette and you have one crazy amalgam of flavors.Beef & Broccoli, one of Ruxbin's signature dishes that's been around since Day 1, was scrumptious as well.  Though the name conjures up images of the go-to Americanized Chinese dish often laden with corn starch and MSG, the dish itself comes no where close.  The hangar steak was cooked to a lovely rare and provided one fantastic bite after another, accented by fresh broccolini and tasty rice tots with miso butter.  The meal concluded with the Chocolate Pot de Crème, a most unique and awesome dessert.  I never knew what savory cotton candy tasted like until now and it works surprisingly well!  As for the chocolate itself, it was like eating spoonfuls of the filling in Lindt truffles...sooo good!A wonderful meal worthy of the many accolades Chef Edward Kim's received thus far despite his restaurant still being so new.  I suppose that's what happens when you work under Thomas Keller ;)"
The family that own's  this place are Hip Cat Koreans!  Eddie the chef will modify your dish to your personal taste.   Fantastic food and the space is a feast for the eye.  Just be sure and go to the rest room since that is a trip to another time space adventure IF you can figure how to enter it.......yup.  The door is not a door......curious ?  I was......
"I'm done with the pretentious ""philosophy"" of a restaurant that preps their food only the way the chef desires. I've been eating for myself for over 30 years now. I understand that a restaurant may recommend how you should have your food prepared and maybe even discourage not ordering any other way than the way they have it planned. Well, I have hit a first where the chef refuses to prep my order any other way than medium rare.I have been to restaurants that can't guarantee the quality if I want medium/ medium well and places that tell you they won't exchange your order if it isn't done right when you steer clear of their prep style.Ruxbin has been the first place to refuse to prep beyond medium rare. Sorry, but my ma stopped telling me how to eat years ago.  I don't need some arrogant oaf telling me he has a ""philosophy"" when he comes out to the table after we have eaten.I ended up  having an appetizer that was good and would have left if it weren't for the fact that I was with a group. I will say, going to Smoke Daddy later hit the spot..."
"This is a restaurant that has the attribites of an egp maniac.  It session ask if.they believe their own pr  on valentine day, of stood in line for.dimner. On the front of the restaurant there wasonly the usual notice of hours.  NOthing else. I knocked on the door after 530 and a lady came out and told me that they were taking reservations for Friday.  there was no signs on the door about reservations required for Friday zero. an Asian lady came to the door and she told me that it was reservations only for tonight I told her I asked her why was there no sign on the front door she just said sorry. then she said but we have it on the website I said no you don't because I look. I went to my car and looked on the website. on the homepage there is no mention about reservations being required for Friday and that they would not accept people for regular walking service. on the sidebar of the website there is no taste about Valentine's Day but its on the sidebar not on the homepage. I called Ruxpin and I spoke to the person that takes the reservation I told her about what happened she said we have notifications on the website and I said no you don't matter on the homepage she did her hung up on me. this is a restaurant that needs to be put out of business they are rude and professional egotistical and that are interested interested in the customer. this is a restaurant that need to be put out of business. this restaurant does nothing for the Chicago food scene stay away."
"Service was great, food was great, noise level was....great......why can't restaurant designers better address this problem? Couldn't hear the servers, couldn't hear my friend, my friend couldn't hear me, even when leaning in.......when there was a pause in the racket, it was clearly noticeable, where I could actually say to my friend without shouting, ""wow, listen to that (lack of deafening noise).""  It was a great restaurant in all other aspects, but my ears can't take that stress again, and for that reason probably won't go back. PS. This noise problem is all too common in restaurants, so it's not just Ruxbin. Bottom line: love love love the food, love love love the service, hate being forced to shout to have a conversation with someone 2 feet away."
"Just fantastic!  I had read many Yelp reviews before eating at Ruxbin last night, and I couldn't agree more.  Everything from Ruxbin's charming BYOB atmosphere to their friendly service to the absolutely delicious food combined for a wonderful experience.Just to echo everyone else - this restaurant does not take reservations.  But Ruxbin manages to do this in a way that is still accommodating and also adds to your overall experience.  We had a party of 5 last night, so our wait was longer than a smaller group would be.  My friend went early and put in our name around 6:15 and they told him our table would be ready around 7:45.  The rest of us met up a little after 7:00 and we drank a couple bottles of wine in the ""loft area"" near the kitchen while we waited.  We were seated exactly at 7:45 and the waitress explained that it's best to order all items at the same time, as many entrees can take longer to prepare and it helps the chef plan our meal.  They have a revolving menu that always includes 6 entrees - one of which is vegetarian and one of which is purely seafood.We started with the grilled octopus, flatbread, and quail as appetizers.  The octopus was absolutely phenomenal - the perfect blend of that charred flavor without overpowering the whole dish.  The combination of grapes and thinly sliced radish completed this as one of my favorite flavors of the night.  The quail was an excellent combination with the watermelon and tomato garnish.  I didn't try the flatbread, but the rest of the table found it quite tasty as well.I went with the arctic char for my entree and it was served on top of a yukon gold potato blend in a vegetable broth.  The fish was absolutely amazing - cooked to perfection, moist and flavorful, with a wonderfully seasoned crispy skin topped with greek yogurt.  The blend was so flavorful and added to the experience that I ditched my fork and knife and ended up eating the dish with my spoon, just so I could enjoy everything together.  My friends enjoyed all of their meals - the pork loin was quite possibly the most perfectly cooked tenderloin ever, the hangar steak (beef and broccoli) was prepared medium rare and delicious, and the duck breast was tender and flavored amazingly.We finished with both the pretzel donut dessert in beer-milk sorbet and their berry shortcake.  I'm not even a dessert person but I couldn't stop eating bites of that amazing donut.The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and welcoming.  I had a nice chat with the chefs while waiting for the restroom and they also were welcoming and truly appreciated my comments about their food.Ruxbin is the one place in Chicago where you can truly enjoy a first class meal, with a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel casual and welcome, and leave with a bill under $50 per person because you can bring your own alcohol.  By far one of my favorite culinary experiences in this city and with all the amazing restaurants Chicago has to offer, this is no small feat."
It was good. not great.  we ordered the lamb saddle for two. it was cooked perfectly but it didn't blow my mind by any means.I thought the popcorn was gimick-ey and out of place.  cramped space. small.
"Hand down one of the best meals I've had in 2014.  I've been working my way through the recent Eater 38 list and hit up Ruxbin for a Friday night dinner date with my husband.  The food and the experience was outstanding from start to finish. The ambiance is unassuming and intimate and quirky, hostesses and servers were attentive and knowledgeable.  Food... was amazing.  We started with the pork belly and the beet and labne.  Pork Belly was fantastic, not too fatty or too crispy, just perfect.  We followed our starters with the Nigerian Prawns and Duck Breast.   Both were exquisite.  The duck breast was incredibly tender and the prawns and all the fixings were glorious - literally wanted to lick my plate.  It doesn't hurt that Ruxbin is BYOB.. keeping our lovely meal very affordable.    We will absolutely be back... and heading to the partner restaurant Mott St. very soon!   Well done Ruxbin, well done."
"What started as an undiscovered small seat, no reservation BYO spot quickly transformed into a city hot spot that requires a little effort to secure a seat (still no reservations, still BYO). Both GQ and Bon Appetite named Ruxbin to Top Ten Best Restaurant lists nation wide as well as numerous local awards - adding fuel to an already burning hot fire. We first went to Ruxbin in October of 2010 when you could still walk in at a reasonable hour and grab a table. It was a great experience with quality food and a fun trip to the #1 bathroom in Chicago - so we needed to return and see if things had changed. To get a coveted table for four on a Friday night Erica put our names down when the doors opened (and they were kind to let us wait for the second seating and not eat at 5:30). They called us back to give us a ten minute warning and everything worked out great. We can prepared with two bottles for the four of us but definitely wished there was one more glass each. The space is well documented for the creative use of random materials - some sourced at Salvage One. It's eclectic and funky but it works because the space is so small and comforting. The menu is modern american without anything crazy or funky. It also helps that every table starts with tasty popcorn to get the palate ready. There are only six starters and six entrees, but the variety is great and ensures something for everyone. We started with Calamari (Chicken & Pork Forcemeat, Potato Confit, Korean Chili, Peanuts, Pickled Fennel, Pea Tendrils) and Garlic Fries (House Cut French Fries with Chipotle Aioli) for the table and each pair ordered the soup special (cauliflower cream I believe). The soup was nice, and perfect for our chilly spring evening. The french fries were underwhelming and a little disappointing, and the calamari was different and had a little too much going on for my preference. Lots of flavor but a little confusing and loses the natural calamari flavor.If the appetizers were only ok the main courses made up for it. The table ordered the following - Pork Loin (Sweet Potato Gnocchi, Brown Butter Emulsion, Kale, Kalamata Olives, Cranberry, Sage, $25), Sablefish (Maple & Soy with Hull-less Barley, Pickled Vegetables and Black Tea Broth, $30) and Hanger Steak (Wrinkled Long Beans, Candied Bacon, Chimichurri, Creme Fraiche, Heirloom Potatoes, $25). Erica's steak was delicious and well worth every dollar, very good and a generous portion. Jen and I went with the Sablefish and both agreed it was a very nice dish. The flavors are more subtle, which compliments the smooth and ""butter"" fish. Russ went with the pork loin and considering there was nothing left on the plate I assume it went well. We awarded 4.5 stars for our first meal but 4 stars is more accurate this time around. I love the vibe and decor but getting a table is a challenge. Our entrees were fantastic (get the steak) and worthy of very high praise but we were disappointed with the starters (I always want better main dishes than starters). Our bill ($95 all in for two) was surprisingly high without any booze (love the BYO policy) and no dessert (we went to Hot Chocolate instead) . It all balances out to a high quality place for dinner that is among the most interesting choices in town. The main courses (and bathroom) are worth the excursion but repeat visits are challenging to execute. I can't wait for the next outpost with more seats and reservations."
"I'm so glad that my friend and I sucked it up and ate blue-hair style at Ruxbin last night.  We arrived at 5:10 with the hopes of getting a table and were lucky - though barely - as when the doors opened at 5:30, we were seated at the last two-top for the 5:30 seating!  Based on the number of people in line behind us, I wouldn't be surprised if the tables for the entire evening were alloted by 6pm.  In fact, we had tried eating at Ruxbin a month or so ago, and when we arrived at 6:15, we were told that they weren't taking any more names for the night.  So, ARRIVE EARLY...it's worth it.We split the mushroom toast and calamari starters, the chicken and hangar steak entrées, the chocolate pot de creme dessert, and two bottles of wine.  All were delicious though my favorites were the mushroom toast and chicken.  That's saying a lot as I'm not usually a chicken fan but ordered it based on the other Yelp reviews.  It was so moist, and the gouda accompaniment was amazing.  The restaurant is a cramped - it seats less than 40 people in tight quarters.  Be sure to visit the Jetson's bathroom and peak into the kitchen on the way.  The meal was nicely paced and the service unassuming.  They did ask us to vacate our table immediately after we paid, but given the demand, I don't fault them.Definitely grab a bottle or two of wine and head to Ruxbin, arguably the best BYOB in the city!"
"This is quite possibly the best dining experience I've had in Chicago! Ruxbin is at least on par with Publican in terms of food quality, but with a much quieter, more intimate appeal. We went on a cold, snowy Friday night right when they opened, so our wait was pretty short, but if I were to return, I'd most likely make reservations for a Sunday unless it's summer and I don't mind hanging out and opening a bottle of wine. The food was amazing! The duck in particular was fabulous."
The service was great just like the expertly crafted food.The place is small but it leads to it's intimacy. We were able to get a table immediately as it was a Thursday night at 7.
"I went with a party of four last night. We arrived around 7:45 and were told there would be a 45 minute wait, but that we were welcome to wait at their communal table, so we did. They popped open our first bottle, brought us some stemless wine glasses, and we got cozy with the group already seated up there. As it turned out, they were ready for us within more like 30 minutes (though I'll admit time does fly with good company and wine).FOOD: They start you off with popcorn. YUM and really a fun twist on the bread-as-carbs-before-dinner thing. Kind of wish they gave more. GARLIC FRIES WERE SO GOOD. Between the 4 of us we devoured two bowls. I had the hanger steak and it was flavorful and DELICIOUS. So good. Two others had the shrimp and grits (looked good, she ate it all) and the pork loin. Everything was yummy. That said, while it was all delicious, it wasn't quite worth what we paid for it. I just don't think 8 bites of hanger steak is worth 28 bucks. It seems like they're compensating for not making money off of alcohol by over pricing all of their food.PRICE: I'm not really sure why Yelpers have put this at ""$$"" when it should really, IMHO, be ""$$$."" To me, one dollar sign means cheap as f*ck, maybe 8-12 a plate. Two dollar signs means in the 15-25 range. But, when each entree is 25-30 (not including any appetizers, mind you), I think it really ought to be ""$$$."" No big deal... just a nit picky thing I noticed.BATHROOMS: CRAP! I didn't try them. But I've read awesome things and it does look cool from the outside. It's like a spinning metal door. Looks like you're going down into a submarine.Why isn't it 5 stars? I don't know. It's just not. A few things...-It's VERY small. There is not a lot of room to move around and wait for your table. -Kind of overpriced. The food is delicious, yes, but like I said, I think they're compensating for not being able to make money off of alcohol by making their food expensive."
Another instance where I'd love a half star as this is 4.5 for sure. The creative oyster appetizer was my wife's favorite oysters ever and I just loved the presentation. My pork tenderloin was so juicy and soft and enjoyable. The pork belly with cornbread was good too. Only negative was the portion size being a bit small. The bathroom was even cool.
"Five stars are under statements. I picked the place for a farewell dinner with a friend on a 6m oversea assignment. Considering he will miss Chicago, I might as well add some more pieces things to miss. Ruxbin certainly lived up to that expectation. I am still trying to find the right word to articulate their unique decor from table, chair to light and ceiling. The place is a life art museum. We shared the octopus as appetizer. The umami black beans sauce along with mix greens just brought out the perfect grill flavor. Beyond flavor, the perfect pattern created with the sauce is like ancient Chinese brush stroke in a water paint.2 of us shared the special of the day - lamb. It was amazingly delicious. Tender inside, crispy outside. If one is a wondering how a senatorial journey is like, this dish topped it.And you are planning a next trip, don't forget that it is BYOB. In 5 min of walking distance, you can find quite a few wine store. My favorite is Lush."
"Maybe it was because I went in here with such high expectations but I was pretty underwhelmed. We had the pork belly (a little fatty and luke warm) and octupus (pretty good) for apps. For the main course we had the scallops and venison. They were good but not great or anything I would rave about. For dessert we had the peanut butter and jelly which was just weird. As many other people have mentioned, the portions are small. We had a reservation but I definitely wouldn't advise waiting an hour place."
"I live right by this place so me and a couple of friends wanted to check it out.  I had read several other Yelp reviews recommending getting there early, so my friends headed there around 6:00pm since I was running late from work.  They said it was empty, so they went to Noble Grape to get some wine (Yay BYOB).  When I arrived at 6:30pm, all the tables were packed which surprised me but I was starving and just wanted to get my grub on.Garlic fries- awesomeePork loin- tasty and sooo tenderHangar Steak- great and already cut for youOverall the dishes were very good, albeit a little small.  Would definitely go back again.  Also, since this place is new, they were a little busy so after we had paid our check they asked us to leave (nicely) since other people were waiting, so if you want to sit and chat for a long time don't come here."
"I literally just got home from this restaurant, and not only am I happily intoxicated, but I was SO satisfied with my meal.  First off, it's byob, so it gets at least 3 stars to begin with.  Next, instead of the boring old break basket, you get POPCORN. Yummy popcorn with some kind of furikake (seaweed) seasoning. YUM.My date and I both got the oysters for appetizers, and they were delish, but then again... we loooove oysters. Like, LOVE oysters. FYI, if you get to try the oysters, and it has the one that is being ""lightly smoked"" whilst you eat the first two, do not lift up the cup and inhale deeply into the cup. Unless, of course, you like the taste of camp fire.We also got the pork belly (when is pork belly not good?!?), the steak (perfectly done), and the shrimp and grits (the sauce is a little salty, but also so complex in it's flavors).  And despite being full up to our necks, we ordered both desserts because when someone says ""rocky road, caramel, fluff, something, something"" and ""pineapple, coconut, something, cumin, something"" you do not refuse.  We literally inhaled the chocolate dessert in less than 15 seconds.  It was that good.  And the pineapple dish with the cumin... cumin, in a dessert... CUMIN.  Totally changed my life (in a good way).It's a small (very small), intimate place with great service.  The ambiance is great, the background music is not too loud.  Just go.  I'm not entirely sure if this review is cohesive/coherent, but you should go.  Just make a reservation and go."
"I hope more restaurants like Ruxbin is what we can expect of Noble Square in the next couple of years. Love this tiny little space tucked into a random corner on Ashland. The menu is inspired and the atmosphere is romantic, but also steampunk cool. Came here with a lady friend and a bottle of red, and there was a 30 or so minute wait on a Thursday night. That breezed by though, because we sat down in the waiting area and a handsome waiter poured us glasses of wine. The meal itself was great, we carb-loaded and ordered both the goat cheese & prosciutto flatbread and garlic fries to start. The flat bread was flavorful and the toppings to carb ratio was skewed perfectly. The garlic fries were good, but still just french fries. Then we split the perfectly cooked hanger steak, served with some greens and potatoes. So good. Lastly, an important tip is not to leave without trying the Rocky Road. It involves ice cream, but it's more than that."
"Tell me when you hear the name of this new, tasty, West Town hot spot you don't immediately think of this 'lil guy: wowshopper.com/education… Uh Huh. It's impossible not to. While there are positively zero similarities to be found between my favorite childhood talking toy and this charming, hip spot serving up American-Korean-French hybrid fare, I still adore them both, so cheers to that! Hit up Ruxbin early Friday night with a group of 6 starving - and fabulous - food enthusiasts. Lemme tell ya, the choice to venture out ahead of our traditional late night dining schedule was a wise one! With no reservations being accepted and Ruxbin at capacity when all 10 of their tables are filled, it makes things a wee bit ruthless in the seating department. This place is teeny tiny and uberpopular at the moment, so yeah, you've been warned: get in early or prepare to wait. And wait. And wait. Waiting, at least, can be pleasure with the BYOB factor involved... pop a bottle of something lovely, explore the super odd - but also oddly exhilarating - dark room revolving bathroom and endless fun can be had. Ahhh, the simple pleasures! By the time the 'new shiny object' rush wears thin, hopefully you'll find yourself at a table in the charismatic and cozy dining room beneath bronzed vintage studio lights and a recipe clad ceiling. Delightful! Here's where you admire Ruxbin's alluringly simple and fresh menu and begin to dabble in delicious bites like Oaxaca Cheese and Chimichurri Crème Fraîche Empanadas, Apple and Plum Arugula Salad, and Fennel Seed Gastrique Hangar Steak. Mmmm. Drool. My personal standout favorites, however, were most definitely the insanely perfect starter of Crispy Eggplant with Roasted Beets, Cucumber and Honey-Cardamon Yogurt followed by the extraordinarily crispy Pan Seared Trout. The eggplant app was crunchy, earthy and robust with just the *right touch* of tangy sweetness to start a unquestionably fantastic party in my mouth, while the flawlessly browned, fork tender trout came with a surprising smattering of gorgeous, sugary dates that give this dish a unique, well thought out edge. Bravo! Of the two desserts, the Panna Cotta with lychee and toasty coconut was by far the darling of our table and was devoured before we could even say ""scrumptious!"" The only minor hiccup worth noting actually, was in the service... our server, if anything, seemed a bit indifferent to our group (which was fine) until, of course, she had to ask us to vacate our table. We had just paid our bill and were finishing the last glasses of our wine as the slightly discourteous request was made. I get it, the restaurant is small and people are waiting... but hey, we just tried one of everything on your menu, left a nice tip and don't need to feel rushed out like the in-laws. This is a delicate situation and I hope they find a better way to handle it in the future - ahem, reservations! Clearly it didn't sour my time enough to quell a total gushfest and recommend my buddy, Ruxbin (not Teddy), to you. Will certainly be back, just waiting to ride out this phenomenal Panna Cotta afterglow. Yum."
"Let me start by stating that I had very high hopes for Ruxbin and have been wanting to go for a long time.We went here last night (a Saturday) expecting a long wait.  We arrived and got our name on the list on the list and were told about an hour and that we'd receive a call about 10 minutes before our table was ready.  We went to a nearby bar to wait our call, but decided to head back to Ruxbin after about 45 min had passed.  We were seated with no wait upon returning which I found a little strange since they never called but had quite a few tables available.  Additionally, we left a couple of bottles of champagne at the restaurant to chill while we waited.  Upon being seated we were served our champagne which come to find out had just been sitting out while we were waiting instead of being chilled as we were told. So not the best start to the meal, but no big deal. We wanted to enjoy our meal.  We requested that our bottle at least be put on ice but after about 10 min had passed and asking our waitress twice we were given a bucket with few pieces of ice and mostly cold water. We asked that our other bottle at least be put on ice until we wanted it.  Turns out they don't have a freezer so it was put into a bucket with cold water and ice (it worked though!).We ordered the octopus as an appetizer, pork chop, and duck breast.  The appetizer had great flavor but was served lukewarm.  Our entrees were pretty good.  The pork chop and duck were cooked to perfection and were good portions.  We decided to have the panna cotta for dessert.  I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert - maybe I didn't appreciate the combination of flavors but my husband loved it.Overall, our experience was underwhelming.  I had high hopes after reading wonderful reviews and hearing great things from friends.  I was disappointed with the service - specifically with the champagne.  Our waitress was inattentive and slow. The food was pretty good but nothing to write home about.  I did like the ambience and was surprised by the bathroom door (you gotta see it). Maybe we went on an off night, but not sure I would return."
"Stop reading, you're wasting critical time that you could be in line for Ruxbin!You make me so happy, Ruxbin.  Try as much as you can because you don't know if you'll see the dish again!  I love seasonal menus, btw.  I adored every dish here.  Check out ""Twin B"" for the deets."
"Let's throwback to a hs, multiple choice exam here:Which of the following describes Ruxbin:a) drool-worthyb) 1hr and 20 min wait-worthy, c)  let's treat ourselves to a semi-pricey meal-worthy.d) all of the aboveAnswer?  Clearly, all of the above.  And, like I've said before, I'm usually skeptical of anything 'fusion'.  Ruxin, however, is a lovely exception.My friend and I came here early-ish on a Saturday, but, by the time we got there, the wait was already 1 hour and 20 minutes.  We headed off to wait at Five Star and the friendly hostesses let us know that they'd call us when they were ready for us.  After only about 30 min, our table was ready!  Great surprise as I was already starving.  Ruxbin is cozy and dimly lit.  Given the space and size, I'd say a group of four is probably the most optimal sized group. Oh yes, and BYOB with a $5 corkage.  Anyway, everything on the menu sounded great, but I somehow decided on the mussels and HAD to try the K-Town empanadas.  I mean, kimchee in empanadas?  Yes, please.  My friend wanted to order the trout and we made a last minute decision to also get the avocado toast 'cuz of all the rave reviews on Yelp.Hands down, that avocado toast was probably my favorite item.  Think bruschetta style, but with anchovies, feta.  Ahhh, amazing!  The empanadas also got a thumbs up from us.The mussels were delicious and a huge portion, too!  The garlic aioli was fabulous and almost addicting.  As for my friend and his trout, he was so in love with his meal that he wanted to 'lick his plate' (which he actually shamelessly told the waitress).  Yessir, the food was that delicious.  And, even though we were both stuffed, we had to try dessert.  Both desserts were awesome, but if you know me, you'd know that I have an affinity towards the lychee/coconut panna cotta.  And, as already mentioned, no reservations taken, so be prepared to wait.  But, I promise...it's worth it!"
"Ohhhhh Shoot; not only did this place go down as top 5 foodwise for me, it also happened to be another lovely meal I shared with my bffl Sunil D.  He mentioned the no reservation policy, and after reading numerous yelp reviews, we planned to get there at 5:30, only traffic made that actually 6.Street parking is plentiful and I had no trouble getting a spot a block away.  Luckily for us, there was one table still available at 6 so we got sat right away.First impressions:  -The bathroom is like the freaking phantom tollbooth.  I needed our server to help me figure out how to get in it.  So whimsical and really cool.  -Very flattering lighting!! As a woman with occasionally unruly skin, this is huge for me.-Very intimate seating.  I believe this place seats 32 or 36, so you may hear your neighbors conversation, but fortunately for Sunil and I, we did not overhear anyone, either because they were quiet or we were too focused on the food.What we Split--and it was divided evenly bc we are the perfect food sharers.  Except when it comes to brunch bc this fool will never split a savory and a sweet dish with me.  Jerk.-Endive Caesar: BEST CAESAR OF MY LIFE. WITHOUT A DOUBT.  There were pickles, egg, WHITE ANCHOVIES, lemony goodness. OMG. I still dont thnk im over it.-Mushroom Brioche toast: Stellar.-Calamari:  Wow. It was citrusy and great.Mains: Bucatini and Clams and the Amish Chicken. the chicken was the best ive had. the bucatini and sausage were awesome.Dessert: chocolate pot was rich and came w/cotton candy and the fried pear tart had gorgonzola ice cream that was SO phenomenal.  Just recounting the meal makes me want to go back.  A+, Ruxbin!"
"We had a lovely meal at Ruxbin on 10/10.  Staff was gracious and our server was terrific.  We started with the pork belly appetizer and it was amazing - tender, flavorful pork with jicama, citrus, blue cheese and cornbread.  It hit all the right notes.  For entrees we had the scallops and the sea bass.  Both dishes were lovely to look at and extremely delicious - clean, strong flavors.  For dessert we had the chocolate quartet and the bread pudding.  We devoured both.  The only reason I didn't give Ruxbin 5 stars is the corkage fee.  Would definitely return."
"It's been a while since I've been so inspired to write a review by a single meal, and Ruxbin definitely delivered the swift kick in the pants I needed to surmount my writer's block tonight.First off, decor is a total conversation piece. This little restaurant is filled with so much cheerful whimsy and smooth comfort. I was immediately put at ease by the soft lighting and the cookbooks on the walls (not to mention the pages on the ceiling!). The food itself was transcendent. While my companion and I munched on our seaweed dusted popcorn and sipped our apple cider dry sodas ($4), we ruminated over how excited we were to try the cauliflower soup of the day ($7) with fried pickles, golden raisins and charred endive and the pork belly salad ($12) with cornbread, jicama, grapefruit and hints of blue cheese. Both were a pleasant balance of rich yet subtle flavors.The entrees were incredible. We had the clams with bucatini ($21), which was cooked perfectly al dente in black soybean/white wine sauce. The dish, a riff of ja jang mian, had some delicious lap cheong sausage that my friend thought was bacon. We also split the hanger steak ($25) with wrinkled long beans and roasted heirloom potatoes that were drizzled in these chimichurri and creme fraiche sauces so delicious I wanted to lick the plate. I did the polite version of this by cutting my food into tiny pieces and smothering them in sauce. Had we been given bread instead of popcorn, you can bet I would have dunked my bread in that sauce. Also, the steak was cooked so tender each bite made my smile wider and wider. The piece de resistance? A pot de creme of chocolate, BACON COTTON CANDY and hazelnuts ($8) that even I, with a weak sweet tooth, couldn't help but scrape the sides of. Believe it or not, after all this, I didn't even feel uncomfortably full. Overall, it was a pretty memorable meal. I was surprised to see a line at the door at 5 (when the kitchen doesn't open until 5:30), but now having eaten a dinner there, I understand completely. Kudos, Ruxbin. I'll try to get in again sometime soon."
Been here.
"Cookbook pages ripped outand pasted overhead, wallpaperof knowledge and expertise.Checking account said, ""don't eat out."" I said,get lost, checking account.Tawdry Schlitz accompanied usand doublets dribbled fancy wine.Desk chairs, providers of lumens.Split two mains and an app twixt three.Hanger steak of cow plate, salmon fromfrigid waters, orchards-mixed-garden-greens.Sauce medleys peacefully rested on potato beds,capers and fish lolled about dandily, crispbounties rejuvenated our systems.Every last exorbitant drop lapped up to linger only briefly. Appetence taunted,wallets in the throes of overdraft."
"Friends of mine have said they've had an 'on' or 'off' dinner at Ruxbin, for my birthday dinner it was definitely 'on'.  The interior is cozy and hipster, staff is unpretentious.  We started with the pork belly and octopus.  Both had completely different flavors but were so complex in flavors.  The octopus was cooked perfectly and is a MUST HAVE.  For dinner we had the flank steak and the lamb.  Again, both had completely different flavors but both were amazing! Great portion sizes as well.  We ended the night with the panna cotta which was unbelievably good.  One of, if not my best, meals in Chicago."
"Good but other places are better for then priceSmall portions for the price, but Byob is always a positive"
"My husband and I stopped by for dinner last night, around 6pm.  We were able to be seated right away, which was awesome for a Friday night.  When we walked in, only about half the tables were full.We didn't BYO, which was actually great because we got to try the Apple Spice soda.  If you like apple pie and soda, this is the best drink combo ever.  We ordered 3 glasses throughout the meal.Appetizers:(1) Octopus - perfectly cooked, not too chewy, in a umami black bean sauce.  Topped with thin slices of radish and microgreens. Really tasty.(2) Pork belly - my husband's favorite dish of the night.  It definitely had that 8-hour cooked taste.  So tender!(3) Roasted tomato soup - amazing; my personal favorite of the night.  Every time I attempt to make this, it's too sour.  Don't know how they do it, but they do it right.  Perfectly complemented with grilled cheese (pain perdu?) dippers that were delightfully crunchy and gooey.Entrees:(1) Duck - my husband loved it, perfect medium rare, delicious sauce(2) Tomato and eggplant tartine - the mushrooms were my favorite part.  Impeccably seasoned and cooked.  I'm not a vegetarian, but would be if all my meals tasted like that.Dessert:Upside down pineapple cake - a deconstructed version with fresh and grilled pineapple. There was a crunchy thing that you 'break' and mix all around with the coconut sorbet.  We shared it - a fantastic ending to an even more fabulous meal.Will definitely be returning for more!"
"Took my husband here for a surprise foodie birthday dinner and enjoyed every minute - even the 1 hour wait!Arrived ~4:15pm to stand in line for the 5:30opening. Surprised not to be the first people. Tip: Wear warm clothes if you want to wait for the first seating.Everything on the menu impressed us: amazing grilled octopus, savory flatbread, perfectly dressed salad, pork loin, duck and even dessert! Love the BYOB policy and enjoyed bringing our own special wine for a memorable birthday meal. Prices are very reasonable (less than $50 per person) for a very high quality and special meal.Despite the busy atmosphere we did not feel crowded or rushed. Hipster decor was cozy and interesting. A little out of the way for us but worth the trip for sure!"
"Early bird catches the worm...Man, I knew that was true, but it's most definitely true for Ruxbin. Go early, or you will wait. OR, eat a little bit and wait two hours. By the time you get a table, you'll be hungry again.So we waited...and waited...and waited. But while we waited, we found a number of liquor stores, some of which were super upscale [the neighborhood is very eclectic]. Wound up picking up a bottle of wine [Ruxbin is BYOB in case you didn't read the other 200+ reviews] that we thought would go with our soon-to-be meal.*ring ring ring*Me: Harrrrrrro?Ruxbin: Hi this is ________ from Ruxbin. We're setting up your table. You can come into the restaurant in a few minutes.Me: Cool, thanks. We'll be a couple minutes. We're down the block and will be there shortly.Ruxbin: Sounds good.Me: Kthanksbye.Yeah...when they say rustic, they mean rustic. It's such a quaint little place. And as we were seated, I completely understand why it takes 2 hours for a table. But waiting aside, let's get down to business.Teddy Ruxbin serves up some amazing food. We started out with the Calamari and Garlic Fries. Yowzas, both were exquisite. But let me say the fries were fiyah. Really good garlicky flavor. Really good chipotle aioli. Really good. Period.Onto the entrees. Pork loin, Amish chicken, Hanger steak. Ughhhhhhhhhhh. I'm reliving this extraordinary experience. Every single bite..phenomenal. There isn't a single thing I would change about anything. I honestly can't wait to go back. But, I might take my own advice and head out there early...On a final note...go to the bathroom. It's fun!"
Fantastic food. Everything on the menu is delicious.  You can't go wrong here unless you have a big group as I am pretty sure that they don't seat parties greater than four.
"Line is long, but you would be a moron not to wait.The food is phenomenal.  Look through my Yelp Reviews and you will find that I've been much gone up and down the culinary ladder, scouring the world in each of the 34 countries I've visited to find food like this.  The food is flavorful without being overpowering, and the blend of cuisines from Asia to Latin America makes this rustic joint the perfect place to go for a first date, a birthday get together, an anniversary, or a night out with the friends.Their staff is beyond fantastic and if you like to pee in cool places, make sure you drink a lot (no drinking and driving) as its BYOB and go upstairs to transport yourself into the bathroom.  But please, if you finish your meals, don't meander forever - there is usually someone waiting to be seated - me!"
"Definitely a cute date spot.  And girl date spot.  And, well, everything spot!  I dined early style with my girlie friend and were seated promptly.  We didn't byob because my friend is expecting (awww--yay!)  But we did decide to try out their homemade soda.  It was celery flavored (huh??) so we were intrigued.  It did taste like celery, but it was very refreshing & balanced.   Not too dry, nor sweet.  Nibbling on the popcorn, we decided on sharing an appetizer.   The apple and plum salad was a nice way to start our meal.  It was full of nutty manchego, crunchy almonds and ripe plums.  I'd say it was a pretty generous portion and we didn't leave a single morsel on the plate, so I guess we kinda liked it.  A lot.I chose the pork entree, while my friend got the sable fish.  Both were prepared very well and beautiful presentation, to boot.  My pork was just the way I like it---PINK in the middle.  Not at all dry either.  Very flavorful and I liked the pairing of the grilled peaches on the side.  I may have had slight food envy over the sable fish.  I could not get over how amazing the black tea broth was!  It was subtle, yet aromatic and really elevated the dish.  Food was lovely and service was good.  We didn't feel overly rushed, until we looked at the time on our way out.  We were there for just over an hour!  Kinda sad, as we hoped to have more time to chat."
"I don't want to be redundant, so just do yourself a favor and book a reservation, grab some wine and order the octopus and the raviolo-heaven in your mouth! New favorite BYO!"
"OMG! The one of the best BYOB places! Good ambiance and decor, good service, the food was just amazing!!! The ingredients were so fresh and the dishes were very creative.We literally wanted to try everything on the menu!We shared a few appetizers, which are all very fresh. One of them had crispy chickpeas as part of the garnish....which i thought was very interesting and it went so well with the rest of the dish. I had the pork loin entree. The pork loin was cooked about right and so juicy! It went so well with the wine we brought there! The dessert was amazing! I am not a big fan of cotton candy nor chocolate mousse, yet, the dessert is comprised of both. The cotton candy was not as sweet and ""airy"" as you would think, it really did feel like cotton when you pulled it!!! The chocolate mousse was really chocolaty, and it feels more like chocolate cream cheese (a bit less creamy) than a typical mousse! Perfect texture! The saltiness of the sea salts and bacon were just a right balance and helped enhance the flavour of the dessert!Def. worth the effort of going there early or wait for the table!"
"I went to Ruxbin when it first opened and had not returned until the other night. The menu was completely different but both experiences were great. We got there around 6 on a Thursday and didn't have a problem getting a table. Also my friend had to wait for me and said the service couldn't have been better - she was given a shot of carrot soup and offered water.As far as the food go, I wasn't blown away but everything was really tasty and I had no complaints overall. We started with the flatbread topped with prosciutto and goat cheese. I thought it was going to be a warm chewy flatbread and so I was kind of disappointed but it was a nice light way to start the meal regardless. We also had an order of the garlic fries which my friends enjoyed very much.For my main, I ordered the agnolotti. It had a bunch of veggies and lentils, was filled with a sweet butternut squash and accompanied with a poached egg. The pasta was really delicate and different from what I would usually order (not a big pasta or raviloi girl) It wasn't a big dish but this made me happy. I don't need a giant plate of food. I like leaving full, not stuffed! My friends ordered the salmon and seemed happy with the choice.The price point could be lower but you are getting high quality food at a low key place with great service. I will happily return to Ruxbin over and over."
"Went to Ruxbin with a girlfriend last week. What a great experience! The food, the atmosphere everything was delicious. The restaurant was all decorated with recycled materials, from the tables to the ceiling. We loved- Mushrooms toasts- Calamari- Hanger steakRuxbin is getting rave reviews from everywhere, so don't be the last to try!"
"Now that they are starting to take reservations, expect that much better of an experience. We are huge fans of Ruxbin -- the amazing interior design, the focused menu with so many twists, BYOB (!!!), and the friendly staff. Having to stand in line at 5:30 in order to nab one of their first seatings was fun the first time and a drag thereafter. Eventually, I think they began to lose patrons because of it - just a guess. The last time we went, we arrived super early only to discover the place was nearly empty for the first hour -- as any 'normal' restaurant would be; it filled up as the evening wore on. Thrilled to return now that we can dine at a more reasonable hour."
Been multiple times. Always amazing. Never disappoints. Walking distance from our home (no one other than me cares about that). BYOB. Last time we went was a Thursday night around 6:30p and we were seated by 7:15p. We were able to sit at the communal table upstairs and drink our wine while we waited. Make sure to check out the bathroom. 5 stars. Thanks Ruxbin.
"Line:  At 5:30 on a Sunday evening, was getting long.  Luckily, our friends got there at 4:30 to get us the first table!  Way to go guys and take one for the team!Atmosphere: Very interesting.  Seems to have an artsy motif... theater chairs turned into light fixtures, book pages glued to the ceiling, tables reminded me of a log cabin from the 70's.  Seat belts served as the backing to the booths along with what appeared to be leather jackets and pants.Food: Very good.  My three dining companions and I had the following:Calamari- tasted slightly Korean BBQ esqueMushroom Toast- Really goodPork, Amish Chicken, Bucatini and Clams, and Sablefish for dinner.  All entrees were thoroughly enjoyed with plates licked clean.  I would have preferred my dish to be a higher temperature (it seemed lukewarm) hence the 4 stars.Dessert was the chocolate pot de creme and the fried pear pie with Gorgonzola ice cream~  which was one of the best things I have ever eaten!!!!  Who would have thought cheese flavored ice cream could be so divine?!?Service:  Very good... prompt, knowledgeable, and professional.  Overall experience was great.  I also liked that it was BYOB, definitely saved some coin.  I will try to return, but I have to admit it probably won't be likely due to Ruxbin not accepting reservations and I don't like waiting in lines."
"Not really sure if this place is my thing, but not going to give it a bad review for my own issues...so we'll go with a rating right in the middle.So, went to Ruxbin on a whim a couple of weeks ago with a friend.  It was my very first BYOB experience EVER.  This threw me off a bit, just simply because there was no real bar or waiting area to hang in while waiting for a table.  This place was packed, too, so the wait was more than a couple of minutes.  We were told by the very nice, but busy hostess that we could wait upstairs and she would be right up with a mixer for us.  We got to the top and and the only table was filled...as was the bench along the table.  We tried to just stand, but were getting all in the way of the kitchen staff.  My very outgoing friend finally just asked the people at the table to slide over and make room for us.  They did just that, but we were quickly told by a waitress that we should get up because she was about to serve that table their food.   Arrrgggghhhh.  I was getting slightly irritated...I needed a drink ASAP.  We asked this same waitress about the mixers we hadn't received and apparently asked the wrong person because this seemed to fluster her.  Finally, we got our mixers and got some peace inducing liquor in me.  Our wait went by fast after this and we enjoyed talking with the table of people who had briefly let us sit with them.A table opens up and I am super excited at this point as I had been sitting by the kitchen watching the food come out.  It all looked so good and smelled so good!  The hostess came and got us and was very nice and apologetic for our wait.   Our waitress was also so nice and accomodating.  After perusing the menu, we decided on a few appetizers and I decided on an entree of shrimp and grits.  The waitress asked me if I minded the sausage that came in the grits and I assured her I was fine.  The appetizers arrived and were SOOOO good so I was super pumped for my shrimp and grits.  My entree arrived and I think my eyes almost bugged out of my head.  Being from the South, I had a completely different expectation for this dish.  The grits were baked/fried into a patty, there were 3 shrimp, 3 mussels, and a giant prawn with eyeballs and legs and antennae staring at me.  Errr...this was my fault, I suppose.  I don't like my food staring at me.  Also, the mussels appeared to be smiling at me...how is that even possible???  Anyway, I ate only the grits patty and the 3 shrimp.  They were good, but I was not full.  My friend ate my food that still had faces...she said they were very good.Now, my favorite part of the experience...the bathroom!!!  The coolest bathroom I have seen in a restaurant.  You enter this little round portal that gives you the impression of a time travel portal or something and it spins you around to the bathroom.  So cool!  OK, maybe it doesn't take much to impress me...Overall, the place is very cute, the staff is super friendly (except for the 1 flustered waitress I mentioned earlier) and the food is mostly good (just a little frightening to me).  I will recommend this place to others and will probably give it another go."
"Two words:DAAAAANG!Yes, so I really enjoyed my meal at Ruxbin.  For some reason I had it in my head that this place was a steak house (don't ask me why...) so I was totes shocked to walk in and see a restaurant so eclectic and crazeballs.  It is SUPER tiny, so plan to wait, even on weekdays.I had the bucatini and clams which was yums in the tums, although I would have preferred a *moister* sauce. (btw, also, *shudderatthewordmoist*)  But srsly, I could have done with all the same components, and just a splash of stock or somat, it was a little bit pasty in texture.  Delicious paste, but paste all the same.  My dining companion had the sablefish, which I thought was delish, but she found to be a little too sweet.  Also, the portion size was way smaller than my pasta dish, she ended up eating a fair bit of mine and we both left with satisfied tummies.  Perhaps the cheffy types at the Rux should consider upping the veg level on that one?Overall, super awesome, and the bathroom made me grin like a freaking cheshire cat.  I won't give it away *snicker* you'll have to go check it out for yourself."
"Waited for an hour and a half..... Completely worth every minute!!Took the advice of my fellow Yelpers and decided to try Ruxbin with my boyfriend. I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have had in the past year. We recently moved to Chicago, and have never experienced the BYOB concept. LOVE IT! The communal waiting area is a great place to meet people and share wine. I would definitely recommend bringing two bottles of wine, one for the wait and one for dinner. The mushroom toast and hanger streak are phenomenal! I cannot wait to go back!"
"It goes without saying that you have to go to Ruxbin with a plan, especially on a weekend:  Queue up as close as you can to (and preferably before) 5:30pm, put your name in, and then head off to a nearby bar and wait....and wait and wait--2.5 hours as it turned out for our party of four.  And the reward for your effort?  Dinner in a charming, intimate space with appetizers a little disappointing on quality but with the restaurant fully hitting its stride in its main entrees.Dinner starts with a small complimentary bowl of popcorn with wasabi.  This was not a good way to start the meal:  The popcorn was a little on the stale side, and taste-wise, the wasabi powder brings surprisingly little to the table.  The popcorn bowl starter has been pulled off with greater success at many other restaurants, most notably the seasoned and fresh complimentary popcorn at Graham Elliot.As I mentioned earlier, Ruxbin really seemed to struggle in the appetizer department.  The Garlic Fries were surprisingly short on flavoring.  Even with the thick chipotle aioli, the overall taste is so unexpectedly mild.  The Calamari was a big step in a better direction, a lot of complex flavoring going on, but still at a subtle and controlled pace.  The potatoes included with the calamari seemed unnecessary.  The soup of the day, an Acorn Squash Soup, was very good, highlighted by a refreshing bit of sweetness.  This was easily the best of the appetizers.  The Mushroom Toast was okay and provided flavoring in the form of what was essentially a salad sitting on top of bread.  I don't think anything about this dish appropriately accentuated the oyster mushrooms.Fortunately, Ruxbin rebounded in a big way (at least for me) with the main entree.  The Bucatini & Clams entree was superb:  The Chinese sausage accentuated the saltiness of the clams, and the black soybean and white wine sauce provided visual appeal in addition to taste.  Bucatini seemed like the perfect pasta for this dish, doing a great job retaining the flavoring of the sauce, adding little textural excitement on top of being served al dente, and still retaining a general feel of an Asian noodle soup.  This was a very well put-together dish, and it seemed evident that the chef found comfort in the layers of complexity of an entree rather than the one-dimensional small plates/appetizers that are so prevalent elsewhere.  On the negative side, I do have to note that one of the other diners at the table found the Pork Loin extremely bland and disappointing.For dessert, our table shared an order of the Fried Hand Pie with Gorgonzola ice cream and the Chocolate Pot de Creme.  The ice cream was pretty good, while the bacon cotton candy part of the pot de creme was not really properly infused with bacon and instead oddly overloaded with mint.  On the whole, I would say the desserts were passable but far from a restaurant highlight.Service was good and attentive, but nothing particularly remarkable for a high quality restaurant.  In addition to navigating the tight confines of the restaurant, the servers should get extra credit for escalating those handful of steps between the dining room and the kitchen for what must be a couple hundred times a day.  I won't go on too much about the restaurant interior, which surely has been commented on ad nauseam:  The repurpose concept works well here, from the bathroom door to the seat backs made of seat belts.  And certainly, given the wait you likely suffered to get a table, you do get the benefits of a small, intimate, and exclusive space."
"This review is long overdue, as I went there for my birthday last October with my father and step-mother. I love that this is BYOB, yet it has a quiet, quaint and calming atmosphere. It almost reminds me of the restaurants that you find in New Orleans that look like a house - or once were an old house. The bathroom is quite an experience, you go in some sort of a vestibule and when you close the door, you spin around to the other side - into the bathroom. I would love to come back on a date!! The food is incredible. The chef picks out fresh seafood daily - the menu changes - and the desserts are TO DIE FOR!!!I highly recommend this restaurant."
"We'll be back! The menu is full of creativity so expect a party in your mouth! Ruxbin features a twist on traditional cuisine, recycled decor for a little eye candy, and BYOB accommodations to top it off. You'll want to get there early...it's such a tiny space.My husband and I shared the lamb dish for two over a bed of a spring couscous blend. If only there were more on our plate! We cleaned it in no time. Be sure to order an appetizer and dessert in addition to your main course. You won't be disappointed."
Wow. This is an amazing restaurant. Elegant yet traditional food. Not a single flavor on the plate was misplaced. Couldn't have asked for better scallops. I would recommend this restaurant as one of if not the best in Chicago.
"Summary: Food 3 stars, Service 0.5 stars, Overall experience = awful and will never go back.We came to Ruxbin for my husband's 30th birthday.  We arrived at 6:45pm on a Thursday.  They told us 45 minutes.  The hostess initially had a difficult time understanding the name Hill, so after 50 minutes we came back to verify we hadn't missed our call.  We had not; in fact she told us it would be another 15 minutes.  All-in-all, we waited almost 1.5 hours for a table on rainy, cold Thursday.All of the waiting is OK and we expected that.  What we did not expect, was to be served room temperature meals after all the waiting and then to be told that is how meat is 'supposed to be served.' (It wasn't just the meat though; the garnishes were cold too).My husband ordered the pork and I ordered the hanger steak.  By the time we got our food, BOTH of our dishes were no where close to hot.  My broccoli and potatoes were COLD, which is gross.  When the server asked how the food was, I said mine was cold, including the sides.  She told me ""that is how medium rare beef is served because it has to rest for a while.""  I said my sides were cold as well, and she took my dish away without further discussion.15 minutes later, after my husband ate his cold pork, they brought me another plate.  It took me only seconds to realize they brought me the SAME STEAK AND SIDES, they had just refired it.  Really?!  It was shady because it looked like they threw a couple of medium rare pieces of meat on the end but I recognized the main piece of meat and it was WELL DONE!  I asked the server, ""is this the same piece of meat?""  She admitted it was because I said I wanted the steak cooked longer.  I said that was incorrect - I did not want to eat a cold piece of meat with cold sides.  At this point, I am too upset to be hungry, but she didn't offer another dish anyway.  This place cannot be labeled as Steakhouse on Yelp for it is not, in my experience.  After 3 hours, they couldn't deliver a proper hanger steak.  ADDITIONALLY, after all of this, the waitress did NOT EVEN OFFER US DESSERT.  She just handed us the check and never came back.  She sent the bus girl to swipe our card.  On my husband's BIRTHDAY, we were not offered dessert!  I guess I scared them.Overall, sadly terrible experience.  It had potential though, I guess.  There seemed to be some great creativity and skillful thought behind the dishes.  If it weren't for the service and the complete ignorance and miscommunication, it could have been a very good experience, but it wasn't."
"I like this place not for food only but also for everything on this place. The service, the design, the food, the location.This is a great place for DATE not for eat because the quantity of the food will not makes you full."
"I really wish I could give 4.5 stars--I'm so torn--life is so hard.Ruxbin overall was a good experience. Our group of 4 arrived at 6:00 pm on Saturday night which was stupid of us because if we would have arrived when they opened at 5:30  pm or before, we would have made the first round of patrons seated. Instead, we would get round two. The hostess was very helpful, she offered suggestions of BYOs in the area where we could go to wait since the space is so small, it's pretty difficult to wait in the restaurant. So be prepared to leave and come back, unless you are lucky enough to capture the one table for people waiting, in which case you can open your drinks and wait in the restaurant. We walked down to a sushi place about two blocks away and came back an hour later. We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 minutes, which I didn't think was too bad--they estimated us at an hour thirty. We were able to nab the elusive one table for waiting people upon our return, which I think the owners cleverly placed right next to the kitchen and right where the food comes out. We were drooling by the time they called our name to be seated and we definitely had our appetizers ready to order.For starters, we selected the apple and plum salad and the GARLIC FRIES. Apple and plum was so-so (I think La Madia has better salads,) but I wish the garlic fries lasted forever, really. Get them.For entrees, I had the hanger steak and the rest of the table had the sable fish, the mushroom etouffee and the bucatini & clams. My hanger steak was too rare for my taste and extremely rich, although, I still liked it. My friends all loved their entrees, especially the mushroom etouffee and the bucatini & clams. I also have to say how wonderful the atmosphere is. I would bet some people say it's too dark, but it's really cozy, rustic and intimate. If it were up to me and my hanger steak, Ruxbin would be getting 4 stars, but the rest of the food, along with the space and the people AND it's BYO, it really is a place I would suggest to check out."
"Friendly casual service at this BYOB.  Love the seasonal and ever changing menu but the best things I've ever had here were a mushroom tart and a chocolate pots de creme with bacon cotton candy.  These were years ago now.  But man, I usually try one of everything on the menu, I ordered a second of each of these!"
The food here is good not exceptional in my opinion. The staff is warm and accommodating.  The food is expensive.
"Delicious is the only word to describe this lovely little place!The servers are very knowledgeable and passionate about the food they are serving. Asked for a recommendation and was told the salmon was her favourite thing on the menu right now, chose to ignore her and ate the lamb. If any dish is better than that lamb your taste buds are in for a real treat! Cooked and seasoned to perfection the accompaniments really worked, each mouthful revealed a new taste.Would highly recommend this place, but make sure you are prepared to wait a while if you go at peak times, the restaurant only seats 32 but the wait well be worth it!"
"We tried to come here before, not knowing how small the venue was (it sits only 32 people and they only have 2-3 waitstaff) and therefore, how quickly the night fills up. So our impromptu and late arrival was turned away. After reading Yelp reviews, this time, we came prepared. We picked up our bottle of wine beforehand and arrived on a Saturday evening at around 5:10-5:15 p.m. The place opens at 5:30, but there was already a line outside. Luckily we scored a parking spot closeby and was able to get in during the first round of seating.Besides the complimentary seaweed/sesame popcorn, we started with the salmon tartare and garlic fries. The tartare was fresh, complimented with cucumber and celery, and the garlic fries were crisp and came with a delicious aioli to dip them in.I ordered the hanger steak, he ordered the duck breast. Steak was yummy, but duck was to die for -- especially with the zucchini bread. Strange, but surprisingly good, combination of flavors.Lastly, we ended with the panna cotta for dessert. I personally wasn't a big fan, especially of the banana/sesame milkshake on the side, but it was still pretty good.Overall -- really neat experience. Not sure if it's worth all of the hype but I would still give it chance. Just be prepared about the wait!! Plus it's BYOB and I can never complain about that :)"
"Ruxbin is awesome!  I have been wanting to go for months now and never got it together.  Last night finally I did and I can't believe it took this long!  EVERYTHING was so good.The popcorn snack was a great start.  Our group also tried the gazpacho which was refreshing on a 90+ degree day.For our entree's we had the duck breast, hanger steak, octopus and pork belly.  I honestly could not choose a favorite.  They were all cooked so well with a tasty sauce and perfect garnish.  I love trying new restaurants in the city and this is close, if not at, the top of my list.We got there at 6:00 on a Tuesday to make sure to get a seat and it was no problem at all.  I can't recommend this place enough!  If you haven't gone don't wait like I did.  Can't wait to go back to try everything else!"
"There is a reason why I typically don't like Asian fusion type places: They always leave me craving for authentic Asian food.My friend and I came here around 9pm, and there was a 30-45 min. wait. Really? Wow. I've heard so much about this place so we decided to wait it out. We sat upstairs for a little bit while we enjoyed our wine and looked over the menu. Everything sounds amazing!We ordered the following when we got seated:- Endive Ceasar salad- Calamari- Clam Bake- Pork LoinThe sad thing is that my favorite was the endive salad.The flavors on the calamari tasted like a mix of the Hong Kong XO sauce and the Korean jajang sauce to me. (Funny side story: the two flavors came together in the middle of the dish, but my friend started on the jajang side and I started on the XO side... we both ended up thinking that the other was crazy when we described the flavors to each other). As someone who is used to these flavors, it just didn't stand out to me. I liked that the calamari was soft and tender though. It was done well.The sake broth in the clam bake tasted very similar to a white wine broth, so I wasn't that impressed... The lap cheong sausage added something interesting to the dish, but to me, I thought it seemed completely out of place.I was attracted to the pork loin dish because of the crispy hominy. I've only had hominy in pozole so I was a little curious, and I think the sauce came out well. My only problem was with the actual pork loin... It was soft and tender, which I liked, but the smell was a little off-putting for me. I thought the basil would help, but it didn't take away the meaty smell of the pork. I felt like I ordered the wrong items to have such an unsatisfying experience at Ruxbin when people I trust to have good taste in food loved the place. I may have to come again in the far future. I'm craving Chinese-Korean food at the moment, like jajangmyeon and jjamppong, etc..."
This place is legit.
"I've heard a lot about this place. The food is good, but the portion sizes are ridiculous, as are the prices. Even the entrees had 4-5 bites worth of food, which is crazy considering how much the dishes cost"
"While I award the same number of stars as reviewer Ben S., it is for similar yet different reasons.  I'm Korean by heritage, and I travel to Korea 4 to 5 times a year, eating basically everything in sight.  That said, while I am no chef or connoisseur, I'm pretty sure I know the food fairly well.  Well, after hearing about Ruxbin from friends and family, and have them rave about it, I finally decided to try it out.  What I found was Korean food presented sightly differently, served in small sized portions and everything overly salted and with no side dishes, helpings of rice or a 'carb' element to help balance everything out.  Oh, and it was extremely expensive for what it was.  I'm a guy who doesn't mind dropping a bit of money for food if I think it was well worth it, but this place left a bad taste in my mouth afterwards (literally and figuratively).  Even with having some friends actually know the brother/sister ownership here, it really turned me off to the restaurant as a whole.  For all of this, I was willing to still give the place a 3 star rating due to it being a shining example of Korean food that isn't something like Ban Po Jung or Cho Sun Oak, or San Soo Gab San (aka k-bbq / bi bim bahb / standard soup dishes).  But what really ticked me off was, as I finished my meal and as I was walking to the washroom, I believe the staff or manager leaned out of the kitchen window and asked me how my meal was.  My response verbatim, ""It was good.  But I noticed that there was a very heavy influence from Korean dishes.  I didn't know that Ruxbin was a Korean fusion restaurant.""  His response, ""Oh really?  That's funny, I don't think so.  No one else says that."" and stared pointedly at me.  I just laughed it off, but as I was walking away all I could think was, ""If I want kalbi jjiim, I'll just make it myself at home and save myself the $30).  What a joke."
"Everything I've had here is good. A bit unique yet, solidly good. It kinda feels like comfort food to me but, that might be the ambiance as well. Regardless of the wait, I like this place. It's small, intimate and dark so you're not distracted by cool hipsters.And the bathroom? It brings the act of defecation to the next level. The weird door was neat but really, I enjoyed that candle in the bathroom... not gonna lie."
"Solid 4 stars.  Highlights:  1)  Almost every single dish was flavorful, fresh and beautiful.  We ordered the soup of the night (carrot), octopus salad, apple & plum salad, garlic fries, black cod dish and deconstructed rocky road for dessert.  My only compliant was the apple & plum salad, which was nicely dressed and fresh, lacked any flavor-the fruit didn't seem fresh and barely had enough cheese to add any flavor.  I probably wouldn't order that in hindsight.  2)  The bathroom was SOOO COOL!  You have to see it for yourself.  Additionally, it was the warmest place in the restaurant (see lowlight).  3)  The decor was amazing-love all the upcycled objects they incorporated into the place.  Lowlight (only one, but it has a big impact on whether or not you enjoy your meal)1)  It was f-ing freezing.  If you make customers wait for a long time in the cold, the least you can do is have a toasty warm restaurant!  I think the fact that we were the first ones in line and therefore got a nice window seat had something to do with it...but for the prices your toes should dethaw during the meal.  To give you some perspective, the Ashland CTA stop heaters made me feel warmer."
"Hands down our favorite restaurant in the entire city.They used to have a dish that was a pork loin with cream of wheat (cant remember the details) which we went back for the following week after having it the first time just to get it again. Never in my life have I had pork loin treated with such respect and finesse as Ruxbin does. So often its dry and lacking seasoning but this was truly incredible.They do a lovely job here of pacing your order out (we tend to order way too much but they made sure to bring it all out in perfect succession). No matter what you get, the moment you sit down put in an order of garlic fries to have while you pick whatever else you are getting. Best. Fries. Ever.BYOB, expertly prepared dishes, and very kind service. My kind of place."
"""I'm Teddy Ruxpin...do you wanna hear a story?""Well Ruxbin is the new hot spot on the lips of the foodies....I went here on a Tuesday night.  We had heard there was a significant wait so we were smart and showed up promptly at 530PM when they opened....dont hate on the early birds...haha.Seated immediately and opened up our bottle of Pinot (its byob, fyi).We started off with the *new item on the menu, the mushroom toast and also the apple/plum salad.  Both were great.  For the main event, we got the bucatini & clams & the sablefish.  The bucatini and clams was GREAT.  I have been thinking about it since I ate it....a little food affair.  The sablefish was cooked to perfection.  Of course, we were stuffed after that so no room for dessert.Service was pretty good.  I have to say you have to put your apps in with your entrees ""because thats what the chef wants.""  I felt that our entrees were up a little long and under a heat lamp for about 10 mins so I wasnt a fan of that.  I would rather place my app order and wait for my main entree because I feel like we were talking and taking a little long on the apps.  Also, at the end of the meal, I felt as though they were rushing us out.  I know its tough because its BYOB and people like to hang around and they arent making any money on you once you finish your meal, but I thought a little more grace would have been nice.  The girl was like...would you like a cork for your wine?  OUCH.  I get the picture, ok.The bathroom has a little flair.  Its like a turning door which takes a hot second to figure out, but I loved it.Overall, great food with a couple hiccups, but I would go back.  Prices are a little high but its BYOB...cant be beat :) I think a $5 corkage...."
"good food.the hanger steak was just amazing.next time i go back i stick to the garlic fries, steak and maybe scallops....and bread pudding.i am a duck boy but did not die for the duck. the octopus appetizer and quail were ok but not to die for.the donuts and ice cream where just ok.good service and nice people.oh, did i say i will go back in a few days just to have that steak? not shy of flavors...not shy at all."
"My date, Colin B. (I am reviewing for the both of us), and I came here this past Saturday after attempting to come here a few weeks back only to be met with the long wait time and having to dine elsewhere! We had a game plan this time, we would arrive RIGHT at 5:30 PM to ensure a table. It worked!! We got a cute little table in the corner and we were ready to eat! We had reviewed the menu earlier in the day, so we knew exactly what we were ordering! Starters were the Garlic Fries and Calamari. We received the fries first and we seriously ate them in 2 seconds. The mayo dipping sauce was delicious - it had a red pepper flavor/color to it as well and the fries were hot (more towards the bottom than the top) and crispy with this delicious garlic/salty topping. The calamari came next and it was probably my fave dish of the evening. We were discussing the sauce into the next day! It was grilled, which we were not expecting, and the sauce was spicy and had such flavor! There was a bit of pork and chicken in there as well, and a few potatoes on the side. He was scraping the plate for more saucy delicious-ness!For our mains, I had the Clam Bake and he had the Hangar Steak. I am not a huge red meat eater, but he gave me a couple pieces of his meat and it was out of this world. The marinade/sauce was sooooo delicious!!! The meat was cooked perfectly and the side of potato salad was equally as delicious with bits of bacon (who doesn't love bacon) and little potatoes. It was AMAZE!!! The Clam Bake was definitely good, but not as good as the Hangar Steak. The clams were super fresh as was the yellow corn and tomatoes in the broth. The dipping bread was awesome after sopping up all the delicious-ness in the broth. Once again, both of our plates were clean.  Shocking ;)For dessert, we had both the Berry Shortcake and the Panna Cotta. UMMMM, there are no words. The berry shortcake was this mound of fresh berries, whip cream, balsamic vinegar and homemade biscuits on the bottom! The Panna Cotta was so light and tasty with a topping of toasted coconut and bits of lemon. I had to work quick with my spoon b/c Colin was literally in heaven, he couldn't get enough! He also tried both of their home made sodas and they were so good. There is absolutely no question why they were named #5 by Bon Appetite Magazine as top new restaurants. This place has it down. The food is well executed, our server was great, and we walked out very happy and very full!"
"I'd definitely return for a second try at Ruxbin because of the intimacy and cozyness of the spot (""gezellig"" to the Dutch) along with the flavorful and creative food preparation. Upon return I'd hope to find applicable food served hot (rather than disappointingly warm). My salmon dish was very flavorful - but fish that does not come from the kitchen steaming (my expectation) or very hot (minimum requirement by any measure) is disappointing and not worthy of a restaurant that has gathered a good reputation and good press. The fish was not the only dish to be served on this cold December Tuesday luke-warm. In reply to other posts, I absolutely do *not* mind putting $25 down for my reservation - keeping a restaurant going is not easy work and I'm happy to abide by this requirement which is understandably becoming used by more restaurants. No valet parking at Ruxbin the night we were there - and was not needed with parking easy and abundant in this neighborhood. One big ask of Ruxbin is to please improve your glass service. We brought with us two really nice bottles of wine to this BYO restaurant and were disappointed to not find true ""Bordeaux"" style wine glasses and rather small, stemless glasses - the wine glass makes a significant impact to the contents of the glass and one would expect that a restaurant like Ruxbin would know this."
"I ate at Ruxbin over the weekend and it's already shot straight near the top of my mind's list of the yummiest restaurants in Chicago.My friend and I got there around 6:30 and were told our table would be ready in an hour. They offered to chill our wine in the mean time, and gave us a call at 7:15 to say the table would be ready in about 15 minutes. We returned and were seated immediately. The popcorn they gave us to start was so-so-- flavors were just okay and I thought it was on the stale side. That was definitely the low point of the meal. Garlic fries - They don't hold back on the garlic, which is a major plus in my book! Perfectly salty and crispy, and served with tangy chipotle aioli. What's not to like?Quail - Comforting because it's fried in a buttermilk batter, yet refreshing alongside a watermelon, basil, and mint salad. I liked it, but I probably wouldn't get it again.Beef and Broccoli - So delicious! My hangar steak was a perfect medium-rare and full of complex Asian flavors. The broccolini had varying textures and the slight bitterness complemented the steak. The rice tots on the side were so fun! But I kind of wished there were a little more of those. Overall, a really delicious and fun dish.Arctic Char - I usually opt for red meat over fish because I prefer intense, bold, hearty flavors. I would happily have replaced my scrumptious beef and broccoli with their arctic char-- it was so flavorful. It was served in a lemongrass broth with smashed potatoes and some haricot verts. It was absolutely perfect.Pretzel and Beer - I ate the first pretzel donut with a fork, and loved watching the chocolate pudding ooze out. My friend recommended I eat the next one whole. ""It's too big,"" I said. He said I should try it anyways, so I did. When I bit into the donut the chocolate pudding quickly started run down my throat, triggering my gag reflex. BUT IT WAS AMAZING. Have you ever gagged on decadent, rich, warm chocolate pudding? It was an immensely pleasant experience."
"My foodie Chicago friend was dying to try this place, so of course we had to come here when I was in town. We lucked out and didn't have to wait for a table at all, which was a blessing because it was so cold I probably would've left if they had made us stand outside.Concept-wise, Ruxbin is everything I love about dining out. Everything about it is down-to-earth (as down-to-earth as you can get at an upscale restaurant, at least) and rustic. The dining room is small and cosy, the rotating menu is only 15 items tops, and they have a no-restrictions BYOB policy. Simple and sweet, but classy at the same time.We were given a little dish of popcorn to start (v. cute idea) while we perused the menu. Upon close inspection, it's a very impressive list -- each menu item is a unique combination of ingredients that clearly had a lot of thought dedicated to it. We ended up choosing the pork belly, garlic fries, pork loin, and beef shank.Our food came out promptly. The garlic fries were good, but the aioli was very bland. I like my fries with more potato, so I let my friend finish those. The pork belly salad was phenomenal. Every single ingredient on the plate was meant to be there. The pork belly, cheese, and cornbread were the perfect pairing of rich and sweet, while grapefruit and vinaigrette provided just enough tartness to keep the dish light. My entree was the pork loin. It was a lighter, sweeter take on pork than I'm used to, and I don't know if I enjoyed it as much as I'd hoped to. In my opinion, the lemon was too overpowering. I liked my friend's entree a lot more -- the ribs, risotto, and brussels sprouts made for a heartier, safer dish that catered to my tastes better.The only real disappointment of the night was dessert. We ordered the Rocky Road, their take on a brownie sundae. We were surprised when we bit into it to find that it was extremely spicy. Our server told us the candied walnuts were dusted in chili powder, something that hadn't been mentioned on the menu. We couldn't finish because the spice was too jarring.Overall, Ruxbin does a good job of adding modern twists to comfort food ingredients. If you're a proponent of traditional flavours, make sure to go in with a very open mind."
"Darn you Ruxbin.  Darn you to heck.Look, I'm a reservations person.  I like reservations.  I haughtily declare ""No food is so good that it's worth my wasted time standing in line.""Darn you Ruxbin.  Darn you for making me eat my words.We dutifully showed up at 5pm (party of three).  The door opened at 5:30pm on the nostril with a lovely greeting.  We were promptly seated in a booth, water poured, and wine uncorked.Our server Holly was sheer perfection, just lovely, clearly well versed in the fare, great explanations, and easy demeanor.Ahh the food...we did octopus, tuna, and quail followed by pork loin, scallops, and duck.  The duck was accompanied by slices of what appeared to be (and definitely tasted like) an old-fashioned hermit cookie.  So genius and delicious!  The flavors just danced around my mouth.Desserts were beautifully presented and heavenly (berry shortcake and pretzel & beer).  We had tea and coffee to top it off.I also enjoyed the diverse clientele, all ages, good style, diners conversing with parties next to them, all enjoying an exquisite shared experience.Go stand in line at Ruxbin.  It's worth it."
"I still don't know how to get out of the bathroom, *smirks*Ruxbin, is quite possibly the best BYOB restaurant in the city. For me, it was the best restaurant I visited in the last year. Their complete from beginning to end. They hold true to your seating time, the seating is awesome (we got a booth), the bathroom is just simply a hilarious novelty, service is superb, no booze in the bill (plus I can pair up food and drink my way), the food is outstanding, and the service is superb. We had a lengthy wait, but we were appreciative and a bit guilty when they stayed true to our 9:45 seating (didn't even get sat until 10, the close @ 10...). Our server was very conversational, witty, intelligent, and fun. She was so much fun that we offered her some samplings of our beer we brought. The booth was really comfortable, tall enough backs to not be bothering the people behind you and deep enough that you can avoid being part of every ones business. Plus, they keep water on the table. THANK YOU! I cant stand waiting for water, it's a simple solution for people like me who hydrate a lot while they eat. The 3 of us almost ate the entire menu.   +Beet Salad: Beautifully plated, trio of beets was cool, anchovy as salt was clever  +Pork Belly Salad: Gloriously cooked belly, not enough greens, cornbread=delish  +Frog & Snail: Melt in your mouth snail, crispy and meaty legs,   +Grilled Octopus: Good char and tender, sesame paste and grapes were cool  +Hamachi Crudo: SPECIAL, very good, recommend experiencing anything freshMAIN  +Beef & Broccoli: Broccoli Rabe had amazing texture on florets, like stuffing paper  +Amish Chicken: Most juicy breast ever, pearl onions and brussles looked and tasted greatDESSERT  +Fried Hand Pie: Simple, sweet, and fun to eat.   +Chocolate Pot De Creme: Went glorious with a rare stout we brought, cotton candy was a miss for me, rest of dessert was decadent and sooo rich. Nothing more can be said. Great restaurant. Hands down one of the best dining experiences in my life."
"Fantastic nook of a restaurant - small, intimate but packed full of character.  Although reservations are not their thing, making fantastic food is.  We enjoyed the selection of non-alcoholic drinks (such as a lavender type lemonade) as well as the flavors in our mains (from the staples of baked chicken to a new take on scallops)."
"Favorite restaurant I've been to in Chicago. Food is delicious, space is snazzy. Superb service and BYOB is obviously awesome. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and it was so wonderful. We ordered the octopus for a small plate, pork shoulder and halibut for entrees. Everything was just so flavorful and delicious. Every bite I took... I savored."
"Not sure how they do it but Ruxbin just keeps on getting better.  As we were a group of four, we were able to order a good amount of dishes to try and it's hard for me to try to decide what was my favorite since they were all so divine but here are my highlights.  Eggplant salad: The moment I tasted this, I was overcome with regret that I didn't have this on my previous visits because it was just so delicious.Hanger steak: Always amazing but loving the new version with the yolk on top and the kimchi hash.Spring chicken: I've been shying away from chicken at restaurants as of late as too many places poorly execute fowl dishes and make them into sad dry items.  Ruxbin's on the otherhand was juicy and flavorful.9 Spice quinoa: Okay, this was surprising. I did not expect to love this dish that much but the curry was phenomenal.  Then came dessert and it was an amazing end to the meal.  The coconut lychee panna cotta is delectable but I'm currently dreaming about how insanely good the berry shortcake was.  Perfectly light, crunchy and creamy in every single bite.Another satisfying visit and already looking forward to the next."
"I was very excited to take my in-laws to Ruxbin for a post Christmas day dinner. It's nearby my home, seemed like a popular place and has great reviews. We had Pork Belly, Scallops, Hanger Steak and Etouffee and Grits and five appetizers for the four of us. Food is tasty, not stellar tasty, but tasty. But portions are small, not ""we are a boutique high end place and we serve small servings"" small which I am very much used to, but so depressingly small that you will order extra appetizers just to fill yourself up and still come out hungry from this place. After spending around $30 on entrees that's the last thing you want to feel. The dessert portions are a joke. On the plus side, Ruxbin has an interesting boutique style interior, very nice ambiance and fantastic staff. I would have given them 4 stars for the service, interior and the taste of food if not for their serving size."
"Five stars, but also in the context that I didn't have to wait a ridiculously long time in line.We (the three of us) got to the restaurant at 5:30pm on a Sunday night (right at the opening time).  There was already a line of people in front of us.  The attendant at the door was only letting one group of people in at a time, and being mysterious by not telling us what was going on with the wait time.  Finally, 6pm rolled around and the attendant got to us. ::drum roll:: ..... we got the last table in the restaurant!Everybody who was standing behind us in line got put on the waiting list.  I didn't think it was particularly efficient/satisfying that people would have to wait half an hour to find out if they would make it into the restaurant or be on a wait list.  However, once you're on the wait list, you can wander off, and they'll give you a call to come back when they anticipate an opening.I strongly recommend not coming here with large groups (4 at most) - unless you want to show up an hour before the restaurant opens to guarantee your spot.The interior is intimate and has a funky decor in artsy orange sepia tones.  It's eclectic, and makes me think of words like hipster, warehouse, scrapyard, yet sexy at the same time.  There's seats for up to 32 diners.  There's an upstairs, but that's where the kitchen and bathroom are at.  O. M. G.  THE BATHROOM!  This is the most interesting bathroom I've been to.  The door to get in is a cylindrical curiosity.  Maybe the bathroom itself is reason enough to come to this restaurant.  But it is single-occupancy, so potentially there's a longer wait.The food itself was also delicious.  All well-plated and presented.  Here's what we ordered, which we all enjoyed:Garlic Fries - french fries with garlic aioli:lh3.googleusercontent.co…Drinks - lavendar lemon-lime (I personally preferred this) and a guava rooibos tea:lh3.googleusercontent.co…Octopus - grilled with fried chickpeas, pickled green onions, radish, black soybean, roasted grapes, and ginger scallion vinaigrettelh4.googleusercontent.co…Tuna - tartare with mild horseradishlh5.googleusercontent.co…Clams - with couscous, watercress, fennel, heirloom baby tomatoes, sake lh6.googleusercontent.co…Beef & Broccoli - hangar steak, broccolini, rice tots, miso butter.  They didn't ask us how we wanted the steak cooked, but it came out medium-rare, which was perfect for me.lh5.googleusercontent.co…Pretzel & Beer - Pretzel Doughnut, Chocolate, Beer-Milk Sorbet.  The sorbet had such a subtle flavor of beer, but I could definitely taste it with every bite!  I strongly recommend ordering this.lh5.googleusercontent.co…Altogether, the bill came to about ~$40/person, pre-tip."
"According to Bon Appetit, Ruxbin is one of the best restaurants in America so we decided to try it out. Knowing that it is a small place, and hard to get a table we got there a little early (too bad we ran a little late). Little did I know that hard to get a table means a 2.5 Hour wait for a table. With all the hype, obviously we waited.  But was it worth it????During the Wait....It was nice that Ruxbin will hold your wine for you if you want to go somewhere else in the meantime, and call you abotu 15 minutes before your seating time. We walked over to the closest place to get a drink, Natalinos- akward... there were about 15 people there and you could definitely tell it was spillover from people who didn't want to wait for Ruxbin as Ruxbin suggests you walk over to Leopold and Natalino is on the way. We had 1 drink and bolted down to Leopold for a glass of wine where I was secretly wishing I was about to eat there since it has been on my list of places to go. At least we had something to do in the meantime. I suggest not wearing stillettos or high heels while snowy as you will have to walk somewhere nearby if you dont drive.Here comes Ruxbin...As as appetizer we ordered the Calamari (pictured below), which I thought was fantastic. It was sweet, salty and spicy, cooked very well. (Website's description- Chicken & Pork Forcemeat, Potato Confit, Korean Chili, Peanuts, Pickled Fennel, Pea Tendrils). This, I would definitely eat again.Amish Chicken (Per Website-Oven Roasted with Confit Leg, Israeli Couscous, Dill, Prunes, Braised Endive) Ummm, well the chicken was cooked well but well it was chicken, good but nothing special. I will say that the chicken was juicy and I did not like the couscous. Wasn't bad but not to my liking, and I did not taste any dill.Pork Loin (Per Website- Crispy Hominy & Chickpeas, Grilled Peaches, Roasted Shallots, Fried Basil, Coffee Chili Salt) First of all, do not order the Pork Loin ujnless you are in agreement with the USDA stating that pork products can be eaten pink. If you think pork should not be pink, you will likely send this back and ask them to finish cooking it all the way. I liked the combo of flavors but it was a bit bland. I did really like the Crispy Hominy & Chick Peas, the Chick Peas were pureed and Crispy Hominyh ontop to get a great flavor texture combination.Barkley gives Ruxbin--- 3 LicksAbove average. Good atmosphere, food was overrated in a town with so many great dining destinations."
"The service and food are amazing! Be prepared to enjoy a 2-hour dining experience in this date worthy temple culinary excellence. Make sure you order both an appetizer and an entree because no only will both of them be amazing, they are both sized to be paired together."
"How did I just discover Ruxbin now?  THANK you Yelpers!  Went here on a Thursday night for dinner.  Got there at 6pm so there was no wait.  The restaurant itself is small but the flavors inside was anything but small.  Their foods were all bursting in rich flavors!  For appetizers, my gf and I had the Crudo of the day which were the three oysters with all different flavors.  They were fresh and delicious!  One of the oysters came under a cup and we were instructed by our lovely waitress to eat it last.  When we opened it, a small cloud of smoke came out of it!  The oyster was sitting on top of small wood chips which gave it a wonderful smokey flavor - I was very impressed with this dish.  The other appetizers we tried were the Pork Belly (this was okay - a bit on the dry side), and then we also had the garlic fries (these were amazing.. nice and crispy and it came with a side of chipotle aioli sauce) and I'm a HUGE fan of french fries so I'm hard to impress when it comes to good, quality french fries.For our mains, I had the Black Cod and my date had the Shrimp and Grits.  They were both amazingggg.. my cod was buttery soft and flaked off perfectly (melted in my mouth - good).  It was so good, my stomach gave me a high five - I was incredibly happy with the food there.  And for dessert, we went with a deconstructed rocky road.  The dessert was really good.. presentation was great.  Overall, the server was really nice, patient and informative, the food is a must-try if you've never been and the best part.. it's BYOB!  I would definitely come back.  Till next time Ruxbin!  :)"
"Man what a fantastic night! Loved everything about this place, and am happy to give it a 5 star review.The ambiance is delightfully weird, with lights that were made out of old schoolchairs, the back of the bench is made out of seatbelt materials, the ceiling is plastered with book pages, notched natural wood tables, the whole place was tiny - great design guys.The food was perfect:-soup special was tomato terragon, with a strong flavor without the characteristic thickness of tomato soup-calamari appetizer was spicy and interesting, and the calamari itself was cooked exquisitely, so often it is rubbery or burnt or otherwise just normal-mussels were amazing - that broth has fennel, oranges, thyme and is good to eat with a spoon (we finished the whole thing), and the mussels themselves were fresh and well cooked. Also, props for having an extremely simple dish on the menu, this was literally just a huge platter of tasty mussels.-berry shortcake - yes oh yes what a way to finish. By this point the wine and good conversation were really hitting me, so I am lacking adjectives to describe it. Awesome.Definitely going to repeat here, however, make sure to come early or prepare for a 2 hour wait! When hearing about the wait, we went and grabbed a drink and appetizer at another place and then came back."
"Came here with a bunch of friends on my birthday last week. I've been hearing about Ruxbin on Yelp, from friends, and randomly on streetcorners for close to a year; as always with such places, one is worried about a positive-feedback loop of hype, inflating a place's ethos beyond its modest merits (see: Tavernita). This is not the case with Ruxbin. The phenomenal things you have heard are truly deserved. There were six of us, six entrees, seven appetizers, and two desserts, so we deemed it prudent to order the entire menu and share all of it. The pork belly appetizer stood out; the belly is more gently cooked than most offerings, which enables you to taste the meat itself rather than the other stuff that comes with it. Fries are delicious, if a little on the thin side. Perhaps the appetizer highlight for me was the arugula salad served with Manchego cheese; an incredibly simple dish that shines. The beet salad (three ways: raw beets, pickled beets, and candied beets) with white anchovies and orange has a perfectly balanced flavor profile - this was a sticking point with some who hesitated to get on board with ordering the whole menu, but after trying it, there were no complaints. Crudo and octopus appetizers were both delicious. The entrees were all memorable. Seared pork loin might be the most tender meat dish I've had in my life. Pan seared rainbow trout is fork-tender and perfectly cooked. Amish chicken (pan roasted breast, confit leg) turns an offering that is conventionally pedestrian into a spectacular, once-in-a-lifetime dish. Simply put, this chicken tastes more like chicken than essentially anything I've ever eaten; it's the pinnacle of simple, well-executed food. Tomato tart, served with trumpet mushrooms and zucchini, is not a token vegetarian option; the flavors are nuanced, and the dish is made with the freshest seasonal vegetables.  Hangar steak with broccoli and miso butter and clams steamed in tomatoes and vermouth with couscous are also excellent. Neither dessert is too large or over-the-top to spoil the excellent experience; both are perfect caps to the meal. Dark chocolate pot de creme is served with bacon-infused cotton candy, a whimsical take on the classic chocolate mousse. Fried hand pie served with pear and honey is simple, yet is one of the more elegant dishes meant to be eaten with one's hands. Thanks to the BYOB awesomeness, pricing at Ruxbin is *extremely* low for a meal of this caliber; we paid around $40 each after tax and tip to split the entire menu six ways. All in all, Ruxbin is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It lives up to the hype, and is well worth any wait you might have. An absolute must try!"
"How did we walk in at dinner time and get a seat without waiting?  I'll never know - but I also won't complain!First, service was fantastic, attentive without being overbearing.  Perfect for having a great date!  We were placed in the back of the seating area as well - which lent itself to the intimate environment, however the front of the restaurant seemed to be slightly less intimate and had a little more of a party vibe.The menu was perfectly sized in my opinion, and clearly allowed the kitchen to become experts in what they prepared.  Everything was extremely flavorful, went together superbly, and I would get it again - on purpose.  My favorite thing was the fried apple pie to end the night.  It was deconstructed, which always gives me pause - but each piece was perfectly made it was a pretty amazing way to end the night.Even though we didn't wait, it would definitely be worth the wait, especially for an intimate evening with someone special!"
Lives up to expectations. Small Paris bistro atmosphere (small space with high quality food). Oysters were great...by far the best octopus we ever had...and we loves the venison. I wish there were more restaurants like Ruxbin.
Flawless. start to finish. every single bite.  courteous staff. great environment fantastic dinner.
"Ruxbin, I had a dream about you last night. Maybe I'll come back to Chicago to visit you. Are you the best restaurant ever? Possibly. I miss you."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago in terms of ambiance, service, taste of food,  and value. I was really impressed with this restaurant all around. I cannot believe it is BYOB. It's amazing!We drove over and put our name on the reservation list around 6:30 PM. They said they would call us when there was a table ready for us and about 2 1/2 hours later our phone rang! Holy moly, it was it worth the wait. This place reminds me of a small, intimate restaurant you would find in New York or Paris. There isn't an air of superiority you think you'd find at a restaurant like this. It was low lit, packed, and still romantic when we visited.Everyone at the restaurant was extremely knowledgeable with the menu selections. You could tell that all of them had a passion for food and making sure their patrons had not a meal but an experience. Everything we tried was impeccable in terms of presentation and taste. Another plus to the restaurant was that the courses were evenly spaced out in terms of timing.  We will DEFINITELY be back. I hope the 3 oyster appetizer is still on the menu.Oh and try using the restroom. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's an experience in itself. I will be returning soon."
"I cannot say enough nice things about Ruxbin!!!!A special thank you to the hostesses from April 8th who were so wonderful and helpful with a special request!!! I really love this restaurant, the service, decor, food...everything is super. I again had trout, but tried some new appetizers...calamari and the pork 'fingers'. Everything was so delicious as usual. Thanks again for a great night!5's all around as usual!"
"As was the case with L&E, I don't get the hype about the food. We waited in line for +1 hour and were really excited for our meal given the amount of press this place has gotten. We started with garlic fries and apple & plum salad. These were good but these are not really things that showcase a restaurant's strengths. We had the beef & broccoli and amish chicken, which were not anything to rave about. The beef was better than the chicken (not sure if the latter was fully cooked, or overly moist, but something was off). We ended with the hand pie and pot de creme. The latter's cotton candy failed on many levels and the handpie was like a poptart, good but not outstanding. I was disappointed that the online menu said it had quince but instead, this was just pear. Overall, I agree with the other reviewer who said he went in with high hopes and was prepared to be blown away but instead found just a quirky restaurant that fell a little short. The hype just doesn't live up and I didn't find myself thinking I have to return. However, kudos to the staff because everyone is nice and knows food. In addition, I should note that we forgot to bring wine, but our waitress called over to a nearby liquor store and it was delivered. Very nice.* from my visit on 4/6/12"
"This place is hands down one of my favorite places in the city. Though it sometimes may take forever to get in since there are no reservations, it's worth the wait (and this is coming from someone who is impatient). They really set the expectations on long wait times due to the no reservations system, so it's really hard to complain about that (for those who really opposed it in reviews).Anyway, the food is VERY well thought out and each leaf or greens rather are placed with much intention. Not only is the presentation great, the food is just AMAZING.  Each fusion of spices work so well together and I love how they sweeten flavors organically with exotic fruits or something unique. It's really hard to explain how they get all the flavors to mesh for each dish but it is all done so well. The prices are great too and it is BYOB.It's worth the time and experience. Here's a tip -- smaller groups will get in faster so if it's a date night thing, perfect! If it's a big group/birthday party thing... probably not easy to get a seat since the venue is quite small. Very affordable 5 STAR Michellin Star experience."
"First off, Happy Easter to my Christian friends. And happy hard-boiled-egg-eating-contest day to the rest of us. That out of the way, I'd like to tell the story of our trip to Ruxbin last night, or more importantly, what happened en route... After putting our names down at 5:30, we went over to Chip Inn, where I tricked my dinner date into doing a Malort shot (pwnd). Around 6:30, as promised, we received a call telling us our table was ready. We made our way back towards Ruxbin, and just feet away from the door, noticed a woman in jeans and high heels sprinting down Ashland towards us with an unleashed boxer by her side. The dog stopped running and jumping when it reached us. Not knowing anything about this large, completely collarless dog, we smartly began petting and hugging it. The woman who it had been running with yelled, ""I don't know whose dog that is!"" and quickly made her way inside Ruxbin. At that moment it occurred to us that this woman was sprinting in heels because she was actually scared of this animal. We continued to occupy the canine until the woman peeked her head out of the door, and then began sprinting back in the direction she'd come from. Not to be outdone, the boxer took off running after her, and again stopped when it reached other pedestrians. This group of pedestrians, a man and a woman holding a baby, were not as enthused as we'd been by the dog's presence. In fact, they seemed to be genuinely alarmed as they tried to in vain to escape the wayward dog's company. Their futile attempts to flee inspired great laughter on our part, which was only augmented when the man pulled a roll of sushi out of a to-go container, threw it on the ground, and began running with the woman and baby in tow. The dog stopped to enjoy the free meal and the family finally got away. It was srsly the funniest thing I've ever seen that wasn't on 30 Rock. Anyway, I'm emo to say our experience inside Ruxbin was not even close to that level of hilarity. I live 3 blocks away and like to support neighborhood businesses, but I don't really see myself going back there anytime soon. They seem to be doing quite alright though, so I doubt they'll miss little old Matt L. But I sure will miss that exuberant boxer terrorizing people on Ashland. I hope it found its way home. I'm perfectly fine with a 25-30% food cost at restaurants, and lower for complex dishes, but Ruxbin's dishes seemed quite simple, and I'd venture to guess you're looking at 10-15% on most of these. Not really worth going into more detail, other than to say I have a new appreciation for restaurants that list where their meats come from. After bringing up our cut of pork belly with our waitress, she went completely MIA, only to be replaced by the hostess 20 minutes later when it was time to get our check. The hostess did an admirable job trying to placate us, but the damage was done and what started as a really great birthday dinner for my date ended in tears... Just kidding,  It ended in cocktails and dessert at Leopold.Their panna cotta is the shit and their Local Cocktail with North Shore #6 and Koval Rose Hip is fucking genius. I should totes review that place."
"two friends and i walked into ruxbin at around 6pm on a wednesday evening and were seated immediately. we had been eating all day and planned to grab dessert at mindy's hot chocolate by 7pm, so we only ordered two appetizers and an entree to share.the octopus was the first out -- tender and flavorful, with a great char accentuated by the black soybean paste. the chickpeas weren't cracker-crispy but just hard enough to add some texture to the dish. the grapes were a nice touch of sweetnessthe beets, though conceptually creative, didn't taste as exciting as i thought it would be. i was excited for the anchovy-beet combination, but the pair wasn't as complimentary as i expected it to be. probably my least favorite dish of the night. the thin, crispy pumpernickle, however, was a nice neutralizer to the other flavorsthe clams. are. delicious! flavorful, chewy, and well-mixed with the watercress, fennel, and tomatoes, the combination of all ingredients in this dish is perfect.service was friendly and courteous, and as our server knew our desire to get out early, he promptly brought over our check as soon as all the food was out. we were out by 6:45, full and happy.**the bathroom is a fun trip. take a peek into the kitchen on your spin in** :)"
"My dinner at Ruxbin was the best meal I've had in Chicago since moving here in April (and I traveled here quite frequently for business prior to my move, as well!). The atmosphere is lovely - it's just dark enough, but not too dark that you feel like you can't see what you are eating. The ceiling is wallpapered with old cookbook pages, which we loved. The food was amazing. And, to top it off, the service put everything over the edge. When we sat down, we were given some delicious popcorn instead of bread. i'm really loving this new trend. Popcorn is so much lighter, and can be flavored in fun, creative ways. this popcorn had crumbled SEAWEED for flavoring. At least, we think so. Regardless, it was delicious.Deciding on appetizers was HARD. we consulted with our waitress, who, by the way, was FANTASTIC, and she said that while 3 appetizers might be a lot of food, she's ""seen it happen."" We went with it.app #1: mushroom toast. oyster mushrooms, savory biscuit, housemade ricotta, hazelnuts, frisee, arugula.app #2: calamari. chicken & pork farce, potato confit, korean chili, peanuts, pickled fennel, pea tendrils.app #3: pork belly salad. jicama, grapefruit, arugula, cornbread crouton, danablu cheese, citrus vinaigrette.All 3 appetizers were delicious, but particularly the pork belly.  I feel like it is easy to mess up, or to go overboard with, pork belly since it is SO RICH and SO FATTY. The way this dish came together with the sweetness of the cornbread, the slight bitterness of the grapefruit and arugula, and the bite of the cheese... it was perfection.main #1: hanger steak. (the recommended med rare) wrinkled long beans, candied bacon, chimichurri, creme fraiche heirloom potato salad.This surprised me (in a good way). Because of the steak and bacon, i was worried this dish would be too salty. But the candied bacon added the sweetness, and the chimichurri added JUST the right amount of heat. main #2: mint creek farm lamb. top round, parmesan cream of wheat, stewed mission figs, quick-cured lemon, caramelized fennel.This was FANTASTIC. The fig combined with the cream of wheat (very polenta-like) and with the lemon, then combined with the saltiness of the lamb. Easily the best dinner I've ever eaten. dessert: fried hand pie. quince and pear, candied walnuts, red wine caramel, house churned cheese ice cream.This was also amazing.Moral of the story? Get yourself to Ruxbin! But be prepared to wait - it's tiny!"
"Octopus and  fries were really good.. the steak was a bit fatty but decent.  Wasn't impressed w the halibut, it was bland and pretty small for the price. Overall a cute place.."
"I've heard from various sources regarding this little gem and how good their food is and how since it was small, there is usually a wait. So, it was never on the top of my list on a Fri/Sat night as I was unwilling to wait. So, we came here on a whim at 7p on a Sunday night and was promptly seated. We weren't terribly hungry and thought that we would just order a couple of item and share them. Then again, everything on the menu looked so good that we knew we had to order more. Apps/Starters- Apple & Plum Salad - thinly sliced apple and plum on a bed of baby arugula; I appreciated that the dressing was not over powering, but had plenty of flavor with a nice cracked pepper finish. The sweetness of the apples and tartness of the plums complimented the peppery arugula nicely.  - Octopus - This was a beautiful plate of food from presentation to taste. Main-Hallibut - Another beautiful presentation of food. It a beautiful piece of white fish sitting in the middle of a bright yellow-orange sauce. We were both blown away by how beautiful it was and how it tasted. Duck - The duck was perfectly cookedI can tell you that we ate every since piece of food and cleaned the plates since it was ALL so good! The best part is that they are a BYOB establishment and I'm happy that they are. The atmosphere is very intimate, small, and unique. I love what they have done with the place and how cozy it feels. Highly recommend anyone who is looking for great food in a unique setting, you won't be disappointed!"
"This is a super late review.... I was there with 2 friends for my birthday last year in May. I had read all of the reviews before hand and got there at 5p on a Sunday. We were seated right away. The food was amazing! I fell in love with the garlic fries :) and the lavender drink!I would have given them 5 stars but the waitress that we had, was not so friendly. When we finished with our dinner, she was quick to bring the check. My friends and I hadn't even had had desert or finished our wine. She kept coming to the table every couple of minutes to see if were ready to pay, I would have understood if there was a long line for people to be seated, we would of left. BUT, it was a Sunday evening, and there were pleanty of tables open. I will be back, the food was amazing, I just hope that waitress isn't there."
"There were 3 of us and we had 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and 1 dessert plus a bottle of wine (it is BYOB with no corkage fee).  Every item was at least excellent and many were outstanding.  The menu was about 50% new on our 2nd visit from our 1st one month earlier.  My wife was able to tell the herbs were fresh and the server confirmed they had an herb garden on the roof.  Service was efficient and friendly with just the right amount of attention.  It is also very reasonably priced. For value, it can't be beat. We have eaten her twice now and will definitely come back again.  We have eaten at 4 of Chicago's Michelin star restaurants and about 20 other fine-dining Chicago eateries and none was any better than Ruxbin.  It is small and doesn't take reservations so you need to be there at least 20 min before the 5:30 open on the weekends.  We arrived at 5:15 on a Sunday and they filled up before we got to the head of the line.  During the week, you'll probably get seated if you are there by 6 (note this is based on only 2 visits.)"
Went to ruxbin with 6 friends. Food was good but it didn't live up the expectation. Need to try again
"Any place where you need to get in line 45-60 minutes to guarantee seating better be worth the wait.  I have held out on going to Ruxbin for awhile because I refused to wait in line to eat.  I thought, there are so many great restaurants in Chicago, why go through the agony?  To keep things short, Ruxbin is worth the wait!I got there 1 hour early before opening on a Friday and I still was not the first person in line!  The whole experience was actually kind of fun.  Maybe it was because it was my day off, or maybe it was because I cracked a bottle of wine open on the sidewalk, but Ruxbin delivered an exceptional and enjoyable dining experience.  Part of what makes Ruxbin so special is the BYOB aspect.  Ruxbin offers high quality food worthy of a high end restaurant with affordable prices and BYOB!  What is better than that?  The menu does change but some of the highlights on the menu are the beets, octopus, garlic fries, and beef & broccoli.  The octopus salad was my favorite dish and it was the best octopus salad I have ever had.  The beef & broccoli was extremely flavorful and perfectly cooked.  It is refreshing to see the head chef in the kitchen and greeting guests.  You can tell that Edward Kim puts his heart and soul into his restaurant.  It really shows."
"I've been to Ruxbin several times now and it is always a great experience -- delicious food, great service and cozy atmosphere. The bourride is fantastic."
"warm, inviting atmosphere.  friendly staff. wicker park cool.  materials used to create the space are deconstructed from their original purpose and reclaimed.  we ate at ruxbin on a tuesday night; the place was full, however, it probably is full most of the time with only room to seat 32. we had reservations, and we were promptly seated and served yummy popcorn upon arriving.  appetizers really were underwelming...maybe it's because we were expecting a lot, but the grilled octopus and seasonal beets were certainly edible and sat beutifully on the plate, but the overall taste was bland and both plates felt random and not cohesive.  the entres on the otherhand were OUTSTANDING.  my husband indulged in the hanger steak and loved every bite-perfectly seasoned, served medium rare just as good meat should be. my scallops were wonderfully complimented with pork carnitas, making a wonderful flavor explosion.  If it were just for the appetizers, we wouldn't be back. but the BYOB and entrees were enticing, so i imagine we will be back."
"Naturally the wait was an hour and fortunately I live around the block, so we just went back to sip on some wine. When we got the call, I was in the process of blacking out so there isn't much to this story and the first thing I remember was the popcorn with the seaweed seasoning? last thing I remember was sitting at the table and having eaten all my mussels. I assume they were very tasty.I will continue to say I love it so don't go there. It's already too crowded. And hopefully next time I will actually remember what the mussels taste like."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Seriously, some of the best food I've eaten in Chicago, and that sentiment does not come easily. I went here on a Friday night with 4 people around 7:00. Wishful thinking?? For a small place that does not take reservations-we were taking a risk, but ended up getting lucky getting seated right away in the communal table near the kitchen. The beef and broccoli was to die for. I'm not a huge meat person, but this was by far my favorite dish. The garlic fries were a must-have, and I would be lying if I said I was not still thinking about them. The arctic char was also a stand out. Desserts were awesome--definitely same some room for these.It is clear that the chefs at Ruxbin put thought into every single detail on each plate, and it pays off. New favorite restaurant in Chicago--can't wait to go back! **BYOB!!**"
"Your introduction to this potential friend is the decor, a creative, quirky mish mash of re-purposed items (and a really cool bathroom) that let you know this place is accepting of all kinds of folks, even you. It reminds one of that person you know who shops at thrift stores yet somehow puts these castaways together in a very presentably stylish package. ""So far so good, but I'm not convinced"", say you.  Next you begin to get more familiar with Ruxbin as this funky-stylish package approaches in the form of smiling and knowledgeable wait staff, warm and willing to answer any questions you may have about the menu.  The fact this friend allows you to bring your own alcohol, in whatever form and quality of choice without judgement, just shows the politeness of Ruxbin.  You say ""Hey, I could really get to like this Ruxbin fellow."" The clincher that convinces you will be close friends for a long time with Ole Ruxy is the food. The options are more finite than most other friends, but this allows for the constant changing of the menu for freshness and availability of items and also allows for a quality not quantity approach, which Ruxbin executes to a T.  ""Ruxy"", you say as you loosen your belt, ""that was a fantastic meal. Call me?"" Unfortunately due to Ruxbin's svelte size, popularity and you coming late to the party you won't always be first on his list of guests. You must properly prepare in order to hang out with this comfy-cool old friend. But like hanging out with that person who shops at thrift stores, isn't it worth it? Yes, yes it is. Cheers!"
"This is the best food I think I've had in Chicago... Or anywhere.Love the concept that is it small and intimate. Also seasonal menu is a plus. Good excuse to come at least 4 times a year! Everyone at our table said everything ""was the best of that type of entree they have ever had"".  There were so many different flavors in each bite. We also had 4 bottles of wine (unrelated to the prior sentence) and they never tried to rush us out. We finished our last bottle after we finished the food.Had a reservation for me and 3 others. We seated slightly late and the hostess brought over fries when we sat down as an apology. A super nice gesture that shows they value customers. The fries were so great, wonderful garlic flavor. And I never like fries... Especially at nicer restaurants I usually find them to be overrated and ""meh"".Appetizers are small, but perfect for the 4 of us to each have 1 bite of each dish. Tuna- some of the best tartar I've had. The vinaigrette on it was great.Quail- normally don't love fried food, but this was very light and had wonderful flavor. Flatbread- smoked peaches on it are so good. Probably my least favorite, however it was still great.Octopus- delicious!!!!!! I've never tasted octopus like that before. It was so tender and all the flavors worked so well together. Favorite app.Dinner-Pork loin- this is what I got and it was AMAZING! Cooked perfectly with a sauce unlike any I've had before. Scallop- another delicious dishHanger steak- a standout. The marinade (or whatever was on it) was awesome.Duck- I didn't try the duck, but I did try the zucchini bread that came with it and it was the best zucchini bread I've ever had... Strange combo, huh?Dessert-Berry shortcake- very good, sounds like how it isPretzel and beer- sorbet was awesome- had caramel hints. Chocolate filled doughnuts were great, but super rich... As expected. Make the trip Here!!"
"This place has earned a place in my list of favorite Chicago restaurants.  Every menu and meal I have had has never missed, and the blends of flavor is always well done, clean to the palate and unique.  In addition to the BYOB, I see no reason for any Chicagoan and food lover to miss out on trying this place.  For those who wish they took reservations, it's worth the wait!"
"Fabulous birthday dinner here for hubby!!  We just missed the first seating at 5:30 on a Sunday but we were offered the communal table and got to sit and enjoy our wine and chat while we waited to be able to place our order.  And we really enjoyed the communal table.  Service was amazing and the food, especially the goat cheese flat bread and salmon, was delish.  The only dish we did not care as much was the fried quail.  But everyone in our group loved their entrees.  Also, for a great meal, the price was very reasonable.  We'd absolutely be back here again.  It is worth any line or wait."
"It is disappointing that I waited so long between dining here and writing this review, but at least I won't waste anybody's time with dishes that have been gushed over dozens and dozens of times.  Ruxbin had quite simply the best amish chicken dish I've ever had, with the notable highlight of the drumstick being confit'ed until it fell apart, dripping with juicy fatty goodness.Other things done impeccably well by Ruxbin: scallops, hangar steak, beet salad, FLATBREAD, decor, dessert, atmosphere and general ambiance.And it's really nice to walk out of a place without spending $50pp on booze."
"One of the best meals I've had. Read everyone else's reviews since it was over a year ago and they can better describe the food.If you have amazing food and I distinctively remember your bathroom for good reasons and tell people about it over a year later, you're doing something right."
"How to enjoy dinner at Ruxbin: 1. Come on a date or with ONE friend, maybe. Two peeps = quicker seating. Not recommended for large groups. No, really. Seriously. It's touch 'n go for a double date...though they do have a FEW 4-toppers. NO RESERVATIONS. Open time is 530pm. 2. BYOB + limit lingering if others are waiting. We all know how this goes.  It's the pedestrian v. driver dilemma morphed into a restaurant. When you are in one pair of shoes, you hate the other...and vice-versa. Just be aware, and be considerate. It goes a long way. 3. Admire the quirky, intimate surroundings. Ruxbin's humbly sexy interior in delightful orange/sepia hues is delicious. Dimmish lighting, strangely constructed seating, pages of cookbooks stitched to the ceiling. All works. Understated, yet most definitely thought out. 4. If its summer, dress lightly. Seems there is no AC...and the kitchen makes things a tad bit steamy. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but if you're one of those ""can't handle a drop of sweat"" kind of peeps, best wait til it cools off a bit outside...Okie doke, now that we've gotten those things out of the way...we can continue with our exploration of this new West Town treasure. And yes, it is a treasure. A small one. Take note! Yes, they are currently (July 2010) in the midst of some super-hype...but hopefully that dies down to a dull roar over the next few months and business can resume a nice casual and consistent flow, much like...well, Ruxbin. My group of 4 arrived at 7pm and was faced with a 45 minute wait. Oh, the humanity. Ok, not really...just ""Oh, the man sitting alone at a 4-top during DINNER hour for 1.5 hours."" See RULE #2, sir. Regardless of this impolite squatter, we were escorted upstairs near the kitchen to a stainless steel prep table with wooden benches overlooking the restaurant, sort of. Interesting...an ad hoc waiting room with sight lines into the kitchen! Exciting, yet...decidedly...warm. Of course, they are working hard to spin stuff out of their kitchen. Our wine was corked, waters served and fancy popcorn laid out. A nice touch...this made the 45 minute wait speed by, in the company of friends and popcorn and wine. Well done! (note: this waiting room holds about...6 people comfortably, so it may not be available at all times). As soon as our table become available, our delightful hostess scooped up our wines and led us to a booth just perfect for 4. I'd love to know what the booths were constructed of, but suffice it to say: creative, yet unobtrusive....much like our server! (sidenote: our service was nothing short of fantastic, not a kink in sight). Appetizers: *Fries: For $5, a heaping bowl of toasty fries with mayo-based dipping sauce. *Grapefruit & Jicama Salad*Apple & Plum Salad**both delicious, fresh and flavorful. Main Dishes: *Mojo Chicken: basic dish, but A LOT of chicken. Hangar Steak: medium rare, spiral cut over cauliflower puree. I had to restrain myself from inhaling it. In the end, I did anyway. So it goes. It was killer. Dessert: We were informed that the Flourless Chocolate Cake was the only dessert left (sob), but luckily it's what I would've ordered anyway (cheers!) so, crisis averted. A very tiny slice was presented to us accompanied by 4 spoons to which we all thought ""what!?"" Then we took about 1.5 bites each and realized it was thick as fudge and no one would be able to eat more than that anyway. Again, crisis averted.  Top it with a solo french Julius Meinl press...and well, this was a happy ending to this veritable success. Follow the rules. Eat at Ruxbin. The End!"
"""Shivering in my shoes, I whistle a happy tune..."" with excitement over my first visit (and soon discovered not my last) to Ruxbin. First in line at 4:45 p.m  I was thankful it was sunny and NOT snowing. Regardless, it was worth it and more. This 32 seater or less is the quaint restaurant you would expect with BIG foodie tastes to fill your tummy. My chickies and I started off with our BYOB ($5 cork fee) bottle of moscato to celebrate the occasion. Perfect. Now it was time to glaze over the menu and choose the deliciousness ahead of us. We were presented with their winter menu. It was super thoughtful of our server to share with us the intimacy of the restaurant and how it may take an extra few minutes for our food, as well as to order all our starters and main dishes at the same time. But to be honest, everything came out at the perfect time. We started off with the soup of the day - a creamy acorn squash soup.  It could have been one of the best soups I ever had if it had been piping hot. Sadly no...In fact, all of our food was warm, but not HOT. It was the only downfall of our Ruxbin experience. Luckily I was so in love with my food that I didn't let it bother me too much. Our starters were savory yum! What's better than a bowl full of garlic fries with a side of aioli...oh my goodness!! They were perfectly cooked (the only HOT HOT dish we had) and was just garlic WOW. We had the calamari next, which was spiced, sweet, and savory. It was definitely asian inspired and has such a familiar taste, but couldn't quite put my finger on what the sauce reminded me of. It'll come to me..i know it!  The mushroom toast was also delicious.My friends had the hanger steak and pork loin. Both the best of the best. The pork with sweet potato gnoochi was the juiciest I had ever tasted. My own personal dish was a play off of ""ja jiang myung"", a korean savory dish, except mine was a perfectly cooked Bucatini pasta with clams and chinese sausage drenched in a black soybean, onions, and white winepasta  was PERFECT. The deserts were...well, they were just amazing. The Fried Hand PiePear with Candied Walnuts, Red Wine Caramel, and Ice Cream was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The ice cream had to have some sea salt in it or something. It made me smile all over!  Now the  Chocolate Pot de Creme with Bacon Cotton Candy and Coffee Chili Salt was just beyond any dessert expectations. It was divine! it wasn't even the bacon cotton candy that I loved. It was the Chocolate Pot de Creme that I could eat every single day and feel like I didn't deserve it because it's so good! Ruxbin and Chef Edward whom I had the pleasure to chat with real quickly have my #1 vote. Thank you for a truly foodie fulfilled experience! You're the best!"
"I'm not one to shy away from what looks like a bombed out storefront on a semi-destitute strip of Ashland.  Who knows what you might find inside?  It could be a restaurant like Ruxbin Kitchen, a decidedly fabulous addition to the neighborhood (MY neighborhood, in fact) serving up creative food with a Euro twist.Curious?  You should be.Things to take into consideration:* Ruxbin is TINY.  Like, seats 38 people, tiny and they don't take reservations.  Your best bet is to show up on the early side during the week.* The kitchen is tiny.  Our hostess said they have something crazy like 2 burners and a stove back there.  If you crave perfectly prompt service and exceptional timing on your meal delivery, this may not be your dream spot.* BYOB!  Hallelujah!  Remember to grab a bottle of wine, champs or a 6-pack to enjoy with your meal.  There is a small corkage fee.Still in for adventure?  You should be.The menu, like the restaurant and the kitchen, is small, but honestly, everything looked good.  My party of six decided to divide and conquer, each ordering a different appetizer and entree, so we'd be able to sample pretty much everything.Apps:K-Town Empanadas - Masa, kimchee, Oaxaca cheese with chimichurri crème fraiche. Um, yes.  They're a pretty good size and the combo of kimchee and Oaxaca cheese is nothing short of interesting and surprisingly good.Elotes - If you don't know... this is roasted corn on the cob with chipotle butter, cotija, cilantro and lime.  I get elotes on the street (big ups for living in a predominately Latin neighborhood) just as good.  Tasty, but nothing earth shattering.Greens:Apple and Plum - Baby arugula, shaved celery, almonds, machengo and walnut-sherry vinaigrette.  Oh so light and tangy.  Jicama and Grapefruit - Dana blue cheese, lardons, citrus-parsley vinaigrette and cornbread.  I'm still unclear what a lardon actually is, but honestly, I don't even care.  It was summery, refreshing and absolutely delicious.Mains:Mojo Chicken - Shaved onions and cilantro, black beans, chopped almonds, golden raisins and basmati rice.  I used to think The Publican had the best roasted chicken in Chicago.  I now give that title to Ruxbin.  I'm convinced that little baby angels had to give up their tears to make this chicken so incredibly moist and tender.  Make at least one person at your table order it.  You won't be sorry.Pan Seared Trout - Bulgar wheat tabbouleh, asparagus, dates and basil.  A word to the wise: Ask for your trout to be seared extra crispy.  The skin just sings when it has a nice crust.Garlic White Wine Mussels - Fines Herbs, Togarashi French Fries.  A monstrous portion, it's a beauty when it comes to the table.  We actually shared this as an appetizer.  Dip those fries in the garlic aioli sauce and be prepared to swoon.Desserts:We went with both the coconut topped panna cotta (yum) and the flourless chocolate cake (meh).  I think this is the Achilles heel of the menu... nothing really sang to me.The service was the one weak point.  While our actual server was my favorite kind of server: Polite, helpful yet unobtrusive, the hostess left me cold.  My party was finishing up our wine when the hostess (without the mostess for sure) asked us if we'd mind evacuating our table so the next party could sit down.  Really?  Rushing us out of the restaurant like that?  DISLIKE.  I understand you have a teeny place, but bouncing patron out leaves them with a sour taste in their mouths.No real damage done, though.  I'm chalking it up to growing pains for a restaurant that has just opened their doors.  Cheers, Ruxbin!"
"Ruxbin is straight up cool, despite its location on Ashland, which I still affectionately refer to as the skid mark on Chicagoland's panties. It's an ugly strip, but Ruxbin's recycled and rugged design is perfect and somehow lovely against the gritty urban landscape.Check out my full review with pictures here:thebuckwheater.com/ruxbin"
"If you are going to elope you can do a lot of things you can't do if you have a formal wedding. One of those things is having the perfect dinner for two at Ruxbin on your wedding night. I had said time and again, "" If only we could have Ruxbin food for our wedding dinner..."" Then I realized that anything is possible and made it happen. Some friends said we were crazy for picking a BYOB that doesn't take reservations for such an important meal. Oh, really? We didn't think so. But we were really lucky  that this was right before Ruxbin was hit with an onslaught of much deserved press.We got there when it opened, were seated right away and proceeded to have the best time ever at our favorite date spot. We were thrilled to be able to have the trout one more glorious time before it was taken off the menu. It really was a perfect meal. We recently were here again and died of happiness while feasting on the chicken and calamari. Thanks, Ruxbin!"
I had another magnific experience in Ruxbin. Appetizers-octopus *****-beets *****Main dishes- Beef & Broccoli*****- Amish chicken *****Desert -Chocolate Pot de Creme *****It's impossible to describe every single detail because they are many and they all very creative and unique.So far it's my favorite restaurant in Chicago.
"1 star review.I think I peeed in the wrong place. Everyone kept raving about how cool the bathroom was, so I saw a section which did not resemble the bathroom, had a huge window which looked upon the street and a table and some chairs and proceeded to pee.oooops.I was wrong. it was just a table in public. not some hip I can see you, but you can't see me pee thing.anyways...(;;shakes head::just kidding::p)1 more star reviewgash darn this place is cute. rustic, non-ikea-ish, actually cool enough to be in my house kind of thingy...wood and orgasmic leather strapped bondage booths which just kept screaming ""oh baby"".(Hey urban belly...this is the look you were going for or should at least be smart enough to steal)1 more star reviewthe people. tables were filled with many yelpers as you can hear their conversations ""OMG I am so yelping this blah blah blah...""

No FUCK ME HARDER NOW...I am COMING!!!(sorry, if you are a prude or under 14 please close  your eyes before you read my sentence above)K town empanadas. so simple. so smart. real freakin maza in the mix, gives the crispy doughy outer shell a tamalesque flavor to balance the kimchi stuffing. 2 empanadas to an order so get like 12 to start for 2 people.Crispy Eggplant - beets, cucumber and crisped eggplant slices in a dill and parsley white sauce that made me and my date(hooker) just go ""OMG... I did it again....baby let me love you down......""1 more star reviewBYOB - $5 cork fee. lickher stores a plenty just down by chicago avenue so get your drink on.1 more star review""this feels NYC"" it is small, one page menu, simple prep, simple presentations, curl your toes food, turn over of tables is a good pace, so in like 20 minutes after you all read this review the line will start behind me...just look for the eclipse of an ass as the light which shines bright here will be blocked by my culo1 more star reviewthis is the end of this review.6 stars!!!!! Did I mention all this and they're not even officially open?!?! Official opening is 6/29 and its this good already. Damn you a sexy bitch.p.s. don't forget the white wine garlic mussels. a big bowl of warming goodness topped with the most awesome frites, for one or do share with someone whom you enjoy sucking their fingers because it is that good."
"So here is the trick to eating at Ruxbin without a wait . . . go on a Wednesday night around 7 but leave all your friends at home and just bring that special someone. Yep. That's what we did and we found ourselves in a cute little restaurant with about half of the tables filled and a staff that was smiling and wanting us to love the place (which we did!). Pull open the door and you will find yourself in a cozy little neighborhood place. We were seated along the wall (lots of two tops) and they did their best to keep people from sitting on top of each other until the place got crowded a little later. It's BYOB so they were quick to open the bottle of wine that we had brought- even helping us to get it chilled to the right temperature quickly. Doesn't look like this place will ever be anything but BYOB as the space is not large enough to host a bar. Seriously. That's how intimate this place is. You do need to check out the surroundings. I think the same designer that did Simones in Pilsen helped out here as there are many of the same recycled items around- like seat belts for the seat bottoms, cool lighting and re purposed wood. Take a look up to the ceiling. It is wall papered with recipes from the chef's recipe book (I asked and it turns out the staff had a party to do the ceiling decoupage- nice touch) We started with the avocado toast which was like a bruschetta. Know that if you don't like the anchovies that come on it- while it does change the flavor a bit- they will make it without that little fish. For our entrees- I had the garlic, white wine mussels with fries delicious!) and my friend had the hangar steak (perfectly prepared). And for dessert? The flourless chocolate cake was just the right touch. Parking was super easy on this stretch of Ashland and because it is BYOB- the entire bill for dinner for two was about $50. And even if you don't have to use the restroom- you need to check it out (you will find it upstairs to the right of the kitchen) The door is one of those revolving darkroom doors (again a repurposed thing) that swivels to let you in. There are signs on how it works but suffice it to say- use this restroom before you consume too much of the wine that you bring or you may find yourself inside the restroom with no clue on how to exit! Crazy name, but great place to enjoy a dinner with that special someone. Now all I wonder is how they make all that great food when the recipes are all up on the ceiling???"
"This place is great! A lot of talk of waiting for tables - yes, it is small - but it is also BYOB and they will let you drink said ""B"" while you wait - so what's the problem again? Also, if you aren't paying for booze, your check shows the results. $40 PP with tip - and that was with 2 bottles of wine!The food here was really great. Garlic fries with aioli? Yes please. The apple, plum and arugula salad with shaved manchego? Hello! Silken tofu tomato tart - even if you aren't a veggie - you want this! Really amazing and rich tasting. And the finish? Pretzel donut and beer-milk sorbet. I mean, you HAVE to, right? Yes. Yes, you do. And you have to go to Ruxbin. Well worth the wait! Just bring your ""B!"""
"I love everything about this place. I love the location. I love the coziness. I love the food (pork tenderloin was amazing as was the crispy eggplant!). I love the super cool bathroom (coolest in Chicago). I love the friendly staff. I love BYOB.But if you aren't there at 6:30 you are going to have to wait, and wait, and wait."
"It's times like this I wish for that Yelp half star to magically appear. For me, this was a solid 3.5 star experience. I loved the decor and the service was really great as well. I also enjoyed the food but did leave thinking I must have missed the boat on why this place is so hyped. Maybe I had just built it up in my mind too much going in? The thing is, I ate there only like a week or two ago and I really can't remember what we tried. I can remember meals I had 3 years ago - so the fact I can't remember what I ate means it didn't leave much of an impression, and for me solid but not memorable is the difference between 3 & 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely an enjoyable dining experience and you can't beat the BYOB. My group also went at 5:30 on the dot on a Sunday to avoid the apparently horrid wait times that most experience, and while there was a small line, we did get seated within a few minutes. So would I go back? If there was no wait, sure, I'd try it again. But since that's probably not happening anytime soon - I'll stay away and leave this place for those that apparently get the hype that is lost on me!"
"As I sit on the can and write this review, I am pleased to note we had a nice dinner here. Service was great. Corkage fee is $5 and byob. On a Sunday no wait if u got there at 530pm when it opens. Now the food. Appetizers were all great. The calamari might've been my favorite. It's not your standard fried calamari u get at TGI Fridays but interesting and different. (sidenote: never buy a Vizio branded tv as it shuts off every few minutes on startup, but I digress). The fries were nothing special to me. The pork belly salad was good but too fatty for me. Maybe I took the wrong cross section piece of it as mine was all fat. The mushroom toast was very good too. For mains, the hangar steak was my fav. Prolly the most filling of the 3 we got. Perectly cooked (i love it almost bloody) with some rich nice sauces on plate.  Sablefish also really good, light soy or mirin flavor, moist and tender, ok size but certainly not huge - regardless I think you'll be full with the richness of the apps or sauces (depending on what u get of course). Their bucatini w clams (their take on jiajia mian) was pretty good but I prefer normal jiajia mian (that said I didnt have the dish in front of me so can't fully evaluate). Surprisingly full. Tab came out to $45 pp all in w an app and main ordered pp. Would def come back to try their Amish chicken and pork since I didn't get to try those."
"Heehee.. Minna A. mentioned me. Ruxbin is pretty small, but it makes the place more cozy/intimate/romantic/exclusive. Orange-brown color scheme going on, which makes me feel hungry and fuzzy inside. Felt New York-y, taxi cab-y and time travel-y. Their bathroom looks like a time machine.( I initially wanted to go here just for that... hahahaha). Best mussels I ever had. Also, everything we ordered was good. Like... good, good. The Ktown empanadas looked like Christmas, smelled like cool ranch doritos, and tasted like Korea/Mexico. Go."
"Steak was good, service didnt do the food justice in my opinion. Was with my family (group of 4) and the waiter forgot waters for the longest time, even after we had gotten our food. Nice enough guy, just not the most attentive."
"Wow wow, and WOW. I was blown away at the food at Ruxbin and the decor.Let's start with the food:We were there for a birthday party and got to sample pretty much every plate on their seasonal menu. If there's one way to sum up everything about Ruxbin... I'd have to say, it's like gathering at a home of a talented chef friend and sampling all the creations he has to offer.. which isn't far from the truth for me. Every dish had full flavor and just tasted.. right. It's hard for me to really describe how happy I was at the experience. Every dish was solid, and you can't go wrong with any of them. My favorite was probably the pan seared trout. Yes, BYOB.Decor: I got to sit down with Vicki and learn about the decor of the restaurant. Everything was repurposed, using such creative materials as a DJ booth, seat belts, leather jackets, recipe books, and church pews. I especially psyched out at the use of a darkroom door for their bathroom door. I really appreciate the amount of thought placed into everything. This is a great place for an intimate dinner for two or a small table of friends."
"Outstanding restaurant!   Inventive cuisine, every dish so carefully and knowledgeably prepared.  Wonderful, cool, urban space...not fussy...very urbane.  Excellent staff.   One of the best restaurants in Chicago in my book."
"It only took one meal but they got me.  Maybe it was the decor, maybe it was the food, maybe even the restroom?  Whatever it was, they most definitely got me.It all starts with the food.  The wifey and I started with the Garlic Fries and Calamari.  The fries were perfectly fried and I've got no shame in saying we plowed through two sides of the tasty chipotle aioli.  The calamari is one of the more unique calamari preparations I've had and it gives a sneak peak into the Korean/Asian influences in many of Ruxbin's dishes.  You don't often see ""forcemeat"" on a menu (I'll admit, I had to look it up myself before ordering), but it's essentially ground sausage meat which means you basically have a chicken and pork sausage inside a tender calamari casing.  I guess you could call that surf in turf?  The korean chili, peanuts, and fennel added further layers of flavor and texture complexities to the dish.With our appetites whet, we moved on to two stellar entrees; the Hanger Steak and the Sablefish.  If you want to talk medley of flavors, then let's talk Hanger Steak first.  The steak, served mid-rare and pre-sliced, comes with a veritable cornucopia of components and garnishes.  Each on their own were quite good, but when I started mixing up components in each bite?  Magical.  Each bite tasted different from the last and I liked it.  Sometimes a little more sweet smoke from the candied bacon, sometimes more garlic & herb from the chimichurri, sometimes a hint of savory umami from the touch of miso that dresses the long beans; the list goes on and on.  My wife's Sablefish was just as fantastic in its own way.  The fish was perfectly cooked and struck a delicate balance between savory soy and sweet maple.  The barley and black tea broth added another dimension of earthiness to the dish.  While Ruxbin is BYOB (another plus), we didn't ""B"" our own ""B"" that night.  Instead I ordered their homemade soda of the day (I recall apple) and we also had the lychee & toasted coconut pana cotta to wrap up our meal.  I wouldn't say either was spectacular, but in all honesty I was still in a daze from those delicious entrees we had just consumed.  I would have gladly taken back my entree plate to lick it clean for dessert.  Service is to be commended as well.  Our server was warm and friendly, which goes a long way if you've been waiting a while for a table.  The space itself is small, but unique and eclectic.  From what I understand, all the decor is re-purposed.  Just like the food, each decorative piece may seem interesting on its own but when you bring it all together it just works.  I also have to mention what is hands down the most unique restaurant restroom I've ever used.  The crazy portal-like rotating door leads you to what feels like someone's secret rock and roll poster hideaway.  I'll likely never say this again in a restaurant review, but I'll say it now.  Check out the restroom (but please wash your hands before you come back).  As most people have mentioned, the wait times can be exorbitantly long.  It's definitely not the place for a big group dinner and is probably better suited for a casual meal for two, maybe four tops.  The wife and I got lucky with our short wait, but it was quite late on a weekday evening.  The secret's out on Ruxbin so plan your meal here wisely and you'll definitely be rewarded with some fantastic eats."
Rest service. Love the small unique atmosphere. Amazing food!
"Ruxbin is amazing!  The wait is the elephant in the room so I'll address it immediately.  Ruxbin does not take reservations so you have to plan on either eating at 5:30 or waiting 1 to 2 hours on a weekend night.  Doors open at 5:30 p.m. so make sure you are there by about 5:20 (there will be a line).  I saw the hostess turn several groups away later in the evening because the restaurant was booked for the entire night.  When you make it to the hostess, she will take your name and phone number, give you an approximate wait time, and call your cell when your table is ready.  While you are waiting, hunt down a couple of nice bottles of wine at one of the many wine shops on Chicago Ave. (Ruxbin is BYO) and have a couple of pre-dinner cocktails at a nearby bar.  Do not wait in the restaurant.The food at Ruxbin is fantastic!  Probably one of the best meals I've had in Chicago and certain the best for the money.  We tried almost everything on the menu and each dish was delicious.  I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said about the food, so I'll simply say you will not be disappointed.Service is wonderful as well.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, unpretentious, and perfectly inconspicuous.  You should know up front that soon after you have finished eating they will ask you, in a very tasteful way, to give up your table.  This may seem off putting to some but given the size of the restaurant and the demand, this is necessary so that everyone who has been waiting is able to be seated before closing.5 stars to Ruxbin!!"
"So we came on a Thursday 715 it was busy the hostess quoted us 45 minutes. We sat down upstairs in the waiting area. She brought us some popcorn a little snack and offered to open our wine. We only waited 20 minutes or so and she came and sat us.its a cute place only seats 32 people. A lively crowd a little noisy but it was ok..We started off with the grapefruit and jicama salad the avocado toast, the Kim chi empanadas and the elotes all were good . Art had the Hanger steak and I had the trout. The hanger steak was ok a little sweet for my liking it was served atop some cauliflower puree and a fennel gastric. My trout however was outstanding. pan seared with a crispy skin and moist and delicious .All in all a good spot. I would def come back."
"Ruxbin has been on me and my boyfriend's list for a while now. We have been trying to save a little cash lately for an upcoming Caribbean vacation so we specifically wanted to try a BYOB. There are a handful of highly rated BYOBs in the city and a couple on our list (Schwa and Goosefoot have yet to be crossed off....yet!) and with our birthdays just around the corner, the time seemed right to visit Ruxbin. We brought a Gavi and a Nebbiolo and fully expected to wait at least a little bit on an innocuous Tuesday night. To our pleasant surprise, we were seating immediately in what my boyfriend considered ""one of the best seats in the restaurant"": a cozy two top tucked up against the wall. The ambiance was ridiculously romantic and soft, albeit a little eclectic. The small menu (another plus for my boyfriend) boasted everything from octopus to oysters to hanger steak and a PBJ dessert. My boyfriend and I are good eaters, and could have probably put down a little more than we did, but we restrained ourselves to three appetizers, two entrees and two desserts. The prosciutto flat-bread was amazing, with aspects of sweet and salty and the trio of oysters was very unique and almost adventurous, as each oyster has a different accompaniment. The octopus was delightful and strange, with an almost BBQ-esque soy sauce. For our entrees, we feasted on the bourride and the pork loin. The bourride, while good, we felt, was the weakest of everything we tried. The pork loin, however, was AMAZING. So fricken moist and flavorful....my mouth salivates just remembering it! Dessert is a must for us as well, so we got both! The PBJ was decent, but paled in comparison to the Corn Pop Panna Cotta. Service was very good. Not in your face at all, but there when we needed it. I've noticed some people complaining about the time in between courses or the wait for the first course. My boyfriend and I love going out to dinner and absolutely loved the coursing. It was, in a word, perfect. We never felt rushed and were able to take our time and enjoy the magical qualities of Ruxbin. If you want to be in and out in an hour, go somewhere else. But if you like to savor every moment of your dining experience, make the trip. I asked our server where the name comes from.....and of course she said the owner's nickname refers to Teddy Ruxpin.....do they realize they spelled the name wrong?!?! Oh well....it was a great experience. And yes, the bathroom is THE BALLS! Even if you don't have to, do yourself a favor and use it."
"Love the food, love the service, love the quirky little bathroom.I really loved the calamari bokkum.  A nice take on typical pan seared calamari with a korean twist.  I liked the trout more than the short ribs.  The trout had a little mediterranean twist with  the tabbouleh and dates and the fish was perfectly seared and had that nice crunch that the skin gets.  YUM.I'd pass on the dessert, the panna cotta was different with the chopped up lychee (probably canned), but nothing spectacular."
"So I made my first trek out to Chicago from LA and I wasn't sure what to expect from the food in the city besides a whole lot of deep dish pizza. A friend of mine who goes to U of C decided to take me to this up and coming place and let me just say... I loved Ruxbin!! It reminded me of Animal back at home and THAT is my favorite restaurant in LA by far! Both restaurants are not fusion... but the chefs don't discriminate - they just pick the perfect flavors from all different cultures and make them work so well together.I really appreciated the thought that went into both the food and the decor of the restaurant. One of the owners came out to talk to us and explained how almost everything in the place is repurpose/recycled... from old church lights to vintage leather jackets. In all my foodie adventures, I had never seen a place that was completed so thoughtfully. I knew the owners were committed when I was told that the ceiling was a decoupage of the chef's own recipe books.On to the food... our group was big enough where we were able to order most of the menu. So I have to say that the following are a MUST:1. Pan Seared Trout : I kept creating the perfect bite of trout, tabbouleh, asparagus, and date... and I wished at that moment that I had ordered this dish for myself instead of having to share it with others! The dates made the flavors of this dish work SO well together that it became my favorite of the night. My only wish was for more dates to make more perfect bites!2. Crispy Eggplant : I'm not a fan of eggplant or cucumbers, but man... this was good. I can't even describe how the flavors worked because individually I would not have thought to put these things together, but somehow it just made complete sense - genius.3. Hangar Steak : The steak melted in my mouth. This was another dish where I put together my perfect bite of steak, kale, and cauliflower puree. Cauliflower puree is amazing... I need to learn how to make it so I can stop making unhealthy mashed potatoes. At first I was worried when I saw kale because I've never had good kale. It has either been too crispy, chewy, or tough. But this kale converted me... if only all kale had this consistency!4. Avocado Toast : First, you can't ever go wrong with avocado period. After some discussion at our table, we figured out that the slight taste of anchovy (which I personally couldn't pick out) made the flavors of this dish just come alive. It's weird because you wouldn't think it would work, but again it just does...5. Elotes :  One of my favorite things to eat is corn. Don't forget to squeeze your lime juice on it and the toothpick can be used again when you're done (so thoughtful). I fell in love. Enough said.Last but not least! Please check out the COOLEST bathroom entrance ever. It's like the speakeasy entrance of bathrooms! You hear about places in NYC like PDT where you enter a bar through a phone booth... but here you enter the bathroom through a dark room door! When you get inside and if you're vain enough like me... you'll notice that the mirror is held in place by forks! So creative...All I have to say is... David Chang, Ruxbin topped my June trip to your NYC Momofuku-Ko... because this place ain't all hype!"
"Delicious through and through! This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It rivals the likes of NY's delectable Blue Hill Stone Barn. This wonderful BYOB find does not take reservations and with the mention in Bon Appetit's ""Top 10 New Restaurants"" list, the lines are incredibly long. If you show up during peak times, plan to wait 3 hours for a table in this little 30 person eatery. The good thing is you can wait it out at Leopold, a Belgian bar / eatery down the street, and sip delicious beers and cocktails. The amazing combination of French-Korean flavors are subtly worked together and the food presentation is meticulous. I've eaten here 5+ times and find excuses to drag my friends and out of town guests here. The downside is the menu doesn't change often enough, which means I'm eating similar dishes each time. Ah well, it could be worse. The desserts: strawberry shortcake with balsamic reduction and lychee panna cotta are delish as are the mussels, the chimichurri hanger steak, and anything pork. Come EARLY, come OFTEN!!"
"My most recent meal at ruxbin was much better than my first meal, about a year ago. I love that they are BYOB and I love that they now take reservations. Service was excellent. My wife and I split the octopus and scallops for starters, and had the black cod and venison for our main course. The black cod was amazing, as were the scallops. The octapus and venison were both very good, just not amazing. I would recommend all these dishes. I think ruxbin is on par with all the other michelin stars in chicago, but at half the price."
"A restaurant for true foodies--garlic fries, the octopus, the scallops.  All delicious.  And now they take reservations, a total bonus."
OMG the hanger steak is quite possibly the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life.  I can't stop thinking about it.
"Absolutely loved this place. Definitely worth going to check it out even if the location is not the greatest since it's not quite in Wicker Park or Bucktown.We didn't have a reservation, so we showed up early on a Saturday night (6pm) and they sat us right away (party of 3!). If you miss the whole BYOB memo like we did, they have a liquor store that will deliver your bottle of wine and it's still a lot cheaper than ordering wine at a trendy restaurant ($25 for a malbec).We ordered 3 appetizers, perfect size for sharing. Garlic fried are AMAZING!!! Also the flatbread and the pork belly were delicious. We still had plenty of space for our main course (we're all girls but we love food). I had the duck and again very impressed with the way it was done, and the zucchini bread complemented the duck quite nicely. My friends got the short rib and shrimp and grits and they were also very happy with the food.Also awesome & unique, their bathroom door!!! Must check it out.... looks like you're taking a trip to back to the future.Would definitely go back!"
"I had been meaning to go to Ruxbin ever since it opened.  I went there for my birthday and had such a great experience, so I would definitely recommend it to absolutely anyone and everyone.HOWEVER, it's important to realize that going to Ruxbin should be thought of as an experience, not just grabbing a quick burger for dinner.  This restaurant doesn't take reservations, so put your name in right when it opens which I think is right around 5pm, otherwise, you might not get a table at all, and by that I mean for the rest of the entire night.  We put in our name at 6pm and still had to wait around 2hrs, which was fine by us.  We went some place else for drinks before heading back.  They were great to us though, offering us complementary garlic frites and also letting us put our bottles of wine in their fridge so that it would be chilled once our table was ready.As expected, everything we ate was extraordinary.  I'm not even going to describe how each item that we ordered tasted because it's not important what we ordered, and I'm sure their menu will change by the time you actually go there, so that makes it doubly not important.  Just go with a small group of friends, order a ton of stuff on their menu, and then share with your whole group so you can taste many different things.  They'll all be great -- you won't have any regrets.Clearly, I only have great things to say about this place. The hostess was very gracious.  Our waiter was knowledgable and friendly.  And last but certainly not least: Ruxbin has the coolest bathroom I've ever been in, which is a weird thing to acknowledge but it's true! A cool bathroom usually means chrome fixtures, some sort of bamboo decorative paper towel holder, but not here.  The entrance to the bathroom is designed like one of those decompression chambers.  It's a little unnerving at first, but such a great interior detail to a fantastic restaurant.  Memorable in every way."
"I kinda expected fireworks and magic in my mouth after reading all the good reviews of this place. While I definitely enjoyed my meal, I left feeling like it could have been better... sigh. I love the idea of Asian influences on American food, because it hits a chord with me being Asian American (cheesy, I know). Atmosphere: A+ awesome ambiance, modern, and chic.Manager/Owner: Sweet, cute, and helpful (she wrote down the artist who did the paintings on a postcard for my boyfriend along with the address of the dude's gallery)Food: A-Lobster soup: Surprisingly, one of my favorite dishes. It was creamy, but not too thick, it was rich, but not overbearing. Hanger steak: Decent, but nothing to cry home to mom about. Well cooked, but needed something extra to kick it up a notch.Mussels w/seasonal orange/saffron broth: Pretty good except my boo and I agree that Belgium style would have been better. Although the broth was definitely unique and I could taste the tang from the orange and the fragrant saffron, I prefer garlic garlic garlic w/ white wine.Panna cotta w/lychee, creme fraiche, and coconut flakes: This was a home run. The dessert was light and the lychee was cut into small bits so it was super refreshing whenever you bit into a lychee chunk. Coconut flakes will always remind me of girl scout cookies so obviously this was going to be a success. A little on the expensive side, but I think some of the money goes towards the amazing ambiance. Great place to take a date!"
I was finally able to try this place and it did not disappoint.  Looking forward to going again.
"Why is this place so hyped? Its light on the wallet for what you get but I was not blown away like I thought I would be. Service was VERY good. But the food was meh. And that is what I am here to review, not the service, or the ambiance, which again is awesome, I would love for my condo to look like the inside of this place. Everything had a weird sharp bit to it, not everything, let me explain. I got:Acorn / pumpkin soup - Very good, obviously seasonal, if I got this and maybe something else I would raise my review to 4 stars but i gotGarlic Fries - Not really that great. The bedford's fries are better and i did not really like the dipping sauce as much. Hanger steak Wrinkled long beans - guh, the meat was really good but the veggies and other accoutrements were odd tasting. Wrinkled long beans? That sounds like an evil wizards pet snake. Pork Loin - gross dude. Did not like this. Something about it seemed off, like everything else, sans the quality of the meat or the service. Apple soda w cinnamon - kinda bland, not really that great. I may give them another shot but I will not go out of my way to come back."
"I debated between a 4 and a 5, but we really had a great experience here. First off, believe the hype. Get here early. This place is tiny and the line forms quickly. We arrived a little after five on a Friday. We were about 15 people back in line for a 5:30 open. They started seating people promptly at 5:30 and after chatting with our host for a few minutes, we got a seat by the window. I was treated to a great view of people trying to get seated and giving me the envious stink eye. I was really surprised at how small it was inside. We weren't cramped in or anything and the vibe was very intimate. For starters, we ordered the garlic fries (yum, garlicky and a nice portion size,) the octopus (my least fave of the night, tender and pretty good, but I expected more of a sear,) and the pork belly salad (really good, great combined with the jicama, grapefruit. and sweet cornbread.) All three appetizers had interesting flavor combinations that worked well. For entrees, we had the beef and broccoli, and the trout. Loved the trout dish. Crispy skin, an olive tapanade surrounding the plate. A really balanced dish. The beef from the beef and broccoli might have been the best individual bite I had all meal. Tender with just the right amount of sweet from the miso butter. The broccoli was a little on greasy side.We ended with the chocolate pot de creme. Better than I expected with just a bit of salt from the bacon cotton candy. Great experience. Glad we got there early."
"From start (seaweed popcorn) to finish (rockyroad dessert) everything was impeccable. The main negative about this place is that the restaurant is pretty small - thus, the long wait to eat here! Do not fear, there are plenty of walkable bars nearby where you can unwind before dinner (hint: head down Chicago).  The hostess is good at calling you to know when the table is almost ready.  This place does Korean fusion right. The pork belly, garlic fries, duck breast, hanger steak, rocky road dessert - everything was fabulous. The only critique about the food is that if you order the Hanger Steak, you don't really have any say in how you have your meat cooked. However, I would just say one word: trust. The end result will be delicious. Don't forget to check out the bathroom!!"
"We were the first people in line, Ruxbin, how come you couldn't seat our party of 6 together, huh? This left a bad taste in my mouth, and I couldn't get on board with the food. Korean jja jang myun noodles came highly recommended, but I found them too clammy. I guess the fries were good, but not enough for me to want to come back and suffer and cringe through mean hipster waiters."
"Visiting from San Francisco, my boyfriend and I wanted to try the best that Chicago could offer. Ruxbin did not disappoint! Excellent service. Cool decor and atmosphere. Excellent food."
"Let me start this review by saying the creativity and quality of ingredients were on par with some of the best restaurants around.  Pricey dishes, slow service and inconsistent execution put a damper on what could have been a great meal.  Under-cooked rice and raw sunchokes were blaring execution issues in both of our $30 entrees.  The portions were very small and I felt like I wouldn't be getting good value even if the dishes were perfectly executed.  The chef was nice enough to come out and credit us one of the entrees which was the reason the review wasn't 1 star.  Seasoned Popcorn Amuse: Not sure what exactly this was seasoned with but we didn't care for itGarlic Fries:  Delicious, excellent appetizer...we ate them all.Beef Soup:  Beautiful presentation, healthy ingredients and clean flavors.Apple-sesame Soda:  Not the best soda ever but I enjoyed it and certainly gets points for creativityShort Rib w/ ramen risotto and brussel sprouts:  Beef and Brussels were great but the portion was very small and again the tiny amount of rice was unpleasantly chewy/mealy not al-dente reminded me of chewing uncooked instant ramenSteamed Branzino w/ Cauliflower Puree, roasted sunchokes and fried spine:  The fish was nice and although the spine looked nice for presentation it tasted pretty gross.  When I tried to eat a sunchoke it was rock hard...I had to spit it out.After the long wait for the badly executed entrees we knew we weren't going to order desert.  At this price point, I won't accept less than great service and perfect execution.  Needless to say I won't be back...there are so many other restaurants that I am excited to try."
"If I could I would give this place 6 stars.  Unbelievable!!!  Once you  taste you will never forget!  It'll keep you wanting to come back!!!  except the long line, every day.  :( we happened to go there on a random wednesday at like 5:30 - waited for an hour and 15 minutes (we went to the Bedford Lounge a few blocks away so it wasn't a bad wait!) and when we finally sat down, ordered and got our food - we were pleasantly surprised!  The place is byob and has very limited seating.  The dishes we ordered - Chicken, Steak, mushroom toast, pork belly salad, the fries - were all superb!  Their dessert - it was chocolate something - was even more devine!  Very down to earth service.  ALSO, Ruxbin does NOT have a walk in cooler!!!!!  need I say more???  their stuff is FRESH!  a lot of it is from local farms, hence organic, free range, etc. that's important to us so we were happy to find it!  I am most definitely going back.  And i would MOST definitely recommend this place to others!  Please don't mind the wait and the location - it's all worth it!"
"Wow. It took me this long to write a review about this place. Okay, it also takes me forever to actually write a review these days. I could gush on and on about how much I love this place. Each and every time I have been here, which last count was five, I have enjoyed myself. Those friends and clients I have sent here, have come back with raves. BUT WHY!?!?Let's take a ride, a ride I like to call the delicious fun time train. The DFTT for short. The inside is eco friendly, which always is a plus for me. It is creative, I mean check out the bathroom, fun, cozy, comfortable. It is open, you can hang out upstairs while you wait for your table and check out the chef's rocking out some great food.Oh and the food! I still dream about the chicken and waffles rendition they did, savory cheddar waffles, covered with the crispiest of fried chicken and chicken skin whilst drizzled with the tender kiss of orange butter. Crack I tell ya! Their versions, yes versions, of calamari always tend to be my favorite. My favorite was over this summer with their grilled calamari, which was cooked to perfection, covered in a not too hot chili sauce and peanuts. One of my favorite dishes along with the ""now I am missing"" K Town empanadas. Truly I have never had a bad dish her, but I certainly have had my issues with my stomach for not being able to fit any more of them in. Staff has always been friendly, welcoming and always gracious. Never have I felt rushed even though the space is small and seating is limited. With no reservations this can be difficult, thankfully there are bars in the area. Oh wait, did I mention the BYOB factor here? 'Cause that is always a great thing, although I tend to limit it as not to ling too long for the next awaiting guests. (Come on now, let's not be rude)Price point has also always been pleasing, in fact the whole darn place is pleasing. To all of my senses and well deserving of all of the praise they are getting. I look forward to the next ride on the DFTT here and I am sure it won't disappoint."
"I have been hearing about Ruxbin from everyone I know. The reviews are always the same. ""It's AMMMMAAAZING!""""Long wait, but worth it!""So last night, three of my girl friends and I decided to have a Tuesday night dinner at the legendary Ruxbin. We figured that maybe the wait would be on the lighter side since it was a gross, rainy, Tuesday night out. My girl friend arrived at the restaurant at 6:30pm to put our name down.  The restaurant was already packed without a single table available. They told her the wait would be approximately 1.5 hours. The rest of our party soon arrived, and we enjoyed some champaign upstairs in the waiting area.  Then I started to get annoyed. There were tables and tables who were done w/their food, just sitting and taking their sweet old time. But I thought, hey I'm sure the food is worth it. The place is cute. It's very small....maybe ten tables. The host and servers are all very nice. So we finally sat down at 8:30pm.....after waiting for two hours. It's a very small menu, and since we had TWO hours to kill time, we had already decided on what we were ordering before we even sat. We sure weren't going to waste a minute as soon as we sat!For appetizers, we ordered the following: -Apple/Plum salad- this was great and citrusy-Pork Belly salad- think I'm done with pork belly, it's the same everywhere, nothing special-Mushroom toast- mild mushroom, nice citrus flavor. Nothing to write home about.Entrees:- Bucatini and clams- I liked this dish; it had a red bean sauce and clams. Now that I reflect back on it, it was my fave entrée.- Sablefish- mild, white fish. Very nicely done. I would think about buying and making sablefish at home. It almost tastes like bass.- Hanger steak- again nice, but nothing spectacularDessert:- Panna Cotta- quite yummySo I'm giving this restaurant three stars. I'm kind of fearing fellow yelpers throwing rotten tomatoes my way. BUUUUUTTTT...here is my rationale. Although the food was good, it was not AMAZING. I don't believe it warranted a two hour wait. If there was no wait, I would give it four stars. I compare this place to Mana food bar, which is another very small restaurant with a VERY long wait on division. But my god, their food is SOOOOO innovative, and delicious, and well worth the two hour wait. I think that's the bottom line here. There are so many restaurants popping up all the time...what do you have that's innovative and new? Was Ruxbin good? Absolutely! Was it memorable? Not so much."
"Our new favorite byob!  First you have to read Colleen C.'s review.  Yes, better with a small group, decor is re-purposed quirky, no reservation means that you shouldn't go at rush hour on Friday and Saturday night.   Once you are seated, endulge in everything on the menu.  We had the K towm empanadas, calamari, crispy eggplant & beet salad, plus one entree of chicken and waffles.   And we had just enough room to order the bread pudding dessert.  We finished every single droplet of food and sauce on each plate."
"4.5...I loved my meal, the service, and the ambience.  The prices were just right for the experience.I had the egg yolk raviolo, which was spectacular.  My boyfriend loved his I had fish and spaetzle dish.  We also were delighted with the rocky road.The downside: no reservations, we had a 2.5 hr wait when we came at 6pm on a sat to get a seat.  Also, the garlic fries were overly salty.  We walked over to Lush and had a glass of wine and a plate of cheese prior during our wait."
"I am in utter shock that you could get me to wait 2 hours for ANYTHING, especially on a cold, rainy Tuesday night, when all I want to do is warm my ass by the fire and watch re-runs of Will & Grace all night long.  Yet, by powerful demand and cajoling, I was sent into the night, to Ruxbin for what could only be the most earth-shattering dining experience of my life. Unfortunately that's the hype Ruxbin has to compete with....with a lot of media attention and accolades comes insanely high expectations.  So I won't pretend to be completely reasonable in this review. I waited 2 hours, I want a gastro-gasm and great service. Once seated, our service was great, but we were pretty easy to please.  We'd already had AMPLE time to memorize the menu and promptly placed our orders.  Appetizers:Pear Apple Salad - Good acidity, not worth 2 hoursPork Belly Salad - No me likey...ok I'm an idiot, is it possible for pork belly to be TOO fatty? This piggie must have been seriously obese. Not very flavorful either.Mushroom toast - Ymm oh yeah, this is good! Ricotta and lemon zest, very nice.Entrees:Bucatini - ick, no bueno. ...clams were dried outSablefish - ooh! new and interesting flavors with the tea broth, here's something to write home aboutHanger Steak - delicious, well cooked and good quality meat. But you can get this at other places, bonus they take reservations.Here's my recommendation....TAKE RESERVATIONS, please lord! I enjoyed the service and the BYOB.  But I dont know how many times I will be able to put up with a 2 hour wait. Not to mention, I was forced to give diners the stink eye if they appeared to linger too long or reach for another bottle of wine. If you're the more patient sort (I am not), go to Ruxbin and bring a book of Sudoku or chatty friends you have a lot of catching up to do...maybe have a protein shake before you leave home to sustain you for the long haul...."
"Outstanding and BYOB is a nice perk!  Four of us went to dinner and all shared our appetizers and entrees:Appetizers: Octopus, Pork Belly, Soup, and Flatbread - all mouthwatering. My favorite had to be the Pork Belly.Entrees: Egg Yolk Raviolo, Black Cod, Duck Breast, and Pork Loin - all plates were licked clean. No left overs. My least favorite was the Egg Yolk Raviolo, Shitake Broth is not my cup of tea.  My favorite was a toss up between the Black Cod and Pork Loin; both were delicious. The wait for a table for 4 was about 2 hours.  Good thing my friends live nearby and the restaurant will call you when your table is ready..."
"Best meal I've had in Chicago.We snagged a reservation for a 4-top on a Sunday eve (the only day they take reservations) and stopped by The Noble Grape down the street to pick up a couple of bottles on the way to this intimate, DIY-refurbished-themed space. Ruxbin, to be sure, is tiny, and the quality of the food they churn out of their little kitchen is astonishing. We knew about all the accolades from national magazines and such, yet we were still blown away. The dishes are composed with such discipline, and the variety of ingredients and flavor profiles engaged in each dish were spot-on, every time. And when you peek into the kitchen while waiting for the bathroom (which, by the way, made me laugh out loud once I got in), and you see Chef Kim in there looking like he's performing a triple bypass, you know this is one deliberate man.Apps were outstanding:a) Grilled Octopus - best grilled octopus I've had in many years. The black soybean spread and --hello!-- grapes(!) were such a wonderful surprise. b) Leek soup - light, mellow, great.Mains raised the bar even higher:a) Hanger steak - exceptional. It's easy to slack on hanger because it's already so flavor rich, but the combinations on this dish were fantastic. The heirloom potatoes were clearly under the influence of bacon fat. Chef, you devil, you. b) Salmon - very good -- maybe not as lauded as the other two dishes.c) Saddle of spring lamb for two - certainly not cheap ($60?) but some of the freshest lamb I've had. How do you identify lamb as fresh? I'm not sure. You know how a fresh oyster just tastes like the ocean? This lamb just tasted like... spring. Desserts (one of each)a) Rocky Road - super creative, amazing, blah blah blah.b) Upside down pineapple cake - the only dish of the night that we weren't bowled over by but light enough to be a graceful note to end the evening on.Service was excellent -- warm and friendly but not intrusive. Our server even brought out an ice bucket to keep our bottle of white chilled. Prices are very reasonable (what with the BYOB) and portions are ample. We will definitely be back, but most likely only on Sundays when we can make sure we have a table waiting for us."
"shitchyeah.  i thought the food was pretty damn good, and the ambiance was even gooder.  we waited less than 30 min - BYOB.  we, like, SO brought it.  it was me, my bff and her chef boyfriend .  we ordered:OCTOPUSGrilled with Chickpeas, Pickled Green Onions, Radish, Black Soybean, Grapes, Ginger-Scallion VinaigretteFLATBREADDrier's Ham, Goat Cheese, Pickled Peaches, Fennel, HazelnutsTUNAHorseradish, Raw Zucchini, Miso-Carrot Puree, Citrus Vinaigrette, BonitoDUCK BREASTBaby Greens, Shaved Fennel, Snow Peas, Orange, Mustard Vinaigrette, Zucchini BreadDAY BOAT SCALLOPSSummer Succotash of Root Vegetables, Pork Belly, Dandelion & Legumes, Grilled Corn, Poblano Beurre BlancARCTIC CHARBERRY SHORTCAKEMarket Berries, Whipped Creme Fraiche, Balsamic Vinegarstarted off with some yummy popcorn.  i have to say, i thought it was awesome, but the portions were tres small.  we ated everything.  everything.  and im usually one who doesn't finish everything on her plate.the ambiance is sooooooper awesome.  i've never been anywhere like this.  yes, the bathroom is THA shit.  true story.  i love love loved the decor.the service was great.  the server, who was tested by the chef boyfriend, did a great job at answering any questions he had.  we paid about $50 per person.  quality = great.  quantity = mediocre.this would be a great place for a 3rd date, or some sorta small celebration, like the Hot Shot of the Year award.  i think i'll be back, pending said award."
"What can I say, Ruxbin is awesome.  My wife and I have been here twice and both times the food and the service have been outstanding.  This restaurant deserves to receive a Michelin star and is better than some of the current recipients in Chicago.  Plus it's BYOB, what's not to like!  FYI, Ruxbin does not accept AMEX."
"We came here at 7-ish and there was already an hour wait, but our hosts assured us it was worth it. Thus, we put our name down and received a call when our table was almost ready. Nice policy, that.They also offer BYOB with a minimal corkage fee. Nice policy, that.Finally, the decor is made of entirely of refurbished material, and their bathroom is a former darkroom plastered with posters from indie rock's finest. Nice decor, that.But most importantly, the food: fantastic. The chef is Korean-American, but there's much more of a southern cooking feel to all his dishes. The one signature Korean American dish is his K-Town Empanadas, a wonderful fusion you'd think would be found at some trendy restaurant in downtown LA.Being from Houston, I'm a huge fan of the chicken & waffles concept, so that's definitely what I had to get. The waffle is decent, but the chicken was fall of the bone fantastic; had it not been for a mind-blowing fowl experience at Takashi (yelp.com/biz/takashi-chi…), this may have been the chicken to end all chickens.The dessert wasn't anything special, seeing as how I can't remember how it tasted."
"I'm starting an anti-microgreens movement.  I just don't care about them.  I don't think they make your meal any better, and they generally just piss me off.  DOWN WITH MICROGREENS!How does one rate a place that is excellent but just a little less excellent than you assumed it'd be? Ruxbin is great.  The food, the cozy atmosphere & the service make for a really nice evening.  I think with the lengthy waits and tremendous hype, I just expected to be blown away.  I wasn't.  I was just really happy with the meal.  We had three appetizers, each of which were excellent to good.  Starting from excellent, the pork belly was perfectly cooked and it came with a cubic centimeter of cornbread that I wanted another pound of.  The calamari was confusing (""Chicken & Pork Forcemeat, Potato Confit, Korean Chili, Peanuts, Pickled Fennel, Pea "") but great, and the mushroom toast was just good.  It was a little hard to eat and the microgreens made an appearance, but was definitely good.  As entrees, two of us had the hanger steak, which was where my general lack of excitement really set in.  Don't get me wrong.  It was great, well cooked and delicious, but it wasn't overly interesting in any way.  Meg L had the Bucatini, which was interesting, and showcased what Ruxbin is supposed to be all about.  Perfect thick noodles like few things you've ever eaten before, a great sauce and clams.  It was special, and when you take the time to go to a place like Ruxbin, you want special."
"I'm not usually a American/Fusion/Contemporary fan but Ruxbin does it right.Ruxbin is super small and does not take reservations so if you're trying to come, you should come early early or be flexible about waiting. Came here in the summer. Their menu changes seasonally. I had a cold japanese soba noodles with some pickled veggies, poached egg. It was clean, and delicious. We also started with some fries and aioli. Portions were just irght. Everything was good - it didn't blow my mind. I would probably come again to check out a new menu. Their flavors are clean, crisp and simple. I think they try to play that up in all their dishes. Good stuff."
"I had a great experience at Ruxbin, asides from the super long wait. It's true, expect at least a 2 hour wait even if you drop your name off with the hostess at 5:30PM (the time they open). So it helps to bring an extra bottle of wine to drink in their outdoor ""waiting"" section.From the menu we tried the following for apps/entrees:- Garlic fries- Calamari with potatoes- Pork loin- Hangar steak- HalibutI found everything to be delicious. Not only that, you can tell how the chef put a lot of thought into how all the flavors of each dish would marry with each other perfectly. The only thing is the food came out lukewarm, but I wonder if that had anything to do with the ""summer season"" menu. I'll have to come again in the Fall/Winter to see if they've considered how temperature plays into their seasonal menus.At the end of the meal, we had the panacotta and berry shortcake. The berry shortcake was complimentary from Ruxbin because it was my birthday (yay!). So delicious. I loved both of the desserts. I could've eaten both on my own!If you haven't been here yet, do the following:- Come at 5:30PM to drop your name off with the hostess, you can even request that they call you when the table is nearly ready- Only come with a few people, no more than 4- Bring a couple of bottles- Enjoy the decor- Go to the bathroom, it's part of the decor experience- And of course, share the food!!"
"Heard about the wait at Ruxbin but friend and I came right at 5:30 on a week night and was seated immediately. Their garlic fries were delicious and flat bread (goat cheese, pear, arugula, etc.) appetizer was good as well. Entrees were on the smaller side but hangar stake and the seafood dish (forget what its called but has seafood medley, white beans, white broth) were delicious. Flavors are spot on and all their dishes are good for sharing. There's a $5 cork fee for BYOB.  Glad I went and would love to come again and also try out Mott St, their sister restaurant."
"I'll cut right to the points:1) Appetizer (octopus) was good, not great.  Entree (Halibut) was excellent.2) Portions are small and not cheap for the area (Halibut=$30, maybe 6 oz or less of fish). I was still hungry and would consider myself an average eater. They give you a little bowl of popcorn instead of bread.  I would think a grown average size man having an appetizer and entree will leave hungry.3) Service was pleasant, but there was a very long wait between my appetizer and entree. 4) BYOB is always a plus to me.Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars for excellent flavors, small portions and being expensive for the neighborhood."
"The food was incomparable, the services was phenomenal (thanks to Holly!), and the atmosphere was unique. Oh, and it's BYOB. This place is worth the wait! I heard about Ruxbin before and was a little negative about the idea of a restaurant with no reservations, but we found ourselves looking for dinner at 8:30, popped in and lucked out with someone else who couldn't wait any longer and we took their spot on the list (still another 40 minutes to wait). I was skeptical, but let me be perfectly clear on this: waiting three hour to eat at Ruxbin is undeniably worth it!  We didn't wait three hours, but I would in the future."
"Yay, Ruxbin! I came here on Tuesday night with my friend Zoe H., who had forward me their website earlier that week. As soon as I walked in, the hostesses were so great and accommodating! Our waiter continued to stop by our table and ask us if we were doing alright, so we were really pleased with the service over all!It's BYOB people! I forgot that on my way over here, and didn't remember to bring a bottle :(Ruxbin is great! We ordered the KTown Empanadas (aka kimchi-stuffed fried pastry), the Avocado toast (sooo... goood. They drizzle really yummy balsamic under the toast. sooo goood), the Garlic White Wine Mussels (GARLIC HEAVEN) and the Miso Tofu (sweet, crunchy fried goodness...)We downed the ENTIRE huge meal (the mussels come in abundance!), so sadly didn't have room for dessert, but it was awesome!!!We also loved the interior. The seats were made from refurbished materials (I sat on what appeared to be a theater-style bench?) and the benches along the wall had backs made from seat belts! I also loved that the ceilings were covered wallpaper-like with pages ripped from a cookbook! I love that idea, and love seeing it when it re-emerges in interior design! We also got to sit near the designer that night, but was too shy to say anything :)P.S. THE BATHROOMS are so cool. I walked into the pod, and the waiter said, ""just turn"" ""uhhh... whaaa?"" haha I can't explain, just go check it out :)"
"Yum Yum Yum. I love the decor, the chef's cookbook library is the wallpaper, the use of old classroom furniture is the lighting and the bathroom is just fun.I tried most of the menu and I love the avocado toast, pan seared trout, and my absolute favorite the lychee panna cotta with coconut. Best for hot summer in Chicago."
"I have been here a couple of times. The food is always excellent. I went in last night and did not get a table or food. While food matters a lot, service and the staff matter just as much or more. The hostess took my number and stated she would call when a table was ready. No call for the evening. Since the management for the front of the house is so poor I will be putting this place on my pass list. Hopefully the owner(s) will want to welcome customers and create a dining experience that people will want to frequent. Not worth the time or risk of not not having dinner for the evening. Go to a place that wants to earn your patronage."
"Great food, interesting menu and super friendly and helpful wait staff.  It's BYOB so plan ahead and come early.  It's worth the wait."
"The food was great (5 stars) and, strange as it might be to say this, the bathroom is a highlight of the restaurant. But this place loses a star for being a little too into their ""house rules."" The waitress was stern, bordering on rude, when we asked about making a SLIGHT modification to our order. Still, I will be back."
"Tasty restaurant with a charming atmosphere, but probably not worth all the trouble to get into."
"If are looking for a nice BYO that is fairly priced this place is good choice.  I had both the Crudo of the day and the Pork Belly for app, they were both great.  My wife had the flat bread which was wonderful as well. For the main course I had the duck and my wife the pork.(Both were straight forward but very good)We shared the Panna cotta dessert. I gave this place five stars, not really for the food alone.  In reality one can have everything we had at many other places in the city at the same level as Ruxbin.  But, combine the quality of the food with the price, atmosphere( extra cool repurposing decor) and the BYO, and you have a five star must go to to place!Ruxbin knows what we want. A nice casual place with great food at a fair price where we don't get buyers remorse in the morning.Cheers"
Ambiance is what I would expect for something 1/3 of the price. But the food more than makes up for it. Maybe some of the best fish I've ever had
"I'd like to open by saying I had been openly giddy about coming here for MONTHS. I had tried two other times (unsuccessfully) to get in for dinner at Ruxbin since it first opened, and once the Bon Appetit list came out, I knew I needed to jump on it before the whole world got in line.  A group of 6 of us checked in at 5:45pm on a Tuesday, and there was already a 90 minute wait. There's only one table that accommodates parties that big, so if you're dining with more than 3 people, I recommend pressing your face against the front door at 5:28 for the best chances of being seated first. You're allowed to walk around after checking in, and they'll call you when your table is ready. We wandered for a bit then got chilly and decided to get started on one of the bottles of wine that we'd brought in the ""lounge"" area up a few steps from the host stand. The lounge was already packed (it was about 6:45 at this point) and the two benches were already taken, so it felt a little like a standing room-only holding cell. We asked for glasses for our wine but were told they were all being washed and they'd bring us some when they were clean. We waited glassless about 20 minutes, then our table was called.We started with the garlic fries (awe-inspiring; we wondered aloud if we could convince them to start delivery just for these), the flatbread (topped with beet chips and assorted veggies, yum), and the endive caesar salad (deconstructed and pretty to look at, but quite small with about 8 endive leaves). Two of my friends ordered the pork loin (I stole two bites and had INSTANT entree envy), one ordered the clam bake (we all took turns stealing her bread and dipping it in the amazing broth), and I decided to share the soba noodles and halibut with the only pescetarian friend of the bunch. The halibut was to die for, poached in olive oil and sitting atop a perfectly crispy/soft cake of steamed rice....The soba noodles, however, were hopelessly, tragically inedible. I knew it would be a cold noodle dish when I ordered it, but something about the horseradish granita (crushed ice) melting over noodles was very off-putting. I took one bite before pushing it away--the initial flavors were strange, but the aftertaste felt especially ""off"". I offered it to the friend who was sharing with me, and she also could not make it past her first bite. Intrigued by our reaction, two more people at the table had a little taste and agreed that it was just... unappetizing. As a very open-minded and adventurous diner, I was honestly shocked to encounter the first dish I just could. not. eat. I guess there's a first for everything!Our server came by to clear the last plates, and upon seeing the still-full bowl of soba, asked if we didn't like it. We said unfortunately we didn't, and something about it just didn't work for us. She offered to bring us something else to replace it, but since everyone else was already done eating, we just asked for the dessert menu. We ordered both desserts, the panna cotta and the shortbread with berries, both of which both were AMAZING. We basically licked the bowls clean. When our check arrived, we saw that we'd still been charged for the uneaten soba, which I found rather disappointing. I work for a small group of restaurants and dine out regularly. I've always felt it was standard practice (as well as a nice gesture) to either remove the returned item off the check, or make up for it with something small on the house (such as a dessert, in our case). I wonder, if we had taken the offer to order a replacement entree, would that be added to the bill as well?My sharing friend and I left hungry and got slices from Pizza Metro on the walk home. However, everything else about the meal was absolutely lovely. Just skip the soba noodles and you'll leave happy!"
"Hellz Yeah!  This place is fan f-ing fantastic!Hubs took me to Ruxbin to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived at 5:35 and no joke the line was about 40 people long (Saturday night).  Luckily we brought an umbrella because it started to rain.  A few folks ahead of us left because they didn't think to brin an umbrella (lucky us).  About 30 mins the line started to move.  We got the very last 2 top at the first seating.  Woo hoo!We were greeted by Rick our server, who suggested we order one appetizer each and one entree.  Because we are fat a$$es we did 4 appetizers.  We ordered the salad with manchengo, apple fennel and walnut.  This was light and refreshing. The grilled octopus was delicious!  This was the most tender octopus I've ever eaten in my entire life.  The black soy paste sauce completed the dish so perfectly, both the hubs and I were fighting to get the last piece.  We ordered the flat bread with grilled peaches, omg it was devine!  I loved the crunch of the flat bread with the tartness of the mesclun and the sweetness of the peaches.  As an after thought we added the fries, because I'm fat and wanted to try everything.  It was good, but then again it's Just fries and not really as awesome of what we just ate.For our dinner entrees we had the pork roast and the day boat scallops.  Both were fantastic.  The pork was perfectly cooked and accessorized with these creme brûlée like figs.  (which I need to learn how to make figs).  And the day boat scallops were terrific!  By the time we got to dessert, quite frankily I was revelling in food heaven and not to mention 3 sheets to the wind because we were pretty much done with the second bottle of wine. So the desserts we good, but I can't remember the specifics.  We ordered the brownie sundae and the pretzel and beer doughnuts.  Delicious.If you get a chance, go to the restroom.  I felt like Clark Kent.  You'll know what I mean.Overall, from start to finish I was extremely impressed with everything at Ruxbin.  So when you see the line at the door.....yes this place is worth the wait."
"Worth the wait. Sat outside for 30 min with a group of 4, once inside the service was good and all of the group loved their meals, especially the rocky road dessert! I also love BYOB places"
"I'll pile on and agree with all those who say not to let the line deter you.  Ruxbin is an absolute neighborhood gem.  I've been there several times now, and like a fine wine seems to be getting better with age.  The food is interesting and well executed.  The short ribs are really amazing.  The ambiance and food presentation shows off the owners creative side and is done well.  I truly don't have a bad thing to say other than I wish it was easier to get in.  Hmm, maybe I shouldn't be writing this.For those that can't handle the wait, they do now take reservations on Sundays."
"What? i just realized i have been Ruxbin several times but never written a review on yelp, definitely an oversight on my part (or maybe secretly i just don't want others to go so i can get a table there) :)We love this place, you get to bring your fav wines and the food are always inventive and seasonalrecently we tried the calamari, mushroom toast for appetizers, both very food but with the mushroom toast being the starthen we shared the bucatina & clams, pork loin and sable fish (the latter 2 are the best)rounded the dinner with the berry shortcake (just awesome)service was great and no doubt we'll be back again soon"
"Was at Ruxbin for V-day dinner. Got there early enough to get a table without a wait time. I wanted to try this place out for a long time. The decor of this place is uber-cool. Very interesting and unique and the service rocks. The decor is really kitschy and a little rustic. On to the food... most of it was great, and some of it was ok. That's why the 4 stars.We started off with the garlic fries and their house sodas. The house soda (apple cider and something) was refreshing and delicious. It paired great with the garlic fries. The fries were awesome and very very addictive with the aoli. Then we had the mushroom toast - this was good too. The texture of the biscuit was a little soggy (my husband thought it was fine, but he thought it needed some acid) - but we finished the whole thing - so clearly we liked it. My husband, being a vegetarian ordered the Mushroom etouffe with the cauliflower steak - this was topnotch. I really appreciate a place which puts some thought into the veggie entree and not just make a random risotto like most places do. There were a lot of textures in the dish and cauliflower was delicious!! Loved it. I ordered the Bucatini with clams - this was ok. I was not a big fan. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish - I should have ordered the sablefish. The mussels were a little gritty and it was just ok. But overall it was a great meal and is a must visit for the foodies in Chicago - and it is BYOB. We didn't have room for dessert, but they gave us a little treat as it was V -Day - lavender infused mini-meringues and they were OMG! delicious!! They totally put a big smile on my face. Oh - and dont forget to check out the restroom, I was left intrigued!!"
"Lovely. Lovely lovely lovely.I read all your tips and prepared to wait and then once seated, sweat it out. We were given a 30 minute window, handed over a phone number and went in search for a cocktail elsewhere. Almost 30 on the nose, we killed our Matildas and headed back over to the smiling host (and a perfectly acceptable interior temperature).Seated near the window, we got down to business. The most amazing thinly sliced salmon that we scarfed up and still are talking about three weeks later. The pork belly didn't stand a chance. Perfectly cooked, savory, just sweet enough and coursed with just enough time between it and the salmon. The mains (halibut and the hanger steak) were good, don't get me wrong, but the starters were the clinchers for us. Coupled with minimal but kind service and the right choices for our BYO-wines, it was pretty much a spot-on place for a lovely dinner. But that bathroom confused the heck out of me, y'all."
"After talking about going to Ruxbin for what felt like ages; we finally dined here last week with our friends who just moved into the neighborhood. I don't know if it was all the hype/anticipation but Ruxbin didn't impress me in the way that I was expecting. There's not a tremendous amount of reason to pick apart every dish since it's been done time and time again in all the other reviews but the thing that really stood out for me (in the wrong way) was that Amy really wanted the Hangar Steak but can't eat red meat cooked less than medium well and the server obnoxiously told her that ""the kitchen makes no alterations to the menu"". No where on the menu did it state that the steak was cooked only medium rare and to me a substitution is swapping out ingredients, not requesting meat cooked to a particular temperature. Anyway, I went with the Hangar steak for myself and laughed at the fact that it came out cooked no less than medium well anyway. If you're going to be a stickler about meat temps, at least get them f'in right. :-)"
"Fantastic Fantastic food, i mean this is what i'm talking about, creative and delish, i was told i have to go back again because it's supposed to be better the 2nd time around. I guess we will to see.Be careful the wait is usually long, and they don't take reservations. BYOB. wine stores just around the corner, definitely walking distance, and the wait will be more than enough. But the food is worth the wait. Looks good, tastes good, and is good."
"Good food but terribly small portions for the price. Popcorn instead of bread when you first walk in is different but they desperately need that bread to fill up their customers! Even after a $75 meal, we ended up going to a 2nd place afterwards to fight the hunger."
This was an interesting space (all salvaged materials) and the food was quite a sensory experience. I am giving Ruxbin 4 stars because it is really expensive for the size of the dishes and I came hungry and left hungry. The restaurant is BYOB which is nice because you can spend your money on food and avoid the cost of drinks.
"We have been wanting to come here forever but were intimidated by the idea of not being able to make a rezy and having to wait a long time for our table.  (My patience is really something I could work on!)A few Fridays ago we had a babysitter and decided it would be a good night to go for it. My husband stopped in Ruxbin on his way home from work on a Friday and put in his name at 6.  They told him they would call him when our table was ready.  We went to a nearby place and grabbed a drink and waited. They called us by 7 and we headed over.We loved the atmosphere inside!! Really well done!  I loved the lighting. (Make sure you check out the trippy bathroom!!)The service was great and the chef was friendly.  (He would chat people up as you were waiting in line for the bathroom.)Our food was over the top yummo! We started by munching on the garlic fries- can't go wrong there! I ordered the Hanger Steak and my husband got the Pork Loin! Both of us were pleased! My husband claimed his was better but I think mine was. Oh, I also got one of their homemade sodas. Super tasty.  Due to it being BYOB we got out of there without spending a fortune but felt like we had been out for some fine dining! We will definitely be back and can't wait to bring friends there to introduce them to this gem!"
"After two trips to Ruxbin I can say that it is consistently good.  The bottomline is that the food is really creative and the service is excellent.  I recommend the sausage stuffed calamari, fries (yes, I know they are really good) for appetizers.  For entrees try the specials.  We split their chicken recommendation and their vegetarian entree for the evening and thought both were exceptional.  Most important, no reservations.  Make sure you get there really early.  We arrived at 5:15 last time and got one of the last tables in the first seating."
"Food was delicious, setting was intimate and cool, service was excellent and to top it off, it's BYOB!!. This little hidden gem is what it's all about.  Triple threat.  I had the chicken, my date got the trout.  What can I say, I can't rave enough about this place.  We went on a friday night, naturally when my date told me they didn't take reservations and said the wait could be long depending on when he put the name is...I was a bit shocked at first.  We didn't wait too long, think we got a call within 40 min or so.  Unbeknownst to me..the ""wait"" was definitely worth every drop of that food.  I got to chit chat with the owner after dinner as we were one of the last people left and they were so nice and friendly and just very down to earth.  I'd definitely recommend this place and would go again in a heart beat."
"We went here last night for a special occasion dinner, food was incredible, even better then I was hoping for. We shared the crudo and octopus appetizers which were both outstanding. The octopus was so tender I almost couldn't believe it was actually octopus. For the main course we had the hanger steak and duck breast both cooked to perfection. Both had a unique and delicious combination of sides. We had to try one of each for the dessert, who could pass up rocky road and a panna cotta? Both were outstanding, truly unique with perfect flavor combinations. The decor is unique and perfect for the space and our server, Selina(sorry if I misspelled your name) was a delight. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the food and the restaurant in general. Overall an A+ experience!"
"I have been three times now & planning to go again tomorrow.  Every time I have been the entire staff & kitchen has been great.  My favorite motto for those of you that have had problems, it's nice to be nice to the nice.  Great job guys food is extremely solid love sitting up at the chefs table, see you tomorrow."
"Cute decor, great service,  awesome food,  BYOB, the best chicken and waffles EVER!   A MUST TRY!08/2010I can't get over how amazing Ruxbin is. Every time, every single time it's just amazinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng ! Congrats on the Bon Apetit #5 best new restaurant in the US. Well deserved. I was just there tonight and I just want to say thank you for the fantastic meal! Be back soon. 11/10/2011"
"Yum, this was the best restaurant I've tried during my 1.5 weeks stay in Chicago.  The decor was antique looking, not sure how to describe it but it was cool.  The bathroom was unique, I was afraid to go in initially.  Service was great.Had the mushroom toast: delishBucatini & Clams- not badSablefish- soo good, the way they cooked it reminds me of jap fusion placesChocolate thing for dessert was unique- it had bacon bits but i liked the chocolate pudding at the bottom, smooth and creamyHomemade soda- i think i had the apple flavored one and it is worth a tryWill def come back next time I'm in town."
"Love this place!I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday... the BYOB option saved me a few bucks since we ended up drinking a bottle of wine during our wait, and another for dinner. Be warned: we went on a Tuesday evening, got there at 5:40 (they open at 5:30) and there was already an hour and a half wait! They have a small seating area, and since we just missed the last table, we were able to have a seat and start drinking. They also bring you flavored popcorn while you wait. Make sure you check out the bathroom- it's really weird how you walk in, but pretty cool! We were sat at a small, candlelit table. It was different inside than I expected but a great date spot as it's an intimate, small building. We ordered the calamari first, which was AMAZING.  This isn't your typical fried appetizer, but a nicely sautéed, seasoned calamari with potatoes pieces, chicken and pork. Had a great sauce, a little spice, just delicious!I ordered the pork line which was super juicy and great, but the best dish was by far the hanger steak. I tried a few bites and this could not be more perfect. It was a great dish and overall just amazing, unique flavor. I will definitely have to go back again! :)"
"We went last night (on a Tuesday) for our anniversary.  We brought along a six pack and a bomber, not knowing how long we would have to wait (drink).  We arrived at about 7:15 p.m. and were told to expect to wait 90 minutes.  We went upstairs to the waiting room and waited.  It took a bit of time to get someone to notice us in order to open our beer.  But, eventually someone came and we hung out.  All was well until we needed another beer opened and there was no one to be found.  It would be nice to just leave an opener for people drinking beer.40 minutes later we were seated, much better than the 90 minute quote!  We started with the fries, which were very good and the Pork Belly salad which was a little disappointing.  The pork belly did not have a ton of flavor.Dinner was the pork loin and hangar steak.  The pork was WAY to salty (yes, I know pork is salty).  Overkill.  Too much.  The steak was very good, I like that they only cook it medium rare to ensure that it is eaten the way that it was intended.  The caramelized bacon on the dish was delish!  I enjoyed the fried chickpeas on the pork dish, but like another review had stated they got boring pretty fast. We decided to skip dessert because we were not overly wowed by dinner.  I felt for the price and the wait that this just did not live up to the hype.  Was it good, sure!  Was it great, not really.I do have to admit that our server was very friendly and attentive (she was also pretty funny) and the hostess was very nice, not at all pretentious or snooty as we all know some Chicago hostesses may be.  If it wasn't so difficult to get a beer opened while waiting I might have gotten a little drunker and thus my dinner may have been fantastic ;)Two apps, two entrees = $80."
"Love this restaurant!    My husband and I got there at 5:30 on a rainy Thursday.  Our friends were running behind, so we sat upstairs in this little section by the kitchen.  While we were waiting, they opened our bottle of wine and gave us two glasses.  I thought it was really nice that they did that...and all the while we were waiting, we kept seeing all the food coming out.  It all looked wonderful!  When our friends came, we were promptly seated.  We tried the following menu items --Appetizers: flatbread, calamari, garlic friesEntrees:  pork loin, hanger steak, quinoaDessert:  panna cottaAnd they were amazing!  I was so happy with the food!  After dinner, we still had our wine and made our way upstairs (we didn't want anyone waiting) to finish off.  We all had to try out their bathroom -- it's very unique!  And we got to talk to the Chef a little bit -- one of our friends was wondering what dragonfruit tasted like and the Chef actually cut a little bit for us to try.  That was really sweet.  I also collect autographed menus to frame for our house, so I asked and he actually wrote a little novel on my menu!  They genuinely care about their food and how we all feel about it and I love that!  I highly recommend and don't forget -- it's BYOB :)"
"Right before our trip to Chicago I read about Ruxbin in Bon Appetit and put it on our list.  We showed up on a Wednesday around opening time thinking there would be a huge line after reading the reviews and were surprised to find one person.  I do understand how lucky we were!I love the space and the decor.  It's intimate, comfortable and completely unpretentious.  Our server was wonderful and they are efficient without making you feel rushed.  We had:-- Garlic fries.  I'm glad I tried them but they were a little bit of a let down after reading the reviews here.  I enjoyed them but wished I had ordered something else.  -- Endive Caesar with soft boiled egg, frozen red grapes, white anchovy, manchego and toasted almonds.  Wow.  Loved the presentation and the flavors.  -- Clam Bake with sake, roasted tomatoes, corn off the cob and lap cheung sausage.  This was my boyfriend's dish and I don't love clams so I only tried the broth and the corn.  The broth was light and refreshing.-- Halibut poached in olive oil with basmati and wild rice, summer vegetables, tarragon, kimchi and bacon.  It was lovely, a perfect dish for a hot summer evening.  -- Panna Cotta with lychee and toasted coconut.   Mmmm...tasted like summer!  Love that it's BYOB and reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  This is the way I like to eat: clean flavors, good portion sizes, you leave satisfied without feeling too full.  This little unassuming restaurant is doing amazing things.  Can't wait to go back."
"I came for a friend's birthday with my husband to this cute korean-fusion eatery.  To tell you the truth, i had higher expectations for the place but the food was still ok. I heard the menu might change a lot, as I didn't see items on the menu that other people had yelped about.-First, the Soda of the Day is nothing mindblowing. We had the Vanilla Tamarind Poppyseed. Nothing memorable and annoyed it cost 4 bucks.- Here's my favorite dish - the Garlic Fries- totally a standout dish! We gobbled this one up. It's a generously sized appetizer with a lightly crisp flavorful texture. We kept chomping and chomping on these. Definitely a keeper.   - Calamari - mmm this seemed a little dry to me and rather bland. again nothing memorable. - Hangar steak.  This was rather salty for me but not too bad. My friends like this.  The sauce was decent. Maybe i was just full from the Garlic Fries. - Soba Noodles- I don't know if cold noodles is my thing to begin with so i shouldn't comment on this dish. Nothing memorable at least for my taste buds. - Halibut.  Hm, i can't remember how i felt about this dish so i guess it wasn't memorable either Plus i don't normally eat fish.  =)In terms of noise level, since we came during the week it was fine at first but as it got more crowded this small space got pretty noisey. Guess i'll stick to weekdays for this spot if i don't want to scream out my conversations."
"I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it featured in the Red Eye when it first opened last year.  So I came here on Friday night w/ the bf since we wanted to go somewhere we haven't tried before for dinner.The wait wasn't too bad, they don't take reservations but on a Friday night  & it being a cozy lil restaurant I kinda anticipated it would be a long wait (45 mins or so)...after all I did have Ruxbin ""bookmarked"" since August 2010 so I figured I've waited this long, there's no turning back now!The menu is pretty simple & it's a lil pricey but Ruxbin did not dissapoint. From the appetizers menu we ordered the ""Croque Monsieur,"" Garlic Fries, Tonkatsu & the special which was a kimchi dumpling w/ a tomato broth that was served tableside. I really liked the Tonkatsu because it was topped with pickled melon & fennel..the chicken was very moist & our server did a nice job of making note of my nut allergy & not including the walnuts in the dish. The special was really flavorful & I liked all the spices that went into the broth and dumpling.For our entree we shared the mussels..this was what I was really excited to try since I first laid eyes on it in the Red Eye, I thought to myself...""I wawnt that...*drool*"" & drool-worthy it was. The sake broth that the mussels were in was so yummy & perfect for dipping the bread in. Since we couldn't decide what to get for dessert we went with both dessert options..the berry shortcake & the panna cotta. The creme chantilly w/ the berry shortcake was soo yummy. The lychee bits in the panna cotta were really good too & I love toasted coconut. Both dessert options were delish. The atmosphere is really cute & the overall design aesthetic is really cool (especially the entrance to the bathroom) they really utilize the small space in a great way. Also its BYOB w/ $5 corkage fee. It was a lil more expensive than I thought it would be but I really liked Ruxbin & am glad I can ""un-bookmark"" this from my places ""to try."" =P"
"Ruxbin! I had heard so many good things but I never had the chance to visit here until late October. I'm glad I did. We showed up to Ruxbin a bit late, so we just missed the first seating. We were told that the wait would be about 90 minutes, and that estimate was right. If you go here, get there early if you don't want to wait. FOOD:Mushroom Toast: When hell finally froze over, we got seated and ordered the mushroom toast with oyster mushrooms on top of a savory biscuit with housemade ricotta, hazelnuts, and various greens. I love mushrooms, that this starter was a sign of greatness to enter my belly. The more I try them, the more I love mushrooms. Most people I know hated mushrooms growing up, and many still don't eat it. But they do such a good job of absorbing flavor, have such a fun texture, and don't have an offensive odor (at least to me they don't). More people should eat mushrooms. Bucatini & Clams: This was actually what I believe to be Chef Edward Kim's interpretation of a Korean-Chinese dish called ja-jangmyun, which is basically noodles in a black bean sauce. The noodles were cooked to al dente standards, although the thickness and firmness made it hard to cleanly eat. I loved it, definitely a step above the majority of this type of dish you might seem to get at other restaurants.Crispy Oven roasted Amish Chicken with confit leg, Israeli couscous: SO. GOOD. I rarely order chicken from big name restaurants since...well it's chicken. It's the most consumed animal in this country by a long shot based on what I see. Chicken is everywhere, and to me, it's the most boring protein you can get. But this was far from boring, it was extraordinary. The thing is, I've tried the chicken at other places when I was basically promised that the chicken was amazing. I've had a 100% failure rate at other places until Ruxbin came along. Add to that the almost crispy couscous, and I wish I had the whole thing to myself. This was the standout dish of the night, and worth going back to Ruxbin for in of itself.  I think that if I didn't say anything, my dining partner would have just quickly cleaned the plate without sharing. Good thing I looked up from my own meal and said something...Berry shortcake w/home-baked biscuit, balsamic & creme chantilly: I realllly like this one, and I ate it so fast. Not much else to say. A great ending to an almost perfect meal.SERVICE:Attentive and friendly. Exactly what you expect at a place like this.VALUE/OVERALL:This isn't going to be a cheap meal, but it's not overpriced either. You get fantastic food at a fair price.Overall, I'm really excited to try this place again soon, and I'm willing to wait in line in the middle of Chicago winter to try it again. I hope that tells you just how fond I am of this place."
"This place is so.. HIP!We arrived around 5:45 on a Thursday night. The hostess and servers were awesome. We immediately got some popcorn to munch on. Yum!We started off with the crudo, pork belly, and garlic fries. The crudo was so refreshing and crisp (well the apple one). The other one under the cup was smoky and full of flavor too. Such a variety of flavors on one plate. The garlic fries were divine! Perfect garlic aioli sauce too. My dining companion got the pork belly and he said he might have liked the skin a bit crispier but he loved it just the same.Then I got the duck breast, and he got the hanger steak. Both dishes were so delicious. The duck breast was savory and sweet and so good. The hanger steak.. I tried a bite and it was good!But what I REALLY enjoyed was the dessert. We got one of each: rocky road and pineapple upside down cake. When both desserts came out, I was pretty surprised. I was expecting a bowl with some ice cream and chocolate cake, but the presentation of the rocky road was so beautiful. It was on a long plate and garnished with cotton candy! (What?! Cotton candy?!) I thought it was symbolic too.. We just ate it going down the plate, like a real rocky road.. (Am I reading into it too much? Maybe.) The pineapple upside down cake was good too, but I'm not a big fan of coconut. More of a chocolate kind of girl. This dining experience was amazing: everything from the recipe book pages on the ceiling to the awesome bathroom door. The place is a bit small but very cozy and friendly. I would love to visit again!"
"Dear Chef,You make great food, but your front of the house is run by children.I don't mind being told it will be a 30 min wait and then being seated closer to an hour later.  However, I do mind ordering and asking if a specific dish can be coursed first, being told no, then having it come last.  I do mind having the appetizers and mains all fired at the same time, and upon asking for a slight delay between them being told that the mains will have to be remade.  I do mind having the bill thrown on the table before desert is offered.  I do mind being told the the kitchen is closed and no desert is possible when inquiring, without any prior heads up.  i do mind being told that this was my fault for slowing down the main courses (despite the fact that we ordered within 1 minute of seating down).  If you can't offer a well-coursed well-serviced meal for someone showing up at 9 pm, then stop seating before then.  I've never experience such offensive service in Chicago.  Pitty."
"I really like this place. I've been to it twice. It has a small menu and is BYOB.  No reservations so you have to go before they open to stand in line - first come first served.  I found all the items on the menu to be very enjoyable and not terribly expensive.  The only reason for not having five stars is that I went there twice, at least a month apart, and the small menu was exactly the same both times.  I went with four people and that is enough to order almost everything on the menu. I will go back."
"I'm usually stingy with 5 stars but I really LOVED this place.  Arrive before they open if you want to be seated right away otherwise put your name down, walk around and wait for your call.  We arrived around 5:20 and still waited for the next seating...The food was perfectly seasoned an perfectly done.  For appetizers we had the Pork Belly Salad and Mushroom Toast.  For entrees, I had the milk-braised pork and my husband had the hanger steak .  The pork practically melted in my mouth.  The hanger steak was well marinated and very tasty.  For dessert, we had the Salted Chocolate Pot de Creme with Bacon Cotton Candy.  AMAZINGLY GOOD!  After we had the Chocolate, we ordered the Friend Hand Pan.  We liked the Chocolate Pot de Creme better but I'm guessing it was because we were already stuffed! Service was also top notch!"
"Amazing food. Friendly, knowledgeable staff and service, and BYOB. Definitely my fav restaurant in Chicago!"
"We lucked out and skipped over to Ruxbin after work on a Friday and got there around 6 and snagged the last open table.The atmosphere is worth noting - very cozy hipster.  The bathroom with a funky spinning door is wallpapered with band tour posters.  The overhead ""lights"" are created with seat bases and the benches are supported by seat belts.  Kind of hard to describe you have to see it  in person, but it all works well.  The capacity minimal, so we lucked out by getting here early, there was definately a wait by the time we left.The food was delicious, we started with the crunchy garlic fries and mushroom toast, and finished with the hangar steak - all the while enjoying the byob with a bottle of wine.  The service was friendly and the prices fairly reasonable, we highly recommend a visit - but be prepared to wait (going to a bar nearby) if getting there during normal hours."
Awesome food in a fun atmosphere.  They paid attention to special requests and turned out lovely food.
"Food, ambiance, wait staff are solid. I'd really give it 4.5 stars -- I can't give it 5 because I can't stand the fact that they are tiny, always full, and won't take reservations. It's just so irritating to get there, be told there's a 2.5 hour wait, and then trudging off to some other nearby restaurant instead that you're not that excited about. Oh well :("
"I'm going to be honest have... I no idea what a Teddy Ruxbin bear is, but this restaurant was goood!! Went for our monthly byo dinner and was definitely not disappointed. Had the calamari, the flat bread and the fries as appetizers.  We were split on which one we liked best- 2 loved the calamari and 2 loved the flat bread.  I personally liked the flat bread, I thought it was light and a perfect appetizer.  I really didn't like the fries.  Nothing special and the sauce was too mayo-y for me (I know...it's aoli but still) We all shared the halibut, pork loin, hanger steak and the Amish chicken.Halibut- I wanted to drink the sauce/broth it came in! AMAZING! Hanger Steak- cooked so well. This was definitely a hit with the other girls.Pork Loin- I really liked this one. I thought all the sides that came with it were awesome and everything went really well together. Amish Chicken- this one you can pass on.  It was good but I would have rather had a 2nd of one of the above.  The service was really great- and they didn't judge us when we brought some wine in a smart water bottle..."
"Very impressed. The food at Ruxbin was delicious and exceeded my expectations. Chef Kim successfully executes contemporary American dishes, many of which incorporate Asian ingredients (e.g., Korean chili, sake, lychee, etc). Rather than conventional bread, dinner begins with complimentary popcorn seasoned with seaweed (I think?). Good. To start, the crispy eggplant salad with roasted beets and honey cardamom yogurt was very nice. The calamari bokkum was excellent. The pan seared trout over bulgur wheat tabbouleh entree was delicious. I enjoyed the hangar steak with crispy kale and kimchee hash equally as much. The kitchen does proteins exceptionally well: the calamari was perfectly cooked; the trout was beautifully seared; and the hangar steak arrived a lovely medium rare. Both the berry shortcake and lychee panna cotta desserts were fantastic. The menu is focused-- 4 appetizers, 3 salads, 6 entrees, 2 desserts. The dining area is very small and narrow and decorated with recycled materials. Sorta quirky, yet charming.  When all the tables are occupied, the noise level can get quite loud. Service was friendly and efficient. $5 corkage fee. $95 before tip for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. Looking forward to returning when the menu changes (the online menu was current with the menu I was presented at the restaurant last week)."
"We heard too much about this place, but were afraid of the notorious LONG wait on the weekend. We braved it on a cold sunday night, hoping that everyone would be home.no everyone was here.We waited for almost 1hour before seated. We were waiting at the upstairs area next to kitchen, and were able to see the food and match them to the menu. The food were presented beautifully but in small portions. The decor was interesting with converted theater seats, and overall gave a nostalgic feeling. We orderedcurried popcorn - very good, loved the curry flavor!tonkatsu - good, the port tenders were not crispy when arrived.croque monsieur - very good, what's there not to love. cheese, ham and tomato! the bottom was slightly burnt though...crispy eggplant - ok, really crispy eggplanthanger steak - good, love dthe kimchee hash that contrasted.braised short rib - good, wish there were moreroasted pork - dry, the pork was overcooked and the sides unimpressiveI was not impressed by the food, especially the price we paid. The food was good in general, but i did not taste the dazzling reviews i've read of the restaurant."
"Went with my boyfriend on a Friday night - I showed up and got in line at 5:38.  We didn't make the first seating (which I was pretty happy about, actually) so we put our names down on the list and the hostess told us to expect a table around 7:15.Followed the recommendation of another Yelp review and went to Leopold for drinks while we waited for the phone call.  Leopold was awesome, btw.  The call came through a little earlier than we expected - had a table around 7pm.The food - oh the food!  To start we had the evening's special of tuna and melon (GREAT first food impression) and the frog and snail dish.  Tuna was better, both were very impressive.  We shared the clams and fries for an entree. Oddly enough, the fries were one of the highlights of the night.  Lowlights? There were none.Word to the wise: if there is a bacon cotton candy dessert on the menu - you order it.  You just do.  And then you inhale it, because it is going to be one of the yummiest unique things ever.Ruxbin was such a fun and yummy experience."
"Great food. Every course was perfect. Loved the unique approach to serving grilled calamari -- the calamari was cut in a way that almost resembled baby scallops. But as a few have mentioned, the coolest part of the restaurant may be the bathroom. I actually had to ask the expediter ""Is this for real?"" before walking in. Very cool!"
"I'm impressed with the space AND food AND service! For a small restaurant, things are executed really well. I wanted to grab a place to eat after yoga and while there was a wait for downstairs seating, I was able to get seated upstairs by the kitchen and bathroom for my party of one (my friend did join me later for dessert and a snack). Complimentary seasoned popcorn to start.Garlic fries with some great aioli--horribly addicting but had a nice crisp to it. Calamari is superb--tender and very well flavored with the magic of gochijan (korean chili paste). The plating was also soothing to the eye! Quinoa--a heavier dish because of the masala but all the vegetables were well grilled/cooked and soft! I also got a tasting of the soup of the day: tomato tarragon broth with kimchi dumpling. I thought it was a tad sweet. Service is warm and friendly. Cool bathroom."
"I can't say enough great things about this place. My friend and I walked in and were led up a short flight of (5?) stairs to wait for a table. They don't take reservations, but they kindly opened up the wine we brought and let us stand and drink by the open kitchen. It was a cool little nook with a long booth/bench area. They brought us popcorn and a small appetizer while we waited...I'm a sucker for friendly service. The food was amazing, and they are vegetarian friendly. Very cool steampunk theme going on too..a place not to be missed! Just remember that they don't take reservations-bring a couple of bottles w/ you!"
"This review is 4.5We came with friends at 6:30 on a Saturday night. We were told the earliest table would be 9:15 but they told us they could call us when the table is ready. So we went down to a sushi byob down the street and drank and ate appetizers to pass the time. 9:15 came sooner than I thought it would and we were happy we waited when we entered Ruxbin. It was very warm and cozy inside and our server was attentive and friendly. We started with the pork belly salad and fries. The fries were amazing! The porkbelly salad was tasty but kind of small, but I guess it was a nice morsel. For my entree, I had the pork loin. It was cooked to perfection. My friends had the steak and the chicken and loved it. My husband had the steak and it was very delicious and well seasoned. Everything was perfect. For dessert we had the pannacotta and the berry dessert. Those were also very tasty, but I think I preferred the berry cobbler. The pastry was very light and tasty. Overall, it was a wonderful meal. The fact that it is BYOB also makes it a bit more of an affordable night of fine dining!"
"My fav. so far.Ruxbin has very intimate and cozy atmosphere; chic and classy french style interior design.Food was amazing. I really fav Mushroom Toast and Hanger Steak. Steak is so juicy and tender.Veggie is fresh and flavorful.Asian ingredients are properly fused into french dishes,especially good use of korean sauce.I think this is a spot perfectly for dating or girls group dinner. Love it."
"Hipster alert!  Put on your skinny jeans, grease up the chain on your ten speed and put on your big black eyeglass frames and head on down to Ruxbin for half a trendy meal 3 hours later.Hehe, I kid, but there is some truth to all of that.  After hearing all the hype and not really ever venturing over to Ukranian Village I decided to give this a shot.  For those of you not in the know, this place got named 'best new everything of everything ever' by every food magazine ever.  I overstate, but again, they did get some pretty serious press.So on a Thursday night me and my brother went here to get some man dinner.  Well that was our first mistake; this isn't your really 'man-dinner' type of place.  We arrived at 7 and were told we'd be seated at 9:15.  I half-expeced this, but it still seemed REALLY long for being empty at 7 PM.  We wandered over to '5 Star' to have a drink or 7 while we waited.  At 8:15 the call arrived and we happily made our way back.We were sat in their cozy restaurant and were ready for some food.  The atmosphere is cool.  Lot's of recyclables decorate the place and the lighting gives off a dim-lit retro cool type of vibe, almost like being in a dive, but this is by no means a dive.  I love places that get lighting right, and this place did.  It's also tiny.  You could see how the wait would pile up!  I think they only have about 34 seats altogether.  Do NOT come here with a big party!  Do not come here and expect not to wait!ON TO THE FOOD; which was a-ok at best.  We started with the 'Frog and Snail' which was frog legs, snails and puff pastry with some other stuff in there.  I thought the idea was really cute (yep, just said that) which is that they were trying for the pond ecosystem type of dish with frogs, snails, puff pastry lily pads, ramps for the swampy greens, etc.  I thought that was cool.  But the whole thing was kind of messed up by what I can only describe as an Indian Butter sauce, like you'd get on Indian Butter Chicken.  That was weird.  The octopus was great, and the char and smokiness melded perfectly with the raisins and grapes and was just FANASTIC.  For the mains I had the Beef and Brocolli, which was hanger steak and brocollini, and my brother had the Pork Loin.  Both were spectacularly prepared, but I would say mine was a little bland.  This might be my fault though, I'm not sure how wild I was about ordering a Hangar Steak from a highfalutin place like this.  We polished this meal off quite easily and when the waitress came back we told her we were ready for the mains.  In jest, of course.  In all seriousness...there is not a lot of food.  I am 6'  170 lbs. and am not a fat man by any means.  My brother is built of an equally medium build.  We both could've probably put down three entrees each in addition to our one appetizer each.  And I'm pretty sure this place did not bill themselves as a small plate type of place.  So I would want to have this rectified before I went back.  Or maybe I'd just go here for desert and have one of their entrees.The service was great.  Our server could not have been nicer, and eeryone on staff just seemed to have that happy go lucky attitude.  I wish the place all the luck in the world. and to the Ukranian Village...well, see you again when I drive through it."
"Love this place!  Get there early as other recommend or you will wait.   There was a wait by 6p.m. on a Saturday night.Everything we ate was fantastic.  The hangar steak was the best I have ever had, amazing flavors, and super tender.  The Apple & Plum salad was good, and my husbands favorite was the calamari.  But don't skip dessert, the shortcake was one of the best desserts I've ever had.my only complaint is I wish the place was larger."
"Definitely don't show up early to this place, it's a ghost town.  No reservations (you won't need them) just show up right around 8-8:30 and prepare to be amazed!"
Anna's is simplydelicious. Phenomenal hospitality to say the least and the food really speaks for itself. Because of the variety of dishes ask anna what you're in the mood for and she can suggest accordingly.  My favorites so far have between the fried avocado and the seared ahi tuna!
"I cannot believe it has taken me this long to eat at Ruxbin.   The food was incredible.   The black cod in a maple-soy glaze was, without a doubt, the best fish dish I have had in a long time.   The apple and plum salad,  french onion soup, and pineapple upside down cake were  delicious.  The dishes are good.  Seriously.  Chef Kim knows what he is doing. The atmosphere is intimate, but casual.  It's BYOB and no reservations.  The restaurant is tiny, so it fills up quickly.  You can leave you name and number with the hostess and go to a local bar (or back home in my case since I live in the area) and she will call you when your table is ready.  The service was friendly and unpretentious.  I was not made to feel rushed as other reviewers have commented.  A definite return."
"I'd been driving by Ruxbin on Ashland Ave for quite some time before I finally went.  Why oh why did I wait?  It was soooo good.  It's one of those places where the food gets its flavor from combinations of ingredients rather than the addition of fat (like butter or bacon, as so many chefs like to do these days).  Just clean food with whacky combinations that you'd never think of but work wonderfully.We started with the Apple and Plum Salad with baby arugula, almonds, manchego and a walnut-sherry vinaigrette.  Ok, this one wasn't too much of  a stretch.  It was clean and bright and fresh.  Just what the doctor ordered!The calamari, on the other hand, was unlike any other calamari I've ever encountered.  Ever.  The bodies were stuffed with a chicken and pork forcemeat (aka sausage without the casing), and was accompanied by potato confit, Korean chili, pickled fennel, peanuts, pea tendrils and some other stuff that wasn't listed on the menu.  A couple of sauces, for one, and some pickled cukes.  The calamari itself was tender and it's filling, full flavored.  The rest of the components were its counterparts:  fresh tendrils, acidic fennel and cukes, spicy chilis.  So delicious.  We cleaned it up.The flatbread was fairly irresistible, as well.  I mean, just look at those colors!  In house made ricotta, shaved radishes... prosciutto... kumquats!...and fresh basil.  Gaaaawd it was good.  Salty, creamy, citrus-y, sweet.  The crust itself wasn't anything to write home about but who cares?!  With ingredients like that, you could have asked me to lick it off the table and I would have agreed.Next was the cold Soba, which was so interesting.  It had a ton of veggies and other things I know not about, a poached egg and, coolest of all, horseradish granita.  ""What?"" you say?  Yes, horseradish granita.  Next to it on the plate were a bunch of pickled goodies,  some crazy gelees, and a couple little salty sea beans.  They were there, apparently, for you to use as a palette cleanser between bites.The broth was smoky, the ingredients bright, the noodles earthy.  A lot going on, I'd say.  Would I rush back to order this again?  Not so much.  Was I glad we tried it.  Oh yeah.  Totally weird, but in a good way.See the ice-y granita?  Cool, huh?  It lent a little horseradish spiciness as it melted into the broth.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot to mention the crunch, salty, toasty little soy beans.  They were good too.Then there was the Pork Tenderloin.  All I gotta say about that... COME TO MAMA!  Crunchy hominy and chickpeas, roasted shallots, grilled peaches, fried basil and chili-coffee salt.  Hmmm... ponder that a moment.  You can't possibly understand how these flavors came together so amazingly.  Really.  Genius.The waitress informed us that they only had two desserts on the menu.  So we ordered one of each, naturally.  Fresh berries, homemade biscuit/shortbread and chantilly cream (aka fresh whipped cream with sugar and vanilla) and balsamic vinegar.  Ugly as hell, but sigh-worthy delicious.Last was the lychee panna cotta with toasted coconut.  Also fab.  Creamy, soft, sweet, tropical, crunchy, toasty.  Yup.  These guys hit it all on the mark.I also didn't tell you that we ordered one of their homemade sodas because it sounded so intreging.  It was.  Tamarind, vanilla, citrus and poppy seed.  Complex and a bit sweet which was balanced nicely with the citrus.  It was almost better than a boozy cocktail.  Well... almost.The place is teensy and very rustic but hip and comfortable.  Oh!  And it's BYO, so be forewarned!Service was great, too!  Our server was cool and fun and knew her stuff.  Great recs and told us the truth about menu items, which I always appreciate.I heart Ruxbin.The Short Version (Out of 10)...Food:  10Service:  10Ambiance:  10Overall impression:  10Would I go back?Absolutely!  In fact, I'm adding this to my mental list for when people ask, ""So what are your favorite places to eat?""  Ruxbin.  The answer is Ruxbin."
"Ruxbin was just named one of the top 10 new restaurants of 2011 by Bon Appetite. bonappetit.com/magazine/…I've been back a handful of times since my initial review. The flavors are consistently clean. Last time we had the halibut, clam bake, and soba. The halibut was delicious. They do fish very well. Sadly, they do not have the avocado toast on the menu anymore."
"Always glad to see up and coming new chef's open restaurants that do well - Ruxbin is no exception, as the chef is a young Asian-American cook trying to make it in Chicago.  Chef Edward Kim has done a good job so far - I think there is certainly room for improvement, but I can see why people have enjoyed Ruxbin so far.  Overall, I thought the food was pretty good and many of the dishes were very creative, but the one thing that turned me off a bit about Ruxbin was the price.  Considering it is a BYOB, I was expecting the meal to cost somewhere in the $30-35 a person range after tax, but the cost of the meal was more around $45-50 per person after tax, bordering on a fine dining meal, which Ruxbin is not.  Some of the dishes had an Asian fusion flavor to it and were twists on the typical Asian dish, while other dishes were more like the New American cuisine that most new restaurants cook up now.  Overall though, most of the flavors worked well together and I would be excited to try out some of their other menu items.  However, as I still have many more restaurants in Chicago to try out, I probably won't be back here for a while.  Ambiance was okay - other restaurant patrons were a bit loud, but this could be a fun place to go for a group, especially since it's BYOB.  They don't take reservations and the restaurant is really small, so plan accordingly.  On a Sunday night at 9pm, there was still about a 15 minute wait.  However, make sure to come earlier - they ran out of the mussels and the eggplant dish (which is supposed to be one of their more well-known dishes).Pictures / reviews of specific dishes here:  thegluttonousjd.com/2011…"
"Garlic Fries - yummy and comes with a great chipotle aioli.Mussels - good but had a little too much fennel for my taste.Berry Shortcake - I would suggest getting this...Panna Cotta - ok.Here is why I gave it only 3 stars. Inconsistent service. I knew about the long waits and came prepared for patience, but not for the attitude that I was served two out of the three times I attempted have dinner there."
"One of the hottest newer restaurants in Chicago. Named 5th best new restaurant in the nation by Bon Appetit! Cozy ambiance- not too hard to get a table earlier on a weeknight. The space is small but nice candle lighting. The bathroom is uncomfortably strange. The well-crafted menu selection was unique and creative, mixing Asian flavors with new American styles. Garlic fries were oh-so-tasty with our byob pinot noir~ mMm is there anything better than fries whilst on a vino buzz? Also we had the apple and plum salad which was fresh but pretty standard.I highly recommend the hanger steak with chimichurri and creme fraiched heirloom potatoes. Wow. The meat was cooked PERFECTLY. So tender! I only wish I wasn't so full from the fries!! I think my only critique would be the presentation was not really worth mentioning. But then again, this isn't one of those super pretentious places.My friend's pork tenderloin was also the most tender pork I've had! The grilled peaches were in perfect balance without overwhelming the flavor of the pork.Eat like a king for an affordable price AND BYOB! What's not to love? Fun times!Would like to come back to try the bucatini and clams!"
"Everything was perfect! The Hangar Steak was one of the best steaks I have had in my life, and the fries are a must. Reasonably priced for the quality of food as well."
"i came in to ruxbin with an open mind.  i heard from people who loved it and from some who didn't like their plating style, so i just figured i'd form my own opinion.  and you know what, it was pretty good.  i ate the scallops and tried bites from my co-diners dishes.  everything was well cooked, well presented and the service was great.  there was something missing, though.  i'm not sure exactly what it was.  if i had to break it down and be honest, i'd say that the cost of the dishes vs the portions of the dish vs the actual quality and taste of the dish just didn't match up. the ambiance of the place is gorgeous and very cozy.  it's byob, so it's nice if you come prepared.  nothing about the meal really stood out, bu i did have a nice experience here."
"For all the gastro pubs in Chicago, we think that one word describes Ruxbin: Overrated.  We've been wanting to come here for several months, and we were so disappointed that Ruxbin did not live up to its reviews, or our expectations.It's BYOB, which is fine, and the hostess who was attending to us in the waiting area was wonderful.  The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, and of course the bathroom is very unique, but the food just doesn't stand up to places like Longman and Eagle, Publican, Purple Pig, etc.Our Pork Belly cut had so much fat on it, that we returned it to the kitchen.  Yes, yes, yes.  We know.  Pork Belly is supposed to be fatty.  But this was gratuitous amounts of fat and we've had far better cuts in the city.  My boyfriend's clams were good, not great.  My pork loin was actually very good but was not warm by the time it reached our table.  The Lychee panna cotta was good, but again: Just not great.Between the BYOB, neighborhood, lack of reservations and average food, your money is just better spent elsewhere."
Very tasty. They do a good job of mixing ingredients. Unfortunately they don't take reservations and you could have up to a 2 hour wait for a spot so I'd recommend getting there early.
"Ummm.... amazing!  and byob!I went to ruxbin last night with three of my friends, and it was absolutely amazing.  After reading all the reviews and hearing how hard it is to get a seat, I planned to meet my friends at ruxbin at 5:30, when they opened.  Of course, my friends were all late, so I got in line to hold a spot for us.  Unfortunately they did not get there in time for us to get in for the first seating, but we were the first ones on the waiting list for the second seating.  While we waited, the hostess told us we could sit upstairs in the lounge area to wait.  The waitresses were all super friendly and brought us wine glasses so we could enjoy one of our bottles of wine before dinner.  They said the wait would be about 1.5 hours, which was totally fine by us.  Once we got seated at our table, our waiter came by.  He was really friendly and attentive as well.  We ordered the garlic fries, pork belly salad, and mushroom toast.  I LOVE garlic, and those garlic fries are amazing.  I swear, they must sprinkle crack on them, cause they are ridiculously good.  And the pork belly salad?  The pork belly is tender and fatty.... like butter.  SOOOO good!     For dinner, we ordered the hanger steak, pork loin, and sable fish.  All of the dishes were fantastic.  I ordered the sable fish and it was just a fabulous piece of fish, and the broth... oh... my.... god.  I was tempted to lift up my bowl and just slurp up what was left in my bowl, but my friends judged me when I said that, and told me not to.  But it was just that good.  And the bed of barley and pickled vegetables that the sable fish was sitting on, were a perfect complement to this tender piece of fish.  When I was waiting in line, I was chatting with the guy that expedites the orders in the kitchen and when I asked him what his favorites were on the menu, he told me it changes based on what he feels for the day, but if theres something I see that sounds good, that i should just order it.  I thought his answer was a cop out, like really?  Anything will be good?  But oh yes, he was right.  For everything we ordered, the first thing that you would hear after every bite, from every person at our table, was ""oh my god... you have to try this!""  I cannot wait to return again to ruxbin.  its just an amazing meal and amazing service.  everyone that works there is just so nice.  thank you for putting up with my ridiculous friends that were so amazed with your bathroom and kept using it.  I'm sorry we were so loud!  =)"
"ohmygoshican'twaittoreturnthisplaceisperfectionand­byob. I mean, in a nutshell. Best new BYOB, hands down. It's so kitchy-cute, sort of like Anthropologie for eating. Even the shape of this place feels unique and cozy. Tiny tiny restaurant so expect a wait and do not go with more than a table of 4. Seriously. The food is amazing. The tonktasu appetizer and 9 spice quinoa were inhaled quite quickly. All in all, I loved my visit to Ruxbin and will return soon!"
"Visited Ruxbin late on a Friday night (perhaps an hour or so before it closed) and it was still rather busy. Always a good sign for a restaurant. I was told by a number of people that getting seating would be difficult, so we were fortunate to get a seat when we did. Staff was polite and even offered to uncork our wine for us while we waited. Always nice to sip wine while waiting for a table to open up. Staff happily brought us over to our table when it was ready and refilled our wine glasses along the way. Ambiance was different. Not what I expected but definitely enjoyed the dimly lit restaurant. Definitely a good place for a romantic date. It is a small restaurant, but noise quality wasn't too bad - its frustrating to go to a restaurant and have to yell at the person across the table from you. Candles at each of the tables provided a nice touch. Food was fantastic. For appetizers we had the Garlic Fries and Calamari Bokkum. I was thoroughly impressed with the Calamari Bokkum - the Korean Chili was a great touch and added an appreciated spice to perfectly cooked Calamari. For entree's we had the Pan Seared Trout and Spring Chicken. While the Spring Chicken was my dish, I sampled the trout and thought it cooked well as well as seasoned enough as to not overpower the trout. My chicken was tasty and the Israeli couscous gave it a fantastic texture that worked well with the prunes and braised endive. We skipped dessert, but overall were impressed with the service, food and overall experience at Ruxbin. Will definitely be back to enjoy another meal at Ruxbin and would suggest anyone interested to try it."
"Cool placed tucked in a random neighborhood on Ashland.Food was delicious.  Calamari was great, portion was a bit small for an appetizer at that price though.  Fries..well they're fries  you can't go wrong with fries.   I got the hanger steak which was PERFECT.   The steak was tender and well seasoned, the potatoes and string beans were a perfect pair.  They do rotate menu by season so do go try the summer menu now.   Well they just changed it so you have time... I would skip on the homemade soda.  I had the ginger lemongrass and it tasted odd.   I thought it would be like a fresh ginger ale, but their machine didn't make it bubbly enough and it wasn't sweetened.   Although the first time my drink came out it was flat, they offered to exchanged it right away so that was very nice.   Unfortunately it didn't come back tasting any better haha.  Oh also go to the bathroom lol.  I know that sounds weird but they have an interesting bathroom door.  It's worth a try .  Overall:  food was great, service warm and friendly, no reservation, plenty of paid street parking, the place is a bit small but the wait wasn't long at all on a Sat. night., BYOB."
"Ruxbin, rocks! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, here are some things that we shared:  Octopus, garlic fries, frog and snail, hangar steak,  pork loin, and amish chicken.  Everything was well seasoned and flavorful, my favorites were the octopus, fries, hangar steak, and chicken.  We also split the chocolate pots de creme for dessert, it is served with a savory/bacony cotton candy on top, it was a wonderful way to end the evening.  The casually intimate setting, excellent service, and byob status make Ruxbin an awesome restaurant."
"Food is delicious.  Subtle and flavorful without being pompous.  Great balance of substance and sophistication at the same time.  I won't go into the details of what was eaten, other reviews are pretty much spot on.  Service was attentive, ambiance was chill, girlfriend loved it.  I'd say the only drawback is that space is a bit tight.  Otherwise, one of the best places I've eaten in Chicago."
"We really enjoyed our meal here.  Went on a Saturday evening and had to wait about 35 minutes for a table for two, not a big deal at all.  I would not recommend going with anymore than 4 people since the place is quite small.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  I liked that the hostess took down our number and let us know she would call if something opened up prior to when she quoted us.  There were several items on the menu that looked good but we went with the following:Endive Caesar SaladFlatbreadHalibutFresh Berry Shortcake3x Soda of the Day (Mixer for our byob Vodka)The Endive Caesar was awesome and very unique.  I don't think I would get the flatbread again but if we did I would get it without the honey.  It wasn't bad there were just several other things I wanted to try, particularly the garlic fries.  The Halibut was cooked perfectly and rice and vegetables were a perfect complement to the fish.  In hindsight, we should have gotten the Clam Bake.  The table next to us got it and it looked amazing.  The dessert was the highlight of the meal.  The balsamic glaze/sauce they put on the plate was so good.  I would have never thought to combine those flavors but I'm glad someone did.  Having not really read the description of the dish at first I thought it was chocolate from the color.  The sweet vinegary taste was a nice surprise in the first bite.Would definitely go back.  Completely reasonably priced, well run and very tasty food.  When the bill came I was expecting it to be almost twice as much as it was.  I would like to see a few more fresh/homemade mixer options but otherwise I'm not sure how things could be any better there."
"Came here for a birthday dinner and had an exceptional meal. I'm generally suspicious of kitchens that try to cram a large number of ingredients and flavors into every dish--it's often a case of valuing flash over flavor--but Ruxbin made me a believer. Every dish was interesting, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. And the prices were completely reasonable given the quality of the meal. There was a 90 minute wait, but there's a small bar around the corner with a pool table and an excellent beer selection. We didn't mind the wait."
"Ruxbin, you are wonderful!My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous meal at Ruxbin this evening.  We were surprised to find it over 1/2 full not 30 minutes after they opened for dinner, Friday evening, and it quickly filled up shortly after we were seated. The food was spectacular.  Where Ruxbin really gets my kudos this evening is for the service.  We brought our 19 month old son to dinner (I know, what were we thinking on a Friday night?!).  While the staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to be sure that we had everything we needed to make our dinner with a curious energetic toddler enjoyable, I would recommend saving Ruxbin for a date night.   The food and the experience are too good not to savor in a relaxing environment.  My husband and I will definitely be going back.  Thank you, Ruxbin!"
"Superb, delicious, nearly licked my plate clean! Do I have your attention???A friend and I came to this little gem off Ashland just north of Chicago (street parking is not hard to find) and learned that the early bird gets to sit and eat! No reservations taken however, as others have stated, would honestly limit dining to 2 people, more would appear to be a slight wait. There is a small wait area upstairs but easy to wait outdoors (in good weather). So maybe dine a bit earlier than normal?So, it is a fabulous BYOB, with a beautiful, thoughtful, ever-changing menu! We started with their flatbread and calamari, I preferred the calarmari as it had a bit more flavor, then onto our entrees: I ordered their hanger steak, cooked MR (oh so lovely, why would anyone volunteer to be a vegan or vegetarian?), with green beans and a potatoe salad - no joke, I could have licked the plate if manners didn't matter but had to pull myself together! My friend ordered the pork loin and he loved it, yes, I had inhaled my steak and didn't need anything else but of course dessert!We ended with a biscuit/berry mixture which I didn't love however, as the meal, service, ambiance were terrific, an ok dessert was not going to end the experience, just need to try something else next time!!It is a very intimate restaurant, you will be sitting close to your neighbor and if you do see others waiting, don't be that table - be considerate of your fellow diners!!A must go, bring a date and you will completely impress them!!"
"I have no idea what the hell just happened in my mouth, but I'm sold. Ordered the the Octopus, the Frog and Snail, the Garlic Fries, the Amish Chicken, the Beef and Broccolini, the Clams, Gorgonzola Ice Cream, and whatever the hell that Bacon Cotton Candy was. DEFINITELY try the Amish Chicken and the Bacon Cotton Candy. The only downside was that the crust they used for the pastry served with the Gorgonzola Ice Cream was a bit cumbersome compared to what's inside. I have absolutely no idea how to describe their mix of flavors. Just do it. I'm in love. Also, go to the bathroom."
"I am a little biased because this place is literally next door to me... but it does not discount the fact that it is one of the best new places in West Town!  Went back for the third time and brought some very high maintenance foodie friends and they were both blown away by the quality of service and food at this tiny place.  And the scary thing is that it is getting better everytime I dine here... soon I will have all of my 3 daily meals at this place.Definitely try the chicken and waffles - you will be pleasantly surprised how cleverly they reinterpreted this dish!  I had the trout which is always a palate pleaser and my other friend almost ate the bone from the short ribs because it was THAT delicious.  It's a small very focused menu but definitely well thought out.  It is BYOB (with no corkage fee, I may add) so make sure you bring a few bottles from your cellar because cheap wine will not do this place justice.Meeting the lovely Jen and the talented Chef Edward was a fantastic way to end the dining experience.  ...oh, and the bathroom!  OMG - who ever thought of the design is seriously a genius!!!"
"Because of all Raved Reviews we didn't want to wait on a Friday night,  so we headed over to Ruxbin around 6pm with our chilled Mascoto in hand and were seated in 1 minute flat. $5.00 cork fee. NOT BAD! Small, rustic, wood, natural and great service...I'm sold! My girlfriend and I split the pear/apple salad-Very Fresh and plenty for 2. Garlic fries- a Must Try. Plenty for 3 but we finished it off and Chicken and Waffles, I really didn't want to share but we did. My first try with Chicken and Waffles, I hear a popular dish on the west coast so I had to see what this was all about. 2 Crispy waffles and 2 different kinds of chicken-YUM! Plus a side of coleslaw which isn't my thing, but looked fitting. Devine Service and super attentive waitstaff...I will be back!!! ONLY $42.00 + Great Tip for all this....impressive"
"Ok, so I heard a review on the Hungry Hound & got a group of female friends to go there last Friday night at 6:30.  It's small, no reservations or liquor license....all that worked for us.  We brought booze, essentially took over their ""waiting area"" & befriended other customers who were not so happy at first to see us.  They lightened up quickly when we offered drinks & we made friends.  It took a while to be seated (group of 7 in a small place) but that was fine....and worth the wait.  Everything we ordered, and we ordered a lot, was great.  No one was disappointed but may I say, the short ribs were particularly excellent.   Staff was friendly, crowd fun, girl friend time together a blast and did I say the FOOD WAS GREAT!  (and, it didn't break the budget.)  Would I return?  A resounding yes, and even with my kids.Check it out, Chicago."
Fantastic food. My friend and I both ate everything off our plate. Great ambiance and decor...the bathroom is pretty awesome as well. You'll know what I mean when you go there.Only thing to take note of...they do not take reservations and we waited about 2 hours...it was a Friday though. There is a neighborhood bar around the corner so it made the wait easier.Definitely check it out.
"I ate here the weekend I moved into my new apartment and what a good first impression of the Noble Square/ West Town hood. Dined here in August and have been dying to go back ever since. Ate here with my boyfriend and his parents, so we ordered a ton and shared everything. It was all delicious and memorable. You can tell that every dish is so well thought out with SO many layers of flavors. The dishes were all interesting with subtle to very pronounced asian flavors. And the bill wasn't very high - big bonus that it is BYO. I'm recommending this place to all my friends and am gearing up for round 2!"
"I debated between 2 and 3 stars. What finally made my mind up on Ruxbin was when I considered whether I would return. To me, 3 stars means that I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if a friend wanted to go that I would not protest. In this case, it would have to be a good friend making a strong argument in order to get me back to Ruxbin.The biggest upsides of my experience:1. Decor (which I mostly don't care about in a restaurant)2. Goat Cheese Grits (of which there were not enough)3. Noble Grape, to pick up wine around the corner (so, one of the best parts of my experience with a restaurant was a different business half a mile awayIt is a nice looking place, interesting decorations, but unfortunately it seems they put more time and effort into the layout and vibe than the service or the food. And, for me, that means priorities are out of whack. I'll take an ugly dump with good service and great tasting food over this place any day of the week.BYOB, so it was convenient that Noble Grape is around the corner and down the block, since our group of 3 had not planned ahead to B our OB. Read: that means we also had PLENTY of time to wait at Ruxbin for awhile, chat with a nice couple (also waiting) who suggested a place to pick up a beverage, go for a 20 min walk, chat for a bit with the helpful man at Nobel Grape, and return to Ruxbin to again wait long enough for a slowly sipped glass of wine.On top of the wait to be seated at a table (of which there were plenty of OPEN tables as we left and returned from picking up our wine, so I don't understand why there were so many people cramming the waiting area upstairs), the service was slow once we were downstairs. And it was increasingly slow - slow to take orders, slower to bring our appetizer, amazingly slow to bring our entrees, and even slow to bring the check and accept our payment! Ridiculous, if you ask me. We arrived at 6:15 and were finally able to leave around 9.Appetizer - the 3 of us shared the ""Crispy"" Eggplant. Not sure where the ""crispy"" label comes from as this dish was soggy and luke warm.Entrees - I had a special of the day, flank steak - quite over-seasoned. If I wasn't starving from our long wait there is no way I would have eaten as much of this as I did.I don't remember one of the entrees ordered, but the last was the braised short ribs (not terrible, but not particularly good either), and they came with goat cheese grits and brussel sprouts. Honestly, the grits and brussel sprouts were my favorite part of the meal, and neither were on my plate. Plus, after 3 people each took small tastes of the grits, I would have felt bad asking for a second taste because the serving was so small.Back to the service...I just don't understand. The tables were mostly empty, yet it took forever to be seated. The folks in the kitchen looked like they were trying their best not to look bored as they killed time in the kitchen, so I don't understand why it took so long for us to be served any food. Is there some secret, busy back room that I don't know about?Final verdict:One of my pet peeves is the ""OVER - RATED"" cheer in sports, but I'll spare you that tirade since this review is already long. Yet, that is the nicest thing I can say about Ruxbin - overrated."
"Hell-uuuh, NKOTB!!So young and yet already such a rock star.....you get the groove all right, and a great scene name - intriguing enough (Ruxbin?!? huh?) but not unpronounceable (Aurore?!? how do you pronounce it again?!?!) - and of course, first and above all, you are UNATTAINABLE.It's quite impossible to get anywhere near you.Your bodyguards are all nice and smiling, and pretty cute too, but they have redoubtable ways to keep one off: waiting times.1 hour 40 min.1 hour 25 min.I like much, find you quite enticing and your fans, speaking of you, make me mouth water, but you see - patience is not my first virtue.3rd time was a charm though.Saturday at 6pm you finally opened up your arms to welcome me. Everything was quiet and cool. We came with a bottle of Argentinean Malbec to share.And we started to enjoy.Freshness of a lovely summer salad of jicama, grapefruit, peppery greens enriched by creamy blue cheese, lardons (cubed bacon/pork belly) and a fantastic citrus-parsely vinaigrette.Crunchiness of the K(orean)-Town empanadas, filled with fermented cabbage and lovely Mexican cheese dusted with paprika and cumin.Crispiness of the trout fillets, perfectly seared and portioned laying on a bed of tabbouleh made of bulgur, asparagus, dates and basil.Herbiness of the mussels broth, overflowing with fresh thyme and tarragon, sweet, tonic and clean. Great fries to top them off.Contrasting textures of the pana cotta, cream VS. dry coconut flakes, with only a slight hint of litchee fruit to balance things out.They all played up your looks, and they were right: you are damn cute in a whimsical, mischievous kind of way.......like a modern Betty Boop.I thought you were perfect.Hope success won't make you head swell. Keep it real, Ruxbin."
"yes.BYOB which is always great.  i had a delicioso pan seared trout.  i get nervous about the skin on fish but the waiter recommended i try eating it.  i did it and it was tasty and good!  (i was very proud of myself).  we also shared the roasted beets and i basically wanted to lick the plate when it was gone - YUMMY!  the ambiance inside is super cute and romantico, i would definitely recommend this for a date or for a small group of friends.they do not take reservations so definitely beware and go at the appropriate time or be prepared to wait.  it is worth it!"
"3.5 stars, I hope this will improve if I go back!I have been waiting to come to Ruxbin for such a long time, what seems like forever! It was just never convenient with the rumored long wait times, etc.I went on a tuesday RIGHT at opening.  Huzzah!  I was the first one seated, and the restaurant was empty!  I dined with two of my friends ... we ordered... (drum roll and mini flipping elves..)1. the soda of the day-- Vanilla tamarind poppyseed.  Meh.2. Calamari appetizer.  -- this is NOT the calamari bokkum that so many people know and love.  They changed the menu.  It is not that great.  It is basically squid with gochujjang and some random lettuce.  Actually, I was a little confused by the whole thing.3. Garlic Fries- OMGZ YUM!!!!!  These fries are so freaking delicious!  I can't even explain it.  I went to this other famed restaurant for their famed fries and I was so upset... but when I tried these I was thinking WHY AREN'T THESE FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE EARTH!??  and I was yelling in my head. a lot.4. Soba Noodles- pretty good, pretty standard.  Per the description on the menu it came with multiple fun additions to your average soba, sad part is when you actually ate the dish, it tastes like your typical soba served on a hot day.  Not a bad thing, I love soba... but the random korean peanuts did not really change the flavor, sorry man.5.Hangar steak.  Ok yes, I did love this.  It was so tender, and I *loved* the flavoring!!!  It tasted a little like korean food and a little not.  Also, the surrounding sauce was so good.  I would have licked it up if I were less civilized.7. Halibut.  Yes, it was good.  The fish was tender and the rice (or fancy derivitive of rice, whatevr) was a perfect compliment.  I am not over the moon about it, but solid dish.So that was our meal.  The staff was very nice and attentive. I feel like I'd like some of the menus other people are talking about more.  For example the avacado bread people have discussed, the kimchi with the hangar steak (ours had no such thing!), the calamari fried rice... drool.... So basically I have to come back and pray for a better menu.  Still not a bad experience, not bad at all."
"Over-rated/under-whelmed. I had read and heard a lot about Ruxbin, and was really looking forward to eating there. My girlfriend arrived a little after 6 to get our name in on a Saturday night and then headed over to Leopold for some drinks while we waited for our table, which we were told would take about 90 minutes.We finally got the call, grabbed a six-pack, and headed back. From that point on, the mystique wore off. No one came to wait on use for about 12 minutes after we were seated. When our server arrived to deliver the complimentary five-spice flavored popcorn, which was pretty stale, he did not offer ice for our beer, nor an opener, nor did he go over the specials with us.We found the menu to be lacking in information as we ordered the crispy eggplant appetizer, expecting something akin to finger-food, but instead were presented with a mayonnaise-drenched salad. If the dish is a salad, it'd be nice to at least mention this fact on the menu.I had the hanger steak, my girlfriend got the short ribs. Hers was much better than mine, which I could tell would be disappointing as I tried in futility to saw through the steak cuts with my knife. It was a tough, chewy mess.Our dinner was pretty pricey and included a $5 corkage fee yet we didn't even get offered a bottle opener, and had sub-standard service throughout the night. I think ruxbin got a lot of hype, got a lot of business as a result, and has not been able to maintain. It was definitely not worth the wait."
"July 3. GF and I try to go to a BYOB for a late dinner, we bought a bottle of wine, and go to walk into the restaurant. Closed. An hour early. So here we are, standing at Chicago & Ashland, with bottle of wine in our hand and hunger in our bellies. She suggested Ruxbin, I thought there'd be no way we get in there quickly. But luckily, Chicago was half empty and we were able to walk in and sit right away. We sat and were brought popcorn with an Asian flavoring, very good and light. We started with Jicama and Grapefruit salad, which had Dana Blue Cheese, Lardons, Citrus-Parsley Vinaigrette and Cornbread. The cornbread was a nice addition over croutons, and the jicama gave the salad a nice crunch. For the mail course, I had the Mojo Chicken, which was a seasoned half chicken with shaved Onions and Cilantro, Black Beans, Chopped Almonds Golden Raisins and Basmati Rice. It was very good, and very moist. The GF had the Garlic White Wine Mussels Fines Herbs, Togarashi French Fries. The mussels were fantastic, and the fries crisp. For desert, we tied the panna cotta, with toasted coconut, big fan. Our waitress was really friendly, never refiled our wine or water glasses (a carafe of water was placed on the table), and, I'm sorry, but when you are charging a $5 corkage fee (which is against city ordinances), then you should at least earn the $5 and refile our glasses when their empty. The restaurant itself looks amazing, with the interior designed by the same group that did Simone's. The place is small, with 3-4 booths, and a long row of two tables, so be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations."
"I love it when a restaurant lives up to the hype surrounding it, and then far, far exceeds it. Needless to say, I loved my dining experience at Ruxbin last night.After scouring the Yelp reviews on Ruxbin for literally months, my boyfriend and I decided to come here on a Tuesday after work right when they opened to avoid the long lines that appear to accompany a weekend visit. I'm known to my friends as being the ultimate planner and always early to any given event, so I thought I'd show up to the restaurant about 45 minutes early to ensure that we were seated right when it opened. Since I haven't seen any Yelpers state this yet, on a Tuesday you do not need to arrive early AT ALL. You can show up anytime between when they open at 5:30 and 5:45 and be seated without a problem. Although, when we left the restaurant around 7, there was a bit of a wait but no line outside.We were seated next to the window when we arrived, which I was thankful for as the restaurant started to fill up. The service was very prompt and attentive, and they dove right into the specials and explaining the menu as we were seated. As we were looking over the menu they gave us a complimentary bowl of popcorn with an interesting blend of seasonings on top. I couldn't quite place what the seasonings were, but it was the best tiny bowl of popcorn that I've ever had to share in my life.After taking a look at the menu we decided to start the meal with the Octopus dish and the Garlic Fries. The Garlic Fries came out first and it was an over-flowing mound of deliciousness. The fries were cut thinly and were a perfect balance of not too crunchy and not too soft/mushy. They were topped with lots of seasonings and were paired with a nice chipotle aioli on the side that didn't overpower the fries like aiolis often can. As we were about halfway through the fries the Octopus showed up. Having recently ventured away from only eating fried calamari (sad, I know) and being skeptical of the rubbery, overcooked disgustingness that many restaurants serve under the name of ""grilled calamari"", I was a little apprehensive. Although, when the dish came out, I could barely hold myself back from diving in. It had a very impressive and artsy presentation with a black soybean smear on plate and then a medley of colors due to the grilled chickpeas, pickled green onions, radishes, and the grapes. They recommended that you try and get a little of everything in a bite, and they weren't lying! The sweetness of the grapes balanced out the ginger-scallion vinaigrette and really brought out the taste of the octopus. Oh, and the octopus! It was cooked to perfection and had the ideal (as in not chewy and rubbery) bite to it. It was refreshing to have octopus served this way and not with a lemon wedge squeezed over the top an doused in marinara sauce.For the main entrees we went with the Pork Loin and the Beef & Broccoli Hanger Steak. My boyfriend and I decided to share the entrees, so I started out with the pork and he started out with the beef. Both of the dishes were well prepared and presented, and I couldn't wait to dive in. What I absolutely loved about the pork dish was that you were served two good sized medallions which made it easy to share, and a substantial dish. The pork was served in a green pistou sauce along with fava beans and baby carrots and topped with some large shavings of Parmesan cheese. All of the flavors really balanced each other out, and I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Perhaps one of the greatest things about this dish is that it was cooked perfectly. Normally pork loins are dry and overdone, but this came out juicy and succulent. Now, onto the Beef and Broccoli Hanger Steak. This dish is Ruxbin's signature dish, based on my experience and all of the reviews that I've read. This dish obviously has some Asian influences which the name implies, but it goes above and beyond the typical beef and broccoli. The meat was cooked to a medium perfection, and you get about eight thinly sliced pieces that are splayed out on the dish. It's great to get a bite of the steak with a bit of the rice tots and topped with the broccoli. The sauce that is drizzled around the dish reminds me of a soy sauce, but so much more. I really wish I could elaborate on this dish more, but it truly speaks for itself. Do yourself a favor and make sure to order this when you go.And of course, we had to finish off this amazing meal with a dessert. We decided to go with the ""Chocolate Pot de Creme"" as soon as the words ""bacon"" and ""cotton candy"" escaped the waitress's mouth. The dish arrived with a plume of cotton candy on top, and I could not wait to try it. We broke up the cumin tuile on top of the chocolate-mousse esque dessert and tried to get a bite of everything with each spoonful. This was a truly savory dessert with the perfect balance of sweet and salty. Highly, highly recommended! All and all a great experience and I can't wait to come back!"
Stumbled upon this while wandering in search of a good restaurant and remembered hearing great things about it.The decor is really whimsical-- the darkroom revolving door to the bathroom was especially clever. Food was tasty (garlic fries utterly addictive) and the homemade sodas were unexpectedly complex/awesome.Will be back.
"BYOB with a wonderful wine store around the corner (Noble Grape). Best Pork Loin Ive ever had.  Calamari was superb and prepared unlike any other time Ive enjoyed calamari.  Service was spot on and the atmosphere was small/cozy, tasteful lighting and perfect for enjoying a nice dinner."
"I have found one of my new favorite restaurants! Ruxbin is excellent. I went there on an early Sunday and got there before the wait started. Pleasant and totally professional but casual service. The food is fantastic. We had the garlic fries and the calamari bokkum...the calamari was so good we ordered another! We were 4 and our table had Short Ribs, Trout (s) and Pork. Well prepared and creative. Chef Edward Kim is smart, creative and his combinations and flavor sense is very very solid. We shared the 2 desserts on the menu, the panna cotta and the berry shortcake.....hellacious... I am happy that I live so near this place, I plan on working my way into a regular.... Thanks Ruxbin!"
"hm.  this is one of the few times i'll honestly say that everything was solid, dish by dish, 4 or 5 stars + ambiance give this place a solid 5.   No reservations means either immediate seating (once your full party arrives) or waiting for a full turn of the tables and wait of nearly an hour.    Unfortunately we had to wait, but ended up in the 2nd floor waiting area enjoying BYOB wine and a few apps, before moving to our table on the main floor.  Here's what we had:- garlic fries:  very crunchy the way fries should be, with a side of aioli- calamari bokkeum: delish, korean chile with peanuts and baby potatoes- trout: with tabbouleh, dates and basil- mussels: sake tomato broth, fennel, orange and dill- orange and chocolate bread pudding- panna cotta with lychee, toasted coconut and lime zestOverall the calamari was the lead, followed closely by the fries and trout.   Interior decor is warm, vintage and grungy, and the bathroom is really unique.  Definitely will be back!"
"What can I say.... great food, presentation and overall value. It was BYOB which was a plus for keeping the cost down.  I would definitely go here again and would consider making this a regular spot if the menu rotates (not sure if they do this??). The wait to get a seat is a bummer."
"Day two of Gastronomy Week in my house took us to Ruxbin, which absolutely did not disappoint. In fact, the calamari makes my list of the ""10 best things I've ever eaten,"" which is particularly interesting since I'm not a huge advocate of calamari or kimchi. Yet, in their hands, the dish became pure magic. Although neither dessert offering was particularly tempting, we ordered the panna cotta based solely on the fact that everything else we were served was spectacular. I'm a convert--it was awesome. Can't wait to go back and discover more dishes that will haunt my dreams."
"I almost loved it.  A few things held me back.First off, the decor in the place is spectacular.  Very cool and unique look.  As previously mentioned, the book art on the ceilings, the lights that were made out of old schooldesks, the darkroom spydoor that leads you into the bathroom.  The hostess station when you come in was made of resalvaged tin roof pieces from a Wicker Park church and the glass viewing area you walk past as you open the door is from the old DJ booth of Sonotheque.With the decor does come some issues.  The school seats, although cool looking are unbelievably uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time.  I had to stand up a few times because I was so uncomfortable.  The wait for our meal seemed a little long.  Granted, I know it's a small place but I felt like we were waiting for a good amount of time.The crispy eggplant appetizer was fantastic.  The orange flavor that went along with it did a lot for the dish.When our entrees arrived, we had ordered the panseared trout, the amish chicken and the hangar steak.All of our food was excellent.  The Trout's skin was fantastically crunchy and the fish was perfectly cooked.  The Amish chicken fell off the bone and the hangar steak was great.After about half of her dish, my girlfriend noticed a LONG hair in her hangar steak.  Then another one.  Two hairs and she was done with her meal.The food, up to that point was amazing, but that would turn me off from eating anymore as well.  The decor, although cool is a little uncomfortable.  I'd go again once I'd heard more people didn't have any issues with hair in their food."
"I struggled with how many stars to rate Ruxbin. I really, really wanted to give them 4 stars. But the thing is, while I liked it, I can't see myself rushing back either. This is a long review because I want to lay out specific reasons for my rating.Here's the lowdown from my point of view:+The food tastes fantastic! 4 stars. We split empanadas and avocado toast between 4 women. The ingredients in the empanadas were inventive, but I would have liked more of the stuffing. The avocado toast was also different from anything I had tasted, much better than your typical bruschetta. I thought the trout entree with quinoa(?) and asparagus was done perfectly, I loved every flavor. The chicken was pretty good too, nice and tender but I preferred the stronger flavors of the trout. My other friend said the beef entree was also good. +The people who work there are all very sweet. They're the reason why I wish I could give a higher rating.+The decor is adorable in a kitschy way. As others have mentioned, the bathroom alone is worth seeing. I felt like I should go in like Clark Kent and come out like Superman.+There are always kinks to work out at a new restaurant, so I am willing to overlook some of the issues that arose. One big problem was the wait time between the appetizers and the entrees. We waited almost an hour. That's probably why there's such a long wait to get seated, because the turnaround time is really slow. They need more kitchen help.+The main reason why I couldn't give a higher rating, despite the quality of the food, was the quantity for the cost. Ultimately, for me that's what it comes down to. Maybe others don't care about paying a lot for a little, but portion size is part of satisfaction for me. The portion of my trout was puny. Now fish can be pricey-- I understand this. So give more of the other stuff, like the quinoa and asparagus. I had three little pieces of asparagus. Really? You're going to charge $21 for this entree and you can't throw in a few more pieces of veggies? Maybe a little bit more quinoa? I have a huge bag from Costco, and it can feed me for months. It's not that expensive. Also, I believe it was $8 for 2 empanadas. $11 for the avocado toast, which only had 3 pieces (an awkward number to share). I ended up spending $35 on a meal that tasted delicious but left me unsatisfied.Maybe my friends and I have extraordinary appetites, but none of us left full. We ended up stopping by Dominick's, buying a bag of salt & vinegar chips, ice cream, apple pie, and cookies and pigging out with another bottle of wine.Do I think Ruxbin is worth checking out? Absolutely! And most people will probably love it, as the previous ratings already indicate. But I guess I just need a little more sustenance. If they increased their portion sizes or decreased their prices, I would definitely return and up the rating to 4 stars. If they fixed their kitchen turnaround times on top of that, they would deserve 5 stars."
"A great new intimate restaurant, was very impressed with everything they did.  Decor is a funky rustic look, sort of high-end casual.  Would be a great date spot or somewhere to have good conversation over great food.  Service was excellent, friendly and speedy.I usually think restaurants that serve ""pretty"" food don't taste as good as no-frills type joints, but this place surprised me.  The food was ridiculously tasty!  My table of 4 shared all the goodness of the Hanger steak, Avocado toast, K-Town empanadas, Garlic fries, Crispy eggplant salad, Mussels, Pan seared trout, and a couple desserts.  I'm dead serious when i say they were ALL amazing!  Mark my words, I think this will become one of Chicago's new hot spots.  I'll be going back here again and again."
"Great new restaurant with a really cool bathroom. Well, the revolving door of the bathroom is very unique and I also enjoyed the concert ""posters"" that served as wallpaper. Oh yeah, the food is good too. We shared a few of the appetizers (empanadas, fries, apple salad) and they all were delicious. As for mains I was able to have both the Short Ribs and their unique version of Chicken and Waffles. I enjoyed the chicken and waffles a little more than the Short Ribs, mainly because the dark meat was cooked carnitas style (crispy on the outside and tender on the inside), yet it also came with the traditional breast with white meat. For dessert we had both the Panna Cotta and the Bread Pudding. My preference was the Panna Cotta, but the bread pudding wasn't bad either. Definitely will be back, hopefully sooner than later..."
"I loved my experience here!  Julie and Rachel took fantastic care of my mother and I.  We were seated rather quickly on a Wednesday night and had food in front of us at all times.  Prices are great, portion sizes were perfect, and everything we ate was fantastic.  The atmosphere was fun and cozy and the level of noise was just right.  I would highly recommend his place for a good anniversary date spot or for a place to catch up with an old friend.  Intimate, but not pretentious.  5 stars all around!"
"4 STARS.That's what I wanted to give Ruxbin.How could a place so HYPED UP, be so pretense-less and mindbogglingly awesome.I don't know.But it happened.The people who work here are extraordinarily nice.They are also very helpful and genuine.The motto on the wall upstairs, a quote from James Beard saying something like ""food is a universal language we all speak."" is truly conveyed in the restaurant.The restaurant blurs cuisines and speaks a universal language of friendship, love and harmony.... and damn good mussels.Much LoveChaz"
"Ok so top 7 reasons I love ruxbin:1) lots of meat (braised beef, pork, hanger steak)2) goat cheese grits3) kim flavored popcorn as free app4) secret spy-door bathroom w sweet posters onthe walls5) veggie opt's for herbivore friends 6) Korean owned (thus kimchee hash & calamari bokumbop)7) BYOB"
"Can I give a restaurant 6 stars? I have been to Next, Blackbird, Frontera and I think Ruxbin blew them all away.First, they do not take reservations. We showed up at ~5:20 on a Saturday night and there was already a line (doors open at 5:30). We got the last table of the first seating. Also, they will not seat you unless your whole party.On to the food!!!! We started with the garlic fries and oh my god were they good!!! so garlicly, so salty, so...everything you want them to be. I also had one of their homemade sodas which was very tasty. For my main entree I had the Hanger Steak with potato salad and wrinkled long beans. Every single part of this dish was amazing. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (FYI, if you like your steak well done, your out of luck because he will not do it). The potato salad had a mild flavor of bacon in it, and was delicious. And the green beans had a great flavor as well. They other people at our table had the amish chicken and pork loin, both were tasty but I was happy with my choice.For desert you have to get the shortbread with berries. It is everything a desert should be and complimented the rest of the meal very well.Overall I think this is one of the best meals i've had in chicago and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"After salivating over the photo gallery on Ruxbin's website, I finally made the trip with 4 girlfriends on a Saturday night around 7pm.  Hopeful that the wait would be bearable, I was impressed to find 1/2 our group seated w/ popcorn on the table and first wine bottle uncorked, poured, chilling in an ice bucket.  (an underrated accessory at the byob joints)  The only caveat to our prompt seating was that we squeezed 5 girls into a 4 person booth - being one of the 3 on one side, it was worth it to be seated and didn't impede on my experience - it may have even brought me closer to my friends.Now the food:  We began with the K-town empanadas and crispy eggplant salad - yum!  You can taste a hint of kimchi in the empanadas and the salad lived up to it's ""crispy"" name without the feeling it was just cooked too long.  Between the 5 of us, we ordered each of the entrees except the tofu (which I'd love to try next time..mmm tofu).  My trout was cooked to perfection, no fishiness, just pure, clean and simple goodness.  The garlic white wine mussels, mojo chicken and hanger steak (my friends so graciously shared bites) were all superb.  Just enough flavor to make one think you can't do this at home, but not overdone to mask the unadulterated freshness of each protein.  The sides complemented the flavoring and made each entree a stand alone meal.  We couldn't leave without dessert and after tasting the panna cotta .... I was determined that Ruxbin has it figured out!  Be sure to stop by the bathroom before you leave.Cheers Ruxbin - glad to have you in town!"
"Came here with the ladyfriend on her last night in Chicago before moving back to sunny California. Had my doubts about this place initially due to its no-so-popular location. However, after spending some time on the website to study the menu and their blogs, I was instantly intrigued about this place and decided to test it out. Needless to say, this place was so good that I decided to break out my 4-month yelp review hiatus to give them some well deserved props. I mean...Garlic White Wine Mussels? Good!K-Town Empanadas?? Goooooood!!BYOB?? Goooooooooooooooooood!!!It's definitely refreshing to come to a restaurant to enjoy some fresh and gourmet food without spending my entire weekly paycheck. Now, a few other comments from the heart:- The service was definitely as great as everyone has mentioned in their reviews. - The bathroom door was definitely as confusing yet amusing as everyone has mentioned in their reviews. My ladyfriend even came back to the table with her jaw wide open and raving about the bathroom. - While the mussels were fantastic, I could have used a little more broth to make the dish a little more juicy. The hostess was gracious enough to listen to my suggestion and hopefully communicated it to the chef. - I know the avocado toast is heavily advertised by everyone but it just didn't do it for us- The miso tofu dish is at its best if you eat it with sequence with all the other sides All in all, 4 stars with the food, service and decor... AND one extra star for BYOB!"
"Finally! A contemporary restaurant that I can take my picky Korean parents to! After two failed attempts to eat here for dinner (I now understand why the 2+ hour waits) I finally got a chance to dine at this innovative spot. I came in at 7pm on a Thursday night and was told I'd have a 15 minute wait.The hostess asked me to wait in their elevated waiting area / kitchen viewing area / bathroom portal. This is not a bad  thing. I was amused at how guests scratched their heads in wonderment on how to enter the strange door to the bathroom...you must try it! I also enjoyed watching the chef double check all the dishes before they went out. By the time my friend joined me, we were ready to be seated. Upon reviewing the simple menu, we decided on trying as much as we could so we shared 3 appetizers and 1 entree:Crispy Egglant - AMAZING. The sauces drizzled over it were just right and added such depth to a simple vegetable. I also thought it was the right amount of crisp.Calamari Bokkum - I loved this dish! I thought it was an innovative take on the classic fried calamari appetizer offered at every other restaurant the world over. Tonkatsu - The most classic Korean/Japanese street dish. I wasn't thrilled with this one. I thought the meat was dry and too thin. But I liked the veggies it came with.Hangar Steak w/ Kimchee Hash - WINNER! Perfectly cooked steak, thinly slices exposing the nice pinkish centers of the meat. Reminded me of Kimchee covered beef pot roast that my mom used to make. Yum.All in all, I thought the meal was fantastic and the Malbec that I brought went well with the spices from the dishes. Without wine, this was an affordable dinner - $63 for two people including tax, not tip. I think the prices could drop a dollar or two even - but still, a great place to try some new things and a great entry point for diners who are not yet ready for the bold flavors of authentic Korean food."
"Let's get the food out of the way early -- 4 star plates made for sharing.Now, lets talk about what really makes this place special. Everything else. Faced with a bit of a wait, the hostess sat us in their waiting area. Anywhere else, this would be the chef's table (maybe it is sometimes). We popped our BYOB and got to watch the kitchen do their work. The interrior design has gotten a lot of press, so I wasn't as impressed as I would have been going in cold, but it's full of details that want to be examined. We also got a chance to check out the bathroom, which truly is Bigger on the Inside. You can't visit without checking it out.We were seated, and even though we ordered a jumble of small and big plates to share, the staff did a great job of spacing them out and giving us time to enjoy everything. If there was a standout, it was the mussels, but really it was the overall execution that impressed."
"I haven't yelped in a mighty long time as I have been in NYC eating and working the last few months, rather than writing.I also told myself I wouldn't review a place unless I've been there 2 or 3 times, but I'll break this rule just once.The reason I have chose to write this review is that I enjoyed my experience at Ruxbin mightily.The space isn't very large, but it's decorated very beautifully.  It strikes some interesting chord between modern, rustic, and industrial.  I know, that sounds kinda like an oxymoron; but that's at least the vibe I got.  A lot of the furniture and design features scrap pieces of what was destined to be refuse.  (old seat belts, church pews, etc)  from a sustainability viewpoint that's a plus.  Though I'm sure one can nitpick about the efficiency of lighting.  The bathroom requires special mention, as it's by far the most interesting...whimsical bathroom entrance I have ever seen.  For any of you that have drank at PDT in the East Village; it's kinda like that.  But no snooty hostess on the other side.  I had no idea how to lock the thing; so I went pee as fast as I could.  Hmmm..maybe that was TMI...I don't recall my servers name.  But she was lovely.  Courteous, kind and around at the right time.I ordered the K-Town empanadas and the Trout.  I was a bit apprehensive order K-Town empanadas as I'm Korean and have a discerning tongue for Korean ingredients or flavor. I went to Bill Kim's Belly Shack not too long ago, and was a bit disappointed in his fusion of Asia and Latino flavors. So i was afraid to get confused and disappointed again.  Surprisingly the combination of the kimchi (which was wisely not too salty or spicy) with the cheese and the brightness of the chimichurri went very well together.The trout was delicious as well, cooked to the perfect crispness.  The sweetness of the dates provided a nice contrast to the other savory flavors, and the bulgar wheat was very hearty, reminiscent of the rice my mother would make ever once in a long while.  The food appealed to me due to it's fusion nature.  I find fusion falls flat more often than not, but it really worked at Ruxbin.  Often times I feel ingredients and techniques are rather forced; but don't really exist peacefully.  The use of Asian flavors and ingredients were done tastefully and subtle enough to where they can really meld well with the other ingredients.  The food was very satisfying and left me thinking my mother would approve of this.PS The girl working the line was really cute.  If you happy to be reading this.  Holler!"
"There aren't too many restaurants in Chicago that I can say the bathroom is enough to get me back there. It's a darkroom door - you walk in to a barrel, whip around like you're about to be sent through a drive-through bank teller machine, and then swivel the door shut into a cavern of concert posters, and yes - a toilet. Going through a bathroom door has never been so delightful. But the bathroom is just small metaphor for the conceit that is the gorgeous design of the entire space. Warm, tumbled tawny wood and a lofted, cookbook decoupaged ceiling create a space that's both cozy and airy.  And the FOOD. Just like in humans, mixing continental influences creates stronger and more interesting results. Kimchi in my empanada? Ye gracias. Everything we ate was worth closing our eyes and savoring - even the popcorn with seaweed that's brought out like bread. We had the lychee coconut desert and I found myself licking the bowl as my friend went to the aforementioned amazing bathroom. Overall: Ruxbin is a place worth revisiting again and again, especially if you have to pee."
"Excellent restaurant -- and BYO to boot! To begin with, expect a wait because they don't take reservations (arriving at 7:30pm on a Friday meant sitting down at 9). My suggestion - drive to Matchbox for a drink. Or, they do have a small waiting room off the kitchen, which has a large table and some seating to be shared. Then, while the menu is small, there seem to be enough options to please everyone -- including the vegetarian at the table. For apps, the empanada is super light and flaky, which is most welcome for something fried like that. The croque monsieur was touted as a highlight, but that can be skipped (at least by those at our table). Finally, the salad looked excellent. For entrees -- whomever came up with chicken and waffles is a friend. However, don't expect some big hunk of fried chicken to show. Instead, perfectly cooked breast, sliced, and the dark meat served chopped and sandwiched between a split waffle. So, definitely an interesting and welcome presentation. Other entrees were the short ribs, which I got to try -- perhaps even a winner over the chicken and waffles. As for vegetarian, the quinoa was so good my gf didn't even offer me any (which is fine by me). Only two deserts on the menu, none irresistible. So, in sum, hooraaay for another excellent BYO to be in the mix! Booo for no reservations, and ehh for appetizers and deserts. However, for small, quaint decor, with some fantastic entrees, this place is a winner!p.s - check out the cool dark room door leading to the bathroom."
"This place really makes me love white people.They take the craziest shit (found, reclaimed objects, eclectic art) and create a memorable experience.  From the church bench seats, to the pages pasted on the ceiling to the pieces lifted from the former mayor of Rockford's mansion--tres chic darling. And the BYOB policy is great...cuz I shoplifted a bottle of vino from Binny's. $5 corkage fee taint bad at all.   Okay, okay I'm being a cheeky bastard, only because I really enjoyed my experience.  And as I understand, it's Korean owned so yay! The food was great, and the service was even better. And as you may well know, the experience is what keeps bringing a diner back.My tape worm was feted with pan seared trout, crispy bulgar wheat and asparagus.  My comrade had the braised beef, brussels sprouts, and goat cheese grits.  The grits were okay--not quite as terrific as I'd hope, but way better than Quaker Quick Grits and American cheese like you might make in a hurry in the morning.  Desert was the shortbread get up--not too sweet...a nice cap on a great meal.  Our server had the perfect balance of enthusiasm for the menu, and was quick witted.  The host staff were equally cool.Speaking of cool--the bathroom is trippy. Don't go in there if you're stoned. I swear you'll think you're in Dr. Who's Tardis.Good food.  Great service. Local. Intimate.  Simple street parking.  And not a single diner was on their cell phone. I can't wait to return. Gold Star Ruxbin.Go."
"Favorite restaurant in Chicago! BYOB, amazing service, cute atmosphere, flavorful food--what more could you ask for? My favorite dish is the Amish chicken with Israeli couscous and dates--yummm!"
"Yet another successful Broad's Night Out...We had to wait a long time for a table for 7. However, all 7 of us brought enough adult beverages for all 7 (insert math equation). We hogged the stainless steel ""waiting table"" and shared with the other patrons who were waiting and made friends.  From what I can remember from the evening ... after we were seated, we shared with the other tables too. The food was superior, the waitstaff as nice as could be. My credit card bill (I don't remember paying) only had $40.00 charged and we all had appetizers, main course salads and deserts.  BYOB really keeps the bill down. I did have a massive hangover the next day. Truly massive."
"I LOVED Ruxin!!!Decor - Best and most innovative I've seen ever.  You MUST go to the bathroom.Popcorn - tasty with nori seasoningCroque Monsieur - was interesting, not a huge fan of it, I thought it was going to be more cheesyGarlic Fries - delish, sauce is creamy and flavorfulTonkatsu - very very very good, super tenderPan Seared Trout - as good as everyone says it's beenHanger Steak - YUMMY, my favorite dish of the nightShortbread dessert - tasty!!!Not that bad for 3 people - ended up being about $40/pp since it's BYOB so that helped alot!"
"Decor: awesomeService: AttentiveFood: DeliciousValue for food: HighReally nothing not to like. Creative chef that executes well on everything that I tried. In order from favorite to least favorite (if such a thing exists at Ruxbin):1. Chicken & Waffles2. Calamari3. Crispy Eggplant4. K-Town EmpanadasDesert (Bread Pudding) was awesome, and shouldn't be compared to the rest, as that would be like comparing apples and orangutans."
"Found an article in Chicago Magazine about their soft opening last night.  We live right around the corner and decided it was a good night to check it out.  The place is small and intimate, but decorated with a rustic look.  Recipes line the ceiling and I even noticed Julia Child's MtAoFC perched on the side wall (I'm reading Julie and Julia currently, so it stuck out to me).The menu isn't big, but it has many wonderful items.  We chose to go family style and order a bunch of items and share.  We started with the K-Town Empanadas and the Avocado Toast.  The empanadas were amazing.  Korean/Mexican??  Works perfectly!  And the avocado toasts had so much flavor...avocado, heirloom tomatoes, anchovies, onions, cheese!  So many flavors!  So good!Then we moved onto the salads.  We chose the Grapefruit and Jicama and also the Pear and Apple salad.  Both so fresh and delicious!  I'm drooling just thinking about them.Then we finished the meal with the Mussels in the Garlic Wine sauce with fries.  Tender juicy mussels, amazing sauce!   Huge chunks of garlic! YUM!The place is also BYOB (with a $5 cork fee) which always makes me happy!  We will definitely be back for more!  Great addition to the neighborhood!"
"Damn.  Ruxbin blows LA/NYC eateries out of the water.The steampunk decor is tastefully executed and even whimsical in nature.  The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  And the food?  WOWowowoWOW!A friend and I shared several dishes here on a Sunday night.  At 7 PM, we had a ~15 minute wait, and the restaurant was full until its close at 9 without ever feeling overly crowded or noisy.  Entrees are nicely portioned, and for better or worse won't leave you stuffed ie allows room for you and your table to share some smaller-portioned appetizers and dessert.Celery and Grape Soda [4.5] On the small side, maybe 6-8oz glass with some room lost for ice, but it was a beautifully light and innovative drink with just the right hint of savory celery balanced with light, sweet, and crisp grape.Crispy Eggplant w/ roasted beets, cucumber, frisee, & honey-cardamom yogurt [3.5]Nicely crusted/breaded and fun to try, though I'd probably opt for something different on my next visit.Calamari Bokkum w/ korean chili, peanuts, baby potatoes, & sesame [5]Delicious.  The calamari is sauteed, not breaded/fried.  So tender, and the Korean chili has an umami savoriness similar to Chinese black bean sauce.  Not really spicy IMO.9 Spice Quinoa w/ masala curry & market vegetables [5]The masala sauce is quite rich, which makes for a pretty filling dish.  It's plated adjacent to the quinoa and vegetables such that the diner can decide how much or little to sauce, but believe me, you will be finishing off every last lick of masala whether it's accompanied by something or standing in its own pure glory.Center-cut Roasted Pork Loin w/ drunken black beans, apple-rosemary lumpia & cherry mostarda [7.  no.  12.  yes, out of 5.]That pork is like ... slow, romantic sex - a sensual treat you could never say no to, and probably find yourself daydreaming wistfully about every now and again.  Cooked perfectly medium and tender, and surprisingly light, so perfectly accompanied by the savory smokiness of the bacon black beans and the sweet of the apple lumpia (filipino egg roll) and cherry mostarda reduction.  Think there was also a small arugula salad on the side.  I have officially re-entered wistful daydream mode.Panna Cotta w/ lychee & toasted coconut [5]This is how panna cotta should be made (and how coconut should be toasted, while we're at it).  It's not meant to be gelatinous, nor is it meant to be a heavy pudding.  Rather, it should combine the best of both worlds - creaminess and feather-light airiness.  And Ruxbin certainly succeeds.Kudos, Ruxbin.  I can't wait til the next time we dance."
"I thought Ruxbin was awesome! And I'd definitely go back! Note, they do not take reservations so be prepared to wait. We got there at 6:10 and although they had just opened (at 5:30) we still had to wait a hour for a table. Luckily there's an upstairs waiting section where you can drink (it's BYOB) and enjoy a small bowl of their complementary popcorn. Unfortunately, we all forgot to bring something to drink. When we told this to the hostess she informed us that Lush Wine & Spirits in Wicker Park delivers for free. So we called them up and w/in minutes they dropped off our two bottles of wine to us on the 2nd-floor. How awesome!Another note, due to their limited seating capacity on Friday & Saturdays they can only accommodate groups up to 4. Upon seeing how tiny the place was, now I know why!Their decor is very unique and cool. As described on their website their ""32-seat American Bistro hosts a steam-punk decor in a sepia-toned menagerie."" They've even taken this cool art vibe to the ceilings - they are covered in decoupaged recipe book pages. Oh, and make sure to go to the bathroom. It was an interesting experience! The door is way neat. I felt like I was going into a secret chamber. I loved all the band promo prints decoupaged on the walls, too.Although they only offer a handful of appetizers and entrees, the few that they do have are impeccable. I'd rather have a handful of items on the menu that have been perfected rather than several items that are either either hit or miss.The food is incredible. The 4 of us we ordered up a storm! We got the garlic fries (yum!), calamari (I'm not a big calamari fan so I only had a little and it was good), and an eggplant dish (the citrus-y flavor was great). One of my friends and I each got a bowl of the Tomato Tarragon broth with Kimchi Dumpling. I thought it was ok. For our entree her and I split the 9 Spice Quinoa in masala. OMG, that was amazing! Even the quinoa alone (without the masala sauce) was incredible! And with the masala sauce it was out of this world! For dessert we split the two items that were on the menu: the Berry Shortcake (it was drizzled in chocolate syrup) and Panna Cotta (a delicious custard with lychee in it). Both were equally yummy. Overall I felt all the flavors in each dish were so complex, rich, and unique. I left Ruxbin feeling satisfied and full but, happily, not stuffed."
Second time there and I can't say enough about the food. I just can't. So so amazing. I will continue to go back as long as I can get a seat!!! Thanks for arguably the best food in Chicago.
"This place is a gem!!  Came in on a Thursday night with no wait at all. Had the salmon appetizer while drinking our first of three bottles of wine --It's BYOB if you did not know which is great--  we loved it. It was not fishy at all and had great flavors. The highlight of the meal was the steak. One of the best I have ever head. Full of flavor, cooked perfectly medium rare.  Great meal all together. My wife had the soba,  let just say I dont think she really knew what t was and she did not enjoy it at all. Don't forget to check out the bathroom. It's very unique...  You will know what I mean when you go there."
"After an hour of tasting different wines, a friend and I decided we needed to find a BYOB place to try out some of our new bottles of wine. Enter Ruxbin.We walk in and no wait - pretty rare from what I've heard. As we sit down, we see each of the tables around us receiving quelques amuses bouches. We secretly waited for ours to come out since we arrived only a bit after the other tables. Alas, we never got one, which may be the reason I had to knock down the review to a four. We were both the tiniest bit bitter, sorry Ruxbin.Other than that, we started off with the eggplant starter, which was good, but I would be open to trying something different next time. I also got the special fish of the day. Then, since we decided we wanted to go all out, we had the berry shortcake. The balsamic in this dessert is just amazing - get it!All in all, would definitely come here again. Make sure you go upstairs to the bathroom so you can feel like a superhero. Don't forget to bring your own bottles because there was quite a wait between the appetizer and the main dish."
"Great ambiance, yummy food, BYOB, outstanding service, - however tiny entree portions.I am re-craving the salmon."
"Have you ever been to a restaurant so good that you feel obligated to tell everyone about it? Well tonight the stars were aligned, and Ruxbin was that restaurant. The restaurant's reputation precedes itself, and I was mentally prepared to wait a while for a seat. To my surprise, the pleasant seating hostess (who I believe was one of the three owners) showed me the communal table upstairs next to the kitchen, with seats available in 20 minutes. Since I was a solo-diner and had no one to impress, I opted for the communal table. Like Graham Elliot, this place offers popcorn in lieu of bread. But instead of truffle oil and chive, Ruxbin used seaweed powder, a simple way that immediately tells you what this place is all about - a casual theater of east meets west. The place is BYO. Since I was not about to finish a bottle of wine by myself on a week night, I ordered both house-made sodas on the menu (apple cider and celery soda) and enjoyed them throughout my meal. The flavors were straight-forward and good, but both were flat, which was a shame because they would have made perfect palate cleansers. Food was simply amazing.  For appetizer I got the calamari. Now the menu description didn't sound encouraging- chicken and pork farce forced in calamari - but it was a knockout! It was basically Asian-style meat paste stuffed in calamari, kind of like a zampone. The flavor was spot on and unmistakably Korean. The balance of spicy, sweet, and smoky was perfect and assertive. The menu might as well read ""deokbokki (spicy Korean rice cake), smoked squid, and crack cocaine."" It was so damn good! After my appetizer, the chef sent out the soup of the day, complimentary of the kitchen. What a surprise! Was it compassion for a solo-foodie-diner or suspicion that I could be a food critic, possibly from Michelin? Either way, never one to turn down free food, I gladly chowed down the soup. The base of the soup was beef stock, with star-anise and mushroom adding umami, barley for substance, and fennel for brightness. The star-anise added that Chinese flair that immediately made it nostalgic for me. This was a very well balanced bowl of flavor-bomb. It was like party in my mouth... My main dish was bucatini with clam. If you are familiar with zha-jiang-mian (a pork-sauce noodle dish that originated in Northern China, but Taiwan, Japan, and Korea all have their own versions), this dish will be instantly recognizable to you. Of course, instead of hand-pulled noodle, Ruxbin used bucatini that was cooked perfectly al dente. And instead of dark vinegar, they used white wine sauce with perfectly executed clam. I love it when food is familiar and surprising all at the same time! For dessert, I had the lychee panna cotta. This was panna cotta like no others. it was fine and delicate in texture (more like a flan), rich but fruity in taste, and topped with perfectly toasted coconut. A very simple yet nuanced dessert! Since I didn't sit in the dining room, I didn't have a chance to observe the decor closely. But from what I could see, the restaurant felt cozy and casual. The bathroom had an interesting door design. I will let you check it out yourself. Service was friendly, intuitive, and perfectly paced. The expediter, Nate, was very personable and actively engaged diners who were waiting in line for the cool bathroom. Chef Kim himself was quite hands on. He was constantly moving around and tasting everything. Ruxbin was a well-oiled machine, within the kitchen and without. Asian-fusion has become somewhat of a dirty word, thanks to the ubiquitous trendy but soulless Asian-fusion restaurants that serve spider rolls and sake-tini. When I was talking to the expediter, he sneered at my first mention of fusion and proclaimed Ruxbin to be ""American."" It's true, but it's sad. I understand the concept of contemporary American, but I also want Asian chefs, like their Latino counterparts, to embrace and be proud of the ethnic influence in their food. Call it Asian-fusion, call it contemporary American, or call it self-loathing, Ruxbin is ""fill-in-the-blank"" done right! The combination of flavors and textures were unique and insightful, and the execution was faultless. No matter who you are, every dish will proffer a creative edge but also a source of comfort. Ruxbin reminds me of Obao in New York, only better and more refined. For a similar degree of hype, Ruxbin also outshines Girl and the Goat in terms of flavor-profile and creativity. At such a reasonable price, I have absolutely no clue why this was not a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant. Michelin really missed the mark on this one. While I'm at it, the overall food concept of Ruxbin also reminds me of Schwa, only Ruxbin has more Asian and is a bit more rustic in its presentation. If Ruxbin focuses the concept even more and cleans up the presentation, 1 Michelin star is not without justice. I will be back!"
"This place gets 5 stars based on originality. I am so glad I came here on my birthday!  It was perfect.I loved the space!  Everything is made from repurposed materials.  It is a feast for your eyes!  Such an interesting, cozy space.  The service was great, everyone was super friendly and inviting.  And they might have one of the coolest bathrooms I have been to since 1998 when Pasha had that full service bar inside the ladies room. The food was very good, but I wasn't totally blown away.  Perhaps my expectations were a little high based on the sophisticated menu.  My dinner didn't seem very fresh, although it was very good... as though it had been sitting for a while.  But the flavors were all there.  I had the trout and my date had steak, and we ate everything off our plates.  We also had the berry shortcake dessert which was really good, too.  We started with the tonkatsu which was pretty good, but I suspect might have come out of a frozen bag as the breading was a little too perfect.   I will definitely give this place a second chance and can't wait to go back."
"The food:Appetizers - Pork Belly Salad, CalamariEntree:Hanger SteakDessert:Berry ShortcakePanna CottaBYOB!This place is a gem and I'm glad to have tried it.  This place recently celebrated its first anniversary and I'm so glad to see it thriving.  When you first walk in, you should notice the interesting interior design of the place.  The owners incorporated salvaged design and furniture decor so each ornament seems to have some sort of history behind it.  For example, the seat backs along the wall are made of old seat belts - they're extra sturdy and fit in perfectly with the design and theme of the place.  Food was great.  Pork belly is one of my favorite things to eat and it was tasty with the salad - the jicama and grapefruit cut the fat really well.  Hanger steak was tasty - medium rare and served with wrinkled long beans, candied bacon, and chimichurri sauce.  Finally, the dessert was good...if you try the panna cotta, you'll notice it is lychee and toasted coconut flavored.  Definitely something unique that you probably won't be able to have anywhere else.All in all, will be coming back here again.  Make sure to check out the furniture pieces - the backstory behind how they acquired the pieces is something you won't be able to get anywhere else."
"Friend and I were lucky and got seated right away on a Wednesday night around 6:30.  We both forgot it was BYOB; fortunately there are two liquors/wine shops that will deliver for free!!  We ordered a bottle of wine from Noble Grapes (amazing suggestion), which got to our table in under 10 minutes.  Even before the food, service was top-notch.We ordered:- calamari- garlic fries- clam bake- hangar steak- berry shortcakeThe space is very cool - what seemed like old school desks redone into light fixtures.  The bathroom was awesome as well, covered in music concert posters.  Food, delicious.  Overall, a great experience. Definitely want to come back."
"What a fabulous place... My girl and I had dinner last night and I can't stop raving about it to all my friends. The food, the service and the atmosphere were top notch. World class meal for two under $50, amazing! Thanks Ruxbin, we will be back.FYI - They are BYOB and we got our wine at The Noble Grape!"
"Great atmosphere, good service, amazingly appointed space and absolutely delicious food makes this one of my favorites. Oh and it is BYOB. Score!"
"Delicious food, I just wish I had more of it. My best friend and I, far from being beefy types, had dinner here tonight after hearing all of Ruxbin's glowing reviews. He ordered the halibut, I had the pork loin. We spent more time waiting for our meal than consuming it.  My dish was juicy, the interplay between the grilled peaches, hominy, and chickpeas lovely, but I was still really hungry after my meal. So was my friend. Mind you, he's about 5'7"" and 140 pounds sopping wet. We trucked it to Lockdown shortly thereafter."
"Simply one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. After booking flights to Chicago for a birthday weekend trip, I made an e-bee line to Yelp to find some fun dining options. I happened upon the reviews for Ruxbin, and the rest is history. I was intrigued by everything I read about the place - the owners, the re-purposed interior furnishings, their blog, the menu - and although it was a bit of a trek from our downtown hotel, we are so glad that we made the trip. Decor - casually inviting and fascinating. I enjoyed a few moments thinking about the stories behind every table, wall panel, and light fixture since I knew all of the materials were on their second life. Service - sweet, and subtle. Our server was attentive, clearly knowledgeable, and happy to have us there, but left us to enjoy the rest of our bottle of wine before approaching us with dessert options. Never has that happened before and we were beyond impressed. Most servers and restaurant management are interested in getting another turn in, or are simply unaware of your speed of dining. To be left alone under watchful eyes was a treat. Food - such a cool blend of ingredients and styles. It was completely different without being fussy or formal. The flavors were presented in new combinations, but all of the ingredients were familiar. My husband noted that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the tables. The chef is confident (and clearly able) in his creations. No at-the-table doctoring needed. You must go, and be prepared to feel like you're having dinner at your bestest, coolest, chef-friend's house."
"My roommates and I had a few friends in town and decided we wanted to bring them to somewhere relatively close to our place. I noticed that Ruxbin had a great overall rating so after checking out their website we decided to give it a go.Our wait for 5 was around an hour and a half. They have a designated seating area for people to wait but considering everyone has a really long wait getting a seat there is impossible. We wandered off to a local bar and waited for the phone call that our table was open (which is super convenient).With multiple wine bottles in hand, we finally made it into the restaurant and to our table. We tried the fries/mayo (good), calamari (very good) and the croque monsieur (so-so) as appetizers. A few of us had their pan seared trout and it was fantastic. I haven't had much wheat tabbouleh but the texture addition alongside the sweetness of the dates and the crusted/not overly fishy trout was awesome. I also tried some of the goat cheese grits which were fantastic as well. Ruxbin is definitely the kind of place I would bring friends again as long as the group was smaller and I had a couple hours to kill. Good food, cozy and intimate setting, and very friendly staff."
Never had a bad dish in 3 trips there.Friendly staffBYO
"My new favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Everything is perfect for a nice, cozy dinner.  Repurposed materials frame the small room that serves anything but reused food ideas.  I love when a restaurant keeps the menu small and sticks to doing everything well... seriously did not have a bad bite here: - Popcorn munchies with some strange yet addictive seasoning to start - Crispy Eggplant with roasted beets and best dressing ever! - Apple and Plum Salad - very refreshing - Pan Seared Trout with bulger wheat (yum how did they make something called bulger so delicious?) and dates - Braised Short Rib with brussel sprouts and goat cheese grits mmmmmm - Berry Shortcake with homemade biscuit was nice way to end the super fresh mealTotal bill for 2 was $76 before tip.  BYOB with $5 corkage.  Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive and awkwardly cute.  In short, I will definitely be going back.  Only complaints I have heard is that the lines can be long, but we breezed right in on a Wednesday night.Ruxbin the restaurant dream I never knew... so exciting to have found you!"
"Dining these days in some restaurants is such that you need a game strategy to maximize your experience.  The best time to get there, best day, what not.  I hate that in a lot of ways, because eating out should not have to be that difficult.  But when a place is worth the wait, what can I do but go with the flow?So, Ruxbin.  The little place that could.  It does need a bit of strategy to fully enjoy Ruxbin.  I'm sure everyone has their own way of doing it, so moving on.Starters are great.  The garlic fries just flies out of the kitchen.  The menu is seasonal and dishes might not be around when you get there.  For this write up, I will jump over the starters and go right into mains.  A group of 4 had 4 different entrees, with the intent that we will share everything.  We had (1) Clams, couscous, watercress, fennel, heirloom baby tomatoes, vermouth.  (2) Pork Loin, fava beans, heirloom baby carrots, pistou.  (3) Amish Chicken, roasted breast, confit leg, red pearl onions, Brussels sprouts, pain perdu of apple, gouda, walnuts.  (4) Beef & Broccoli, hanger steak, broccolini, rice tots, miso butter.  The amazing thing about it is even though the 4 dishes are distinctive, somehow there is a harmony where everything did not just taste good on its own, it also worked very well together.  That is a magnificent feat!  We told chef that on one of the visits to the coolest bathroom in town.  You see different things on the menu.  Who knew that they can also blend so well?Desserts were interesting.  The pot de crème alternated with deep chocolate tastes, and spices.  The hand pie, on the other hand, has the flakiest crust of any pie I've had.  Sublime.Why 4 stars?  Cooking from the heart is thrown around a lot these days, whether honest or a marketing ploy.  At Ruxbin, the restaurant is a true labor of love, and you can definitely feel that.  Again, you would need a game strategy to maximize getting there and getting a table.  It could be annoying sometimes.  But oh, Ruxbin is well worth it!"
"The truth is the food wasn't bad at Ruxbin, however for an hour and a half wait and a $100 bill (for two people without drinks), the food better be ahmazing.  And it wasn't.  It was just almost good.  Additionally, they were out of two entrees by the time we got seated, both which we would have gotten instead of what we ended up getting.We started out the night with the panko crusted pork.  My first thought upon eating them?  Chicken McNuggets.  The sauce on top was average to good, but not good enough to make it anything more than chicken McNuggets with coleslaw.Then we had the plum and apple salad, which was a decent salad.For dinner I had the trout which was good, the best part of the meal was the bulgar underneath.  It was crunchy and delicious.  My husband had the hanger steak, which was extremely mediocre.  The potatoes it came with were delicious.  The crunchy kale was like eating olive oil it was so drenched.  We also had a strawberry shortcake for dessert, which was, again, good, but not spectacular.All in all, for $100 and an hour and a half wait, I wanted better food and a more memorable experience."
"LOVED:- The fried eggplant/frissee/beet/yogurt salad and the chicken and waffles.  - Also Loved that 2 places (!!!) delivered wine for you, if you didn't realize it was BYOB.  :D- Awesome-tastic door to the bathroom.NOT SO MUCH LOVED:- The white-noise style music + bipolar climate control + crampy seating that all contributed to the massive instant headache I got the second I walked in and lost 30 minutes after leaving.- The odd same-ness of the look/feel/vibe of everyone in the restaurant.I will def be back, albeit with ibuprofen. :)"
"This was a perfect date place, and definitely one of the finer dining experiences I've had in Chicago.  The decor is unique, the noise level in the dining room lends an appropriate level of intimacy to the occasion without being too loud (if that makes sense), and the staff were exceptionally nice.  When we arrived we had to wait for about 20 minutes for our table, but Ruxbin has a very nice little waiting area directly across from the kitchen.  They brought us water, opened our wine and brought popcorn.  Meanwhile, my date and I drooled over the variations on Damn Delicious  that were being meticulously prepped by the chef at the counter and then spirited away to diners by the wait staff.  By the time we were seated, we could hardly wait to eat.  The food was delicious - my date had the pork loin with grilled peaches.  I went with the hangar steak.  Neither of us were disappointed.  The pairing of pork with grilled peaches, however, was a little more divine - especially when you scooped up a few of the roasted chickpeas, too.For dessert we split a berry shortcake that was also marvelous.  After our meal, I did take a field trip to the bathroom (mostly because I'm nosy).  Definitely an interesting place to have a pee.But - the real highlight of the evening for me (besides being on a date with my dude, of course) was getting to chat briefly with the chef, Nate, who we had been watching while we waited for our table.  He gave me a kumquat to try, and thanked us for stopping in.  You can't pass up that kind of class.  Thanks, Nate!We will be back."
"Cheers to Ruxbin!  Thoughtful and conscientious cuisine and service.  The juxtaposition of flavors, textures, and presentation were delicious, memorable, and moving.  We were fortunate to get the last table at about 6:00 last Friday, especially as I had really looked forward to celebrating my 40th birthday here."
"This place was amaazing. Can't believe we've driven past so many times without checking it out. It's a small, intimate place so we waited for a party of 6 sure, but they let us wait upstairs and drink the BYOB wines we had brought. The staff is genuinely attentive and on point. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu and nothing disappointed!"
"The food at Ruxbin is outstanding. If you go during an off-peak time, the experience is even better. Ruxbin does not take reservations and it's very, very small. The decor is really warm and appealing. All of the furniture is re-purposed and the ceiling is pasted with cookbook pages. The service was good for the most part, and although they are BYOB you can order wine from Noble Grape and have it delivered to your table (no delivery fee). We dined on a rainy Sunday night after a Blackhawks game. It was early, 5:30pm. As an appetizer, I started with the Croque Monsieur. This isn't your typical french Croque Monsieur, it was a reinvented version. It was still a crisp toast with melted gruyere and ham, but they added tomatoes, marmalade and an olive tapenade. It was really flavorful and I really enjoyed it. We also had the Calamari Bokkum with peanuts and baby potatoes. This was also really delicious and unique. We loved it. For my entree, I ordered the Braised Short Ribs with brussel sprouts, tomatoes and gremolata and goat cheese grits. Again, delicious. I'd definitely say I made the right selections off of the menu. Overall, I thought there were a lot of great sounding appetizers and salads, but the entree and dessert offerings seemed to lack that ""mouthwatering"" variety. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood. But, when I looked around the room, almost every table ordered exactly the same thing. Don't get me wrong, everything that I ordered was fantastic, but it's a pretty small menu. If you don't mind the cozy quarters and overhearing conversations, the food is absolutely worth a try."
"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I fell in love with this place as I walked in. The interior design is so creative with lots of recycled and reused materials! Such a cool environment. The food is amazing as well! I ordered the garlic fries, tomato tarragon soup, and the mussels. The tomato soup is a must try! I am a sucker for tomato soup, especially creamy ones, this one is definitely one of my favorites I've tried. I also got to try my friend's Hanger Steak and that was so yummy!!!! Next time I am in Chicago, I am definitely going back to get the hanger steak for myself Lastly, for dessert I ate the Berry Shortcake, which is a must try too! I have a major sweet tooth. The location is conveniently down the street from my brother's place, so that is a plus too!"
"Is there anything better than Mussels and fries on the same plate?!?!?!?!?!The details of this place is what stands out.  The decor is exceptional and you definitely get a warm, intimate feeling.  So it's a great place to eat with friends and your significant other.  Upstairs while you are waiting, they have some delicious popcorn (...and no, this is not your theater popcorn...).  Of course, the bathroom is a detail you need to experience.Back to the food, the flavors are exceptional and such an experience.  There's not really a lot of restaurants in Ruxbin's area that provides this kind of party in your mouth.As always, what makes an establishment 5-stars is whether we would come back and of course, we are planning to come back frequently to enjoy what we've tried but to make sure we try everything in the menu.Plus, we have a ton of friends who haven't heard of this place yet that we want to take them so they can enjoy this wonderful find!"
"Everything was delicious!!  The only reason for the 4 stars is the wait.  But then again, what can they do, everyone is coming back for more.  The first time I went to Ruxbin was Tues. night around 730.  It is a small restaurant so they were packed with an 1.5 hr. wait.  Our growling bellies could not handle that wait time.  Next time I tried was on a Wed. around 8 and I was determined to wait it out.My advice: go early or go not starving, bring a bottle (or 2) of wine to drink while you wait and you'll be fine.  The 1 hr. wait was not nearly as bad with a bottle of wine in front of you.The menu is small so with a table of 4 we ordered about half of the menu.  Everything was delicious.  The portion sizes are modest, but that allows you to have a starter and entree without feeling too stuffed after the meal.Highlight starters:Get the garlic fries for the table to start - yummy.Then I had the Crispy Eggplant (kind of salad).  Delicious!Highlight Entree:Short ribs.  I just tapped the meat with my fork and it fell right off the bone.   You just can't get any better then that.If you have a sweet tooth like me, you MUST get the bread pudding!Out of this world.Cheers!"
"Ruxbin is solid! I won't write an involved review since so many others have done a great job already. A few high points and unique details that make Ruxbin the charming neighborhood experience that it is: 1) Check out the bathroom! 2) What does Teddy Ruxbin have to do with anything?! :) 3) A brother-sister duo and that special family-owned level of service and attention to detail4) Tantalizing, fresh ingredients in unique combinations5) Great ambiance and an interesting decor, reminiscent of a wooden crate lost at sea and rediscovered in a dark roomMy only gripe was the panna cotta (spot on with the lime zest and coconut flavors, but the texture was off - it wasn't as silky or smooth as it could have been)."
"Went here on a quiet Sunday night. The place filled up pretty quick. I'll cut right to it. Place: Very cool. We were seated near the window, very draughty. Do not recommend in the middle of our 9 mo winter. Service was good, pleasant. Let's get to the nitty gritty--the Food:Seaweed popcorn: Tasty!Garlic Fries --super garlicky, a lil oily. Kimchi calamari--Decent flavor, expect non-crispy doused in sauce calamari. Points for being different in concept taste wise, but not that awesome.Chicken and Waffles--Good flavor, moist and tender chicken, waffle was sweet with some sort of onion relish. Overall good, but NOT mind-blowing.Trout--Really good. Perfectly cooked. Quinoa salad with asparagus was delicious.Chocolate Bread Pudding--Rather dry, not much sauce (I like my bread pudding drenched in creamery goodness). BYOB: Fab.Overall, a cute place with good food, but nothing that amazing."
"Loved it all at Ruxbin.I came across this place while searching for a good byob place in the city.  And I am so happy I did, otherwise I wouldn't have found out about Ruxbin.It's small, cozy, friendly, and the food is divine.At our table we had the garlic fries, the empanadas, the calamari, the muscles, the trout, the chicken and waffles, and the short rib.  Everyone loved all of it.  Warning: chicken and waffle dish is REALLY filling- if you get this skip the apps- well, maybe not skip, but don't order almost all of them, like we did.We went 2 weeks ago, and were still talking about our dinner.  Can't wait to come back."
"This place is so good-- Must tries are the pan seared trout and the hanger steak.Everything is delicious and it is BYOB what more can one ask for? Well, reservations! They only take walk-ins and get ready to wait a good hour on a Friday or Saturday night.Go during the week and save yourself the heart ache."
"One of the best dinners I've had in recent months.  Service was excellent. Started out with popcorn sprinkled with  seaweed and a mix of other stuff that I cannot remember. That was nice. We shared the Beet appetizer, which was delicious. I loved the pumpernickel crisp and fresh cheese. The beets were  excellent and offset by the anchovy. I had the  scallop dinner and my friend had the beef and broccoli. The scallops were huge. Very flavorful succotash and scallops and the  pork belly made it amazing.  My friend's  beef was very tender, well cooked  and an excellent pairing to the kimchi rice tots. For dessert, we had these heavenly pretzel doughnuts filled with chocolate pudding and a sprig of mint, paired with this milk sorbet.  To die for.  The mint  gave you this mint choco doughnut that melted in your mouth. Truly exquisite.  Recommendation - go on a weekday. Wait times - We went at like 640 and only had to wait like 30 min for a table for 2."
"I had heard about this place for a long time and was finally was able to get myself and some friends to go.  Four of us ordered dishes and shared family style,  We tried the 9 Spice Quinoa (surprisingly tasty!), Braised Short Rib, Pan Seared Trout, and unfortunately I can't remember the 4th dish as I went over a month ago (doh!)My friends and I enjoyed all the entrees although I was secretly thinking that each dish could have been a little larger.  I'm a small person but what if someone with a super hearty appetite wanted to dine?Even so, the dishes were tasty with great flavors.The night ended with phenomenal bread pudding.  Do not miss it!!All in all, the price might seem high based on what you get for portion size but definitely a place to try at least once.  :)  It's byob too."
Their red quinoa and tofu dish was absolutely sinful.  Just went to dinner there this week with another couple and we have a fabulous time.  Our waiter was knowledgable about the menu and was very attentive. Love that it's BYOB!Fabulous place!
"Went here for dinner on Sunday night.  LOVE that it's BYOB to keep the cost down.  We started with the Tonkatsu appetizer.  Perfect size for 2.  Very tasty.  I loved the pickled melon and walnuts.  For dinner I had the pork loin.  They were out of cranberries for the mostarda, so they used cherry instead.  It was great.  Perfect size.  I cleaned my plate.  My husband had the hanger steak and that was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  His only complaint was the temperature of the food.  (the temperature of my dish was fine)We were going to pass on dessert but then the people next to us had the shortbread.  It looked too good to pass up.  Loved the balsamic and creme chantilly.  Only downside is no reservations, small space, and not much around if you got stuck waiting.  Fortunately, we called ahead and they said they were slow.  (probably due to most of Chicago still at the bar shocked from the Bears loss!)I recommend Ruxbin for a dinner for 2.  Definitely not a place for groups."
"great way to celebrate graduation from my MBA. the garlic fries were a great starter. the chicken was really moist and had tons of flavor. pork was awesome. the only complaint we had was that the food was lukewarm. other than that, the flavors were all there. the bathroom pod is pretty interesting..."
"One of the better BYOB restaurants in the city. They don't take reservations so plan accordingly, and last time we went we had a hard time finding somewhere to go for a drink while we waited for them to call. They have a communal waiting table where you can wait and drink but it happened to be full that nite. Our fold was excellent and our server was extremely nice. In fact, we were blown away by how genuine the service was--it was great!  This may seem weird, but I mostly want to return to Ruxbin because they have the coolest bathroom of all time! The revolving door takes you into a room wallpapered with concert posters from some of the best indie and pop artists of our time. I loved it!"
"I've been to Ruxbin six times now and I have never been disappointed in a single dish.  Over those 6 times, I've experienced 5 different menus, I believe.  Each menu has similar core items- a lean steak, a fish (I've had trout for separate menus and both were fantastic), pork, a vegetarian option, etc.  There is definitely something for everyone on the menu and the meats/fish have been flawlessly prepared every time.  The atmosphere is unique and most of the decor consists of reclaimed items- the bathroom (which is reclaimed from a dark room) is not to be missed. Yes, you have to put your name in and waits are often long, but they make it very easy for you to go grab a drink elsewhere (going to Lush wine bar on Chicago Ave is great idea because you can pick up wine/beer for your dinner).  And, to walk away with a fantastic meal for less than $100 a couple is unbeatable."
"there are only two drawbacks to this place, one, its not big enough and two they don't take reservations.Ok, now that is out of the way, this place might be one of the best restaurants in the city!  The food is phenomenal!  We started with the calamari, which wasn't your typical dish, try it.  I had the skirt steak, which was just ok, but my girlfriend had the trout which was one of the best fish dishes I've ever tasted!  Desert was incredible too.  On top of it all the place is BYOB for now!  You have to get here early because they don't take reservations, but i guess you don't need to when the food is this great."
"No reservations, so come early (or on weekdays) or be prepared to wait. The interior design is stellar, made entirely from recycled/reused interiors and other items. There's a glass wall made from from the former Sonotheque DJ booth which we former Sonotheque DJs would somewhat-affectionately call ""the fish bowl."" There's a bench lining an entire wall that's made from seat belts, and a string of tables along the bench which appear to have been made out of one gigantic piece of wood. They mounted Eames chair tops onto the old wooden chairs that came with the place, to nice effect. The ceiling is wallpapered with pages from cook books, etc, etc...Oh, and the food is also great! Really really yummy stuff, subtle and interesting flavors.And keeping this all relatively affordable is the fact that it's BYOB.I would definitely give Ruxbin 4 stars if not for feeling rushed at the end of dinner. This is understandable, 'cause it's a small, very popular place, but it's a bummer to have plates taken away just as you're placing the last morsel in your mouth."
"I walked by this place on the way home and didn't see a sign or anything, but saw a lot of people through the window having dinner in a beautifully low-lit room. The only sign there said they were now serving dinner. I searched like mad online trying to find out what it was, but when I couldn't find the info I decided to dive in and take my friend anyway.We found out once we entered that this was Ruxbin - the restaurant with all the recent press coverage. We had to wait and were led up a small set of stairs to a large metal table that we shared with another small group. They gave us a small bowl of popcorn to share while we waited. Up the stairs is also the mysterious bathroom with the circular darkroom door. The concert posters that line the walls in there are beautiful. The restaurant is very tiny and intimate. It's a bit loud when it's full but at least you aren't sitting as close to other people like at Bristol, and the lighting is so low you can pretend you're further away. Candlelight is on every table.I got the hanger steak with kale and pureed cauliflower. It was incredible! Amazing taste and not overdone. My friend is a vegetarian and I noticed that there weren't many veggie-friendly entree options, but luckily she wasn't too hungry anyway so she got a small plate. Despite being pleased by the atmosphere and the taste of the food (as well as the amazingly kind and attentive staff) I was displeased by their portions for the money. The appetizers don't cost much less than the entrees, and they are almost too small to share. The entrees don't make up for the imbalance because they are also not that large. The second and more problematic deduction is their lack of vegetarian options - like I previously mentioned. I hope that when they officially open in a few days they have more entree options for vegetarians besides the vast array of vegetarian small plates.Despite what it lacks it's a very charming and warm place to take someone on a first date or just to have a rewarding night out. Hit up Lush down on Chicago for your best BYOB beverage! $5 cork fee."
"So pleasant! We've gone a few times, had to wait a bit each time, and I'm still into it. Simple delicious [mostly snackish] food, incredibly friendly and accommodating staff, reasonably priced everything, and a cool comforting decor. BYOB and no reservations works perfectly, and they'll provide you with chillers or buckets without a fuss. Get the avocado toast, elotes, empanadas, and mussels (which come with a pile of fries for dipping and chomping.)ps. The bathroom is pretty neat.pps. I tried to cut and paste an ASCII bear into here, but couldn't get it formatted properly."
"Come with wine and begin sipping as you wait, because you will wait. But it is worth it. Everything was perfect and we ate a lot. appetizers: fried quail, flatbread, octopus, and beets. I had the beef and broccoli for dinner and they would only prepare it medium rare - (in general, I prefer my beef medium because I can't look at pink, bloody meat) but this was a hangar steak - thin and perfect. No squeamishness from me. My friends had the pork loin, clams, and wild salmon and there were no complaints. Upstairs is the waiting area, the one bathroom, and kitchen - as you wait - you can talk those in the kitchen - and they were friendly and so appreciative of all the well-earned compliments everyone was giving."
I would have taken a star away if I hadn't been seated in the first seating after getting there before it opened and standing around ( wear comfy shoes). Food was very very good. Our trout was not fully cooked but they were very apologetic and made it right with dessert. Hipster paradise:)
I had the Pork Belly salad and it was awesome.  Beautiful decor and absolutely great service.
"My summary:  Amazing food with a unique, creative touch.I can't say enough great things about Ruxbin.  Menu, quality of ingredients, service, decor - they all exceeded my already high expectations.  I highly recommend the Jicama and Grapefruit and the Marinated Hanger Steak.  A superb combo.Granted, Ruxbin just opened and so yes, they have some kinks to work out.  But for how new they are, I was very impressed.Btw, the friendliness of the staff is almost reason enough to go.  :)"
"First off, I am Korean, so any place that claims Korean fusion better bring it.  And normally, I am super critical when it comes to asian fusion food, just because other than Bonsoiree, I really haven't seen it done very well.  This place is absolutely awesome.  Well, sort of awesome.  Let me explain.Food is excellent here.  You can just about try anything, and you'll love it.  I've now been here three times, and I can say with certainty that they have very few bad nights, and whether it be K-town empenadas, Pan Seared Trout (such a rich savory fish dish, I really wish they still had it on the menu), Chicken & Waffles (my fellow diner usually shies away from fried chicken, but he devoured this one) and Bread Pudding (all from a prior menu) or garlic fries, calamari (totally reminds me of home), hanger steak and sablefish (that tea broth is just so divine) - it's all very good, if not excellent.  Easily FIVE STARS for food.But, here's the rub.  It's kind of difficult to dine here unless you have four hours to spare or if you are willing to have dinner at 5pm.  Why?  Well, you get there around 6:45 thinking, okay, I can deal with an hour worth of wait.  But no, in reality, it's a 2 hour wait. Literally, plus more, on a TUESDAY night.  Are you kidding?  We were craving it, okay fine, so I was craving it and I made my date wait with me, despite the fact that we were famished.  We waited until 9:05 and we were finally seated.  The inconvenience of it all is just terrible.   That to me is definitely merits a reduction of a star.But then, there is the rather rude hostess that has no understanding of what her job entails.  I get that you have to juggle tables, and you don't know how long people are going to linger.  If you underestimate the time, at least be gracious about it, and acknowledge that you messed up.  She told me 2 hours at 6:45 when we initially walked in - I said okay.   An hour later, I call from a bar where we're waiting it out, and she tells me it'll be another hour and a half.  Come on, for a two top?  No apologies, no explanations.  It's almost like, hey, you want to dine here, then I won't really treat you like a customer  until the moment you sit down.  When I called her on it, it was all attitude.  Ruxbin, you really need to do something about your hostess or start taking reservations.  As it is, I'm not going back unless I can dine at 5pm.  How many times would that be, I wonder?  Bad taste in my mouth for the terrible pre-dining service would be another half star.  But I can't give 3 and a half, can I?  I love you Ruxbin, but you have some issues."
"I have always heard people talk about sitting at a meal and not wanting to finish their plate because their food tasted so good, but I never experienced that until Ruxbin. When I saw Chicken and Waffles, I had no idea what to think, but I gave it a try and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. The way they mixed the flavors was just perfect and I did everything I could to prolong me finishing all of it...can't wait to go back.Other than the amazing food, it is BYOB and pretty crammed. Good for a couple, but probably not for a big party."
"Amazing food! Great price!Go early put ur name down, then go and grab a drink."
"Ruxbin is a great addition to the neighborhood. While they definitely have the chops to act snooty, they choose not to -- every visit has been such a positive experience from the hostess to the server and the quality of food. They have an interesting menu that will please the foodies in your group but also is easy enough for the stubborn meat & potatoes crowd. The menu changes seasonally so I've had several dishes that are just great. BYO a definite plus. Besides the great food, the decor is so cute yet edgy. We need more places with character like this. Also, the materials used in the restaurant are re-purposed -- the glass comes from the old Sonotechque, there are church pews, etc. My favorite is the wallpaper from the chef's cookbooks. Lovely! The only downside is that they do not take reservations and, given that it is so wonderful, you will likely encounter a wait. I hate waiting so I've always gone on weeknights or early on the weekends and have gotten in very quickly."
"I'll be back here, even if just to go to the bathroom.  The food, decor, and ambiance were also excellent.  But the thing that I find myself wanting more of is time spent in the bathroom!Ok, so when you go there, after you've been to the bathroom...They brought us out a bowl of popcorn with some seaweed seasoning on it to wet our appetite; it was good but also reminded me of a certain seaweed puff thing you can get at trader joes.  So not terribly unique.  But again, good.For the meal we had an eggplant/beet salad with an orange cardamom sauce, the korean empanadas, and the quinoa with masala veggies.  The salad was fantastic.  I really love beets so I'm definitely a fan of the comeback they've been making lately.  The empanadas were good, but I wouldn't say they were my favorite.  The masala dish was also good, a bit salty, but the roasted veggies had great flavor and the masala sauce was spot on.  The ambiance of this place is great.  Tons of reclaimed materials; wood, seatbelts, etc... with really nice lighting.  It was a very elegant meal served in a very comfortable atmosphere.  We had no trouble being seated right away on a wed night around 9, though the restaurant is small and was mostly full even at that hour."
"Food is amazing.  The pork loin is one of the best I've ever had.  We went on a Wednesday night, arrive at 7:00 with a party of 4.  There was a 20 minute wait, not bad at all for the size of the restaurant.  I did notice the corkage fee printed on the menu, which to my understanding is against city ordinance for a BYOB.  I asked the waitress and was told it is to cover dish-washing and recycling.  I let it go until I noticed that she had cracked the lip of the bottle when opening it.  I assume we drank the small bits of glass.  At that point I asked her to waive the corkage fee which she quickly did.  But she followed it with ""by the way this will be coming out of my tips tonight"", then quickly walked away.  That put a pretty negative twist on an otherwise excellent dining experience.5 stars for the food.1 star for the service."
"Ok, so I wasn't as super-impressed as everyone else on Yelp seems to be about this place.  For me, it was a ""glad I tried once, but wouldn't go back"" deal.  Food was good and totally unique (major points) but nothing amazing, it was pricey, and restaurant itself is cramped with spotty service.  I asked if I could first order an appetizer and then order my entree a few minutes later- usually this wouldn't- and shouldn't- be a problem- but waiter replied that everything must be ordered at once.  Really?  I get that you are hip and busy (and have a small kitchen), but something seems amiss.  It was although I had to cater to the server instead of vice versa.  Green bell pepper homemade soda was yucky but totally different and even flatbread was totally different (and tasty)."
"This place hits the mark on every level.  Chef Edward Kim is clearly a genius and before experiencing my meal here, I griped that he needs to open a bigger restaurant and accommodate the pent up demand.   I fully retract that statement, I hope he doesn't expand or decide to pursue new ventures.  Every dish we had was so carefully crafted with detailed attention, you could see/taste the time invested into each plate.   Everyone in the kitchen is clearly focused on taking their time to make sure every dish that goes out is a culinary experience.  For example the Caesar salad was precisely constructed, that the ingredients were portioned  out and placed strategically on the plate so each bite was sure to encompass every element and hit your palate the way it was drawn up in the chef's head.  It wasn't merely a handful of anchovies, romaine and croutons tossed and thrown on a plate.  If the establishment/franchise grew beyond the 30 some seats it currently holds, I don't know if they would be able to devote as much time and attention to detail to every single dish that leaves the kitchen.The calamari was amazing...scratch that, everything was amazing.  The Caesar salad, the calamari, the mushroom toast, the buccatini and clams and the amish chicken.  Throw any preconception of what you think these dishes will taste like right out the window, don't bother reading the ingredients that make up the dish (I didn't think I would love the buccatini given the ingredients and was proven very, very wrong).  Just trust the creativeness and quality of the kitchen and order as much as you can, in an attempt to try everything.  I would break down the menu and describe the dishes, but they were each so different and not like anything I had tasted, that my fumbling descriptions would not do them justice.  They were truly classic dishes elevated to a whole different level.The only gripe, I'm sure as many have is that they do not take reservations.  It wasn't as huge of an issue as I had built it up to be before arriving.  We got there at 5:30 sharp on a Thursday night and were easily seated.  I am sure it is hit or miss, but on that night you could have walked in as late as 6:30 and still be seated right away.  The service was just right, not overbearing, came back intermittently and not only knowledgeable, but passionate about the food they were serving.  I would be hard pressed to find a better deal in town either, we ordered A LOT of food and it was right around $50/person before tip.  BYOB as well.  Ok stop reading and get over there..."
"In a word: Uber-hip.  Highly creative food and decor make me want to return.  I would only complain about the lack of *any* reservation system.  Can't I call ahead and put my name on the list?Really this review is a 4.4999999, and should probably be 5. The food was outstanding, and I love bringing my own wine. Next time I plan to try bringing fancy beer (credit wife for the idea)."
"Ruxbin is a 3.5 star experience, and I chose to round down.  The space itself is beautiful, low lit w/ recipe book pages decoupaged to the ceiling.  The food is also pretty fantastic, although I was definitely more inspired by the appetizer options then the actual entrees, which was disappointing.  The empanada was a partial miss, the pastry was tough and crispy-- but the garlic fries, mussels and jicama/grapefruit salad were all very VERY (yea, caps very) good.  The wait on a Tuesday night at 7:15pm was an hour and a half.  Option #1 was to spend the time in the waiting area drinking all of the liquor we brought while watching course after delicious course pass us by.... or option #2, wander over to Five Star Lounge until they call and save our booze for dinner.  (#2)  Unfortunately, when we were finally seated, the pacing between appetizer and entree was upwards of 40 minutes.  I was falling asleep by the time I was eating dinner post-10pm.  I don't agree w/ complaints about price, for the quality of the food these prices are good and once you throw in the BYOB aspect you've got a fantastic price point for this kind of atmosphere and service.  However, I am not a fan of devoting an entire night to grabbing a bite to eat, unless of course the majority of that time is actually spent eating.  At this price and with the size of the restaurant, I really hope they soon take reservations-- when that happens I'll be back."
"It will require some planning ahead of the time to get in, but once you are in, you won't be disappointed. They have great dish concepts that draw on the chef's Korean background and French training. It is probably some of the best quality food you can get at this price point and with BYOB you won't go broke."
disclaimer: youre gonna wait for a table. and youre gonna wait over 2 hours. so be prepared.the space is fantastic -- a band postered bathroom and old recipes on the ceilings of the dining area with old church pews as seating. very cool. the apple and plum salad was fresh and delicious. the hanger steak is to die for. well worth the wait and byob -- added bonus.
"Every review is accurate, this place is the cutest quaintest little gem.  We arrived around 7 on a Thursday and were seated right away.  This place is tiny and I could have eaten off the guys plate next to me.  Why do restaurants do this?!?! I don't like having to squeeze my butt past someone else's dish to get out to go to the bathroom (which is a must stop if you come eat here).  We had the crispy eggplant salad which was surprisingly really tasty.  I'm not a huge eggplant person but whatever they did to it I loved.  We also had the empanadas which were good but not as memorable as other yelpers made it seem.  I ordered the trout and my friend had the chicken and waffles.  She for sure won the ""who ordered better"" contest.  The trout wasn't bad but the chicken and waffles was better.  My trout needed a few more dates...I think there were only 3 small ones on my plate.  BYOB is always a plus in my book...there's a $5 corkage fee but it's not per bottle.  I'll for sure be back here but maybe with a group of 4 so we can sit in a booth."
"The place is adorable.  No question.  And plus points for BYOB ($5.00 corking fee)!  And I want to give a big shout-out to the bad ass hostess lady.  She called us a couple of times after we put our name in for a table of four-possibly-five when tables opened up even though we were not ready to eat just then.  All the staff was super nice.They hand out a small bowl of popcorn topped with spices to start you off.  My crew and I ordered the Calamari Bokkum which was very unique and tasty.  I sampled some friends' Garlic Fries which were also quite good, and I'm not that crazy about fries.  My Sake Mussels were borderline perfect and my friend raved about her Chicken & Waffles.  The Balsamic-Mustard Vinaigrette on the Fennel & Squash dish was amazing and was told that the K-Town Empanadas were as good as they looked (and they looked DAMN good).Overall a really great dinner.  The seats in the booth were a little uncomfortable but still hella cute.  Everything in the restaurant is so interesting and fun.Beware that they literally do not have a waiting area so if there's a wait you're going to have to chill outside or maybe grab a drink at a bar close by.  They'll definitely call you when they're ready for you though."
"I usually don't go to places that don't take reservations, but once I was in the place I could understand why. It's so tiny, and even smaller is the kitchen. But overall I was so glad I went. The flavors of the food were really great, with a lot of variety. My mouth couldn't get enough. Between three of us we shared 4 appetizers and 2 mains, and 2 desserts. I think after tasting the steak I was sorry I didn't order my own. And the short cake, which wasn't a short cake, but a flaky pastry of love was so good. My friend couldn't stop tell the table next to us that they had to order it. Definitely going back, and I recommend getting there early and bringing wine with. There's a $5 corkage fee. And you have to check out the bathroom too."
"This is a small space with interesting decor (check out the bathroom entrance); service = eh (nice waitress, but how many times can flag someone for a bottle of water? and please, please be able to answer questions and have an opinion on menu items!); and food that was overpriced and hit or miss. Biggest dissappointment: the flourless chocolate cake. have you ever made chocolate truffles? you melt chocolate chips, add heavy cream, and chill. This item was a homemade chocolate truffle. I like homemade truffles, but I ordered a flourless cake. Other things that made me sad: the K town empanadas (the crust wasn't good and the filling was lacking. the yelp reviews hyped it up so much!), and the trout dish (on top of an completely delicious bed of tabbouleh was a flavorless piece of fish! a sprinkle of salt or squeeze of lemon could have done so much). But there was some good: the avocado toast was a nice balance of light, summery ingredients that worked well together. the fries topping the mussel dish were crispy, flavorful, and a little addictive. and again, the tabbouleh bed for the trout dish was hearty and flavorful."
"A fun, interesting little place.  Loved the ""portal"" to the bathroom and actually thought for a second the floor would drop out when I turned the door to the side as the staff had told me.The food was excellent across the board.  I especially loved the trout, which was one of the best fish dishes I had ever had.  Also really liked the bread pudding, which was a good test since I usually don't like that kind of thing.Service was very friendly, but kinda slow.  The only real beef I had with Ruxbin was that I arrived hungry, dropped over $100 for two people (without drinks!), and left hungry.  Pretty pricey to leave hungry.  Their portion size didn't seem all that small, but we had to hit McDonalds on the way home."
"Ruxbin was definitely not a one hit wonder for me. While I was bummed there wasn't any flatbread on the menu, the garlic fries fulfilled my grease/chipotle aioli needs. On my initial visit to this rustic BYOB I enjoyed the Amish Chicken, but during my most recent trip I ordered the Pork Loin. Words do not describe how delicious this choice was. I mean, I enjoyed the chicken, as mentioned, but I've all but forgotten about it in the shadow of the swine. There is probably nothing on the menu that is not going to be a great choice!"
"I don't know what to make of this place. First off, the menu is all over the board. Croque-monsieur, okay french. Wait, calamari with kimchi? okay, korean.. obviously. Empenadas? Wtf? Mexican? Garlic fries?! American?!? WHERE AM I EATING?!Oh, and let's not forget to add some soul food into this menu with the Chicken Waffles.The dishes were delicious, nothing wrong with the execution. But there needs to be some thought in this menu because right now there's nothing tying it together. Also, people marvel at the bathroom. Honestly, it's nothing special. The bathroom is trying too hard actually. the restaurant is small, why in the world would you use a dark room rotation door that takes up more space than it needs to be? I just don't get it. So when you come here, order your food, they all taste fucking amazing, but don't try to understand anything that's going on there. There's nothing to understand. I mean, for god sakes, what does Ruxbin mean? Maybe he meant Teddy Ruxpin.Oh yeah, expect to wait as well."
"Great food on an odd stretch of ashland near ukranian village.  but guess with the bad economy, it makes sense for these small businesses to keep it going and a plus is there's easy parking.On to the foodMust try:- The trout: unfortunately i think this dish is no longer on the fall menu, but it had a perfectly seared crispy skin and the fish was super fresh.- the hangar steak:  this cut tends to be tough but they cooked it perfectly and the goat cheese grits were finger-licious!- Garlic fries: fries are pretty easy to do and they do a great job.  Pretty good:- KTown empanadas:  perhaps trying to get in on the ""LA-Kogi"" train with going for the food truck, korean street food movement, i think this dish did well because kimchi is just so flavorful, but thought the masa was kinda dry.  not a bad dish overall- The mussels:  a large dish full of tons of mussels then topped with a ton of fries;  overall the dish worked, the mussel broth was tasty, but this isn't a must try because not exciting enough dish, but if you like mussels they are fine- Coconut pannacotta:  I feel panna cotta is easy for kitchens that don't strong dessert showings.  the texture was just okay but the flavor was very tasty.  no probs, panna cotta texture is difficult to get.I woulda given them a 5 for food, but the overall experience still needs to be worked out.  Service was good once we got seated... but it took us 1.5 hrs to get seated! the space is tiny and they don't take reservations.  they should consider a reservation system.  BYOB was nice.  the space itself is very eco and hip, reusing odd end things to make up the seats and tables -- very inventive, but somehow the acoustics were just horrid!! i could hardly talk to my neighbor because there was so much echo in the small room... which is fine but i think it's not an ideal date spot.  so overall a good experience.  worth trying definitely."

"I'm in love.....with Ruxbin and their calamari appetizer! I had been wanting to go there ever since I heard of them late last year. I was finally able to go for the first time back in May when my mother was visiting. We both loved everything we had: the calamari bokkum, trout and skirt steak. All delicious! I went back again in July, unfortunately my companion was not so great (we have since sort of worked out our differences but it was a pretty awful evening), but the food on the other hand was absolutely fantastic. The calamari appetizer was a little different but just as delicious as before and the pork tenderloin....was...so...freakin...tender! omg! i definitely will be going back again and again and again but will make sure to be more selective with the people i bring along with me in the future...=)"
"Ruxbin is just the absolute perfect spot for this neighborhood.My fiance and I made a sunday reservation. The table before us ran a little bit late, so because of the limited space, we couldn't be seated quite on time. The staff handled this in a manner that every other restaurant in Chicago could stand to learn from! The hostess was so attentive, and we got a complimentary appetizer and dessert sent out from the kitchen (both quite delicious, I must say). It just really made us feel like we were super welcome at the restaurant, and that the staff genuinely wanted us to have an awesome experience! The service in general is fantastic. Our waitress was so knowledgeable about the menu, and you could tell she has a lot of respect for the skill of Ruxbin's chefs and the work they do. And once I tasted the food, I could see why! We started with the garlic fries, octopus, and the daily crudo (three deliciously prepared unique oysters). I got the duck breast, and my fiance opted for the bourride. We dine out quite a bit, and the food we were served really stood out. The flavors on all the dishes were so subtle and interesting, and very layered. It's clear that the chefs focus on skill and creativity. The dishes are mostly classic, with a few interesting risks... but boy did the risks work! What sealed it for me was the way the seafood and meats were cooked to absolute perfection. The octopus was exceptionally tender, which can be pretty hard to achieve. My duck breast was easily, hands down the most wonderfully cooked duck breast I have ever tasted. I could tell someone back there put a lot of time and care into cooking it. Bottom line is... if you are looking for some seriously great food without all the pretentiousness, this is where you come to get it. The space is small, but it's nothing to complain about (hey, that's probably how they get to put so much care into every dish!) We did a Sunday reservation, but the food is worth the wait if you do walk-in. Luckily, we live just a few blocks away... we will definitely be back!"
"Dine early if you decide to eat there, especially if you have a group of 4 or more. There was already another party waiting for the doors to open at 5:30 and by the time it was 6:30, the place was packed! Although the restaurant is small, it takes a long time to take everything in, from the recipes plastered all over the ceiling, to the seat belt seats and the bathroom...don't want to spoil anything, but worth checking out! My friends and I practically ordered the entire menu! There aren't a lot of entrees offered but everything on there was wonderfully presented and delectable. I'd rather they keep their menu small while retaining the great taste. We consumed the K-town empanadas, avocado toast and grapefruit salad for appetizers. Everything was remarkable, the kimchee in the K-town empanadas gave a great kick to the fried toast and avocado + toast is the best combination ever! My mussels were on the small side and the juice wasn't the best I've ever had but the tofu and trout were delicious. I ordered the trout on my second visit and licked the plate clean! The service was gracious and although there were many people waiting, they didn't rush us or made us feel the least bit uncomfortable with our long dinner. BYOB is always an added plus!"
"We tried it before it got all the hype.  It was fantastic when we went there, well designed and reasonably priced.  I'd recommend it (although the line can be a killer these days)."
"New restaurant in my hood? Gotta check this out right away! It was packed early on a Sunday night. Really cute place with a very friendly staff.Went with my parents who loved that it was BYOB...a rare thing in the burbs. We tried the Avocado Toast and the Eggplant appetizers on the recommendation of the waitress. Loved the Avocado Toast but wasn't huge on the eggplant (sadly, as I had really high hopes for it). I just didn't think all the components went that well together.  My mom is a little picky and she had trouble finding something on the small menu to suit her tastes. And when she asked if she could get the chicken without raisins the waitress winced and said that the kitchen wasn't big on making substitutions. Though, to their credit, the chicken came out sans raisins and my mom loved it. I had the mussles and thought they were delicious. I wasn't too big on the heaping pile of fries that came with them though. They were seriously spicy and I felt they overwhelmed the delicious mussles and broth. I also tried my dad's trout and it was really great. I would definitely get that next time. He couldn't stop raving about it. All in all it was a very good meal and I would definitely go back."
"Ruxbin is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  You can't go wrong with the hangar steak with chimicurri.  I love that the menu changes every season, I'm going have to return soon for the spring menu.  I recommend arriving early (like 5:30) so you don't have to wait too long!"
"Great atmosphere!!  Good service and innovative food.  Loved the Black Cod.   Quality food, and perfectly sized portions.  Can't wait to return."
"Can I just say - I am soo happy about the amazingly delicious BYOBs in our fabulous city?!? Ruxbin is amazing, from start to finish. I hate the idea of no resos and waiting, and to be honest, I wouldn't have gone on a Friday night if it weren't my sister's idea. But even with an hour wait, the pre-meal experience was extremely enjoyable. There's a nice waiting area upstairs so we were able to sit down. I very much appreciated the service despite the fact that we weren't ""running a tab"" - they brought us glasses, water and popcorn while we waited and were very attentive. Clearly Ruxbin understands that your experience with them starts the minute you walk in the door, not when you sit down at the table.The food was fantastic (and really reasonably priced) - as a foursome, we got to try practically everything on the menu, and you can't go wrong. The standouts for me were the eggplant, the calamari, the chicken and waffles, the quinoa and the bread pudding. Even when you think you'll know how something will taste, the flavors will surprise you - and be even better than you thought they could be. The decor is very unique too - I especially loved the ceiling collage of recipes from cookbooks. And make sure you check out the bathroom - maybe I'm just easily amused, but I thought it was very cool.Can't wait to go back."
This place is cute and amazing! Not many choices on the menu but they are alll superb. the empanada appetizer and the spiced quinoa were amazing as was the trout. the bread pudding dessert was perfect way to end the meal. I can't wait to go back. $5 corkage fee and it's about $80 for two peoplewe went early on a Tuesday..but can see how this place can get packed. Choose an off-time and you'll really get to enjoy your experienceand make sure you check out the bathroom - super cool
"I recently revisited Chicago for a day and a half. There are so many places to eat, so I thought. Where should I go? Well. I read the  top ten new restaurants list by Bon Appetit and well one is in Chicago. Ok, I'm going. We arrived before it opened. Trying to avoid that new list award wait time and we did. We were second to sit at a table. Sat down. noticed the decor. Car seat-belts as the backs to some of the seats. A shelf above with cookbooks from Alice Waters and Thomas Keller. Its BYOB. We didn't take the time to get any so we would wait until later to drink. The night was young, since we got there at 5:30. They had house-made sodas. I don't even remember what all was in them, but it was very good. The water had special infusions as well. I do remember the waitress saying, ""the Chef would like it if you order the appetizer and the entree at the same time"" ok. I heard this many times as everyone sat around us. The waitress again, "" the Chef is very particular"", ""the Chef does not like to alter his dishes in anyway."" Oh, oh. I thought. Let's see what happens when we mention that my girlfriend is Vegan. The waitress went back to check with the Chef. I guess this has never happened before? I stopped looking at my menu and waited for his response, ready to get up and go somewhere else........ this is me waiting in incomplete sentence form........... ok. whew, he is willing to alter the Quinoa dish so that there is no dairy. Just as I was about to get up and go to my second choice, Sable Kitchen and Bar, of which we skipped out on our reservations. don't tell anyone. So ordered. Chicken dish, as described by a previous review. There was dill? It was good, but nothing special, but it was chicken. I just didn't see anything else that jumped out at me at the time and I love Israeli Couscous. All in all, very filling and tasty. I also had the endive Caesar salad. Good, but not Graham Elliot asparagus salad wow. She ordered the Quinoa and a salad. The salads came out at different times, btw. ""The chef likes to stagger the appetizers"" Alright. I'll watch her eat the vegan salad and then she can watch me eat mine. How romantic. She enjoyed her meal, although it left her needing something more after we left. Nothing a trip to Walgreen's to buy a can of nuts cant solve. I really feel like if I went again that it would be a four or five star experience and hopefully now that we went the staff and chef will be better prepared for alternative diets and future guests. so take this snapshot of a review at what its worth, just that. oh and check out the bathroom. Think Country Bear Jamboree without Big Al and a bathroom on the other side of the turnabout."
"One of the best restaurants in Chicago.  Desserts are phenomenal.  If you forget a bottle of wine, there is a wine shop that will deliver to the restaurant as well - ask the host(ess) for the number!"
Worth the wait. Ordered the steak and fish and fries.All are good just as expected. BYOB service was very prompt. Great but not overbearing attention from the servers.
"Went to Ruxbin on Tuesday night for dinner. They take no reservations and even on a Tuesday night there was about a 40 minute wait as it is a tiny, hoppin' BYOB place that has gotten a good reputation. No worries, we cracked open our bottle of wine and stood in the ""waiting area"" up by the kitchen, our mouths watering as we watched plates of deliciousness being carried out into the restaurant and talked with others who were drinking, dining and chatting. The atmosphere is great, totally unique- the walls are plastered with pages from old cookbooks and the arching ceilings make you feel as if you are on the inside of a boat. Great first date spot, really intimate and cozy but totally out-of-the-ordinary as well. The food... Don't even get me started. Their chicken and waffles were the best things I have ever put in my mouth. And their garlic fries were TO DIE FOR. We also got a great seasonal salad with butternut squash and beets and a plate of piping hot mussels. Everything was amazing. We finished it off with their bread pudding. Also really great. Totally recommend this place for a date spot or an interesting dinner spot with friends. The food is great, it's BYOB so the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is really cool."
"Great food and friendly service.  It is BYOB which is very nice.   Get there early or wait for a few hours ... I love the pork-belly dish, their desserts are yummy ... on the high calories though ;)"
"Well Bon Appetit had it right when they said Ruxbin was one of the Top 10 Best New Restaurants in the U.S. I went on Saturday night with my brother and could not say anything bad about it (except the popcorn, you just can't do it after Graham Elliot). First, the wait was not bad AT ALL. We arrived at 6:15 and could have sat down immediately but we chose to walk to Lush Wine store first to grab a couple bottles of light red wine (a Pinot Noir will go fabulously) and then sat down to eat by 7:15.Second, the décor was really interesting and well thought out. When you walk in and look around you feel as if you are apart of an art exhibition. The seats are well-crafted wood (and surprisingly comfortable), there are interesting pieces on the wall on ledges, etc. And of course, as everyone has mentioned prior, the bathroom is the coolest bathroom I have ever seen. You walk into this tube that transports you to another room as you circularly close the door. This is not a joke.Third, the people there were interesting, of all ages, and wanted to talk about their food/lives with other diners. I always think this makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.Fourth, the food is crazy good. We shared two appetizers (you have to order the appetizers and main course at the same time):  a special Salmon Tartar with a citrus vinaigrette and crispy potato ships, as well as the Caesar salad with a soft-poached egg, white anchovies, frozen red grapes (which I initially didn't like but eventually loved and picked out), manchego, toasted almonds, all on endive. Although the endive Caesar was great, the salmon tartar kicked its butt. It was not subtle or light, but meaty and tasty and well-balanced - a very memorable dish. For mains, my brother got the Pork Loin with crispy hominy & chickpeas, grilled peaches, roasted shallots, fried basil, and coffee chili salt, while I got the newly added sablefish with maple & soy with hull-less barley, pickled vegetables, barley, and black tea broth. The sablefish was definitely the winner (albeit a very light portion) with the silky fish texture and incredible flavors, while my brother would definitely try another entrée when we go back. For dessert we shared the Berry Shortcake (which we devoured) with a home-baked biscuit, cut in half width-wise with balsamic and crème Chantilly. Wow.Needlesstosay, we will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu."
"An absolute gem!As a small space, it wasn't surprising that when we arrived around dinnertime the place was full.  However, the hostess' offer to let us sit in their waiting area (really, a large table next to the kitchen) and enjoy our BYOB while we waited was a great solution.When we got to our table, the service was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick.  We ordered a selection of small plates (K-Town empanadas, avocado toast, elotes) and then the mussels and fries to share, and our server did a great job of spacing them out so that we weren't overwhelmed with plates, but never had to wait more than a minute or two between ""courses.""  I probably didn't need dessert, but couldn't pass up the lychee panna cotta and enormous french press of coffee - and was not disappointed.  The decor was beautiful, reusing found materials (seatbelts as bench backs, wooden chairs as light fixtures) to give it a warm yet industrial feel.  The cookbook pages papering the ceiling were a clever touch, as well.Incidentally, I would go back to this place just to use the bathroom.  The superman-phone-booth-meets-Dr.-Who-TARDIS set-up is completely original and fun.  I loved that the bathroom was wallpapered with concert posters, too."
"YUM! worth it if you're prepared to wait a long time for a table, and if you are, bring a bottle of wine 'cause it's BYOB. otherwise make sure you get there right when they open. not much option for vegetarian folks. everything was fantastic."
"Cmon...  This place is pretentious to the hilt.  It's a true hipster haven.  I knew I was in for it when I walked in behind an aging hipster (complete with mismatched vest and trendy hat) and hopefully his daughter yet it very well could have been his student or simply his date.Server was spectacular - 25% tip all day for her.  Rest of the staff was nice.  We arrived at 5:30pm on a Thursday.From what I can tell they don't offer regular soft drinks and I when I asked for iced tea I was told they don't do that.  So I ordered the hot tea of the day (sigh) and a glass of ice.  The food was pretty good, yet portions were smaller.  Hangar steak was delishus.  The pork loin was good.  The garlic fries were amazing and the endive Caesar salad was yummy yet only like 12 small leaves of endive. For those that care, when we left around 7pm the place was just filling up.  I won't be back and if I had to wait 20 minutes to get seated, I would have been angry.  MK has somewhat similar food, better portions, soft drinks and iced tea, and is overall better and you can even make reservations."
"Ruxbin is inventive, fun, and truly phenomenal food, at reasonable prices. The first thing to note is that it's BYOB, so stock up before you come - there are several wine stores in the area, but none of them have a great beer selection (which I'm more preferential too), so if you too are a beer at a fancy dinner drinker, buy before hand. Decor: The restaurant uses a lot of reclaimed stuff - seatbelts on the wall, bizarre pieces of metal as lights. But it worked. It was modern, but it worked. Food: This is why you come here people. We had two appetizers, Two entrees, and a dessert. Appetizers: Garlic fries and calamari. The fries were good, not necessarily worthy of the orgasm inducing comments from other yelpers, but good. But the Calamari. Was. Amazing. Like, a completely new experience, a new view on calamari. It doesn't have to be fried, it doesn't have to be battered in any way. Ruxbin's calamari was transcendent like few foods in Chicago have been so far. I probably just could have eaten that the entire meal. We also ordered a pork dish and a flask steak. Both were good - it's often hard to live up to an appetizer as good as the calamari, so they don't seem as memorable now, a month later, but they were quite good. The steak had a similar flavor to the calamari, actually, and was also intensely juicy. Well worth it. Dessert: there was a lime-coconut panna cotta. I liked it a lot, but dessers are often easy to make great. But seriously: the calamari. Get it. (Well, their menu has probably changed, so it could be gone, but if it hasn't, get it.)"
Love. Love. Love.Order the trout.Check out the bathroom.Not necessarily in that order.
"I went here after hearing comments that ""it's supposed to be good"" and ""it's in the neighborhood"".  We started with the popcorn-that was good.  Then had the empanadas...interesting flavor but crust tasted like a frozen crust or it just wasn't flaky.  And I love empanadas.We ordered the steak and thought it had too much sauce.  It was cooked well was seasoned well then doused in sauce.  Weird.  I heard the chef/owner was Korean and saw many Koreans in the restaurant and thought this should be interesting and delicious.  NO Korean dishes...just some kimchi flavored/accented food.        It's not that I hated the food.  I just had high hopes.  The wine was delicious but it was byob.  It gets a star just for the service and the seats/lights were cool and interesting.  Oh yeah and dessert was good but I feel like I've had many times at other restuarants.  Expected more in this price range."
"Love this place!!! The menu changes, BYOB, great atmosphere, great dessert...been here 3 times!!! Will be back many more!!!"
"I don't usually yelp but I felt strongly compelled to do so after dining at Ruxbin this weekend. I think we had just about everything on the menu and each dish was perfection. My being Korean, I approve of the Korean portion of the palette and if I were French, I'm sure I would've been pleased with that side as well.  But really, it's just good food. Sophisticated, friendly and leaving me wanting more. Pros: 1) Unique bathroom situation, never experienced anything like it. 2) A glimpse of the hot chef with the face tatts via the kitchen glass, while waiting for bathroom 3) Uber friendly service and fun interior decorOnly con: No reservations taken and seats only 30 or so people. We had to wait at the nearest watering hole for a good hour before being seated (it's worth it though).Check it out!"
"If you want to do Ruxbin right, grab 3 friends, a few bottles of wine, and show up 30 minutes before they open.  Yes, you'll be waiting outside, so if you try to go in the winter months, like I did, bundle up (like I didn't).  And don't worry - you won't be the only ones waiting outside.  We killed time by going in the ""smoke shop"" across the street.  You can only peruse bongs for so long before the less than friendly shopkeep realizes you're not going to make a purchase...Anyway, if you pay your dues by waiting, you'll be rewarded with getting a seat in this super cozy restaurant.  After I regained feeling in my face and hands, I was ready for some good ass food.  Ruxbin didn't dissapoint.  Everything we had was great, but a few standouts were the garlic fries, pork belly salad, hangar steak, and bucatini and clams.  I can't remember the special we ordered, but it was pork of some sort (unlike Jules Winnfield, I DO dig on swine) and it was great.  Best BYOB I've been to in Chicago thus far."
"I am so, so happy this place is 1.5 blocks from my house.  I hope they never get too big and go away, we really need a place this good in the neighborhood.  Yeah, its small.  Plan on waiting, they dont take reservations.  But, they have a little chill-out area where you can sit and have a drink while you wait.  But I probably wouldnt try it with a large group.  And, it's BYOB!  Glorious, byob.  I heard that some of the fixtures inside were salvaged from what used to be sonotheque down the street, which is cool because I really miss that place and I am bitter that they put a stupid beauty bar in its place.  But, I digress.  The food is fantastic, and our waiter was nice and made some good recommendations.  If they ever get a groupon type deal (which I'm sure they have enough business they dont need to) I would buy the max allowed.  Definitely worth trying!"
"Went on a weekday around 630, and was seated right away.  Cool decor, great service, and the Hangar steak was simply phenomenal!!  I actually ordered the clams, but halfway thru, swapped plates with my wife, who got the steak.  WOW...  I dunno if I have ever had a better Hangar steak!!  Would def go back for the constantly-evolving menu to try something different!  BYOB and even kept our bottle chilled."
"Ruxbin is fabulous!!  The food is amazing and so are the interiors...and no one gave me a snarky look when I couldn't figure out how to get in to the bathroom...The door is something out of a Scooby Doo episode!Many places have the ""amazing food and interiors"" but then the service is either lacking or they behave as if they can't be bothered to engage the patrons, for fear that if they actually relax and smile, it may ruin the reputation/""front"" that their restaurant is trying to put up...The service @ Ruxbin was ANYTHING BUT THAT. In a nutshell...this place was *the bomb*!"
"wow Wow WOW.  Worth the wait and BYOB at that (although I understand that they are trying to get a liquor license).   Went there the other nigh for the first time, great space, great food.  Everything we had was out of this world amazing.  So worth it."
"What can I say.... it's my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Great atmosphere, BYOB, great service and most of all...  great food.  The menu changes seasonally with some of the favorites lasting more than a quarter.  There isn't a bad item on the menu."
"This. place. is. special.Wow. Mom always said never judge a book by its cover. Well,  never judge a restaurant by the number of people working in the kitchen either. Why? Because at Ruxbin there are around 5 peeps manning the ship and this place will methodically make your head explode - dish by singular dish.The food was incredible. (This cannot be stressed enough.)The service was excellent.The space was unique, small, inviting (maybe a 10-12 top) and turned out one of the best meals I have had in years.  Dish after beautiful dish was right on the money.  Everything was great.  Even the french fries were good.Hats off to the people who pull this together.  This gem is off the beaten path and another one of those locals only-ish types places which take time and effort to discover. Thank you Ruxbin.  I miss you already and will definitely be back.  Hopefully sooner than later."
"From the street this place is not very attractive.  It's kind of a dumpy building, but the restaurant front has a certain wholesomeness to it.  Once inside, this feeling continues with the recycled decor which captivates a visitor's attention.  It is a tiny, but very interesting space.We were fortunate to visit early on an uncrowded Sunday evening, and we felt that the staff was very attentive.  The young staff and ownership exhibited a great deal of energy explaining the decor and the menu.  It will be interesting to see how this place evolves, but it looks like it has a good start.The food was excellent at a decent price although the portions could be considered a little modest, although we had enough.  For appetizers, we tried the avocado toast and the empanadas which were both extremely tasty.  We were also happy with the Trout and Mojo Chicken  main courses.  I can say that the chicken was roasted to perfection.  All the ingredients appear to be fresh here.All in all, we got a very decent meal at a decent price.  The BYOB made it more attractive.  When we are back in town, we will return."
"My hubby and went to Ruxbin for dinner last night for the first time and will definitely be returning.  I recommend getting there before 6 if you don't want to wait for a table, as they do not take reservations.  This place is BYO, but they do have a wine delivery service if you forget.They have a very concentrated food menu (not a huge selection) but what they prepare, they prepare amazingly.  We started with the roasted cauliflower soup which was served with deep fried pickles and raisins on the side.  I was skeptical of this combination, but they flavors were incredible.  Next we ordered the mushroom toasts which come served on these delicious biscuit toasts with homemade ricotta, toasted hazelnuts, mushrooms, arugula and a lemon vinagraitte.  For entrees I ordered the Pork Shoulder and my hubby had the Hanger Steak.  The pork was slow roasted for hours and was served over parsnips, cabbage, and raisins.  This dish was incredible...every bite was an explosion of different flavors.  My husband raved about his hanger steak as well.  It was prepared medium rare and sliced with chimichurri sauce on top served with roasted potatoes and wilted green beans.  This was our first and definitely will not be our last time dining at Ruxbin.  Kudos to the chef!"
"best steak ever. i wish i had ordered it as my entree, i had gotten the pan seared trout, which was probably some of the best fish i've ever had, and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly, but when i tried that steak i had instant entree regret. it was cooked just right, and could be cut with a fork, it was so tender. i have no idea what the sauce is, but i could have licked the plate. the steak also comes with these little potatoes and green beans and they were amazing, i wish i could have eaten an entire meal of just those little potatoes. the fish came with asparagus, dates, shallots and tabbouleh. the veggies and dates were melt in your mouth amazing. i've never had roasted veggies done so perfectly. for an app we had the calamari. it was pretty good, i loved the little potato slices and shaved veggies that accompanied it. it was also cooked pretty well and not too spicy. it had a great seafood flavor without being salty or fishy.for dessert we had the shortcake. the just a little savory biscuit went so well with the sweetness of the berries and didn't end up soggy. the whipped cream was so fresh and not too sweet. the fruit was perfectly ripe, it was one of the best desserts i've had in a long time. no wait, we went at like 7pm on a wednesday, but i would gladly wait an hour or two for that steak again."
"The calamari appetizer was good, but lacking something. I needed the potatoes to have a crispier texture maybe. The seared trout was some of the best fish I've had in a while, perfectly seared on a bed of tabouleh, black sesame, asparagus,& dates. My friend had the hangar steak with the kimchi potato hash. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the tots were a standout. Topping off the steak was an egg yolk that made everything a bit richer & tastier. I love the popcorn they serve before the meal, and the berry shortcake was delicious and clearly homemade."
"this weekend, i went to ruxbin for a special evening and had perhaps the best meal i've had in chicago.  tomato tarragon soup, korean chili calamari, mussels with crostini, berry and balsamic shortcake.  every flavor was so well defined and distinct, yet paired so well with the other components of the dish.  this experience plus a bottle of wine equals two really blissful hours and two very happy people.  we were one of the last tables to be seated for the evening (at 945).  though the restaurant ""closes"" at 10 pm, the last few tables lingered and lingered -- as the place slowly shut down, nobody rushed us through dessert or prodded us to leave.  waitresses slowly wiped down tables and offered coffee with dessert.  people walked past the store front windows on the outside, and looked enviously inside.  the atmosphere feels like it's meant to be enjoyed for a late dinner with just one other person.  ruxbin feels like a secret, an esoteric delight that only a few people are meant to find.  i can't wait to come back to discover it all over again."
"Worth the 2 hour wait...it's ever changing menu has never failed us, and the absurdly cheap corkage is the icing. If you manage to coordinate your visit while their corn is on the menu, you won't be sorry....and of course, be sure to check out the bathroom!"
"Ruxbin is definietly at the top of my favorites list. The first time I ate there I'm like, okay, maybe I was drunk or something, I don't want to shout from the rooftops about this place quite yet. I doubted myself as my memory of our dinner there faded. And so I waited until I went back last night, and it was every bit as good as I remembered. Thus, here I am posting about it.Basically, Ruxbin is a little hole in the wall on Ashland at Chicago. You walk inside and the first thing you notice is how small it is - I think there's probably about 25 seats total. This also means anytime after 6:30 p.m., there's a wait, which can be up to 2 hours on the weekends, especially if you have a party of 3 or more. Ridic. So go on off hours, for sure.But the small size is literally the only bad part about the place. The ""do it smaller"" philosophy extends to the menu as well - there's only six entrees (plus an off-menu special) and probably 8-10 small plates. But everything I've ever had from there has been absolutely phenomenal.The focus there is clearly food - creative, American bistro fusion food with influences from Korea and France. It's BYOB, so no beverage program, but you can tell the chef is obsessed with perfection and as a result everything is just really well executed. When you're waiting for your table upstairs, you can watch the food coming out of the kitchen window and everything is meticulously presented - last night we saw him start an entree all over because there was a smudge on the plate he couldn't get off. There's also no ""rushing around your hair's on fire"" people there - all the workers are efficient, but never harried, and even the chefs look really mellow. That's kind of the vibe of the whole restaurant - perfect execution, but not in a stressed/self-important way like at some restaurants.Both times I've went there, I got the trout - a perfectly-sized piece of fish with nice crispy skin, served on top of a bulgur wheat tabbouleh with and date and asparagus spears on top. After every bite the taste was so multi-faceted I found myself like sitting there chewing and ""pondering"" it, if that makes sense- trying to hold on to every last bit of complexity and taste there was to be had. My husband actually forced himself to slow down because his meal was so good (unheard of - he usually just shovels it all in as quickly as possible.) He had the chicken and waffles, a playful, deconstructed-ish take on the original. It had crispy roasted chicken breast medallions with a cirtus sauce and cumin-cheddar waffles with an apple walnut compote. For apps, I've also had the garlic fries (insanely good - would be the perfect compliment to the sake mussels entree), Korean empanadas (with kimchi inside) and calamari (marinated in Korean chili with peanuts with baby potatoes, cucumbers, radish sprouts and dried seaweed.) Everything I've eaten from there has had flavors that just worked exceptionally well together.The space is incredible - it's made of all reclaimed/found items, with items like seatbelts, benches, stained glass, books, etc. And, as I kinda already mentioned, the service is top-notch - everyone I've had has been super friendly and accommodating.Best of all is that it's really reasonable - we've never spent more than $70 there for the two of us. Corkage fee is $5 and you can bring all the bottles you want."
"Imagine one of the most beautiful meals you've ever eaten. A meal that tastes better than how beautiful it looks. A meal that you will remember ten years from now. Put that meal into a small room with cook-books decoupaged to the ceilings, seats made from seatbelts, stretched leather jackets and church pews, and lights made with old theater seating. Surround yourself with people who seem as passionate about food as the chef in the kitchen. Wait to eat your meal at a small family table, sipping wine you brought with you, crunching on popcorn, and staring into the kitchen of quite possibly one of the next best chefs in America. You'd be at Ruxbin.Ruxbin is a restaurant that has made me reconsider the definition of ""fusion"" food. Chef Edward Kim easily combines Asian, French, and American eating concepts and creates an entirely new class of food. His dishes are so strongly fused, it's hard to tell one concept from another.Hands Down, one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago!"
"Friends living near by invited us for this great place. The magical design made from recycled materials is super brilliant and well presented.The tiny place offer great service though slow. We enjoyed every bite. The fun stuff is that that you can bring your own alcohol, which saves a lot!I gave only 4-stars because we waited too long for our food and the plave is a bit pricey ($45 pp)."
"I love love love it here. The only thing that I am not crazy about is the wait, but I totally get it. If you figure out the ""system"" it works. It's best to go early, put your name down, and then go hang at another bar until they call you. The food is worth it."
My Friend Nancy K (see below on Ruxbin Page) said it all perfectly! I cannot wait to return here. Love Love Love.
"Everything was great: service, food, ambiance, but we we just weren't blown away. I'd probably come again to try some other items on the menu, but just not crazy about having to wait in line in the cold if I miss the first seating. The apple plum salad, sablefish and hangar steak were lovely. I don't know if it's because I'm Asian, but the bucatini just did not taste right. My girlfriends and I thought  it wasn't appealing in the least, and only ate half of it. All in all, definitely worth a try and solid food, service and decor."
"Had a great experience and delicious food! A girlfriend and i went for dinner on a friday night around 9 pm. I was concerned with getting a table since they don't take reservations but was pleasantly surprised... We got a table right away! Ordered the arugula and pear salad, fries and eggplant  salad.  All three were delicious! My friend ordered the hanger steak... Fantastic flavor and i ordered the short ribs... They fell off the bone! The panne coto was to die for... Yum! Loved that it was BYOB! Bill was under $100 for 3 appetizers, 2 dinners and one dessert! Will definitely be back... With a small party;)"
"After all the rave yelp reviews on this place I was really excited to go try it out.  Went last Friday with my parents and my husband and I must say I wasn't overly impressed.  We went right when it opened and sat right down, however it took about 15 minutes to get wine glasses.  Other than that the service was good.  Started with the calamari.  There must have been maybe 4 pieces on it - for $12. And it wasn't overly memorable.  For entrees my mom and I each got the trout, my dad the hanger steak and my husband the pork.  My mom and I both though the trout was dry and slightly bland.  My dad's was clearly the best, and my husband's pork was good.  The portion sizes however were not the best.  My dad and my husband both left still really hungry and had to eat again when we got home, and they aren't big guys.  It was good food (minus the trout) and I'd say if you have been dying to go you still should, but for the price and what you get for the money we won't be back."
"didn't get the chance to eat there.  i called a few days in advance and asked if took reservations.  no.  i asked if they allowed children.  yes, they had a highchair.  i asked if we showed up at 5:30 saturday night when they opened - 5 adults and a baby - would we be able to get a seat.  sure, no problem.  we arrived at 5:25.  besides us, there were two couples waiting when they opened the doors at 5:30.  and this is where it all fell apart... they said they had a policy on fri/sat where they couldn't create anything larger than a 4 top.  5 adults and a baby would have to crowd around a small table for 4.  really?  seriously?  ""but there's no one here.""  ""i know, but that's our policy.""  in all fairness, they did offer to sit us upstairs next to the kitchen, but we felt it was too loud.  i've heard good things about the food.  i dig the location.  but i cant get over the fact the the hostess was not empowered, or just couldn't figure out on her own, to seat us comfortably when there was plenty of room. we ended up walking around the corner and going to nataliano's for italian.  we were received warmly and had an AWESOME meal."
"my favorite part of the meal was the panna cotta with lychee.  It was sooo yummy!  The berry shortcake was really good too and I usually skip dessert had it not been for the candle they were going to put on it as part of a birthday celebration.  I had the pork loin with fried chickpeas. The pork was really tender but I didn't care for the chickpeas.  After a few bites, I was a bit sick of them and I would've also liked a warmer piece of meat as it started to taste cool/cold near the end. I really enjoyed the decor and the staff and felt extra special when the sous chef (I think) personally explained the calamari dish. He was so excited about every part of it. tip: if you can't make it here by 5:30 pm for the first round of seating, don't get there after 6:45/7pm.. you might not make it for their second (and I think last) round of seating. byob - $5 corkage"
"I love this place. The decor is really cool --bunch of crazy junk they restored, I like that. The bathroom door is wacky. But the food is the star. Popcorn? meh. Garlic Fries with chipotle aioli? Freaking awesomePorkbelly Salad was really tasty but kind of a ripoff for the portion size. Hangar Steak and Pork Loin were amazing. The portions on the entrees were right on time and I didn't leave hungry at all.This place is great. We got there right as is was opening and were third or fourth in line. Had to wait about 10minutes outside, I think they were trying to stagger the first seating. I really prefer to eat early (I'm prematurely old that way) so I think the no reservation policy is genius. Plus its BYOB (!!!!) and even if you do have to wait, the lounge is pretty cool. Did I mention that I love this restaurant?"
"Decided to try Ruxbin based off an article I read about the top 10 hottest new restaurants.The good. The food was great. I have never tried this style of American/Asian fusion before. I had gotten the halibut and my gf had gotten the pork chops. Both were great dishes. Very flavorful.Another cool thing was the bathroom. That's all I can say as it was a delightful surprise.The bad. They don't take reservations. The wait was 2 hours+, and the restaurant is located in the middle of local business that are not open at night. So if you decide to come, plan on putting your name down, then leaving to kill time.Another bad was no liquor. They do not serve any liquor. We had to bring our own. For a person who enjoys a cocktail and/or wine with his meal, this was a negative.Overall, this place was decent. I would like to try the other dishes at this restaurant but the long wait alone is a turn off."
"This was one of the best overall restaurants I've been to in quite some time. I thought the decor and atmosphere were perfect, I loved the finished tin plate on the walls and the school(?) desks reclaimed into beautiful booths. The layout was perfect, somehow the restaurant was filled to capacity but even in so small a space we never felt cramped nor did we have to talk over the tables around us. As for the food, spectacular. They have a pretty small menu, this is not a criticism I would much rather choose from a small list of creative dishes than wade through 6 pages of chicken ceasers' and buffalo wings. With a party of four we were able to sample a sizeable portion of the menu and we loved everything. We started with the avocado bruschetta which we enjoyed but didn't love we added a platter of the frites after catching a whiff from the table next to us and they were very good. The real treat was the main courses. I had the pan seared trout severed with asparagus over a bulgur tabouleh and a basil puree, sweet Jesus it was good, and when I got to the sweet dates... all I can say is mo-fire! My mom went with the apple, plum and arugula salad, she said it was good but she's never been very descriptive. My grandmother went with the mussels done in a broth that had her lifting the bowl to sip it and me using a discarded shell as a spoon as we tried to determine exactly what it is comprised of. We settled on thyme, tarragon, garlic, shallots and white wine but I'm sure we're missing a few ingredients. My gramps, typically, had the beef, hanger steak on a cauliflower puree. The puree seemed a bit thin (gramps called it a sauce) but the beef was perfectly cooked, rare and melt in your mouth tender and the puree/sauce was very flavorful and added to the dish. We ended the meal with a press of coffee and a serving of both desserts. The panna cotta was great, smooth and creamy, sweet but not overly so and the lychee added a nice tartness. As the flourless chocolate cake was set at the table my grandmother commented on the size (too small), our very cute, and very patient server just gave a knowing smile and handed us our flatware. It was perfect, so rich, a perfect balance of bitter and sweet with a strawberry puree to add a kick. So yeah, if you haven't been yet go. I can't wait for the chance to go back and I'm looking forward to seeing what they do for the autumn."
"I had a great experience here despite the 2 hours wait.  The food was ahhhmazing.  My companion and I indulged in the octopus, beef and broccoli, salmon, and were given complimentary garlic fries which was delish as well.  Each was amazing but if I had to pinpoint  something I won't be ordering again, it would be the salmon.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, it's just the least unique in comparison.. But seriously, i'm planning to come by again but maybe on a weekday for the Amish chicken.  Oh yea, the staff was very attentive without being intrusive. Love that!"
"I was tempted to write a thorough review on how great my experience was at this restaurant, but it seems everyone has done a great job providing their experiences. Let's go straight to the important stuff...+ The ambiance and livelihood of this restaurant makes the dining experience pleasurable. You can tell the owners put their heart and soul into creating a fun environment. Even though this is a small restaurant, the high ceilings and layout of the tables help control the noise level. I thought it was a comfortable volume. + The owners of Ruxbin are very friendly and work extremely hard to please their guests. If you have the opportunity, check out their blog on their website. It'll make you feel like you were right with them when they created this restaurant. + I tried the empanadas, avocado toast, a fig treat with balsamic reduction, mussels, and mojo chicken. All of these dishes were full of flavor and wonderful textures. The broth of the mussels was excellent and definitely worth having over and over again. The chicken had a nice crisp skin with the meat being tender and juicy. Again, the flavors were excellent. I also had their homemade watermelon mint tea. Very refreshing. + Price and portions were decent. + Great place to bring friends or a date nightRuxbin is a MUST restaurant to check out. You won't be disappointed."
"Appetizers are great... get the eggplant, calamari, and tonkatsu. I had the trout for my entree, pretty solid but slightly dry. It's BYOB and the staff are really great as well."
"WEnt here over the holidays, one word LOVE!!!"
"Wow.  Even if the food was terrible (which it isn't at all), I think I would still be compelled to give this place five stars for the design alone.  I can't even describe it in a way that could possibly do it justice - the entire ceiling is wallpapered with the pages of old books, the backs of the banquettes are made of recycled car seat belts, the light fixtures appear to be made of old recycled schoolhouse desks.  AMAZING - you've got to see it to believe it.My boyfriend and I shared four appetizers and one entree - which, in case you didn't know, is way better than one or two appetizers and two entrees.  You can share twice as many different things for the same price.  Try it, especially here, you won't be sorry.  We started with the soup of the day, which was a creamy tomato tarragon, and the endive caesar.  Delicious.  Our second course was the calamari and the croque monsieur... we could not decide which we loved more.  Every time I took a bite of each one, I thought that one was my favorite.  We ended by sharing the hangar steak, which was perfectly cooked (they did not ask us how we wanted it cooked, and it came out a beautiful medium rare) and came with this AWESOME guajillo ketchup.  For dessert, we shared both the panna cotta (which was so good, but bittersweet to me because I knew the taste of the shredded coconut on top fit so well with the dish, but I can't eat coconut because the texture makes me want to kill myself... don't ask) and the shortbread.  The shortbread was out of this world - maybe a tad overbaked, but I liked the little crunchiness it had.  The best was the saltiness of the shortbread mixed with the tartness of the fruit and topped off with the creamy, not-too-sweetness of the chantilly whipped cream... oh man.  I definitely could have had a second portion.Everything was amazing, and it's three blocks from our house.  We will definitely be back."
"I really wish I could rate Ruxbin higher... Initially would like to rate it a 1.... +1 for ambience/decor, +1 for being a new restaurant in soft opening.A friend and I went on Friday night after hearing about the soft opening we decided we had to try it out.  We stroll in and grab the last open table in the house, place is packed, and we managed to sneak in with no wait. Score! Place looks AMAZING. I've been following their blog and their DIY design and have been looking forward to seeing the finished products. Incredible! Every piece of furniture/art/wall/lamp/etc. is a conversation starter. Intimate but not too dark as well. The tables were a bit tight, but not uncomfortable (avec).We ordered the KTown Empanadas and the Elotes as appetizers and the Hanger Steak and Mussels as entrees.Appetizers came out...K-Town Empanadas... being Korean, the kimchi taste is nothing new and/or surprising. It was a great start. For me, it was a perfect balance of kimchi taste and the empanada and cheese. For those unfamiliar with Kimchi, tread with caution!Elotes.. Pretty simple dish, was tasty and flavorful, corn's a bit on the smaller side though.The problem..... Appetizers were quick to come out. About 10 minutes after ordering we had received the Ktown Emps and upon finishing, the elotes had come out... Server had cleared our plates/appetizers and my friend and I sat waiting for well over an HOUR to receive our entrees. We ordered both appetizers and entrees at the same time (to avoid delay between courses). I believe it was one of the owners that came to apologize about the delay about 45 minutes into waiting, kitchen backed up, soft opening sure... About 15 minutes later our entrees came out.Hanger Steak... This must be either prime filet or the worst bang for the buck. Portion is small, the Kale/Cauliflour were a bit too soggy/runny for our tastes and the steak itself lacked flavor.Mussels... Probably the best dish we had all night, until we got about half-way through them... Fries are delicious and the mustard they're served with is great. The mussels taste great as well.....About halfway through our dish we stumbled upon half-cooked mussels that were still quite runny and tasted extremely fishy, decided to skip all of those, digging a bit deeper, we had about 8 mussels that were unopened (unsafe to eat)... All in all, out of 25 or so mussels, 8 were unopened, 8 were undercooked, and we enjoyed all 9 of our mussels... Again....soft openingRuxbin has a great concept going for them and are in a perfect location that will only get better with time. I wish them the best and hope that they can work out the kinks, I will return someday and hopefully I can revise this review, but for now they receive 3 stars.Good luck with the grand opening!"
"Fun, great food in an original setting. And BYOB. Can't argue with that."
"I have had two excellent meals here--hands down some of the best I've had in a while.  The first time, I lucked out with the timing and didn't wait as long as I expected on a Thursday (maybe the madness has settled as I went on a Tuesday night after they opened and there was a 2 hour wait at 6 p.m.).  Second time I ate at early bird special time and got right in at 5:45.  Highly recommend this place."
"I felt like I was eating at a friend's house.  It's very small and cozy but not cramped.  The BYOB part is really nice, although my group didn't do that so we only had water to drink waaaaa....  When I go back though I'm going to try that coffee because it smelled SO good.The food is great, I got the trout and pretty much everyone else got pork, which they all seemed to like.  The trout itself was good - not great - and it came with some delicious tabouleh and some dates - which added sweetness but they also tasted a little burned too (not sure if that was intentional - I wasn't crazy about it but it didn't ruin the dish either).  The portions are small though so I would suggest getting an appetizer to supplement.The service was wonderful, we had one person in our party come later and they let us move the tables around and brought an extra chair so he could squeeze in.  Our waiter made sure that we always had water and we all got our food at the same time.I can't wait to go back!"
"The food was pretty good (we tried the calamari, endive caesar salad, pork belly salad, clam bake, and halibut).  However, the portions are all way too small, and I'm really not sure how they can justify charging $26 for a plate that contained a piece of halibut 2 inches in diameter with a similar sized disc of wild rice underneath.  Also, the waitress was extremely emphatic that everyone at the table place the orders for appetizers and entrees at the same time, but we got the calamari, caesar salad, and pork belly salad spaced twenty minutes apart from one another.  We then had to wait another thirty minutes for our entrees, which were again staggered in their appearance (halibut first, then the clam bake ten minutes later).  The meal took two solid hours, and we ordered within ten minutes of arriving at the restaurant - it should not take 110 minutes to eat two courses!  Mostly, though, I'm annoyed that the portions are so amazingly small for the prices.  At $6 for a soda, you'd think they can give you a more than an 8-ounce glass half-filled with ice cubes.  The bill came to roughly $45 a person and I left feeling hungry (I ordered the ridiculously overpriced halibut specifically because I was worried I'd be hungry with just two appetizers, but no, the halibut is actually smaller than some of the appetizers we got)."
