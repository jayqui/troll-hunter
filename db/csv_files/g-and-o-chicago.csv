G & O
"The hype is real, my friends - the G&O burger is on par with Au Cheval - one of the best burgers in Chicago.  Add in outdoor seating, chill music, and no wait, and as a total experience, G&O might have the best burger in Chicago.But that is just between you and me, got it?The burger isn't the only reason to visit, for hours, even days, on end.  The aforementioned patio is cozy and secluded, despite abutting Ogden, and the drinks are killer - my fellow bourbon boozers will love the dangerously drinkable bourbon root beer, capped off with an Ole Bird, a sophisticated riff on the estimable Manhattan. Save me a table!"
"1 word: Cocktails.They have a great patio at G&O which is perfect to sit outside on a nice day and sip on a few craft cocktails. The list had something for everyone. They have food offerings as well, mostly small plate apps but some interesting selections and not just your lame bar snacks. Service was really friendly and despite being there on an early Saturday eventing on a sunny day it wasn't too crowded which I found refreshing. If you are a bourbon or whiskey drinker, you won't be disappointed here!!"
"Went for dinner on Monday and was pleasantly surprised they offer 50% all food on Mondays. Split a burger, Brussels sprouts and mussels with my boyfriend - all of which were super delicious. I could've eaten the whole plate of mussels by myself :P. Patio is awesome if the weather is warm, we'll definitely be back."
"Trendy, modern and inviting are the words that came to mind when I walked into G&O and overheard the Peter, Bjorn & John tune ""Young Folks.""  I did feel like one of the young folks, as my friend and I had been day-drinking and continued to do so at G&O.The frothy, egg-white cocktails are on point.  The Gin Swizzle, with egg white, cucumber, and gin, was a welcome, imaginative cocktail compared to some of the more standard bars and taverns in the area.  The drink itself was refreshing; I could sit on their patio and drink these all day.  I also had the Risky Biz, which was more berry flavored and much more tart.  I also wanted to try the root beer cocktail, but maybe another time!We didn't try any of the food, but there are a lot of small plates that would go really well with the carefully crafted cocktail menu.  Cocktails are decently priced and well made.  The service is great too.  I would definitely return to G&O."
Great bar over in West town.  Even better on a Monday when their small but yummy food is 50% off.  I knocked them a star only  because service was a bit slow.  It's not a sports bar per say but they had the Blackhawks game on at the bar.  It's not a large space but there is a patio in front thought it was rainy when we went.  As for food I the mac & cheese was great.  The cheese blend had a really nice smokiness to it.  My friend who is a vegan and gluten free always has a hard time finding items.  She went with the mussels and asked that they leave the butter out of it.  The chef was nice enough to bring it out and said that he made a special broth for her.  She loved it and said that it had a nice kick to it.  Overall a great little joint.
"When I used to live on the Northside, I would drive past this place all the time on my way home so I was excited to finally check it out.I came here on Thursday late afternoon to catch up with the bestie and what a perfect place to do it! We sat at their outside patio. It's not large by any means, but it's a decent size and it's fenced in to drown out the rush hour traffic on Ogden whizzing by. It's kinda cool cos the patio is intimate enough to where you kinda forget you're in a busy area. Our server, Remy was her name I believe, was super awesome. When we asked about what today's Punch flavor was, she went to the bar to check, and came back and said, ""It's a vodka lemonade, but it's not good, I don't like it, I wouldn't spend money on it."" We LOL'd and thanked her for her honesty. She was super cool, and often checked on us throughout our stay (and we stayed for at least 4 hours!) She was knowledgeable about the cocktails too. Despite our lush ways, we weren't sure what we felt like drinking based off the descriptions on the menu, but Remy broke the drinks down for us and recommended a couple drinks based off our tastes. I had the Ole Bird and my bestie had the Pisco Sour. Both were REALLY good. Normally I check out the beer menu, but I didn't really pay attention this time. But if I remember correctly, they had a decent craft beer list going. Their food is seriously good too. We shared the Smoked Mac and their Brussel Sprouts. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. The bacon in their Smoked Mac was fantastic! We only stepped inside to use the restroom but I really dig the decor. By the time the sun set, they turned on the lights inside and out and the entire place felt so cozy and chill. I'm a fan. Location is convenient (street parking on Hubbard highly recommended), service is great, and the food and drinks are top. What more could you ask for?"
"GO to G&O! Not only is the name cool, so are the beer and cocktails! I had a perfect manhattan and my girl choose a gin and ronic concoction. The food is tasty as well. We loved the mussels and Brussel spouts. I will be back to this chill spot for sure."
"Honestly, just a great place to chill and have a cocktail or beer. They have their own unique cocktails that is pretty dang good. Their food is just as good as their drinks. Menu only has around 15 items but dang is it tasty! Their patio, although a bit small, is enclosed and great for a group of 4."
"A burger to rival Au Cheval's and mussels that I wouldn't be embarrassed to drunkenly pass out face down in. This is some serious good food. Here's the game plan: eat here, be full and really happy, walk your full bellied self over to Twisted Spoke, then, go to the Grandview and sit out in their beer garden (weather permitting), then, uber your drunken fat self home and recall your tasty adventures the next morning. Just a suggestion (insert that teeth baring grin emoji smiley here...you know the one)."
"Love the atmosphere and space, indoor and outdoor!  Also, the music is great.  Had the burger for brunch.  So delicious!  Definitely I will return."
"Been here at least 3x. Service is Outstanding.  Every single server/bartender is so nice (like, overly nice), I feel like I'm back in Minnesota!   Really like the food...ordered some stuff I thought I never would like but it was so, so good.  So very thankful to have this place in the neighborhood.  Thanks G&O - I'll be back!"
Amazing patio and ambiance. Service has been great each time I've visited. It's a cozy neighborhood gem.
"Not to be confused with the Monopoly Railroad, G & O is at Grand and Ogden and offers the area something that it sorta lacks. Well crafted cocktails, higher end American fare, and a quiet atmosphere that's great for date night or something that's little more on the chill side. The beer list is also pretty good sporting Stone Levitation which is one of my favorite beers from my old town of San Diego. Do eat the scallops, succulent pork shank, and some brussel sprouts that are definitely no diggity! There's great service and dimly lit wooden interior that will make you feel like you're in a weekend getaway cabin. It's sexy yet approachable and an all around good choice for drinks, dinner, or doing it a little classier compared to almost everything else within a couple block radius."
"Wow! This place is the true definition of a hidden geml My boyfriend and I came in here after wanting to try this place for a long time. My boyfriend had to work late, so we came in around 11:30pm on a Saturday. We split the burger, mussels, and brussel sprouts. The burger had these amazing homemade ""pickles"" (they called them quickles) that literally made this one of the best damn burgers I have ever had. The mussels and brussel sprouts were also to die for. Oh and did I mention the service was beyond amazing? Needless to say, it was a great meal. We ended up coming back a few days later...and then a few days later...and then a few days later. I find myself constantly craving this place and wanting to go back.We also came in for brunch a few times and I have still not been disappointed. The first time we went for brunch, my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and I got the crab benedict. Holy COW! I still have dreams about that meal. The second time we came for brunch, I got the french toast and fried chicken and my boyfriend got the burger. Still just as good as the first time we came in with impeccable service to boot.Our most recent visit has been post-the-beginning-of-Lent, and for some reason, I decided to give up refined carbs this year. I wanted to eat here, and I hadn't even really realized, but a lot of their menu is very no-carb-friendly! PERFECTION! When we came in, we got the brussel sprouts, mussels and house salad. Jeez, this place can literally do no wrong.Oh, I also forgot to mention the drinks! They have a gin & tonic with home made tonic. UGH It was ridiculously refreshing and delicious. They also have a bourbon/root beer combo that will put hair on your chest but still taste damn amazing. The bloodies are pretty great too.Another thing I love about this place is the music/atmosphere. Every time we've been here the music has been different, but it's always been really good (like REALLLY good). They've played some oldies, some R&B, some 90s/2000s hip hop. It's a fun time. The ambiance is very laid back as well, so it's a great place to enjoy a good meal.I think I could go on and on about this place up to the character max, but I'll just leave you with this one thought: Basically, I absolutely love this place and I am slightly obsessed. You need to try it.Omg last thing...MONDAYS ARE HALF OFF FOOD (*drool*)"
"We we're biking around when we stumbled into this joint. Great brunch and coffee, I had the chilaquiles, i dug the deconstructed approach We will be back"
Holy Hat Trick: crab cakes (move over Annapolis) meatballs (Italian sausages wish they were reincarnated as these) and juicy balsamic brussel sprouts- put it in your mouth! Trifecta!
"Great neighborhood spot. Super cute and cozy inside. This is the place we always go for a weekend afternoon drink or a weeknight quick dinner when we don't feel like cooking. The waitress who is usually there, Remy, is super friendly and efficient, and I appreciate that she remembers my husband and me when we come in.We brought a friend in a few weeks ago for drinks before dinner, and the waiter (not Remy) was really weird to him; it was like he didn't like him, but for no apparent reason. Odd, but not the norm for service here.The Bloody Mary doesn't have too many fun fixings like many other Chicago joints now boast. But the food--I've had the chicken and waffle, bacon, lollipops with jalapeño and Szechuan sauces, the mussels, and the frites--are all very good and tasty! The rotating beer list is great, and I enjoyed the wine and prosecco I've ordered. They play great music, too!We will keep coming back! We really like it here."
"My girlfriend and I dropped for brunch by after our kickboxing class, and we were STARVING after an intense workout. We got here right at 11 AM on a Sunday when they opened, and were the first to arrive, so we scored a great booth spot in front of the clear garage doors, with a view of a snowy Chicago day. We both ordered the breakfast sandwich and devoured it. The breakfast potatoes that were served with it were HANDS DOWN best potatoes I've ever had. They were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and flavored with some kind of herbs, maybe thyme, and it was absolutely shove your face delicious. I was full about 2/3 of the way through the sandwich, but couldn't stop myself from finishing it all and food coma-ing, which was solved by a nap as soon as I got home. This is the place to go for some bomb ass brunch!"
"Wasn't expecting much out of this small bar at the corner of Ogden and Grand Ave (West Loop), but my fiancée and I left having had THE best Friday we've had in a while!1. Comfortable & cozy but comfy atmosphere.; the place was bustling when we came in around 10pm, but we found seats at the bar right away.2. The bartenders & management were so personable and knowledgeable!*they're whiskey selection is bomb, and the bartender is happy to help you select one!3. The bartender even gave us a music change upon request (top 40 circa 2002 was blaring mixed with some club hits..  Not really conducive to the atmosphere- the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars)Bottom line- great neighborhood bar, a lot of variety, good food and great service!We will definitely be back!"
"Mmhhhhh mhhhh! This place is TASTY! I have passed this place a few times and decided I want to try it out. We sat down for drinks and some snacks. It is very fast and great for a quick drink/grub. The atmosphere is very relaxed and relatively dark. The music selection was ... Okay but I didn't mind it. The bartender greeted us immediately and told us the specials. We got the soup special. Pozole - $7 - this was soooo good. I absolutely loved the broth. It was flavorful without being too salty. The pork shoulder was tender and plentiful. The add ins were traditional: thinly sliced radish, cilantro, tortilla chips, minced onions and longitudinal sliced avocado. Of course we tossed EVERYTHING in the soup, as you do, and INDULGE YOUR FACE OFFFFF. Rock shrimp - $12 - the rock shrimp was great quality and tender. The fried portion was balanced and crunchy. I only wish there was more shrimp. I forgot the two cocktails we got but I wasn't a huge fan of either :-( they were only $10 tho so I was still content. I had the cocktail with the house made infused clove vanilla liquor. It had a smoky taste to it, I think the cloves were a bit over powering.  Anyway, I would definitely check out this place. The food is great and cheap. Their fries sound deliciousssss. I wish I got them oh well. Next time."
"My fiance and I were hungry and wanted to try a new place. G&O was amazing!1) Jaime was super friendly and helpful.2) Aiden kept checking on us even though we weren't ""his"" table.The burger was bomb! I also enjoyed the shrimp. My fiance really liked hee brussel sprouts as well. I would DEF recommend checking this place out. Words of Caution: The kitchen closes at 11p (even though they're open til 2a) and Aiden has a handshake that would bring even the burliest of men to their knees. Between you and me... i think he wrestles bears in his spare time. -------------------------Part 2Yelp won't let me write 2 reviews so Yelpers this is what you get. Lol.The food and service were so good that we went back. Yep, they outdid themselves. Food: The new items we had were the Smoked Mac (unique, tasty and filling), the BBQ chicken tacos (good texture), and the mussels (flavorful and we devoured them.Service: Remy was a great server. She and Chris really made us happy. The last time we went they were out of mussels. We jokingly told this to Remy and they gave us a plate of them on the house. Talk about making memories. We absolutely love this staff and the food. Again, do yourself a favor and try them out.""Happy Eating"""
"Tucked in a little nook at Grand and Ogden, this location might not be convenient for everyone, but I personally drive past it on the regular and finally made my way here and will definitely be back.The atmosphere is very chill, and in non-polar vortex like temps, the open front of the space, which opens up into a patio, is great and gives everything a very airy feel.  I started with the vanilla ginger paloma, one of their on-tap cocktails which rotate seasonally.  This one's about at its end, so something more fall-appropriate is on its way soon.  I also tried the West Town cocktail which was very nice.  They have a decent beer selection, though the drafts are a little on the higher price point end for my taste.  Food wise we tried the burger which is on special on Wed. and the smoked mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was good and I do love a little orechiette noodle.  THe burger was described to me as similar to Au Cheval's in style, which it was though not QUITE there.  It was however very tasty and the fries that came with it were seasoned with pink peppercorn which was very unique and worked well.Our server Aidan was very friendly and helpful and let me know what was in the works for the on tap cocktails.  He also warned me about the swarm of bees that shows up during the brunching hour."
The service was great and the Bloody Maria was great but the food was nothing special. I would rate the food alone 2 stars and the service and drinks 5 stars. The portions are small so be prepared. The chilaquiles were soggy and they were sweet. For 3 people to eat it was over 90 dollars which is ridicules. Definitely not worth it. I would never go back.
"Wow, blown away. Walked in hungry with a colleague and sat at the bar. Was very impressed with the decor and atmosphere.Our Bartender/server Patrick was great and very knowledgeable on the menu and his cocktails. We ordered the burger, pork shank, and some mac and cheese.Mac and cheese was phenomenal, just the right amount of creaminess with bacon and cherry tomatoes on top. My burger did not disappoint with 2 nice sized patties, 2 cheeses, caramelized onions, house made ketchup and a ""quickle"" (I opted for no Dijon mustard) the quickle was my favorite being slices of cucumber that were crisp and lightly pickled. The pork shank was super crispy on the outside and fell apart as soon as you took your fork to it, lots of smokey wonderful flavor.I would recommend this place to any traveler or local looking for great wine and cocktails or expertly prepared food."
Went for brunch.  I hope dinner is better.The bloodys were tasty.  But that's about all I can say.Husbo got the chilaquiles - They were $13 on their own and then they wanted to charge you $4 for chorizo.  You read that right - $4 for some chorizo.  WTF?Got the dish with the chorizo and was thoroughly unimpressed.I had the breakfast sandwich.  Fruit jam overtook the entire sandwich.  The bacon was lackluster and I think I had a 1/4 of a chicken thigh on my sandwich. Potatoes were good.I want to love this place so we won't be back for brunch.  Maybe dinner...Soon.  When it's nice and we can sit on the lovely patio.
Stopped by here for a quick drink. Got the French 75 and it was amazing. Quick and friendly services. Plus one for the nudie pics in the bathroom.
"We live in the neighborhood and head over to G&O on a regular basis.  They have great specials, especially during the winter and the staff is fun and friendly.  The burger is very good, cooked and seasoned well and almost always either my wife or I get one.  They have a weird citrus flavor to their fries that some people may not care for, we love it.  Great cocktails if you like to go beyond beer and they have cool tap takeover nights with local brewers coming in with new beer selections.  Great little outdoor area during the summer as well.Can't go wrong with this place."
"I came in with a gaggle and girlfriends for girls' night last Saturday and fell in love with this place! The service was attentive without being overbearing, the atmosphere was cozy (the perfect dim lighting - you know, the kind that sets the mood and makes everyone more attractive), and the drinks (obviously the most important factor) were fantastic!I had the Doc's Fist (a lightly sweetened, tangy vodka beverage) and it was perfectly balanced, without being stingy on the fun juice. My girlfriends ordered a variety of craft cocktails and were kind enough to let me sample - everything I tasted was delicious! I cannot wait to go back and try something new, maybe with some snacks as well (their menu looked great but I was too stuffed from our sushi dinner to partake that night)."
"Yummy neighborhood hangout.  Great food!  Waitstaff is very friendly.  We go for brunch 1-2 times per month and have never been disappointed in the food.  The only major disappointment now is that my favorite item has been removed from the menu (Chilequiles).  Apparently they received ONE negative comment and have taken it off the menu which is very perplexing to us.  Anyway, today we split the Veggie Benedict and Breakfast Sandwich, both were AWESOME!  Love the patio on a nice day or eveningl.  No pretentious posers, just a great place to stop in and get great food, drinks and service.  Love it!  Would give it 5-stars but not happy that they took off my favorite brunch item."
"Worst crab cake Benedict I have ever had. The hollandaise sauce was cold and tasted awful.  The egg was poached well, and the crab was bland and not worth the money. My date had the French Toast and it looked horribly plain. It would have been better to stay home and cook. I do not recommend this restaurant for food, however the staff was friendly. I may go back for drinks."
"Super friendly, great food, great cocktails, great patio.Menu is small, but everything we had was very tasty, if not amazing. Amazingly friendly service.Only issue is draft selection could be improved."
"So my cousin & I were hunting for a place for after dinner drinks and the Yelp app told us this bar was nearby...so we walked over. As she said, this was a ""solid find.""Craft cocktails in a fun environment that was low key and not super noisy? Oh yeah. If I lived nearby, I would probably be a regular. I had a solid old fashioned and my cousin got a house specialty...probably involving gin. We both really enjoyed our drinks. The price point was good and the place was comfy."
"We popped in here one night for one more cocktail before bed.  That ended up being a few more cocktails plus some snacks :)This is a definite improvement from Clutch.  To start the decor is a little more shall we say, toned down.  If you had been in the bathrooms of Clutch you'll know what I mean.  Our waitress was attentive and very helpful.  I love honest feedback like, we haven't perfected that dish just yet.  So we stuck with the shrimp and some other shareable snacks.The cocktails were great but I had the bourbon peach tea that was on tap and it was horrible.  It was way too sweet and fruity for me.  Maybe if you're trying to ease into brown liquors and you don't want to actually taste it then you'd like it.I would definitely pop back in here.  I hope the challenging location doesn't hurt it too much."
"Came here with a few friends for cocktails after hearing some good things about the place. The inside is nice and trendy with a dark, candlelit vibe. I liked the music and how they were playing some hard rock too. Small crowd, but not pretentious. We sampled a handful of cocktails and all of them were really good. Definitely some of the better cocktails I've had in town based off of that. Service was great and informative too.This place should be on the radar of any cocktail lover."
"First Yelp review, hopefully it's the first of many. I'm giving this place a three only because the beignet special was awesome and my biscuits and gravy were good. My wife and Mother-in-law had the (huge) breakfast sandwich and liked it. Father-in-law had the Chilaquiles with the chorizo, also said he liked it. That said, service was terribly slow. Our food took 45min to get to our table. When it got there, only half of it made it, the rest took another 10min. Restaurant wasn't packed, got there right when it opened. We also ended up sitting at the table with finished plates for too long. The boxes for leftovers were awkwardly small. Not sure if I would go back. The overall experience didn't wow me and the price didn't make up for it. I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
"Last time I was here, the owner told the bartender to change the channel from the blackhawks game  to a lop-sided NFL game, a non-local NFL game. The IRS should really, really look into this bar, and any businesses associated with this bar."
"I really like this place. It is low key on the weekend, which is perfect for me. The bartender was excellent and very friendly. We only had frites to snack on, so I cannot adequately review the food. The tonic is house made, so be aware that it may not be what you are expecting. Nice outdoor space as well. A great place for a date or to hang out with friends."
Delicious food! Definitely take advantage of 50% off food on Mondays. The only down sides were for environment. There was only one waitress so of course service was a little slow because she was running around like crazy in the heat. And there was NO circulation. Bet this place would be great if sitting outdoors in the patio.
"My boyfriend and I moved into the neighborhood last September and have been regulars at G and O ever since.   The menu isn't very big but everything on it is pretty amazing!   We usually split the burger and the pork shank.   My sister does NOT eat pork., never has, until I forced her to try a bite and she craves it now!   The brunch is also great (try the crab cake Benedict).   The bartenders and servers are all super cool and friendly.   We love that we can bring our dog and sit in the dog friendly patio.    The only thing  this place is missing is a steak entree ...hint  hint if anyone working there is reading this ...hangar steak?"
"As the previous post mentions, this spot truly is a hidden gem! Located on the corner of Grand & Ogden in West Town, we had dinner and drinks here before seeing a show at The Bottom Lounge. It was a Wednesday night, which meant half priced bottles of wine. (Side bar: they also have specials on Mondays and Tuesdays). We decided on a Spanish Red Wine, the 2012 Ercavio Tempranillo Roble, which our helpful server best described as a cross between a Pinot Noir and a Malbec (she had me at Pinot Noir). The spiced undertones and fruity, crisp finish paired well with the brussels sprouts, tacos, and smoked mac that we ordered. The tacos were the chef's choice, which were filled with breaded chicken and topped with barbecue sauce as well as sriracha mayo. I'm a wuss when it comes to spice and despite my friend's reservations, I expressed to him in front of our server that I would just have water handy in case my mouth felt like it was on fire. When our server brought out the food, she had kindly put both sauces on the side (A+ for service and her thoughtfulness)! The fresh, tanginess of the brussels sprouts went well with each bite of that delicious smoked mac. Which brings me to the star of the show, folks, and the reason I would go out of my way to find myself in that neighborhood again. Three kinds of cheeses, pieces of crunchy bacon in each savory bite, and topped with bread crumbs for that additional textural component. My mouth is watering as I am currently typing away. This may very well be my favorite mac n' cheese dish in the city. Do yourself a favor and make your way out to this spot!"
