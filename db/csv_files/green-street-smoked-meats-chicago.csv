Green Street Smoked Meats
"The hubs likes to frequent this place when he has some free time & up until now I haven't been able to join him. Whelp, I sure in the hell have been missing out. Here's the deal. the meat is like $12.95 for a 1/2 pound. Yeah that's pricey but who goes out to eat to save money, right? Either way, once you take a bite you'll know it was WELL worth that $12.95. We had the brisket & pork ribs (wanted the beef ribs but they go fast so they were already sold out). The brisket literally falls apart when you take a bite & has so many delicious flavors that come alive while you're eating. Seriously, heaven. The pork ribs were terrific as well. You don't need any sauce on those babies... spectacular without it. The place is just freakin' awesome. Loved the vibe & can't wait to go back!"
"This is the place for barbecue west of the Loop.  Served by the 1/2 pound, you can get your fill of brisket (sliced or chopped), pork and beef ribs.  Hot links, chicken legs and fish are served a la carte per item.Sides are very good.  Their cole slaw is a vinegar (not cream) based creation that is fresh and compliments everything well.  The local favorite is the ""Frito Pie"", or a chili-like casserole made out of Fritos served up in the bag.  I have heard rumors of the peach soft serve for dessert, but this is no longer available.The barbecue itself is served with dry rub only, so that the natural care in the smoking process can be savored.  Many barbecue enthusiasts will say this is as it should be, and they are not wrong.  You can sauce your faire to taste, but for those who like their sauce smoked on, this may be disappointing.  This place is rustic and provincial with solid oak tables and bare brick.  It is not a place for fine dining; it is a place for good food and good times, rock and roll style.My only criticisms are, first, that this place can get rather expensive if you aren't careful.  You can easily rack up a $50 bill as you sample the various items.  Also, not all items are available at all times.  They do their best to keep their most popular items well stocked, but if you are going specifically for one item, you run the risk of that item selling out before they can smoke up another batch.But if you are powerful hungry and want lots of good barbecue, this is the place to go."
"Love the vibe and decor especially at night. You've got friendly people with tattoos greeting you and serving you deliciously smoked meats. It's like an outdoor, high school cafeteria feel for grown ups where a dive bar and rock and roll concert with a slight hipster edge.Meats are good, so are the sides.At night, they turn on all the hanging lights, which makes this a perfect place for a fun/casual date night, grabbing drinks with co-workers, or a post-BKB-climb-stuff-your-face-session (which I was there for). :D Great to go in a group and share everything. Yum.A little pricer than I expected. Two small servings of meat, a side of broccoli salad, and a soda cost little old me $30. I was hoping for like $20 but oh well!"
"So-so... Atmosphere is very loud and unorganized. I hate when I have to find my own table- if I wanted cafeteria style I would go to school. Not a good idea. The food was pretty awesome though. Brisket, pork ribs and pork belly were very good. The sides were only average. Potato salad being the best of the sides. Fritz pie is definitely not worth it. Probably won't be back to this place but I wanted to try it out...."
"4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the price (yikes)! I'm from St. Louis and we have just as good (if not better) food that's only half the price!! But I guess it's location deems it worthy anyways. Outdoor patio seating- love! complete with white string patio lights :)Ribs- would not get next time, very dry/dense and definitely NOT fall off the bone or juicy!Pork belly- good, but the rub was pretty saltySausage- good, had a nice smokey flavorBrisket- probably my favorite of the 4 meats I tried, moist and hearty slices.Spicy BBQ sauce- LOVE!!Potato Salad- eh, would not get next time. pretty standard and not super flavorfulSpicy pickles- eh. not that spicy or pickle-y.I'll come here since I live in Chicago now... but Bogart's in STL is where it's at!!"
What a great place! One of the best bbq I had in the area and not expensive! A bit too loud music inside but in summer perfect sitting in that alley outside enjoying some good bbq with beer! Their salads were delicious: broccoli and watermelon one. Definitely try it!
"Sweet, heavenly BBQ meat galore. That about sums it up!Decided to grab food with my friend for a Sunday lunch. 4-hour wait at Au Cheval? 2-hour wait at Little Goat Diner? No thanks!!! And so off I strolled to Green Street Smoked Meats as chosen by my friend. I'm glad it worked out that way because I wouldn't have known about this restaurant otherwise.It's a pretty big restaurant with lots of group table seating (mostly outdoors). Being the vampire that I am (and because most of the outdoor seats were taken), we sat inside. Each table has several rolls of paper towels. We ordered a chicken leg, pork belly, hot link, spicy pickles and macaroni salad. All of them were great! My favorites were the pork belly and spicy pickles. We also ordered a cocktail drink, which was STRONG (especially for a Sunday lunch).A++ for the food, but I probably wouldn't get a cocktail next time."
Some of the best BBQ/ brisket I've had in the city. Great sides also. Broccoli salad and frito pie were bomb.
"GSM continues to crank out the hits. This time the brisket being better than the Last time I went. Tender, juicy,  flavorful, melt in your mouth good is the only way to describe it.As far as sides I tried the baked beans, sweet pickles, and potato salad. The beans were a bit spicy for my liking which is sad as I am an avid beans lover. However the other three were excellent.Great atmosphere and very good BBQ will l ad me to come back again and again!"
"This may actually be the best BBQ cuisine that I've ever tried in a long while.Came in the evening and ordered a pound of sliced brisket, a pound of pork belly and a half pound of ribs.On the side we had the spicy pickles and the broccoli salad.The best item, as raved, is definitely the *pork belly*The belly was braised perfectly, and the tender cuts of pork literally ""melted with the fat"". What a spectacular burst of richness. The brisket is pretty good, the seasoning is on point, but I'd prefer the beef to be a little more tender. It leaned on the dry side.The ribs are also great. I love that they're not too dry and that they're cooked thoroughly, keeping consistent throughout so you don't have burnt skin and slightly undercooked meat near the bone (faulty to many BBQ restaurants trying to serve as many visitors as this one). Tells me that these guys care about quality control.Thank you Green Street.Also, thank you for carrying left hand milk stout (a personal favorite)."
"Your typical hipster barbecue place. A couple buddies of mine raved about the meats here, so I had to see how it stacked up against the many barbecue joints I've tried. I had been to the RM Champagne Lounge during my previous trips to Chicago, and the smells coming from Green Street Smoked Meats next door intrigued me. It can be confusing to find the entrance, but just remember that the entrance to GSSM is on the left side, and the champagne lounge is on the right side of the corridor. There's a fairly large covered outdoor seating section strewn with old wooden picnic tables. The inside is reminiscent of an old barn with rows and rows of meat smokers, churning out the piles and piles of meat, with a mix of alternative rock blaring in the background. When it's crowded, I would recommend having one person order the meal, while having the rest of the party scout for open tables and grab the beers. We came around 6:30pm on a Friday, and the lines surprisingly weren't too long.We went with the pork ribs, sliced brisket, and pork belly, as well as a few sides of broccoli salad and baked beans. It comes with an inordinate amount of white bread, and as many wet-naps as you can fit into your bag. The brisket was on the fattier side, and leaked quite a bit of grease, but if you ate it with the white bread, it was pretty okay. The ribs, on the other hand, were bomb. Fall-off-the-bone and tender, the ribs had just the right texture, peppery flavor, and chewiness. The pork belly though. Hot damn. Not overly fatty or greasy, smoked just right, the morsels of pork belly had a slight bit of crisp bark on the outside, and then the soft meat on the inside (heh). The pulled pork was fine, but just needed a bit of BBQ sauce to overcome the dryness. The sides were pretty standard, but delicious. The broccoli salad was doused in a little too much mayo, but the baked beans were just right consistency, and had small nuggets of smoked meat throughout. The different BBQ sauces offered were decent, but I'm not much of a sauce guy myself, so use at your own discretion.The prices are by the half-pound, which at a singular portion, is enough for 1 person. In general, the value is pretty good, even though the prices are on the higher side for BBQ. If you're in a large party, I would recommend trying as many different meats/sides as you can. In our party of 4, we were able to try a majority of the menu at only about $20 per person, excluding drinks. Service is pretty friendly, and the staff periodically checks on you to make sure that your needs are being accommodated, and that the wait times aren't too unbearable for you.Overall, the quality is pretty good here, and it's a great place to enjoy a beer and some smoked meats with your friends. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I've had some really great barbecue, and some meh barbecue...a lot of things add up to Green St. being a pretty great place to go. First some of the bad - be prepared to wait, at least on weekend nights, and be prepared if some of the food you've been hoping for sells out. Also, the night we came the brisket was disappointingly dry, as in too lean. Maybe it was the chunk of meat we got, as my friends said the last time they came it was fine, but I may pass on it next time I come.But on to the good - first of all, their location is amazing. Maybe the great weather helped, but the ceilings were high inside and brightly lit tables outside. As for the other food, I really enjoyed their pork belly, which don't really associate with barbecue joints. There I found the moist fattiness I was yearning for in the brisket. And my favorite surprise was their Frito Pie, which I believe had bits of their brisket in the chili that topped it. Definitely get that.GSMM is a great place to come on a summer night when you're willing to drop some dough on some meat. Your half hour or more time of standing in line will be worth it."
"HOT JAM!!!!I tried all of the smoked meats, and my absolute favorite is the Pork Belly with a side of Cole Slaw. I swear, I brushed my teeth the next morning and still tasted that BBQ, and I have an electric toothbrush. That's how much flavor was exuding out of that food. Pro's: Great Smell of Smoked Wood and Meats and the atmosphere is greatCon's: Crowded! - But who cares, the experience & food is worth the wait. It's a famous spot in Chicago it's gonna be crowed because the reputation of great food  precedes itself. Top notch BBQ right here.All in All Service, Food, Atmosphere 5!!!PS. Take note how BBQ is done Phils BBQ in San Diego! Please come and visit.  ;)"
"This is above average BBQ for Chicago (but average or less in real BBQ towns). The chopped brisket was my favorite. The spicy pickles were good. All 3 of the sauces we tried were mediocre. The spicy had what tasted like an overpowering amount of cumin. The atmosphere is fun, but it's not worth the wait if it's more than 20 minutes or so."
"West Loop Chicago has real BBQ? You would think it was a joke but Green Street Smoked Meats is legit. After going to Memphis for BBQ annually for the past six years, I can attest that this place is the real thing. Smoke rings, good bark, and the dry rub were all spot on. Make sure to get the sliced brisket - it's nothing like the brisket that you grew up eating. I guarantee you that this will convert any non-BBQ fan. Who wouldn't like smokey, tender, and succulent meat? Also, get the Frito Pie - it's a bag of Fritos topped with chili made from the burnt ends with nacho cheese and jalapenos. Even if you aren't a fan of BBQ, the outdoor seating and the industrial/southern warehouse interior is the perfect casual place for a drink. Sure, it's not cheap but it's also the West Loop. You're paying around $12 for half a pound of meat which isn't much. The prices are reasonable considering that you don't waste your money on ordering sides since they're nothing spectacular. I'll easily pass on paying $5 on pickles and broccoli and use that money towards delicious smoked meat instead."
"Updating this to 5 stars. A bunch of us went back on a Saturday night and we all were, again, blown away by the food. -Sliced brisket: Tender. Flavorful. Amazing. I'm much more of a fan of the sliced brisket than the chopped brisket (although I'd still eat both if you offered 'em to me).-Pork belly: CRACK. Seriously, one of the best pork bellies I've had. Soft like butter with a nice peppery crust. Next time I come back here, I'm just going to get 2 lbs of this (no joke).Make sure you get the sauces by the counter. There's a spicier one (which has a good kick to it, but not enough where it doesn't let you enjoy your meal) and there's a sweeter, tangier one too. Both are great (I enjoyed mixing 'em together to make a super sauce). The meats here are so good, though, that they can be enjoyed by themselves sans sauce - another testament to how awesome this place is."
"Great brisket, and great sides to boot.We were having a company teambuilding event, and for pre-dinner we all agreed to meet up at Green Street. I've heard rumors and whispers about how good it is, and the reality met the fantasy.I stuck to the basics: a half pound of brisket, no bread, broccoli salad. For roughly $22, you get a ton of food; I'm not sure if you can get less than 1/2 pound at a time, and I didn't ask.The brisket was soft and juicy, with a charred exterior, an excellent pink ring just beneath the grilling area, a good mix of fat and meat and a very flavorful rub.The salad was just a little bit creamy and had fresh carrots, broccoli, sunflower seeds and possible carrots. I thought it was pretty light, so far as broccoli salads go, which made it go perfectly with the brisket.Paired with a ginger beer and some soft serve ice cream at the end, I understood just why people are talking this place up so much. I wouldn't mind making a few lunch runs over here in the future."
"Best bbq I have had in the city.  Great welcoming, open atmosphere with large tables and large spaces.  You have to wait in line but can talk with people.  Food is phenomenal, but you pay a premium for it.  You do have the luxury of getting as much weight as you want (they start cutting and you tell them when enough is enough), so you can load it up high or get for multiple people on 1 tray.The ribs were hands down the best item on the menu, good smokey coating with lots of flavor, protecting nice and tender meat that doesn't all fall off the bone.  The chopped brisket was also great, just didn't have as much flavor.  Pork belly was too fatty for my liking, and didn't have much smokey crust on the outside either.  For sides the broccoli salad was the most tasty, some sweet and crunch all together.  The macaroni salad was also solid, with perhaps a hint of lemongrass, intriguing and pulled off well.  Pickles and pickled veggies will depend on if you like pickles and pickled veggies, I do not in general and did not like them here either.  The long line did irk me, but I was with friends so it wasn't too bad.  it is worth waiting in line, but it does still annoy me."
"Wow... Green Street Smoked Meats... You are soooo good.This is probably the best BBQ place I've been too. In one meal, I got up and ordered three times and was able to sample basically everything on their menu. I was a big fan of the sliced brisket, the pork belly, the pork ribs, and the hot link. I love that there are plenty of seats here, both indoors and outside. Lines occasionally get busy, but once you order, your meats are promptly prepared."
"Solid BBQ joint on Green street! This place is no joke. It's a no nonsense beer, whiskey and delicious meat factory. If you've never been I say you bust out your flannel and best beard and get there now. The ambiance is straight lumineers music video so if you are in to the mason jar scene, then this is your spot. The place is a huge warehouse with plenty of communal seating both indoor and outdoor. Upon arrival you wait in a big ole long line, but have no fear you can grab a beer from the tub or order a custom cocky at the bar while you wait. My bf enjoyed a shiner bock as I sipped on the bourbon sweet tea...mmmmmm!Food food food: plenty o meats to choose from...if you get there early at least. Listen closely, they will run out so I highly suggest you get there early. Sadly, we already missed out on the beef ribs and it was only 8 pm. We went with the sliced brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs with a side of mac salad and baked beans. The brisket is pretty life changing and the pulled pork just falls apart on sight. The sides were a perfect compliment to our meats. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was the ribs...but then again we were set up to fail since we already missed the deliciously beeefy ones. Regardless, our meal was bomb.Green St is just good ole fashioned bbq fun...I highly recommend! A double win here, they are now open for lunch:)"
"Came in on Valentine's Day with the boyfriend and had an awesome experience. First of all, this was a great Saturday evening to go because there was no wait. Apparently most people don't view BBQ as a romantic evening?! However, it was perfect for us. The space is awesome, we quickly made our way over to the big bar in the middle of the restaurant. We ended up splitting a pitcher of the Sweet Tea Drink, bourbon, sweet tea, lemon, and mint leaves. This was super refreshing and was ideal for the two of us to leisurely drink. Seating options are varied at Green Street, we opted for one of the long communal tables. For dinner, we loaded up a tray with sliced brisket, pulled pork, and a hot link for our meats. All were incredibly flavorful and well cooked. The pork was a unanimous favorite. While brisket is my favorite, theirs was a tad fattier than I prefer. The sides also balance the meats very well. Green Street doesn't have your traditional cornbread, mac n' cheese, etc. Their sides are all cold and you grab them at the end of the line. We went with coleslaw, broccoli salad, and potato salad. In my opinion, coleslaw is a necessity with any BBQ, so don't skip that. Really enjoyed the potato salad as well, it wasn't drowning in mayo and had a lot of flavor. Pickles were spot-on as well. Concerning Green Street's sauces, go for the spicy. It adds a very pleasant kick to any of the meats. Overall, I'm pretty pumped we ate at Green Street at a night when there was no wait and not an overwhelming amount of people. I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed the atmosphere as much if it was packed. From a cost perspective, yes, it's more expensive than your typical BBQ. However, you're in the West Loop and should be expecting those prices. Highly recommend going at an off-time and enjoying some Sweet Tea Drink and tasty BBQ."
"I've seen this spot a bunch of times and always wondered what it was because the name isn't that evident unless you take a good look. It just looks like a cool alley with lights and tables. When you walk into it, you see there is a restaurant. We got there late around 9 PM and they told us it was their first day with lunch and they were SO busy. They only had a couple of things left on the menu so we tried what they had. Pork Ribs- SO delish!Broccoli salad- Pretty good... a little on the sweet side but I was into itMacaroni salad- a little too lemony for me but was perfect with a little bit of BBQ sauceFrito pie- We liked it!Can't wait to come back and try more!!"
"At first, the name sounds like a deli, so I was hesitant to go there, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to try it. Overall, awesome experience. Showed up slightly after 6, and we were lucky as they started running out of meat shortly after.  This process was somewhat funny as each time a pit boss climes up to cross out the signs, hoards of boos from the hungry goers flooded the dining hall. The host was very kind and let us know how the experience works. So we hit the bar, got a pitcher of Vallejo then proceeded to wait in line. The wait took longer than expected, but well worth it. The brisket had a nice char on it and was so tender. The pulled pork was succulent but delicate, the baked beans were packed with spices and were top notch, and the Frito Pie was bomb digitty Inside the music was loud during certain times so you had to yell to have a conversation. But the overall atmosphere was very comfortable. But totally recommend hitting this place up and trying the delicious food."
"Green Street Smoked Meats is a great place to grab some barbecue and other beef and pork delicacies, particularly if you're near the west Loop.The menu is interesting in that it gives you prices per half pound of meat, a handful of sandwiches or singular items at fixed prices, and $5 sides. Somewhat frustratingly, Green Street did not appear to serve fries nor did they serve straight mac 'n' cheese.I went a bit crazy and ordered purely meats, without any sides.  I ordered the Pork Ribs, Sliced Brisket, Frito Pie, and Hot Link. The Frito Pie and Ribs were killer.  The Hot Link was solid.  And the Sliced Brisket was good but somewhat disappointing, given how much the staff hyped it up.The experience at Green Street was interesting because we waited in line for a good 35-40 minutes (after arriving at 8:00pm on a Friday) before getting to order at the counter. The restaurant's interior was really cool and reminded me of a barn plopped into an urban area and allowed to decay for a decade -- in a good way.I'd definitely try this place again. It's more of a destination restaurant (mostly because it's bigger and serves alcohol) than a place like Smoque, but you definitely need to be ready for the wait."
"So. Dang. Good. What's not to love about barbecue and beer in a spot that feels like the inside of an old barn? If you get there when the line is short, consider yourself lucky... But if it's long, that just means you have plenty of time to have a drink from the bar or a cold beer from the tub. You can also check out whatever's on TV and decide what you're gonna order. My boyfriend loves the pulled pork and the brisket is my favorite here (super tender with a perfect smoky char on the outside, and sliced right in front of you when you order it). We usually get a half pound of each, and two sides. Baked beans are yummy as well as the spicy pickles. They let us do a half and half of spicy pickles and pickled veggies and they were the perfect coolness to pair with the meat. This place doesn't get caught up in a zillion different types of sauce--just a vinegar based sauce and a thick spicy one--but they don't need to because the flavor in the meat is perfect on its own. Communal tables and paper towel rolls give this place a casual feel. Would've loved to eat outside but it was pouring and the Blackhawks were playing so that will have to wait for next time. Green Street does everything well!!"
"When I came here, Green Street was just a convenient place to kill time while waiting for a spot at High Five, but in reality it definitely shines in its own right. I arrived around 6PM on a Wednesday and there wasn't a line at all. You order by the half pound, the guy slices up the meat for you and you're ready to eat within minutes. It definitely started to fill up around 7:30 so come early if you want to easily find a seat.  Ambiance: You enter from Green Street and walk though a covered alley before entering the door. The space itself was very unique. It was a huge room with lights dangling from the ceiling. It had that rugged, unfinished look, and sort've reminded me of the inside of a barn haha. After getting your food, they just have a bunch of picnic tables where you can eat.  Food: Even though we were trying to save some room for a big bowl of ramen, we couldn't help it and ended up ordering like a pound and a half of meat as our ""appetizer"". Pulled Pork - I'm honestly not that big of a fan of pulled pork. Usually I find it way too sauced and the meat itself is on the dry side with a rougher texture when you chew it. With that said, Green Street served up some of the best pulled pork I've ever had. It was super juicy, and had a cohesive texture instead of a really stringy feel. You could tell plenty of fat was mixed in it since it just seemed to melt on your tongue. I just ate it all with a fork and didn't even bother with the bread to make it into a sandwich. Thunderbird sandwich - I think I saw someone describe this as a fancy Mcrib. Being a cult follower of the McDonald's Mcrib (don't judge me), I had to try this. It was basically a de-boned half slab of ribs topped with spicy pickles on a toasted bun. It wasn't as fatty as some of the ribs I've had at other BBQ joints, but since it was part of a sandwich I thought it was the right texture. The meat was tender and I topped it with one of their spicy BBQ sauces, which was perfect for it. Sliced Brisket - This was a last minute decision, and I'm so glad we ended up ordering it. After visiting Austin a few years, ago I've been a little bit of a BBQ snob and never thought any place I've tried in Chicago lived up to Austin's level. Well...this brisket comes pretty damn close to it. The half pound portion basically translated to 4 slices of the most succulent meat I've had in a while. The outer layer had a great blackened rub with the slightest crispy texture, then followed by a huge fatty layer that you could literally sip on without chewing, and finally a smaller layer of lean meat with a beautiful smoke ring around it. I prefer my brisket slices to be on the fattier side and Green Street gave me exactly what I wanted. No sauce was needed for me to enjoy this.  Overall, this is some of the best BBQ I've had outside of Texas. I was shocked at how easily accessible such amazing meat was. I had to wait hours in line in Austin to get brisket on this level. I will for sure be coming back."
"Meat on meat on meat deliciousness. The chopped brisket and pork ribs were our favorite. Amazing. Also DO NOT overlook the chicken leg. It was some of the best chicken we've had. It had great flavor and was incredibly tender and juicy. The broccoli salad and macaroni salad were just okay. Probably wouldn't get them again. The frito pie is what you'd expect, delicious. Also make sure you get the spicy pickles, so good. It's cafeteria style. Order at the counter and get your food on a tray. Atmosphere is cool. They have a good bar as well."
"Popped in here on a Thursday night to grab some meat...no lines, and their meat was in our mouths within 5 minutes. The sliced brisket is on point. So good! The pork ribs were okay. Not the best, not the worst. The spicy pickles. YES! Do it. The macaroni salad, umm, okay! (I don't do macaroni salad. I do this one.)Picnic tables galore. Super cute décor. I dig it. I'll be back. p.s. they have ice cream...more importantly, they have swirly ice cream."
Good brisket and relaxed atmosphere. We also tried the frito pie which was tasty & diff. Enjoyable grub @ this spot.
"Mmmmmmm.....Meat...... Came here on a Friday night a few weeks back and it was pretty packed. The line wrapped all the way around the bar and I still had to wait outside a little bit so come early if you can. I think I was there around 7pm. The line goes semi fast if you're in good company, but by the time I got to the front, they ran out of both kinds of ribs. BooAnyway, I got to the front and some guy wanted to cut and said he would buy my meal for me. Obviously I said yes. Got the brisket and a side of potato salad. 12.50 seems like a lot but I got pretty full off of just those two items. Brisket was well cooked and still juicy. Lots of flavor if you get the burnt ends part.A friend of mine got the pork belly and oh man.... the fat literally just melts in your mouth. If it wasn't so unhealthy, I probably would get that all the time because it was so delicious. I also tried the pulled pork and it was alright. Nothing too special there.Cafeteria style seating where it's first come first serve, and when you're done you clean your own trays. So you'll always be able to find a seat at least, if not inside then outside under the heaters. I could see myself coming back sometime, I just don't like long waits :/"
"Green Street meats are good. Dangerously good. In fact, the moment I stepped onto Green St. I knew I had already passed the rubicon. If the smoky smell of promise is not enough, then the loud contented murmur of people and soft glow of lights in the outdoor patio will probably be enough to draw you in. Granted, this is not your typical finger-licking BBQ crowd (although Green Street might convert some). The guys bumming around on the wooden fence at the patio entrance are not customers (as we thought when we walked zombie-like right past them and the ramen-eaters), but laid-back staff greeting and carding people as they enter. Yet another person greeted us at the main entrance and gave us the run-down on how the line works. On particularly happening days, the line will curve all the way around the bar and you may or may not down a few beers while your stomach and throat growl at the strangers so happily munching away. As you approach the counter to order, the menu board emerges into view in the dim lighting - make sure to take note of what things are priced what, and for how much! Some menu items go fast; the Beef Ribs were gone before we even arrived. As you're pondering though and don't notice the signs on the ground, keep the walkway through the door clear for people coming in and out.Luckily the 20 minutes we waited gave us plenty of time to hash out what to order, and it was all I could do to stop myself from drooling as the butchers carved hunks of meat to order. It's like ordering meat at the supermarket deli. At the next station, our tray was fitted with sides and two slices of bread each. I couldn't comprehend what a Frito Pie was supposed to be until I saw gooey cheese, peppers, and meat being drizzled literally through a slit in a bag of Frito chips. We grabbed some regular and spicy BBQ sauce from the island with the giant sink tubs, and utensils. Each communal table is set with a roll of paper towels. We snagged the end of one outside because the weather was nice. But even with our planning we ordered too much: - Pork Ribs: easily the star of the show, with or without sauce. It's not fall-off-the-bone tender, but it's so rich with tender flavor we instantly regretted not getting more than a half-pound (2 ribs). - Pulled Pork: your average pulled pork. Nothing to see here, let's move along.- (Sliced) Beef Brisket: a little overdone, but still had a nice smoky flavor. 1/2 pound gets you about four slices.- Hot Link: I'm not normally a fan of sausage, but this was a REALLY good hot link. Especially with the spicy BBQ sauce. It's nice and juicy and meant to be savored. - Frito Pie: what low-maintenance twist on nachos! It's surprisingly good and the peppers add a nice kick.- Broccoli Salad: slightly sweet and tangy broccoli salad. Good choice to balance out the heavy proteins.- Coleslaw: I don't really like coleslaw but... we wanted another veggie option. This one didn't change my mind.The total bill for this though came out to roughly $60 - a hefty price tag for two people. If you hang around with your friends and watch whatever they're broadcasting on the projector screens, it might be more worth your while. But no regrets from this happy belly here!"
"This is the third Brendan Sodikoff creation I've been to. I love Au Cheval and Maude's so I had a feeling this would go well. Plus, as a born and raised Chicagoan and now living in Austin, TX, I have a different perspective on bbq than I once did. I was curious to see how this turned out.First of all, a solid 5 stars for the staff hands down!! Every single person I encountered who worked here was genuinely nice and cool and someone I'd enjoy hanging out with. Second, the decor is awesome. Somehow they smoothly blend the Chicago warehouse and Texas barnhouse feel. The feel over all is very Texas and tin walls, picnic tables, and streaming lights help. The bbq is on the same level as some of the best I've had in Texas (La Barbecue in Austin and the 3 main spots in Lockhart). Any Texan would be impressed with the bbq they do here. I was a bit disappointed in the burnt ends as I was exepcting them to be fatty and juicy which they were not, but as me, my brother and our friend agreed, the brisket made up for it. It was definitely fatty and juicy which is all I ask for in brisket really. Don't be dry! The seasoning was great too. The bbq sauces were nice and very cumin heavy. The pork ribs were solid. We also got their frito pie which a nice compliment. Their spicy pickles were good as well, but I need to say that I've never paid for pickles at bbq joints in Texas so the $5 cost for a bunch of pickles was slightly annoying. I got their La Lousiane cocktail which was great. It had rye whiskey, carpano antica, and benedictine. It was kind of like a mix between a Sazerac and a Manhattan. My brother and our friend got beers which they enjoyed.I like bbq, I don't necessarily love it or crave it on any regular basis. That being said I can tell the difference between good bbq and bad bbq and everything in between. Their's is good here period."
"The wait was pretty long. The food was ok. The thicker part of the smoked salmon was cooked correctly to rare, but the less thick portion was way too overcooked and way too salty. I tasted the brisket which was very good texturally, but severely under seasoned. There was no seasoning at all. The sausage was nothing special. The beans were pedestrian and lacked flavor, and the watermelon salad didn't make any sense. $5 for 3 chunks of watermelon, some jicama, and some seasoning, which was very bland. Not very good at all. Possibly one of the worst things I've tasted this year. Finally, the pork belly was not good at all. It had no seasoning at all, and the meat had a very off putting gamey taste. It was also quite dry and required sauce otherwise it was inedile. The sauces also were not super inspiring; the vinegar sauce was by far the best, but also average compared to places in other cities.In the end, BBQ in Chicago is just not very good compared to other cities. Just dont even try. Do what we midwesterners do well, and we will all be happier. If you want BBQ, go to NC or Texas or KC or Memphis or a lot of other places. Just not chicago.You get 2 stars because the sauces were adequate, the salmon was ok, and the brisket texture was good."
"Fantastic BBQ place. We went for lunch and got a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of macaroni salad. Brisket sandwich was super good with spicy pickles and its own sauce. It's a huge mess though, you're probably better off with a fork and knife. The pulled pork was equally excellent. My wife who is normally pretty so-so on pulled pork said it may be her favorite thing she's eaten in the city. She was also shaking with hunger when we sat down, but its definitely really good. Macaroni salad was a nice side too. We got a couple doses of soft serve swirl ice cream, which was good for surviving the hot walk home, but not anything fancy. The whole place is a down to earth, fun environment. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating, and a good bar with beers on draft. Highly recommend for a casual meal any time."
"This place feels like it was dropped straight out of Austin, Texas. If sauceless smoked meats are your thing, you're in for a great. The warren moon sandwich (brisket and hot link) was great. The frito pie was spicy and delicious. There's nothing here for vegetarians, but I would expect nothing less from a place with ""meat"" in the name. There's basically no wait at lunch."
"Solid BBQ in a fun environment.  The atmosphere is very cool but is close to bordering a Texas Roadhouse meets Rain Forest Cafe...almost too overdone.  Great bbq, good music, laid back environment.  great place for a group.TIPS:They do run out of items on the menu.Hi-5 Ramen is located in the basement, yum!"
"This place was one of my Chicago dining ""white whales."" Any previous attempt to eat here was thwarted by some force. But last night, my trip here became a reality.Pros:- Place is no nonsense, communal seating, Buttnerbut bread for you to grab, and napkins bolted to the picnic tables. In the flashy West Loop, I like it- Variety of meats, even a fish. Salmon, brisket chopped or sliced, pork, chicken, etc. All great stuff to pick from- Bar is separate so it's easy to grab a drink and wait in line or not get caught in the line while trying to order- FOOD. I had the sliced brisket, hot link and a side of potato salad. All were INSANELY GOOD. The brisket was perfectly lean with a little fat and the hot link was intense but not too spicy. Both were really well cooked. My friend got the pork belly which was also good. The potato salad is mustard based with red potatoes and was really delicious. And a good portion for the costSadly though, there were a few cons, or items to be aware of:- Cost. This place is not cheap and it adds up quickly. Just be really aware of how much you order because meat and side itself can be $19 and when you look at it, it's not a lot. (And no this isn't a portion control thing).- Service. Wait staff was nice but register staff could be better. I was overcharged for my meal and when I inquired and asked for a detailed receipt, I was told no. Maybe that's part of the charm but that's not cool.Finally, I can see why this place has insane waits on the weekend so if you really want the best and full assortment of options, go early or at lunch. We got there at 5:45pm and it was already sold out of stuff."
"Tried the sliced brisket which looked juicy and tender but turned out to be anything but.  The flavor was mediocre at best and the sides were the worst part of the meal.  Had the macoroni salad, beans and pickles all of which were cafeteria grade.  Heard good things about the pork belly from others in my group though I don't think I'll be coming back again.  Not worth the money and not worth the wait.  I'll drive a but further to County BBQ instead."
Two words: warren moon. You're welcome. Also get the potato salad and some pickles. The pork belly and macaroni salad are also fave. White bread on the side with your loose meats. If you're not a drinker grab a vernons ginger ale. Compliments well!
"Hipster BBQ. This restaurant is basically an old, graffitied cottage with long wooden tables, full bar service and a grill at the far end. There is no assigned seating, you get to share a long table with whoever squeezes in next to you. Customers queue up at the grill, choose from the BBQ and sides menu and are given the food on a metal tray. No plates, no forks, no knives, no napkins (only a paper towel roll).Meat quality is pretty decent, restaurant is overpriced and, of course, everything is super greasy. This is a fun concept with great BBQ, I can see why it is so popular. However, it is not meant for every type of customer."
"Best ribs in the city. They're meaty, juicy, and have an amazing smoked crust. Only downside is they're pricey. #worthitGood broccoli salad too. Don't miss this place!"
"Came here tonight and it didn't quite live up to the reputation. First of all, it's incredibly expensive for BBQ. 3-4 ribs will set you back $10 bucks. 4 strips of brisket is $13. All the sides are $5. That's right. Even a side of pickles is $5. I think I was most annoyed at the price of the sides. I like variety in my meals, especially BBQ. I understand when a meal that is cooked especially for you only comes with one side, but here the scoop all of their sides from giant vats - so they could easily just scoop smaller portions of sides so we can have more variety. The sides don't need to be so big. Smaller, cheaper sides will do.If the BBQ were really good - the price would be fine. But the food was subpar.The pork ribs weren't tender and the meat didn't fall off the bone hardly at all. It was a struggle to chew it off. The baked beans were the least favorite that I've had. The brisket was pretty good - I'll give them that. However, everything - brisket included - was pepper overkill.I'll definitely be going elsewhere to fulfill my BBQ craving next time."
"For two:1/2 lb. Pork belly. This was my favorite!!!  Fatty goodness. lol1lb. pork ribs, pretty standard ribs. Drenched in both regular and hot bbq sauces. Falls right off bone. 1 hotlink, average. Juicy and right amount of spice. Side of broccoli salad. We needed something green on our plate. Drenched in dressing, it's still delicious. After that, we headed downstairs to their ramen restaurant High Five..lol"
"I visited this establishment today and I was extremely impressed. Their ribs were so well seasoned that I hardly used any of their equally delicious BBQ sauce. The frito pie was a must, the chili on the frito pie was out of this world. I had a chance to try the chicken, link, briquette and potato salad. All of these items were to die for. The place itself had such a comforting feel to it, beautiful illuminated bulbs decorating the ceiling and wooden benches in picnic like form filled the restaurant. I highly recommend this place, I can't wait to return."
"Whoa!I came to this place on back to back days (5/30 and 5/31). I'm big on BBQ but had somehow never been. To make it even more perfect, my GF, who isn't into BBQ, is away so this is my version of a bachelor's weekend.On Saturday, I tried a smoked chicken leg, hot link and pickled vegetables thinking I would have room to come back for more. The portions are huge so that didn't happen. The bone-in chicken was moist and perfect and the hot link melted away with each slice. Pickled veggies aren't for everyone but I crushed them.On Sunday, I had a 'Thunderbird' sandwich, which was described as what a McRib would be if it was actually made from smoked pork. Yep, it's pretty much heroin on a bun. I paired that with macaroni salad thinking that I would need something creamy to counter the tangy pork and spicy pickles. I'm not exaggerating when I write that the mac salad was the best I've ever had.The vibe of this place is far out. Once you walk in, it's like you left Chicago and landed in GA. The soundtrack is a righteous mix of southern rock, reggae and Clapton. I wish I could just move in...5 stars, roll on, Green St, roll on..."
"This is the best BBQ in Chicago, and my friends have agreed on my numerous dinners I've planned to be here.While waiting in line with the security watching can be intimidating your first time, they are really nice and knowledgable people--they just need to make sure that the line doesn't block the exits.  The beverage selection at the bar is solid, with a variety of beer, cocktails, and spirits for whatever I've been in the mood for.  The food is excellent.  Even though this place can get crowded on the weekend, I have never had an issue getting a table once I bought my food, even for a group of 12.My ideal meal here is the chopped brisket, the pork belly, and the broccoli salad with spicy sauce for the pork belly and whatever else anyone is sharing.  Of course the popular items run out fast, but you can also ask the pitman to see if they have anything coming out shortly.  The staff always has good recommendations at the bar and the food counter, so definitely go for it!"
"Solid 4 stars. Atmosphere is cool and the drinks are tasty, be prepared to wait in line. The meat was pretty good, though I feel the chicken rub was too salty. Great music playing! The sides were not my favorite but the brisket was melt in your mouth good."
Holy shiz I wish I knew about this place it's fantastic. The moment we started walking towards it I instantly knew we made a good choice! The little outdoor area is so cute and then u go inside and wow the place itself is just so cool and has such a great urban feel but chill atmos. Definitely some amazing pulled pork and I will go back to try more thing. Frito pie is delicious. Workers are so nice and cool! JustGo. SoGood.
"Omg.... This place is AWESOME! Came last night (Friday) with a few friends.. Had a few drinks on the patio, the inside area was PACKED.. We were still able to get drinks Farley quickly at the bar, we didn't have a server outside which was ok. We finally decided to brave the crowd and wait in the super long line for food ... SO WORTH THE WAIT. Ordered the brisket, ribs and pork belly, a side of potato and macaroni salad.. Everything was absolutely delicious. The brisket and ribs were my fave. The Marconi salad was super yum. Wasn't a huge fan of the pork belly, it was too fatty for my taste but still delicious. The place was packed with beautiful people from hipsters to yuppies to just casual diners. Great atmosphere and music too."
"Excellent BBQ, great atmosphere. You'd never know what was going on in here until you get inside.I had the brisket sandwich, side of potato salad, and split an order of ribs. I wanted to try everything, but unfortunately I was limited by the physical size of my stomach. Great smoke flavor, meat was tender, and not dried out at all. Good portions.This is a popular place, so you'll end up waiting in line. It's not a big deal though because the line wraps all the way around the bar. have a drink while you're waiting. Seating is cafeteria style and there are some tables in an outside area.Can't wait to take out out-of-town friends to this awesome Chicago spot."
"Great beer, great bar scene, great food options Went here to watch a Blackhawks game. There is a great indoor bar scene with lots of microbrews on draft. There is an equAlly great outdoor patio for hanging out. I did not eat here but heard that the upstairs room offers some of the best BBQ in Chicago. In the basement, there apparently is a great spot for ramen. I hear during weekends the wait for food can get up to 2hrs"
"Wow! Amazing! I can't believe that a Chicago BBQ joint rivals Texas!!The brisket melts in your mouth. It is fatty and moist. It is dry rub with burnt edges. The dry rub is not over powering like some others I have had. It has a subtle flavor. I loved it. I also tried the beef rib. It has peppercorn which I have never tried before. It was amazing. Fatty  and moist. Lastly I tried the pork rib. The butcher said I had to try it so have it to me in the house. It was really yummy! It had a nice heat to it and I suspect because they use spicy paprika in the dry rub. Overall, I loved this place. Amazing ambiance, nice bar, and really friendly staff!"
"I don't get the hype with this place... The brisket was dry, the chopped brisket was fatty in a bad way. The pork belly was the only highlight of the meal - tender, juicy, flavorful with a good bark. Their sides were tasty and probably better than their BBQ lol. The space is communal and is like a beer hall or any of the Biergartens I've been to in NJ/NYC area. The place is filled with hipsters left and their beer selection reflects that."
"Brisket nice smoked flavor perfectly done!Love the pulled pork topped with cole slaw. All salads were excellent we had the macaroni, broccoli and potato salad Next time we will try the ribs and salmon Read about it in New York Times Parking sucks had to pay 10 bucks just to eat lunch"
"This place has a really fun atmosphere! It's a little dark and very loud but the lights strung all are around add a nice touch. I waited about 30ish minutes in line to order on a Thursday night. Since the line wraps around the bar and you can grab a drink the wait wasn't so bad. We got the chicken, pulled pork, coleslaw and macaroni salad. The meat was absolutely delicious! Very tinder and juicy and I really liked all of the barbecue sauces as well. The sides on the other hand were kinda disappointing. I was surprised there was no corn bread or hot sides other than the beans. Lots of cold options and pickles. Not exactly my idea of good barbecue sides. But if you're looking for amazing meat with out  adding the calories of comfort food for side dishes this is your place."
"Soooo I needed to be set up for success, to expedite my experience.. So let me do you a courtesy..1. If you walk in through the ""Ramen"" entrance, continue to proceed forward and enter Green Street Smoked Meats from the ""back"" entrance. Green Street does NOT have a sign-in street. That is for Ramen.2. Green Street is cafeteria style with a line and all. Hop in line when you get there (or get someone to stand in line) and order drinks and sip on them while you wait.3. Order the Chartreuse Mule (gin, chartreuse, gingerbeer, lime, cucumber)Now that we have the basics out of the way.. this place is rustic and open and long benches everywhere that fosters community style dining. It's awesome. I had the smoked chicken leg, salmon, broccoli salad, potato salad, spicy pickles, pickled vegetables and my dining mate ordered the sliced brisket and said it tasted better the next day. Not sure if that's a product of we ate with our eyes or a genuine opinion.Of all of that, the chicken leg was amazing (less the skin) and I really enjoyed the broccoli salad. The rest of it.. ehh any given day.  Be careful because it is easy to rack up quite the bill. The chicken is priced per leg and the meat, meat is per 1/2 pound. So I'd order what you think you'll eat and go back if you want more or understand what's happening in advance.Everyone I met was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Most importantly, I felt like they loved their job and that makes it easy to enjoy an establishment."
"I'm in shock that I've lived in the Chicago area for years and only last week I went for the first time to Green Street Smoked Meats. This is any carnivore's heaven, and I will certainly be back again and again and again. I found this place initially when I went to high five ramen, and I noticed just the huge stacks of meat piled up on silver trays in front of some very happy looking people. And of course my friend and I were like LETS GO!!When you enter, you go up to the line where you order your choice of smoked meats, then down the line you pick your sides. My party decided on the brisket, pork belly, pork ribs, frito pie, and potato salad. It came with a heaping pile of wonder bread which comes without charge, so feel free to re-enter the line and grab extra if you're trying to eat make some meat sandwiches.I enjoyed everything pretty equally- the meat was tender and rubs on the meats were packed with flavor. I'm not sure if I would get the ribs again due to the fact that the meat to price ratio was definitely the lowest. The frito pie received raving reviews by my two friends. Pouring melted cheese, chili, and japalenos on top of frito chips is genius and addictive. My experience here was really enjoyable. It's a nice place to grab a drink and some extra delicious bbq food when you haven't been getting enough protein in your diet. The place is full of character too- one of the doormen was cracking jokes and had a chain hanging around his neck that reached the floor. Also, why this place had two doormen I do not understand. Maybe people get belligerent when they eat too much meat?"
"I don't even like barbecue sauce, but I found myself pouring/dipping everything in it. The food is a bit expensive, but what do you expect from a restaurant in the West Loop? I like the brisket and the sausage had a nice heat to it. However, I don't know if it's the best in the city. Don't forget to visit High Noon Ramen located downstairs if you're still hungry."
"Delicious, had the chicken legs while I was waiting for high five ramen. Wish I just would have ate more bbq delicious didn't event need sauce :)"
"Delicious smoked meats!!! Went on a Thursday, so we didn't have to wait in line very long. We shared the brisket, pork belly, pork ribs and three sides. Everything was delicious. I personally don't like smothering my BBQ in BBQ sauce and prefer to enjoy the dry rub.  I really enjoyed the BBQ and will definitely be back (on a weekday...)."
"Hands down amazing... No seriously... I found this place via Yelp and was not disappointed at all. Between the friendly staff, the decor, and smoked meats that are out of this world, I look forward to coming back again and again. Hell, I just heated up my leftovers for breakfast before I wrote this review. So far I have only tried the pork belly and hot link with a side of potato salad yet I can't wait to go back and try more. The key is to go early because they run out of meats quick or at least they did when I got there late on a Sunday evening. Give this place a go and you won't be disappointed."
"This place is just amazing!The brisk sandwich was one of the best I've ever had; juicy, tender and full of flavor. I didn't like the side options though, didn't matter much though given how flavorful the sandwich was."
"Kate Upton. And now that you're paying attention: Green Street Smoked Meats has the best damned BBQ ever, ever, ever!I came here with a friend before heading to The Aviary for drinks. I wasn't overly excited because BBQ is not usually my favorite thing... Little did I know. We ordered chopped brisket (I got the sandwich, my friend got the 1/2#), and we split a side of coleslaw and baked beans. Truth be told, after one bite, we were both completely hooked. The brisket was fork-tender and only got better following the addition of their spicy BBQ sauce, the coleslaw was crisp and had the perfect amount of vinegar, and the baked beans had thick-cut chunks of brisket in it, plus a bit of a kick, and definitely some smoke. By the end of our meal, our tray looked like a rabid Tasmanian devil had torn his way through. Someone might've even accidentally eaten part of a napkin that found its way into the crosshairs. Forensics are still analyzing the video feed, but anyway, there's no need to dwell on that right now...The only downside? I don't live in Chicago, so I can't go back every week."
I had a very similar experience with fellow yelper Moe. The food was pretty good... but the atmosphere kinda left me feeling.. meh.The good:+BBQ is not bad.  Liked the ribs and hot links+gigantic beer selection+nice sauces!The not good:-Really not a fan of the atmosphere.  It felt like a cross between a carnival and a cafeteria. Way to loud and crowded in my opinion.-Disliked how their was no table service.  Also didn't like how the bar was so crowded it took me 10 mins to cash out after my dinner.-Pork belly was pretty fatty and disappointing... and i love pork belly.-We spent about $90 for 3 people which felt like a lot to me considering the atmosphere and the fact that this wasn't a sit down restaurant.
"Went here with friends last night and it was AMAZING. The ambiance is stellar for groups, with large cafeteria-style tables both indoors and outdoors in their patio area. The restaurant is uber-casual with a fun and hip vibe and the staff is friendly and lively. What's great about Green Street is that their food is perfect for sharing. There were four of us and we ordered the sausage, sliced brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, pickled veggies, and potato salad to share family-style so we could sample everything. Looking back on it, we could have ordered more food (I would have eaten the entire platter myself - it was that good), but it was the perfect amount of food if you don't want to be painfully full!My thoughts on the food: Both the pulled pork and sliced brisket were insane orders. The sausage was good, but the pulled pork and sliced brisket took center stage in our meal. They were incredibly moist and tender and the side sauces (Spicy BBQ, Regular BBQ, Vinegar sauce) were the perfect sides for dipping. We came late in the evening (8:30 pm on a Tuesday) and they ran out of the pork ribs and pork belly, which we were dying to try... oh well. #lessonlearnedThe sides were also delicious. The coleslaw was vinegar based, so it was very light and refreshing (same with the pickled veggies). The potato salad was also hearty and tasty.The prices are great. The beer selection is awesome. The meat is phenomenal.... A+ place to dine in Chicago!"
"I love BBQ and I heard this place had Creekstone beef, so my friends and I decided to investigate. I had the brisket sandwich, frito pie, and ice cream. The brisket sandwich was flavorful and light, and the frito pie had a nice mixture of spice and crunch! Definitely check both of them out.Also, the friendly staff engaged me in conversation while we waited in-line. They're super nice!Make sure to check it out!"
"Awesome spot for groups. I would say a little pricey but overall the food is good. But prepare to wait 30min in line on a busy night for food. There is a bar right next to the line to get boozy while waiting (maybe not such a good idea). Anyway, ordered the pork ribs (were not falling off the bone kind but very tasty rub on it), pork belly (best part of the meal), and short ribs (tasty but I've had better). Decent portions and easy to share. For sides, ordered the spicy pickles and pickled vegetables (you can ask to get half of each for one order). Spicy pickles were very tasty and not at all spicy. The pickled vegetables were very crunchy and a bit too vinagery for my taste. They also offer white bread with the food for free. Without drinks the bill came to about $50.. A bit hefty considering the cocktails are $12 each. So if you're looking for a cheap quick meal, I would say go elsewhere. If you're friends are in town and can't get any reservations, then definitely come here. They also have a fun outside sitting area."
"Like so many others I loved place!  It's such a cool space with amazing food.  We stopped in here around 6:30 last Saturday before the Blackhawks game and surprisingly there was not a long line (when we left it was quite the opposite).  The menu is not overly huge which I appreciate.  I ordered the shredded brisket, sliced pork belly, macaroni salad and broccoli salad.  My husband and I then devoured as much meat as we could put in our mouths in one bite.  The brisket and pork belly were both cooked  and seasoned perfectly.  I didn't find anything special about the sides, but they were good and were very large portions.  Once again another great restaurant in West Loop!"
"Green Street is SO much fun. Aside from the delicious BBQ, it's become one of my favorites based on the atmosphere alone. It's rare to find a place where you can have top-notch food in such a laid back environment. Because of the ample space and huge bar area, you don't feel rushed to leave right after eating... making it the perfect spot to enjoy an evening with a group of friends. And the patio is an awesome addition for the summer! If you have any room left after stuffing yourself with brisket, the soft serve ice cream is a must! The flavors are really creative... My favorite was the peach soft serve topped with a cobbler crumble.  I can't wait to go back soon!"
"I've been here twice and enjoyed both times. I thought the best items were the smoked chicken leg and the pork belly. The brisket and pulled pork are also good. I prefer the sweet bbq sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce and a vinegar-based sauce. They serve everything on a metal tray with butcher paper and give you some slices of Wonder Bread. Best of the sides are definitely the sweet pickles. Macaroni salad and cole slaw are okay, but not memorable. Ordering is kind of confusing. First you order your meats, then your sides, and then you pay. If you want drinks, you go to the bar and order separately. They have Lone Star here. Also some good cocktails, including a Radler + gin drink that was very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon.The outdoor patio is a nice place to eat if it's not too crowded or noisy."
"Wow, the best BBQ I've ever had... ever! The sliced brisket was melt in your mouth awesome... The beef ribs are my favorite~ so incredible, but unfortunately not always available, so if they're on the menu, definitely don't miss out!"
It's raining and they are passing out warm clean towels... This is heaven. The brisket was melt in your mouth delish!!!!!
"Upon arrival you're hit by the restaurants rustic charm. Friendly staff, full bar, beautiful place. What more can can one ask for? Well, awesome BBQ for one thing. It was good, not awesome (hence the 4 star review). We had ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. None were spectacular, but they were good. My kids didn't like the spicy rub on the ribs, although that made the on-the-chewy-side pork ribs worth it for me. The sides are all cold and had similar flavors. I enjoyed the slaw the best. They serve your meal with sliced white bread. I didn't get that, but the place sure was pretty. I guess that's what you really pay for at this place."
"An out-of-town guest and I ventured here on a Saturday night recently, looking for a good smoked meats dinner establishment, long a Chicago tradition.First of all, the only African American you'll see working in any capacity here is the black guy out in the street, telling you where the non-descript entrance is as you step out of your taxicab. The ambience/atmosphere here is horrible, unless you like being made to feel that you're eating in a barn...and I mean that literally.The drill is you get in a quickly-moving line, order your food, pay a significant price-point and then try to find a seat at a picnic-style table. As my guest and I walked around looking, we saw at least four available seating areas where people had placed their coats, supposedly ""reserving"" seats for their friends who had yet to arrive, preventing other diners from sitting down. When they saw that we wanted to sit down, people either looked away, and/or pretended not to see us. Why a restaurant would permit people to do this is beyond me, and put a bad taste in our mouths from jump.We found seats opposite each other at a corner table between two other groups of patrons. With this style of seating, you'd expect that people would be friendly, or at least cordial. Neither was the case. They don't make any eye-contact with you, don't extend use of the condiments or napkins (which is actually a roll of paper towels), and hoarded everything close to themselves as if no one else was seated next to them. To say we felt awkward and unwelcome would be an understatement.As for the food, the frito pie is a must, and the salads were excellent, but the meats were very disappointing and left much to be desired. We had the slabs of ribs and the chicken. The meat here is tough and heavily seasoned on the surface, but is woefully undercooked and flavorless inside and by no means falls off the bone. There is no concept here of what well-done means. Of course, beer, you can't get wrong.My guest and I looked at each other like ""why are we here?,"" packed our food up without saying a word and left. We re-cooked everything at home the next day to try and salvage the spend. It's a shame that all of the great African American smokehouses in Chicago have closed or are closing, and are being replaced by these wannabe urban young, clueless hipster joints. It's clearly the demographic that they prefer to cater to. Will definitely not be returning."
"I'd say 4.5 stars. Starting with the location and decor/atmosphere, this place is amazing. I love the old rustic feel, with the abandoned warehouse look. The food itself was well done and very tasty. We had the pulled pork on top the of the sliced sausage. The sauce was great and the sides were VERY well done as well. I'd recommend and return in a heartbeat."
"Can't wait for the summer to hit, just so I can have their elotes again.  Utterly, the best elotes mix I've ever had"
"Great smoked flavorExpensive $$$Fun atmosphere Limited sidesCommunal seatingCafeteria style Brisket & ribs wonderful Don't go by yourself (you'll need one person to order food, another to order drinks in a separate line, and someone to hold your spot at the communal tables)."
"OMG. Was it worth the wait? Yes. A million times over.The ambiance of this restaurant is fun and loud. The bar is right in the middle and the line kind of curls around it so you can order drinks while you wait. But if you want a quieter place to chill out, the outdoor seating area is much more intimate...you get to see the lights above and just enjoy the rustic feel of it all. Onwards to the food, it's weighed to order...which pretty much guarantees that all the juices remain in the meat until sliced. The weighing is also generous, when they say half pound, it'll never be 0.499 pounds, it'll always be over which is nice. And you can also request cuts to an extent...we asked for less burnt ends on the brisket and the gent cutting the meat was very accommodating.What we tried:Brisket - this is literally melt in your mouth delicious. I loved it. Pork Ribs - fork tender, but I hated paying for the bones...every half pound is roughly 2 bones. So $9/half pound will add up quick if you intend to get at least a bone per person.Smoked Chicken - this is probably the first time I had a smoked chicken and yes, it was definitely infused with smoke...but it was also so juicy and so good.Pulled Pork - probably my least favorite as it pretty much looked like a congealed mess. My brother inhaled this though.Potato Salad - piece were a good size and coated very well in their sauce. The hint of dill really made this potato salad refreshing for the palate between tastes of meat.Baked Beans - nice and sweet...with a bacon-infused twist, I think. Yummy.If you want, they also give you complementary wonder bread with your order."
"This place is packed with character, ambiance and crowds of people. It's got a very hipster/grunge vibe with dark rustic decor and lights strung overhead. It's reminiscent of New York's Katz Delicatessen. They've got a great bar with tons of beers and cocktails. And this place is all about the meat but most of the sides are vegetarian. The broccoli salad and cold slaw were delish. I'm vegetarian, but I've heard people rave about the pork belly. It's a little on the pricey side but you're paying for the atmosphere."
"The atmosphere is great! Casual, large, lots of open space lined with wooden walls and decorations. The ceilings were decorated with warm Christmas lights the last time I visited. There's a bar section in the middle that intersects with the long line (usually) of people waiting for freshly cut meats. I had a glass of the house red with briskets. DELICIOUS MEAT. Despite the 20 minute wait, I really enjoyed my time here. As we got closer to the cashier stand we got to stand by two all-knowing meat-cutters (pictured) that answered many of our banal questions (what's better, the brisket or the brisket sandwich? What IS a brisket? It's our first time here). Time went by quickly thanks to the fun atmosphere. During the summer there are many family-style farm tables outside, fit for groups."
"I went here to grab a drink while I was waiting for a seat downstairs at Japanese ramen place. I only had a beer but the food.. looked really good. After having dinner at ramen place, my friend and I had to go back there to have some softserve. I had the coffee flavored one covered with chocolate and it was so~~~~ good. I will have to go back there to try their food and to get some more of coffee - chocolate goodness!"
Complete amazballs. No other comments needed. But i am still having a fanatsy dream about the Beef Ribs cause ive never had them. Always out.
"I've been twice - once with colleagues for lunch during the week and again with wife and kids (7, 4 & 2 years old) for lunch on Saturday.  Lunch during the week is very laid back and tables were about 50% full.  Great place to take a leisurely lunch break and sit outside.  Lunch on Saturday is casual enough for my kids to bounce around and not bother other patrons.  Picnic tables are ideal for families / sharing food...... on to the food....I would highly recommend going with a group of at least 4 people so you can order ""family style"" and try several different things.  My favorite meats (in order): sliced brisket (pushing overall rating from 4 stars to 5 stars), pork ribs, pulled pork.  Chicken Leg just OK (a little dry) and I didn't love the Pork Belly (usually hit or miss for me, I like fat rendered down more, this version seemed ""rare"").  Hot link is a ""pass"" next time.  Cole Slaw and Broccoli Salad were both fantastic... baked beans and pickles are fine, but not spectacular.I would like to go again for a casual dinner with friends to guzzle some beers in the bar....cool hipster vibe with good tunes."
"Really tasty meats! Line up first to get your tray of food, and then find a seat. My favorite was the beef ribs. Yum yum yum. I also tried the broccoli salad that came highly recommended from Yelp reviews, and could not recommend to anyone. Not sure what I was expecting, but it was sweet and I did not care for it at all.     Nothing much left to say that hasn't already been said about the meats, but I think the (somewhat) hidden gem is the soft serve ice cream! One of their flavors seems to rotate, but there always seems to be a rich and creamy vanilla bean. Order by the cashier! The one time I ordered after eating, the cashier just waved me up (there was a lag in line with people still at the meats station). I'm not sure this will fly if the line is packed but might be worth an ask."
"I preach the virtues of Texas BBQ, and Green Street Smoked Meats is the real deal. I'll admit, I came in with great trepidation. Someone I know claimed that a visit to GSSM reminded her of Williamsburg, one of the hipster capitals of the US. If there's one thing that ""Texas Forever"" BBQ is not, it's purposely cool. In Texas, city limits BBQ joints can certainly become cool, but it dang sure doesn't do so on purpose. Instead, it starts from nothing as a shack (Franklin in Austin), becomes a white collar lunch favorite (Thelma's in Houston), or finds whatever space it can in a farmer's market (Pecan Lodge in Dallas).GSSM just seemed like the type of place to attract crowds and good reviews because of its cool vibrations, not because of its actual food. Located in trendy West Loop, GSSM has a top-notch setup. On a plus day like the Friday evening we descended upon GSSM, the atmosphere was unfathomably spectacular and on par one of my personal favorites, Big Star in Wicker Park. GSSM is in a ""hidden"" back-alley, with a plethora of open bench seating, a huge middle of the space bar, and counter service where meat is ordered by the half-pound and sliced in front of you. It's that last step that was the first step in my acceptance of GSSM. Whatever the ambiance may be, the food is prepared correctly and deliciously. The meat you order is on full display in all its glory. Chuck the 1, 2, 3 meat platters out the window. Ordering by mass and picking sides after you see the forthcoming meat sweats damage done by your hungry stomach is definitely the way to go and in no way diminishes the extent you will gorge yourself on quality meats.I'm a Texan, so brisket first. And first, order the fatty brisket. It's as close to Hill Country brisket as I've had outside the state. That the slicemaster even gave me the fatty side was a win; I've asked twice at Smoque and gotten puzzled faces. The smoke ring was small but present, about an eighth of an inch thick. Char was fantastic, with a tinge of sweetness that makes me think the pitmaster went beyond the standard salt, pepper (and perhaps paprika) rub. Most importantly, the meat was tender, juicy, and tasty.This being Chicago, GSSM offers a full assortment of pork. I also had multiple friends from other southern states not as well-versed in BBQ inform me of their GSSM disappointment. I can only assume this meant the pork offerings. In any case, I rather enjoyed the pork medley of ribs, pulled pork, and pork belly. The ribs, like the brisket, possessed a sweet taste, a little bit like Asian-style short ribs, reminding me of Kreuz Market in Lockhart. The pulled pork, like the brisket, was succulent. My cousin particularly liked the pork belly. I'm not the hugest fan of non-Asian pork belly, but GSSM's belly had a peppery crust and a melt-like-butter feel to it. If anything, it'll make great leftovers.As a cherry on top, GSSM's sides were particularly tasty. We ordered four, going with a dynamite mustard-based potato salad, a Mexican-inspired elote, a vinegar-y baked beans with chopped brisket that tasted like John Mueller in Austin, and a heaping of pickles that pairs spectacularly with meat. There were also some sauces I hardly used. The spicy one was good, I think.The beer and cocktail selection is solid, and there were more than a few parties there just to drink the day away. As for beer, GSSM offers PBR tall boys for the Chicago traditionalists, as well as Lone Stars to inspire everyone's inner Texan. I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Lone Stars aren't made in Texas, and some locally available Shiner would be a better substitute, but meat-satisfied beggars shouldn't be choosers.All in all, I've more or less avoided BBQ since moving to Chicago. But I think I've found a keeper in Green Street Smoked Meats."
"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said? You know what, I don't care if this review seems like all the rest. I had some awesome meats. If you ever have trouble finding the place follow the aroma of burning wood and meats. If it were a wearable fragrance in a spray bottle, I would get it for my husband to spray all over himself. We arrived at the door and waited in line for about 45 minutes which would seem outrageous to do so but since the smell of smoked meats were wafting through the air, I felt the urgency to stay. I mean, you can grab a drink before you fall in line and chit chat with your homies. I unfortunately did not partake in any of the drinking but I wouldn't doubt some awesome cocktails come from that bar from the looks of the bustling barkeeps. Everyone who works here has like a metal look, long hair, tats, I like it.As far as the food is concerned, some decent meats being served up. I wasn't a fan of the beef ribs I thought they were a bit salty and overdone, I ate it though- So it couldn't have been that bad, the brisket had a nice bark on it but so tender inside, pork belly was probably my most favorite thing on that metal pan-get it...really-get it. As far as sides are concerned, we got the half and half pickles which are always good. We also had that potato salad- that was so good! Probably the best potato salad I have ever had. The sauces to choose from are: Coffee (Not my favorite), Spicy BBQ, and my fave was the Vinegar based BBQ Sauce.Seating is communal style, so don't be shy and sit down next to some people and claim your spot- seating is plentiful so don't worry.Pro-tip: I know you are hungry and half pound portions seem small don't over do it. Share portions with friends. Prices aren't cheap but they aren't bad. Besides, you are going out downtown for dinner, what did you expect? We spent about 40 bucks for everything and enjoyed the night out."
"There are good BBQ places and there is Green Street Smoked Meats.Come with a big appetite because the portions are large (1/2 lb pricing). Green Street is hidden in the West Loop with less than obvious signs of its location, since the entrance is a side door. You line up to order your food like a cafeteria and a person pulls out the meat, as if it were served in a butcher's and starts to slice-and-dice your portions. I had several of the meats and a side. The best portion of the meal was the smoked chicken leg with came with a thigh and a drumstick. However, the disappointing item was the pork belly, which I felt could have been more tender and succulent. Back into the smoker it goes!"
"I LOVED this place! Everything about it, even waiting in line with my awesome old fashion cocktail. I loved the bartenders, the drinks, the vibe, the community tables, the outdoor seating if you are lucky enough to snag a spot. But most of all I loved the food! And not just the meat, which was the star of the evening, but the sides as well. I went with two Chicagoans - and we all shared so I got to try a bit of everything. I loved the brisket, the chopped brisket and the pulled pork. And I adored the cole slaw, the potato salad, and the must have, currently obsessed with - broccoli salad  - or, as I like to call it - mana from heaven.This LA foodie was won over by this Chicago BBQ joint."
"Mouth-watering food that doesn't accept reservations and has available seating on Thursday evenings? Yes! Green Street Smoked Meats!!If you're going with 1 other person and can't decide between the tantalizing choices (and smells), get the pork ribs, brisket, and pork belly and take the pork belly home to eat later (great in stir fry or omelets!!). Brisket has the best of all brisket worlds- tender meat, burnt ends, fatty bits.Huge fan of the cole slaw- not doused in mayo.Pickled veggies are also flawless, not over-vinegar'd and nice variety of onions, cherry peppers, bell peppers, jalapeños, carrots, and others.Both the sweet and spicy pickles are a great side.Great drinks.Line moves fast.If you can't sit outside, the interior is also rewarding, great vibe and grungy decor."
"This review is based on the pork ribs that we ordered as an ""appetizer"" before getting our ramen next door at High Five.Got here on a Friday afternoon around 5pm and it was pretty empty. It picked up very quickly, though! There were a lot of hungry people who wanted to enjoy the beautiful weather on the outside patio I suppose. Btw, I absolutely love the ambiance outside on the patio. It's communal seating with a backyard BBQ feel -- long tables with benches lined up in between two brick buildings and strung up lights. It's the perfect setting to enjoy your BBQ.The pork ribs were delicious. There are 4 different BBQ sauces to choose from. I got all of them of course: Coffee, Texas Squeeze, Vinegar, and Spicy BBQ sauces. I love tangy sauces, so the vinegar one was my favorite. I would probably mix the vinegar and spicy bbq though, since I also like a little bit of kick in my sauce.I can't wait to come back and try the other stuff, along with the sides. I think the employees were a little surprised that we only ordered the pork ribs without any sides, but we really didn't want to ruin our appetite for the ramen..."
Friend brought us here raving about how amazing the BBQ is. He was so right. The atmosphere is great. Food hits the spot if you want meaty delicious BBQ. I'm gonna go take a nap now. Food comma.
"To begin my rant, this is NOT a legacy type BBQ joint. This is a professional theme restaurant brought to us by the Hogsalt folks, who rarely disappoint. I love Bavette's, but here, I am not in love. It is a foodie experience fer sher ... but ... Like I said, Green Street is a professionally designed theme restaurant. They have marketed for the West Loop, hip/yuppie/20-30/foodie expert crowd. They want to give you that special find feeling with no signage out front and the unmarked door. The room has a faux distressed backwoods warehouse look. It feels just like it belongs inside Disneyworld's Frontierland. They hired all 20 something, bearded, tattooed, ponytailed, hipster, Portlandia looking staff. All with a ""aren't you lucky we have let you in here"", attitude. You get just the right amount of abuse (and don't all 20something foodies like a little BDSM with their snacks) with the food line inside, the don't stand between the red lines, cookie sheet serving trays, and clean off your own table commands, speaking of which, are communal wood benches, All this would be great, if the BBQ matched up to the hype. It does not. Its OK, even good, like with the brisket. The beef ribs were overcooked and scorched, at it was only 8PM. The frito pie was entertaining, but never again. The cole slaw was a bad recipe, as were the pickles. Also, I do not know if it was intentional, but, they ran out of hot links at 8:15, and by 9, they were out of 3 more items. There is the drama of the red line through the menu item. But they say they are open until 1AM, so how could they be running out of menu items by 9? Bad planning, more hype, more foodie abuse? Everyone has their favorite BBQ. Mine is Bogart's in St. Louis. It is the place by which I measure all others. Green Street will not be any BBQ fanatic's destination. It is entertaining, and it is expensive. I spent $100 for 3, with 1 beer, 1 cocktail and a coke. I will not return, unless forced to by my 40-50+ group of suburban foodie wantabees.  But then again, I am sure I am in the minority with my review here. And, if I had not had babes and missy with me last night, I would have told the bearded hipster to go F himself when he told me to clear off the table and pointed to the trash cans. Luckily, I only tipped the bartender, I do not tip for counter service and self cleaning."
"I am easy to please. Give me good meat, good music, and globe lights strung above my head, and I'm smiling from ear to ear. No surprises, then, when I say that Green Street Smoked Meats makes me very, very happy.I was excited to try this place since I heard it opened. When I finally did, I could not be kept away; I went three times in two weeks!All the meats I've tried have been delicious-Pulled pork: barbecuey great, chicken leg: moist and smoky great, hot link: spicy kick great, brisket: marbled and melt-in-your mouth great. You can't go wrong with any of them.While the star of the show is definitely the protein, the sides are also good. I've tried them all, and my favorite is the baked beans. I also have to admit that I was surprised by how well the pickles went will BBQ.I am a fan of the community tables they have here. I've come at peak hours with large groups of people and have not had a problem finding space. I definitely like the modern/trendy southern warehouse vibe here; it adds a level of cool as you stuff yourself silly at an indoor picnic bench.So how about a meat coma on Green Street listening to punk rock underneath string lights? Yeah, I'm there."
"10/10 for Green Street Smoked Meats! Came here on a Saturday night and the line wasn't too bad when we arrived around 6:30. You can drink a beer while you wait in line. The atmosphere is awesome. The lighted dining area with picnic tables makes you feel like you're at an outside community BBQ and they play old music on vinyl. Between me and 2 friends, we split ribs, pulled pork sandwich, salmon, broccoli salad, macaroni salad, and potato salad. It was more than enough food and wasn't overly expensive. All the sides were amazing! And the salmon was some of the best salmon I have ever had (no joke). Great place to hang out, drink beer, and eat good food with good friends."
"Went here last night to grab a bite after work. So there wasn't a long line to place our food order. We got pork ribs, chicken leg, 2 sausage links and a side of the macaroni salad. All this came out to about $44. The pork ribs were the best among the things we ordered. They have open communal seating so you just grab a seat wherever there's place. I'd maybe go there just for the food again but not to hangout. They do have outdoor seating as well which might be nice during the summer."
"Unexpectedly great BBQ in the West Loop.  My friend and I shared the Frito Pie, Sliced Brisket and Broccoli Salad.  Frito Pie: cute presentation using the Frito's bag.  I didn't like it at first, but it eventually grew on me.  Nice and spicy, too.Sliced Brisket:  Cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth.  My favorite BBQ sauces were the spicy and regular.  Didn't care for the other two.Broccoli Salad:  I hate mayo, and this was one of the only sides with very little of it.  Staff was super friendly and let me sample it.  I loved it!  Great combination of raisins and nuts to compliment the broccoli and dressing.I'm knocking off one star only because they didn't have the sides I would expect a BBQ joint to have.  i.e. mac & cheese, cornbread, etc.The outdoor patio is adorable and was great for a casual dinner out."
"Cool ambience - I felt like I was transported into a BBQ joint in my home state of North Carolina.  I imagine that it looks like this in other BBQ capitals like Austin too.  At first glance, the line is pretty intimidating, especially since it wraps around the entire back wall.  When it gets to capacity, the line continues at the entrance and around the outside brick wall.  No worries - the centralized bar will preoccupy you with crafted cocktails and beers while you wait.  The line moves pretty slow but there is ample table seating once you order and get your food.  In fact, the tables indoors were pretty empty despite the long line.  Outdoor seating is also available.  So, from the end of the line near the bar (before you end up waiting outside), it took us about 1 hour until we were able to order.The food was delicious.  I loved how everything is served on a metal serving tray cafeteria style.  The brisket was moist, chewy, and slices like butter.  You could try four different sauces to dip the meats in (spicy, coffee, BBQ, and fourth that I've forgotten).  My favorite was the coffee sauce.  The hot links were spicy.  The smoked chicken leg and pork ribs were also moist and nicely seasoned.  Of the sides, my favorite was the macaroni salad.  It had a lot of texture and crunch mixed in with the pasta.  Hubby liked the pickled veggies.  The Frito pie was also spicy.  I was disappointed in the coleslaw.  Drinks were cold and refreshing.Really good BBQ, just be patient while waiting for it."
"BBQ joint in a barn setting with picnic tables and a bar in the center with loud music. Would not be the place if you have a headache or a kid. I give 4 stars because the sliced brisket reminds me of the bBQ meat i had when I was at Texas for vacation. In the Chicagoland area, this place would have the best brisket because it has that smoky taste and tender. The beef rib is gigantic and delicious. For $12, you get about 3 ribs, which is a bit pricey, but it's good (so it's okay!)I haven't tried the side dishes yet, because it seems to be sitting there for awhile, especially potatoe salad on a summer day. I usually go there after10pm, which the choice is limited, but at least there is no line!"
"Got quite a few different meats. They were decent, but everything was way overpriced.The sides weren't that good."
"I had no idea what I was in for when my friends from work wanted to meet here for dinner one night.  What an awesome experience!  The whole vibe of the place was great - felt like a super cool roadhouse-esque BBQ place in Austin, located in the west end of Chicago.  As their name suggests, they have a wonderful menu of smoked meats.  Everything is fresh and delicious. I had the brisket sandwich - it was amazing, but I could only finish half of it!  I also had the tasty Mexican corn side dish - would definitely recommend it.  My friends tried a wide variety of the meats, but one thing that caught my eye was the Frito pie, which literally is a small bag of frito's with their yummy chili poured into it.   The drinks were great too.  They had a nice selection of beers and their margarita wasn't half bad.  Next time I have a hankering for some good BBQ in Chicago, I'll definitely be making my way back here."
"Heaven be thy freaking name. Stellar smoked meats, quality sides, and perfectly paired craft libations! Stopped in recently and grabbed a seat at the bar...good idea as I watched a less than spectacular Bears win. Tried the 1/2 lb pork belly and 1/2 lb beef ribs. Both were freaking redic! Pork belly was a tad fatty, but what the f*ck do you expect?! The beef ribs were by far the best I've ever had, barre none! Friendly staff, reasonable prices, and superb meat will definitely warrant several return visits!"
"Brendan Sodikoff is a genius. After stumbling into Au Cheval (another one of Sodikoff's brilliant creations) and being told it'd be a 2.5 hour wait, my group decided to try something new. Located in an alley about half a block away from Au Cheval, Green Street checked all the boxes for a good time. -Excellent Beer/cocktail list. The line to order food actually wraps around the bar, meaning you can order a beer while you wait to order your food. Why didn't we have this in kindergarten when we had to wait in all those lines?-The BBQ. Good lord. I had the thunderbird. You can find an eloquent description somewhere else. I'll just call it one of the best sandwiches I've had in 2014. -Atmosphere. You sit at wooden picnic tables. It's like a BBQ in the park. Except, artisan chefs have prepared world class BBQ that is quite superior than that of the weird guy who always volunteers to BBQ at the Company picnic because he doesn't have much else better to do. The location isn't that difficult to find. Don't let that deter you. Just go."
The food was cheap and delicious. The location is hidden from Randolph street which was cool. The chicken was tasty and the BBQ sauce was good. Drinks were avg.
"Delicious pork belly, pork ribs and brisket. Nice patio/alley when it's warm. Usually a wait. Picnic tables for seating. Serve yourself."
"3.5Finger licking good...not greatGREAT ambiance!  Its super cute and reminds me of a backyard BBQ...with outrageous pricesBrisket was tasty and good...I wanted more!  $12 a la carte...eekkkkPork was tasty and good...I wanted more meat and less of the fat $12 a la carteElote was tasty and good...thought it was a tiny portion  $4  Not to mention, the picture advertised it on the cob, they conveniently had it off the cob already and in a paper bowlColeslaw was tasty and good...crisp and light  $4Baked bean was tasty and good...$4Sauces...all were delish...none were spicy.  sauces, water, napkins and plastic ware are free for the taking...Overall, tasty and good.Its an interesting concept because they have no hot sides...like mac n cheese, etc.  The cold sides are sitting out like a cafeteria in big vats that they made ahead of time.  Dont get me wrong, they are all pretty good...but I am not at a backyard BBQYou get your own drinks, you find your own seat, you get your own plastic ware, you get your own napkins, you clear your own area/tray/etc...there are no servers or busboys.  You get your own water...if you want a refill, its cafeteria style...get up and get your own!I'm not crazy about the concept, however I think it kind of worked...but I would expect a little cheaper prices since they are cutting out all of the middle men?They have a stellar patio area that is perfect for a super chill night"
"So we just went in to get some meats to go home.  We bought pastrami 1/2 lb. and it was 8 oz of meat.  Two slices for $12.95.  We tried ribs--again they sell 8 oz of ribs for $9.95--5 ribs.  Lastly, we asked for brisket.  $12.95 for 2 slices.  We paid $40 for 4 slices of meat and 5 small ribs. No sides.  Nothing.  Never again."
"Delightful. My favorite BBQ shop in Chicago.Lovely BBQ. Even that cheap bread is fun when soaked in the BBQ sauce.Fun, professional, nice staff too.Thanks y'all."
"Hipster central in the West Loop! And another fun Hogsalt place. The line can get crazy in the evenings but it moves fast. They now open for lunch on Saturdays and Sundays which has a more mellow vibe. The brisket melts in the mouth- try it. AND, the smoked chicken leg blew me out of the water. I don't even like dark meat and chicken leg. BUT, I will eat chicken leg again, only at Green Street. Contrary to what a lot of people think-- that the pork belly here is the same as what is used downstairs at High Five Ramen-- no, it isn't. The Butternut bread seems tastier when eaten here... I reckon it's because of the tasty baked beans."
"Visited Green Street Smoked Meats before a Hawks game. Great atmosphere- it's cafeteria style but the lights and feel of the restaurant is perfect for a group dinner. The pulled pork was fantastic! My only recommendation would be to add plates!!! The pulled pork sandwiches did not come with any plates, very odd. I'll definitely be back!"
"The atmosphere is what really sold me on this place. The food was okay, the ribs and beans were especially good, but nothing too special about this smokehouse food compared to others. The space, however, if full of carriage lights, just dark enough to feel comfortable but not too dark to think it romantic. I was there last night for the start of the Stanley cup finals and while it's not a bar bar, they still had a huge drop down screen projecting the game. And while its family style seating (just long picnic tables) it doesn't feel like you're forced to awkwardly sit near strangers. Also, The staff was friendly and helpful with our order."
"You're not going to find better brisket in the city. I've been to all the places you have to try and while they are all good...Green St. definitely has the best brisket. Overall this is a great place. The atmosphere really makes you think you're at an outdoor BBQ joint in Austin. Don't let the long line intimidate you. It moves relatively quickly. We got there around 8pm on Saturday night and had to wait 30 min. The good thing is that it's counter service so once you get to the line you get your food.We had the brisket, pulled pork sandwich, hot link and frito pie. Everything was great. It might be a dollar or two more than I would like to pay for BBQ, but the price is not outrageous. The one thing I wish they had was better sides. Fries, mashed potato, cornbread...all of the sides are basically cold picnic style side dishes. That would be my one knock on Green St.This is a great place to go before or after getting drinks in the West Loop. We will definitely be back."
"Amazing vibe- all meats Cooked In a smoker right behind the ordering table. The guys taking the order actually uses a butchers knife to cut your meat. We got the pulled pork sandwich,brisket, chicken leg with macaroni salad and broccoli salad. Good smokey taste. Bar had your local brews and iPas. Whiskey selections is not too shabby either."
"Sadly, I can only give this place 3 stars.  2 stars for the BBQ and 1 star for the sweet tea cocktail which I really enjoyed.  I have read the reviews of others and agree with many.  The BBQ is very good but quite pricey.  This is a trendy place with long benches offering seating for several people but the way the place is set up is very confusing:  once you figure out how to enter, you then must figure out that you have to seat yourself.  Then you have to find where to stand in line to place your order.  Fortunately, because I was with friends, I was able to sample almost all of the meats.  While I really enjoyed the salmon and all the other meats I tasted, I was disappointed about the sides.  First, the menu of side dishes is extremely limited.  Second, the sides, particularly those that were mayo based, were sitting out at room temperature, not refrigerated or on ice.  Although they looked good, I was skeptical about trying the macaroni salad, potato salad or the broccoli salad because I didn't want to take a chance of getting sick.  (I get it that the place is air conditioned but with open access patio seating, the place warms up, especially in humid 90 degree weather.)   I ended up having the pickled veggies only because I thought they would be my safest option ( next to the cole slaw) as far as sides.  I'm hoping that they will expand this part of the menu, perhaps to include mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, corn on the cob, green beans, etc.  All in all, I would probably try this place again, maybe with friends, because the BBQ is very good and worth having again."
"Green Street is reliably good BBQ, and a nice place to spend a couple hours on a weekday evening. I personally enjoy the haute-trash aspect--there is a deliberate attempt to be a bit ""scene,"" and this is reflected in the clientele as well as the employees--although I've been with people who are put off by it. The meat is almost exclusively phenomenal, although a friend and I both had the impression the last few times we were in there that the pork ribs had fallen off a bit. The sides are as good as they need to be--it's not really the point of the place--although the ice-cream and the root beer floats were a pleasant surprise. The staff often look a bit prickly, but I've had exclusively positive experiences with them--they have comped me things on my birthday or when something went wrong, hung around while we finished our whiskies after everyone else had left, etc. I'll keep going back."
"As Ryan L mentioned in his review, the meat sweats came into play here!I walked in and saw communal seating and new I was in for an event! LOLMy buddies who where already there helped me in my selection process as I was told the Warren Moon was the route to go. The Warren Moon is essentially sliced brisket and a chopped hot link on a bun. I jumped in line and saw the guy was cutting up a delicious slab of ribs so I told him he might as well chop me up some...couldn't help myself as they looked so damn good. I needed some greenery in my life so I went with the spicy pickles as well.Once I sat down I couldn't help but salivate @ my tray of food and was too excited to sit it down to go grab a drink @ the bar. I started with the ribs along with the 3 sauces they had available: vinegar, BBQ and Spicy. Those ribs were fucking awesome and once I dipped them in the sauce it was even better. The spicy sauce was probably the front runner here. I then moved onto the Warren Moon in which I was told was inspired by the actual legendary NFL quarterback. That was a damn good meat sandwich...so good I never put it back down on my tray. I tore that sumbitch apart like I've never done before...Very good! The spicy pickles were decent as the meats were the star of the show! It was hard to breathe/talk after smashing all that meat. As I mentioned previously, the setup is pretty much communal seating with long benches and rolls of paper towels to wipe those messy hands down. If you want water (recommended) they have a self serve cooler at the bar with ice next to it. Little patio lights at the top of the place keeps the joint dim which is cool and a good look. Getting to the place can be a bit confusing as you have to go through what looks like a mini alley on Green St. Just so you know its the 2nd door on the left once you turn into it. If you go to the first door, you will be eating Ramen and if you go right, you will be @ the champagne salon."
"There were some hits and some misses, but the things that were hits were SO GOOD that the misses don't really matter. We ordered the beef rib, sliced brisket, hot link, and pulled pork. For sides, we got the potato salad, macaroni salad, baked beans, and cole slaw. The sliced brisket was just OK, it needed some bbq sauce to amp it up. The hot links and pulled pork were yummy, nothing super WOW, just good and yummy. The beef rib was THE BEST THING EVER! It was perfectly caramelized on the outside giving you the perfect sweet and salty bite every time. The inside was so juicy and delicious! Ugh, I'm salivating just thinking about it. The potato salad had some interesting spice that I couldn't quite pinpoint. It was definitely a pleasant surprise and the best side dish of them all. The other sides were good too. Baked beans were just meh. If you go, get the lemonade! Its sour/sweetness helped balance out all of the savory meat. It was also a little pricey for my taste, but it's normal for that area. I would definitely go back but next time I will order pounds and pounds of beef rib"
"Awesome BBQ and portions!! I met a friend here for dinner on a week night and had no problem finding a table or waiting in line for our food. I have heard the wait can be a bit long on the weekend if you don't get to the restaurant before 7. We each ordered a  sandwich (I had the pulled pork) and split the baked beans and macaroni salad. My sandwich even came with coleslaw on top of my meat, AMAZING! I was stuffed I love the family style picnic table seating, common paper towels on the table and the bar in the middle of the restaurant. I also think the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.The entrance is a bit tricky to find but is right across from RM Champagne Salon."
"Finally tried this place out and it did not disappoint. Very cool, hipster type exterior and interior with picnic tables, Christmas lights, mason jars and a lot of beards. Gives off a southern warehouse type feel-very fitting for BBQ. Arrived about an hour after they opened on a Friday (5pm). Solid amount of people as we waited in the cafeteria style line for about 20 minutes. Fortunately for us, it only got longer as the night went on. The line runs right past the bar so get some drinks while waiting (these owners know what they're doing). We got to the front and ordered 1/2# sliced brisket (13), 1/2# pulled pork (10), smoked chicken (7), broccoli salad and pickled vegetables (5 each) for a total of $44. Service was great, the meat guy (is that the professional term?) gave us an extra piece of chicken because our leg was a little small, and the cashier politely welcomed us seeing that it was our first time. After paying, we got our own sauce (regular BBQ and some vinegar sauce). Bottom line-the meal was phenomenal. Get it all. The meat is so tender and juicy it almost falls apart. My favorite was the brisket. But throwing all the meat together between some white bread smothered in BBQ and vinegar sauce is the way to go. I will say there seems to be a small disconnect between their menu online and the working menu in restaurant (no big deal just something to be aware of). I will definitely be coming back."
"Awesome BBQ joint, walked in not knowing what to get. Ended up getting the brisket and the hot link, comes with a few slices of white bread on the side if you like. The sides also look really good.I recommend coming here with friends and getting a few meats and sides to share. Grab a seat at a bench and go to town!"
"After two failed attempts at dining at Green Street Smoked Meats, the third try was the charm. Both of the indoor and outdoor seating is very picnic-like with wooden benches and canopies. The difference is the indoors Christmas lighting strung across the ceiling. Lighting is rather dim but regardless, it's a casual and relaxed environment perfect for gatherings and/or taking friends from out of town. Here's what we ordered:Pork Belly - The texture and fattiness was melt-in-your-mouth excellent, but the flavors fell short. That's when the sauces really come in handy.  Brisket - The meat had a noticeable amount of fat. It was very tender and smokey, but also on the weaker side of flavors.Smoked Bone-in Salmon - This giant slab of salmon is definitely meant for sharing. It came with a pile of tartar sauce to the side but it wasn't necessary. The salmon remained moist and tender with the skin being crispy. Potato Salad - Nothing spectacular but the job was done. I enjoyed it and thought it paired well with the meat. Sauces - Four different sauces were offered: Texas, vinegar, spicy, and coffee. The Texas had the strongest flavors whereas the rest was milder. Overall, the food flavors were pretty mild compared to most places but I can appreciate that. You can up the notch by drenching your meat in however many sauces you want. I also like the option of them offering white bread to go with the meat. Would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu items!"
"What a fun atmosphere this place has! Myself and about 7 other friends came here for dinner one Thursday night. We got there at 7:00 and had no problem getting a table and getting food easily and quickly. By 7:45 though there was a pretty decent sized line. Glad we avoided that! I tried quite a few of the sides and they were all great. I was surprised by just how much I liked the broccoli salad! One thing I wish they did was offer up smaller, cheaper portions of the sides so I could have ordered more! The meats were cooked really, really nicely and everybody loved their food! I wasn't crazy about the BBQ sauces but the meats were still very good on their own. I absolutely plan to come back and would bring my friends or other family along as well!"
Pulled pork sandwich.  It's not a question.  Do it!  Absolutely amazing it melts in your mouth
"It's Official! I have found my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.I came here with a small group so we got to try it all, and it was all GOOD!- Pork Belly - was pretty good- Hot Link - was good- Pulled Pork - was very good- Sliced Brisket - was Amazing!The sides were awesome too. The Frito Pie was just alright, and hard to share with a group but the Beans, Broccoli Salad and Macaroni Salad were all Great.The atmosphere here is really cool and unique, probably a hipster's dream. Can't wait to come back. Well worth the wait.. Yum, yum, yum yum!"
Excellent food!
"Great, because it isn't trying to pretend. It is what it is. That means get your lazy @ss up and go get your food, and enjoy the community style seating. If you feel snobby go across the street to Soho house, if you got a date go next door to RM. But you come here for good food when you're drunk. Will definitely be back."
"Went here after work with a friend and tried the pork belly and chopped brisket--both were great, and you can order by whatever weight you prefer. The atmosphere was unique--very rustic with picnic tables. Would recommend checking out this place if you are wanting to try something different and are a meat-eater."
Wow I gotta say these guys know what they're doing pork belly was phenomenal everything from their menu was just delicious! We waited for about an hour it was a Saturday but it was worth the wait! Just get your drink on while waiting in the line
"I'd definitely say this is a cool looking spot, buuuut oddly pretentious. Came here with my fiancé and his family at about 8pm on a Saturday night. Obviously we expected a wait but we stood in line to order food for an hour. That's fine, whatever .. I get it (or do I ?)What I didn't get was why we felt like we were an inconvenience to all of the grumpy men in the beard/beanie/half sleeve uniforms. We interacted with several of them throughout the night, and for a not (yet) drunk family, we all felt like we were treated like a nuisance for being there. First greet was from a guy who said ""you know it's an hour food, right?"" Not so much a friendly warning, more like why the hell are you here type of thing haha.Food was good for sure, but I wouldn't say it worth the line. We aren't coming back, but that's due to the less than friendly service."
"Came here after work after work on a Friday around 8PM to grab some meaty delectables.  The wait for food looked frighteningly long when my dining mate and I arrived, so I ran to get a round of beers at the bar while he held a spot in the line.  They have a decent selection of beers on draft and in bottles, and a variety of cocktails (by the glass or by the pitcher) - drinks are about on par with the rest of the area in terms of price point.  The line moved pretty quickly (it's an order at the counter and then sit at a long communal table dealie), although if I had been starving when I arrived I would have been rather cross by the time we sat down with our food.We ordered a half pound of pulled pork with a side of white bread, a half pound of sliced brisket, and a side of potato salad.  Don't forget to get silverware and make a pit stop at the sauce station before finding a spot to sit.  I especially liked their vinegar based sauce (yuuuummm) on the brisket.  The meat was well seasoned, tender, and moist.  And the potato salad was DELICIOUS - whatever magical dressing they had on those spuds was on point.The ambiance of the place is interesting - very laid back, almost warehouse-like space with a bunch of small dimmer lights crisscrossing the ceiling.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant, a little difficult to reach when the line wraps around the restaurant, however service was pretty quick and the bartenders friendly enough.Will be back to get more meaty goodies when I'm hankering some BBQ."
"Came here on a Wednesday night, so didn't have to wait much to get some food. It was also easy to find a seat.The food was very good, but also very overpriced. The prices on the board are also misleading, as its not clear that they are prices by the half-pound, and not for a single portion. Would recommend it only if you don't mind spending a lot here."
"Came here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm and the wait was about 45min-1 hour. Apparently this is a newer bbq place that has been getting rave reviews so we decided check it out.  The line moved fairly quickly and you can go to the bar and grab a beer while you wait.  A friend and I split the following.  1/2 lb. Brisket, 1/2 lb. pulled pork, 1 hot link, 1 smoked chicken leg, frito pie & sweet/spicy pickles (half/half).  My favorite thing was the pulled pork.  It was so amazingly tender/fatty/flavorful. Next was the brisket and smoked chicken leg.  Both really good as well.  Brisket is much better when it's hot, so eat it quick!   The chicken leg was good, juicy, good smokey flavor.The Hot link was ok, nothing special. Spicy pickles were really good, not spicy at all. Sweet pickles, i'm not really a fan of, but my friend is and i think he liked it.The frito pie, skip it.  We noticed everyone had it so we got one as well but it really is nothing special.  I was honestly sad that i wasted space in my stomach on it.  Also, theres 4 different types of bbq sauce.  My favorite was the regular and the coffee (i think) flavors."
Delicious. I would eat it again right now if I wasn't so full from just eating there.
"Items Selected:Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Pork BellyPotato SaladFrito PieVanilla Peach Swirl SoftserveOwned and operated by Brendan Sodikoff, a man whose portfolio of success seems to know no bounds, it was only an hour after my sister and her fiancée had tied the knot that myself and two others descended upon Green Street Smoked Meats - the highly acclaimed contemporary smokehouse just steps of Randolph once again proving its owner's ability to amaze regardless of region or cuisine.  Already familiar with stylish spaces like Bavette's, Maude's, Au Cheval, and others it was admittedly an unexpected surprise to find the building housing Green Street to be open and airy with an appearance best described as 'modernized-barn' yet with a centralized bar and looped lightbulbs aplenty everything about the restaurant was welcoming - the team at the counter happy to chat about everything from the Rick James soundtrack to the tender meats ready to be sliced by the half-pound.  Certainly more spendy than several similar spots, with brisket and belly tallying $24/lb while pulled pork and ribs ring in at a more modest $18, it was eventually in a trio of options that we invested our appetites and adding in a soda, sides, and swirl of soft-serve our nearly $55 tab set the bar quite high.  Beginning first with sides, our first taste of Green Street cuisine found skin-on potatoes roasted to tender amidst a creamy, low-mustard sauce and personally satisfied with just a taste while my aunt raved each bite I instead turned attention to a Frito Pie, the corn chips still crispy beneath a veil of melted cheddar, smoky meat sauce, and jalapenos leaning more 'medium' than hot.  Cleansing the palate with a few bites of soft-serve, the creamy base lovely while flavors of fresh peach popped, it was onward to meat that the meal moved and although the lightly seasoned brisket was on par with much of what I tasted in Texas it was the swine that stole the show, first with shredded pork that dialed back the sweetness to let more natural flavors amidst light acid shine, and then in tender pork belly with skin smoked bronze atop a smoky core the texture of bacon that almost melted on the tongue."
"+ quality meats - sliced brisket was my fave+ lots of indoor and outdoor seating+ situated in the cutest alley- TOO SALTY, too peppery- long lines- expensive-ishIt's cafeteria style, so you wait in line (we waited 20 mins on a Thursday around 7:30 PM), tell them what you want, and they put all your food on a tray.  We got 6 beef ribs, 14 pork ribs, 1 lb of pork belly, 1/2 lb of sliced brisket, and 5 sides (macaroni salad, potato salad, cole slaw, Frito pie which was disgustingly overpriced at $6, and broccoli salad)... to feed 6 girls.  Then you pay, visit the sauce stations (none are worth raving about) and/or the bar for a drink, find a seat, and pick up after yourself at the end.  There are lots of indoor and outing seating via picnic tables.  I didn't notice anybody waiting around for a seat, and if you are a small party, you'll most likely share a table with other people.  When the weather is nice, try to sit outside.  It makes for a breezy, romantic ambiance sans bugs (I was surprised, but you are surrounded by concrete after all)!  I highly recommend the brisket because everything else was overly seasoned (salt/pepper/something spicy), and the water cups they have are teeny tiny!  My mouth felt like it shriveled into a raisin by the end of the meal.  Also, the pork belly was 2/3 fat and 1/3 meat... not my style, as I prefer the reverse ratio.  It was $30/pp to eat this way (family style is the best) for food only."
Awesome environment great portion sizes good everyone is so friendly. Will def come again. Reminds me of Texas bbq
"The barbeque here, is outstanding. There were just two of us, so limited on ordering. We had the Pork Ribs and Slicked Brisket as our meats. Phenomenal! Some of the best Ribs I have ever had. Sides were: Frito pie, spicy pickles and Potato salad.Everything was great, except the Potato Salad. Not my cup of tea.The sauces for everyhing were great, but honestly you don't even need sauce.The meat is that good.We went right after work, so the wait was not bad at all.will be back."
"One afternoon in the West Loop, we spontaneously stopped by Green Street Smoked Meats for an afternoon snack. Ended up being much more filling than a snack, but oh so good!It was quite empty at 3pm on a Sunday, but I've heard the line can get very long on a weekend night. Thankfully GSM is prepared with buckets of chilled beer the help improve the wait. This restaurant is cafeteria style, so you walk along the line adding the things you want. You start with the meats, then add on sides and drinks. The employees were very helpful in providing recommendations for use first-timers. We ended up trying the chicken legs, sliced brisket, Frito pie, macaroni salad, potato salad, and broccoli salad. Honestly, my favorite thing was the Frito pie (Frito bag with chili and jalapeños poured into it) which I realize is pretty silly. The brisket was also perfectly charred and delicious.The inside bar area is cool, but we sat outside on the side patio to enjoy the late summer weather. I will be back to see what else this place has to offer!"
"I've had BBQ everywhere. Austin. Lockhart. Kansas City. Nashville. Everywhere. To give Green Street a proper review, you need to break things apart:Food: very good. Not quite Austin. But, very good. The best in Chicago. And yes, I've been to Q, Smoque, Smoke Daddy, Twin Anchors and every other place. The Brisket is very good. The beef ribs are exceptional. The hot link is the best value. Pork ribs are moist and full of flavor. The sides are week IMHO. There's nothing wrong with them, but there's nothing exceptional. I've been to Green Street, some 20 times or so, and the food is very good. A 4.5 out of 5.Drink: let me be clear, it sucks. Average beer selection. Slightly better than average bourbon selection. But, the bar is woefully under staffed and the pricing is bat shit crazy. $20 for a Four Roses Old Fashioned? The same drink, even at a place like Girl And The Goat, is roughly $12 and at Big Star it's about $10. There pricing is out of whack for what it is. A 2 star out of 5.Ambiance: you just have to know what you're getting into when you go. It's hipster kitschy. But, it's simple, clean and lacks any pretentiousness. It's nothing special, but that's what makes it nice. 3 to 3.5 stars out of 5."
"This place came highly recommended by several meat lovin' folks so I was definitely excited to try it.A group of us got here on a warm weekday evening around 6:30. It was packed but somehow the 8 of us secured the last outdoor seating. The outside space, once seated? One star!Once inside, the people working here are super nice and helpful. Another star.The line for food was actually ridiculous. 30 minutes just didn't seem worth it. I had the pork ribs, link, chicken and macaroni salad. Everything was good, nothing blew me away. Deduct a star.I bought a $40 pitcher ($50 tip and tax) that was about 70% ice. Was refreshing in the heat but completely overpriced. Deduct a star.So two stars +, two stars -. I'm wavering around 2.5 to 3 stars. With all these raving reviews, I think I need to set the record straight and give this spot a 2. Improvements need to be made around the drinks, wait time and meat.I recommend it for a drink outside, not for the long wait for food. Soon it'll be too cold to sit outside though so keep that in mind!"
You can get items in quarter pound portions. Do that and get a little of everything. Really good ribs.
"4.5*This is some seriously good BBQ. I've eaten at the best BBQ joints in Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, etc. and this more than holds its own. As everyone says, the pork belly is outstanding, the sliced brisket is delicious as well, but the true star for me was the pork ribs. They have a delicious black pepper crust you rarely see outside of Tx, a deep smoke ring, and they are cooked perfectly, not fall of the bone, which is a sign of overcooking, but the meat pulls away easily and allows you to take a clean bite.The sides are OK, nothing special. The true star is the meats.I would deduct a half star for the prices ( roughly $20 for a half rack of ribs, cmon guys, not even the BBQ legends like Franklin's in Austin charge that much) and the mediocre sides."
"Braving the snow, we stumbled into the Green Street Smoked Meats location by pretty much following our noses. The outside had an incredible aroma that really preps you for a BBQ experience. The door was a bit hidden, but we found our way in and saw the interesting set up. It's a very casual, very relax environment, fitted with bench seating, a large bar, and counter-service for all your meaty needs. The staff seemed very friendly, and looked relatively thrilled to be there. The half of the menu is priced by 1/2 pounds (ranging from $8-$11), while the rest is priced by order. When they asked us what we wanted... we said EVERYTHING. This is what they managed to fit on our tray. Pork Ribs - It had a sweet glaze to it, while being relatively tender. However, overall it was a bit plain and needed help with the sauces to really enjoy the meat. Pork Belly - The texture of this was very good. It was cooked to a great temperature; however, it didn't offer anything special on the flavor front. It was very fatty, and was generally pretty good. Sausage Link - This was the most flavorful meat here. It was tasty and had a little kick to it. Much of the group thought this was the best offering all night. I'm not a big fan of sausage at BBQ places, but I thought it was well done. Brisket - We were the lucky ones to get the last order of brisket before they ran out. However, I'm not sure if this played into the factor of how it turned out. Some of the brisket was pretty good, but it was inconsistent with the rest of the pieces. I thought the texture was ok (while some purist didn't think it was tender enough), but it did lack the strong flavor I was looking for. Chicken Leg - Wasn't very fond of this. It had a smoky flavor to it, but it was pretty plain outside of that. The fact that a full piece of it was still on the tray (out of two) was very telling. Smoked Bone-in Salmon - This was the star of the show for me. The texture, taste, and portion size was very good. It was huge, and definitely should be shared (otherwise that's a lot of salmon for $20.00). It came with a lot of tartar sauce on the side, but it wasn't needed. Word of warning, this is not a filet, so there are a bit of bone in the meat so be aware (experienced fish eaters need not to worry). Potato Salad - A classic that was well done; didn't do anything to change the wheel, but I thought it was pretty good. Coleslaw -This was made out of red cabbage with a vinegar base (rather than mayo). I really liked this side because it was light and tasty. It had a few interesting things in it (like cilantro), and ended up being the more popular item on the table. Sauces - Being at a BBQ place, the choice of sauces is very important to bring out the flavor of the meat without being overpowering. There were three sauces to choose from (Texas something, Leprechaun Tears, and Brown Sugar). They were all a bit mild and lacked that real kick that I was looking for. However, I thought the Texas (something, it was dark... couldn't read) was pretty good and was the only sauce that packed a little heat. Overall, the experience was enjoyable but the food was a bit average (outside of the salmon). I thought the salmon alone was worth the trip (and the sides as well). But the rest of the food tasted about the same and didn't do much to wow me. However, it was opening night, and I will give it another go in the near future."
"Cool atmosphere & good meat. Seriously lacking in the ""sides"" department. No mac & cheese, no tots-- just lots of vinegar and mayo covered slaws and vegetables. Despite the chaotic nature of waiting in line we felt the whole process was easily explained and pretty painless. We found a picnic table with ease, too. Once winter hits I can only imagine how busy it will be though without the extra space of their patio seating. Can't say it's the best in town but definitely worth a try!"
"Average BBQ, really. The brisket and ribs were dry; and the sides were pretty generic. The pulled pork is probably the best item to order; they do a good job forking in a generous amount of fat as well.That said, the burnt ends secret is pretty awesome. And you're telling me it's complimentary? Solid."
"5 stars for food, 1 star for everything elseAfter living in the city for a few more seasons and coming to this place a few more times I have to update my review... because there's no way Green Street deserves 5 starsThings don't add up here. I wouldn't really call Green Street a ""restaurant"" or a ""smoke-house"", it's more like a warehouse space that a bunch of hipsters (who do damn good bbq) leased out so they could hire their friends to eat and drink all day. They have NO IDEA how to actually run a restaurant.First off, their setup is idiotic. It's cafeteria style seating... which basically means seat yourself. They have the smoker and register on one end of the restaurant, picnic tables arranged on the outside and a bar in the middle. The line is right in the middle of the bar and the eating area which is pretty much the only walkway within the restaurant. This means that while you're waiting in line, you have people drinking on bar stools one side, you have people trying to eat their food on picnic tables on the other side, and you have people who just walked in or who just got their trays of food trying to squeeze through all of this to find an open spot to actually eat. If you can't find a place to sit on one of the picnic tables, you can sit next to all the people you will find on the bleachers in the back eating on their laps for lack of table space. To top it off, the entrance is at the front so people coming in need to be told what the heck is going on and where to find the back of the line. They actually have someone designated at the entrance to try to help people figure out the mess, and to keep a gap in the line there because all of the sauces, utensils, and drinks are crammed in that same area. You might ask if this is because the place is small? It's not... This place is HUGE and they could have done much better with the space. I love the way it looks inside but functionally it's so dumbSecondly, they are terribly slow at actually serving the meat. The last time I was there, the line was all the way to the back of the warehouse and when we get up to the front to order, there was just one person up there cutting and weighing the meats to move the line along during the rush, but there were to people standing right next to them chopping potatoes because I'm sure that should be the priority during the dinner time rush. If there is just one person who doesn't know what they want when they get to the cutting station, everyone waits...Thirdly, it's about 1.5-2x as expensive as other good bbq in the city and I'm not exactly sure why I'm paying more. It's not like they have to pay hosts/hostesses or waiters. I guess it's because they have a huge location in the West Loop but damn... They sell ribs by weight, not by the slab like most places, so a pound of beef ribs, which was just 3, was $20. It's also $26 a pound for brisket... Lastly, the music sucks.... I'm not an old guy. I have NEVER complained about the type or volume of music playing at any restaurant I've ever been but wtf man this place BLASTS it to the point where pretty much everyone I was with made a comment about it.I'll finish off by saying that this place knows how to bbq some incredible meat. Hands down, some of the tastiest anywhere, but as a food venue this place blows hard."
"They'll have something you'll like. Pros:Baked beansMicheladasBroccoli saladAll the TVs are powered by a PS4Cons:No legitimate gripes. The prices definitely stack up quick but you should expect that given the location.Tips:Arrive early, food runs out. Fast.For more than 2 people, grab a table quickly.Suggestion to Owners:Get more PS4s and have a game night!Definitely worth trying just for the Micheladas and anything pork related. It's a great spot for you, a date, a handful of friends. You come in through a historic looking Chicago alley (it's the 2nd door from the street) and enter a large room with a bar in the center, sink with exposed pipes, communal tables, and an angled counter for ordering & payment. Behind the counter they are very friendly, and quick to plate your food. I like communal tables but they can be hit or miss, Green Street is definitely more for singles/couples/friends. If you want to bring the family, arrive EARLY. The food is prepared with enough skill that it's hard to not find something to love. The only thing I wouldn't get again is the beef rib because of the actual meat per dollar value (lots of bone. (that's what she said!))... Okay. I'll show myself out now.Pulled pork sandwich:So much texture, easy to dive into and forget it came with bread.Baked beans:some of the best baked beans I've ever had. Rich, packed with flavor, not runny, holds well together by the forkful. If you have a small stomach, this is probably all you'll need.Hot link:This one took me by surprise. Barely greasy, not oily, and yet quite delicious. Doesn't pack the indulgence of a Bobak's sausage but not in a bad way. It was really good.Beef rib:Dry rub, you gotta dig in there to get it, most of the cost is in the bone.Spicy Pickles:Delicious. Nice combination of veggies and crunchy, right-sized pickles.Broccoli Salad:Excellent option for anyone avoiding the heavy meats. Would have it again."
"Friday night at 7- Parking is hard to find - no valet but OK- I always get a spot- somewhere- the place is old Chicago with a cobblestone brick walk back into the restaurant that must be over 100 years old- pretty cool- huge space when you walk in...order at the bar for your drinks, at the counter for food- then find a place to eat with a little help from the host, it works out . they have community-style shared tables.They were out of beef ribs- which must be great- the brisket was to die for- and if you eat enough of it, well, it will probably kill you..it was better than ANYTHING in Chicago-I would say the best I ever had, and I have had a lot of brisket in my lifetime.  They had Spare ribs, which were OK- nothing to write about, also Pork Belly- which must be the new cool food...it was OK, but the brisket eclipsed everything. Sides were decent, Cole slaw, outstanding baked beans. They serve Wonder White Bread with the meats. Nice selection of sauces to choose from, prices are great, ,,,hip crowd, loud music (bad alternative music)I finish my food and had to go grab some water from the bar, and there are a couple of large dudes that took my seated space- one which happened to be Dave Anderson- the Real Famous Dave! What a trip! This man knows BBQ~ He gave thumbs up for the brisket."
This is a great space whether you sit inside or on the patio! The line wasn't that bad as we went on a Tuesday night at 8pm. We split the 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork with Frito pie and pickled vegetables. The Frito pie was delicious! Just make sure you eat it with a spoon and fork. I preferred the pork over the brisket but that is standard for me. Definitely get both sauces (regular and hot) but note that both are pretty spicy. And the pickled veggies had a great kick to me! At least I think it was the veggies... Definitely looking forward to heading back soon.
"NOBODY WANTS TO BITE INTO A SANDWICH AND CHIP THEIR TOOTH! I love smoked meats more than anything in this world and this place was just poor excuse for a BBQ joint. I don't care if you're covered in  trendy tattoos or have a cute little mustache, back up your prices with a quality product.   I got the thunderbird sandwich off of one of the employee's recommendation. The first bite into the sandwich was straight into a rib. C'MON MAN ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?? It ruined the entire experience for me. The only redeeming quality of this place was the INCREDIBLE POTATO SALAD and the Silent Hill themed bathroom."
"The slowest possible service.With only six people in front of us we waited 25 minutes for our turn before we realized a single person is taking/filling orders, and another person is handling side dishes and the register. There were two other people at the order counter quartering unwashed potatoes, and two other people standing around behind the side-dish / cashier counter. All it took was one undecided customer in front of us to bring the whole show to a halt and create a huge line.  Once you get the food, you have to wait around by the bar for an open spot and hopefully getting the attention of a bartender while your food is somewhere else at a table. This about the dumbest layout I've seen at a restaurant. It took nearly an hour from the time we walked in to the time we could walk out, this at a place that has gone out of its way to be a Texas cafeteria. The side dishes we tried were too stinky for date night.All that said, the brisket was out of this world. Everything else was average.  They could be cranking out orders with minor improvements so there is hope.  If like them to succeed."
"A friend actually recently texted me that they were at my favorite place and I knew exactly where they were talking about: Green Street Smoked Meats!  I have a borderline addiction to their brisket and I will not apologize for it!  I usually get 1/2 lb. of brisket and then another 1/2 lb. to go.  I love to bring everyone here and they have almost always been pleased.  The one complaint I have heard is that they do not have macaroni and cheese and one or two other sides that my friends may have liked.  I wouldn't order macaroni and cheese anyhow, so that has never bothered me.  A few times out of over 20 the meat has had a quality that I really cannot accurately describe other than to say it has been off.  Still, Green Street Smoked Meats is worth the gamble."
"I just love this place.  The Chartreuse Mule is my favorite drink, and the food is spectacular...and I don't even like BBQ :)"
"Sunday lunch around 1ish was perfect time to go.  Walked right up to order, guy behind the counter took the two things I wanted and said the chopped brisket with a half sausage on top would be a great sandwich for me, and he was right.  The bun looked delicious, but I actual held back on the extra carbs. Got a side of the potato salad rich would do super rich and tasty. I think next time, I'll go for the spicy pickles.  I'll be back!!"
"Good meats, got the thunderbird sandwich with sweet picked (amazing), broccoli salad (slightly sweet but good), and potato salad (nice change of pace but nothing extraordinary).   Menu is small but maybe that's the point.   Beer selection is ok but get a can not a draft as their taps do not appear to be used all the time."
"Green Street has to be my favorite BBQ in the city. The brisket and hot sausage link were top notch. Atmosphere was very cool. The prices, though, kept my review from going to 5 stars, but I can't blame its owners since the place was packed and the patrons don't seem to mind. I will likely visit again."
"5-star food and atmosphere.The one thing I take issue with is they make you bus your own tables.  Which is fine, except tipping the staff is highly encouraged with tip jar by the register and tip line on the CC receipt.  This place is packed every time I'm there, and the prices aren't cheap.  They can easily afford 1 full time laborer to bus tables, especially when gratuity is practically expected."
"It was a tough sell for the fourth star but I thought the concept of this restaurant was unique.  'Picnic style' its called which means you order your food at the counter, get it right away and eat at picnic tables. It may not seem exciting but with the added flair and the type of crowd the west loop 'restaurant row' draws it definitely works.Food was barbecue and good, although there are better joints in the city for that type of fare. Definitely order some coleslaw when you're there. Pork ribs were great, as were the baked beans. Drinks were so-so definitely not worth the 12$ a pop when you have Maudes so close for drinks a dollar or two cheaper and better quality. Service was fine but you don't have to deal much with most of the staff as it's all mostly self serve."
"Went on a weekday before Interstellar IMAX 70mm.  Despite being a weekday, it was very busy.  Got to try the pork belly, brisket and fritos pie.   I would definitely recommend both meats, I would probably pass on the fritos pie unless you really love fritos.  I would recommend to try any of the other sides instead, my only regret is not being able to try more meats."
"Do yourself a solid and visit thisClusterPhuck of great Buffet Style, Pig-destroyin, Industrial, Picnic-esque, sloppy-seconds-worthy of goodness.  Plus the place is littered with Slime Sk8 stickers which is rad. Have some pepto ready at home after this meal,&Like the ol' sayin' goes...for every animal you don't eat, I'm going to eat four..."
"The food was good, I wouldn't give it ""the best BBQ in Chicago, "" but it was satisfying.  The bar is really loud, hard to have a conversation.  I would recommend that you check this place out at least once.  The hot link was the best thing I ate there."
"I walked in here all side eyes, like ""Come. On."" THIS  line for some bbq? Cool story, bro. Turns out, it was totally worth the wait. All the meat was incredible. I think my favorites, of what we had, in order, are: burnt ends, pork ribs, chicken, pork belly. Yes, you read that right. They will serve you an order of burnt ends if you ask nicely. GET. SOME. Also, DO NOT skip the elote. Or the coleslaw, actually. I know, I know. Boring. But it's not! It's so good! Pickles, too! Broccoli too! I actually housed like a whole side of that sweet and savory delicious broccoli salad because vegetables. Go get you some meat! Just be patient. Nothing good in life is easy to get. #wisdom"
"Very cool atmosphere - good beers and drinks.  Loved the ribs, loved the brisket..Hotlinks were a little on the salty side..but very good. Sides could use some improvement - how about some cornbread, mac n cheese, collard greens??...Pickled stuff was good - especially the spicy stuff.  Good place - although there are a lot of good bbq places in Chicago...this is worth the trip for the atmosphere alone.  Very cool cafeteria style seating...feels like you're at a picnic..shared tables, very casual."
"My vegetarian friend Elisabeth has been talking about Green Street for months, which made it pretty clear that I had to try this place out. When someone sworn to not eating food that once had faces recommends you eat meat, it's gotta be good.We had a couple of false starts where Green Street ended up being WAY too busy to visit and then we tried on a Tuesday early evening and were actually able to get a table to consume our ABSOLUTELY delectable BBQ. First off, this place is SO SO good. SO SO good. SO SO SO SO SO SO good. Just had to get that out of my system! SO SO good. Sorry. I had to say it again. This place gets it and it's brand new. I can't imagine what the crowds will be like when the word really gets out! It was nutty busy on a tuesday night. Weekend diners and explores take note and beware!Two days later and I'm still having flashbacks of the pork belly. Pork belly as a concept is getting old, because most restaurants don't know how to cook it.Green street's belly is beautifully peppered on the top, and cooked to such a perfect degree that the fat is ALMOST rendered liquid, but it waits until it hits your mouth to melt. I ordered a half pound, and ate most of it. SOLID FAT people. There was meat, sure. But it was SOLID FAT. And it was wonderful. I slid a few pieces between a piece of folded white bread, and dipped it in a few different sauces.The spicy BBQ sauce is SPICY! Yes! It was actually hot and flavorful! And the vinegar sauce was awesome. The white bread was happy to sop it all up.My red hot sausage link was also delicious. Dense and flavorful. Another great vehicle for the different house made sauces, as well as the provided texas pete. Our table of four shared a few sides. The Frito pie was delicious, but felt almost lost amongst all of the wonderful meat flavors. I think if I had held back on the proteins, I would have devoured the pie. The pickled veggies were also good, as well as basically everything else.I enjoyed 1/4 of my wife's pulled pork sandwich, with a coleslaw topping. It was spot on perfect and echoed what my mouth was telling my brain. Green Street Smoked Meats is serving up some of the best BBQ available in the midwest. No question about it. My ""vegetarian"" bud Elisabeth sitting across the table from me, enjoying that divine pork belly on white bread slammed the last nail in the coffin. This place is killing it, and I'm so glad I experienced it. I will be back, many many times."
"I love meat. I love it almost as much as I love pizza. Putting meat on a pizza (i.e. a ""meatzza"") is like a little slice of heaven. But even just meat alone? It still pretty much rocks.  So, imagine my excitement when I heard a veritable meat buffet had opened in a space hidden somewhere between Nellcôte and RM in the West Loop. It was a high level of excitement. And the excitement was pretty much warranted.I enjoyed Green Street Smoked Meats quite thoroughly. Their adorable, road house chic décor gets two enthusiastic thumbs up. Great #instagramspiration up in here. Love the metal lights, the rustic wood, the vintage beer tubs... And after much admiring of the aforementioned, I was ready to eat. The only thing remaining between me and a big 'ol plate of BBQ was, unfortunately, quite a substantial line. On the Wednesday evening I was here the line was wrapped around the bar. A semi-friendly host pointed me toward the back of it, and when I inquired about seating, she said ""that's up to you."" Seating is first come, first served, get in where you fit in... and on a busy night this does mean you could be standing (for awhile) with tray of ribs in hand and nowhere to plunk your badanokadonk. Kind of annoying.Luckily, a spot was found and getting-my-grub-on commenced. Loved the succulent smoked chicken leg, the tangy pork ribs, the spicy hot link and, especially, the sliced brisket. Didn't love the Frito Pie, but that's because I didn't want to waste my precious belly real estate on Frito's when I could have more brisket, please! The sides were a slight downfall for me. Nothing bad, just nothing eye roll-worthy. Oh, and nothing hot. Don't expect to find your newest favorite iteration of mac 'n cheese at GSSM, there are cold sides only here. Broccoli salad, cole slaw, macaroni salad. The reaction was lukewarm to them all.Overall: yummy meat, adorable ambiance and bustling crowds. Wear your cute outfit. This BBQ is trending on high."
"It's good barbecue. A little trendy and lumberjacky. Neat atmosphere. Nice staff. But definitely pricey. It kind of has the Austin, TX feel with the West Loop prices. I realized also that I made grave mistake that I often make at other similar trendy restaurants that really don't provide service. I left a tip. And not a bad one. But I forgot that I literally received no service for the night. You order at the counter. You can grab your own beer from a tin cooler. You seat yourself. You serve your own water, and get your own plastic utensils. They charge steeply on an ala carte type menu. They give you a steel tray and paper bowls for your food. a roll of paper towels at your bench, and you bus your own table. And yet, they ask for a tip. And I gave one. When will I ever learn?And why do so many people like the feel of a fabricated hole in the wall?"
"Meat, meat, meat. This place is awe-some. You walk in, stand in a line to order your food and then go find the table. Basically a typical bbq place but refreshing for a west loop restaurant.We got pulled pork, pork belly and sliced brisket and it was absolutely delicious. My favorite was the sliced brisket cuz you actually taste the delicious smoked char ring on the outside. The people were super friendly and the atmosphere was great with casual cafeteria type seating. I'll definitely be back here again, a lot."
"If you come on a weekend evening then get ready to wait for upwards of 45-60 minutes just to get the opportunity to order food. Is it really worth the wait? Probably not, but that's based in standing in line on concrete. We had the brisket, smoked chicken, pulled pork,  and pork belly as meats. They were all fair but over priced for the weight your received... The sides we tried were the fried pickles,  Cole slaw,  and baked beans. All were mediocre except for the baked beans. Won't be coming back on my next trip to Chicago..."
"I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for this joint.   I've been here probably 7-8 times in the last six months because I really freaking love their meat.  The barbeque is absolutely amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the sliced brisket and the salmon.  Get out of here with that salmon.  I want to slap the mama of the keeper of the smoker because that salmon is the shit.  Remember not to stand in the pathway in front of the door because the bouncer might cut you.  The sides are out of this world also.  I haven't had a chance to try their elotes but I NEED TO.  The spicy pickles, the macaroni salad, the potato salad.  SLAP EVERYONE'S MAMAS IT IS ALL DELICIOUS."
"The atmosphere is awesome and BBQ is delicious!Wooden communal tables surround the bar, and in the warmer months, seating extends outside. It's been busy both times I've been, and there's a line that wraps around the bar to place your order at the counter. There are markers on the floor to tell how much longer to wait, and they were pretty accurate. So far, I've tried the following:-Pork Ribs -Pulled Pork Sandwich-Brisket Sandwich-Thunderbird Sandwich-Baked beans-Frito Pie (Fritos, brisket baked bean chili, cheese, and jalapenos)The sandwiches are awesome since they come with one of the sides (typically coleslaw or spicy pickles). You have the option to get the side either on the sandwich or separately.Overall, favorite BBQ in Chicago."
"Always a great time when I come out to Green Street Smoked Meats. It's setup cafeteria style and th meats are ordered by the half pound. I've ordered the hot link, ribs, fritz pie, broccoli  salad, and the vanilla ice cream... yes ice cream and it is amazing! I get it everytime.  Make sure to ask for the chocolate topping."
"Yet another place that suffered from prolonged expectations...I've been dying to try ever since they opened and finally had the chance to go when there's no line. While the chopped brisket was tender & flavorful, some bites were rather stringy, and it just wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Maybe I was being unrealistic, looking for excellent BBQ in Chicago. Potato salad was a bit too undercooked (read:crunchy) for my taste. I liked the dining room a lot, but wished the music volume were a bit more conversation friendly. Bonus points to the host who greeted and explained to incoming guests the ordering system. I'll come back to try some of the other offerings, but this first visit was a bit of a letdown."
"Obviously very, VERY good meat here. The pork belly is to die for! I always have trouble deciding whether I want a sandwich (what seems to be a more economical decision) or just meat with some bread; after two or three visits, though, I'm still undecided. For one, the meat is quite pricey, and then if you want a side, it's an additional $4.50 or so. I think the second time I was here I thought I had gotten it so that my meal wouldn't be too expensive, but it ended up being around $20 for a small portion of food. Despite the price point, the atmosphere is rather charming! Huge, open space with communal tables great for groups. With all that said, if you're willing to pay the price (both in time and dough), I would recommend!"
"Went here with a couple friends after work and all I can say is:Brisket, Brisket, Brisket.Fantastic dry rub and bark with a tender, juicy inside.  To pack that much flavor into those slices of beef is wonderful.  The pork belly is also pretty solid (what else could you expect from the guy that serves Publican Bacon?!)The setup reminds me of a ballin' Chipotle.  You basically order the meat and sides and they prep it right in front of you.  Then you pay at the end and find a seat.  The cool thing is that their bar is strategically placed to refresh you with a couple beers/cocktails while you may wait in line.  We got a pitcher a modified Moscow Mule and waited 25 minutes to get our food.The reason I could NOT give it 5 stars was that the SIDES WERE STRUGGLING for the price that they charge ($4 a la carte).  We tried the mac salad, spicy pickles, baked beans and the pickled vegetables.  The amount of flavor that they coax out of the meats is sadly NOT in the sides that they provide.  Otherwise, it is a great place to hang out, feast on brisket, enjoy a nice bar and picnic table seating. It feels like a backyard BBQ where everyone is invited!"
"My favorite part of our meal was the sides and the soft-serve.The brisket was pretty good, the ribs didn't impress me, and the salmon had bones and was a pain in the ass to eat. I need to go back and try the other meats. The vegetables sides and traditional sides were excellent. They have my favorite cider in a can, which was a plus for this GF girl. The creamsicle soft serve was fought over at the table and was EXCELLENT. This place is good for groups but only if you're all there because you can't sit down until you order food... and they are strict about this."
"This is a cafeteria style place with a central bar to get your alcohol.  You buy your meat by the half pound for the most part.  You can buy a hot link sausage or smoked drumstick individually.They carve the meat in front of you, the smoke ring is evident on all of the meat.  The brisket has a thick, delicious, crust on the outside.  The pork belly is falling apart and delicious, and the hot link sausage is spicy and delicious.They play records on an old turntable behind the bar.  The records are late 70's, early 80's, hipster treasures.The bourbon selection is strong at this joint."
"Best BBQ we have had in Chicago!  Tried all the cuts; brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs and pork belly.  Tried the spicy bbq sauce and regular as well.  All was excellent!  Next time we will order our favorites; brisket & pork ribs.  The decor is rustic and rugged.  We really liked the inside as well as the outside seating areas.  We will be back with friends next time."
"I've always been a fan of Chicago BBQ but the smoked meats area is new to me.  I went to County for the first time maybe 6 months ago and loved it.  I heard great reviews about Green Street but wasn't expecting too much.  Me and friend stopped in on a Friday night, ~5:15pm.  There was about a 15 minute ""wait"".  This place has you order food/drink, pay, and bus your meals.   The wait is actually the line to order.  You order drinks at the bar and pay separately.  It's community style seating with long tables both indoors and outdoors.As for food, between two females we ordered a 1/2 lb of brisket, pork belly, and ribs.  We asked for portions with fat, because let's be honest here, fat makes everything tastes better... BBQ is no different.  The brisket was PHENOMENAL. I've heard some people say it can be dry, but ask for a fatty portion and you won't be disappointed.  The meat just about melts in your mouth.  The pork belly is also good, it looks like it has a spicy rub.  The ribs were also very good.  In all, our 1/2 lb orders of each included 3 slices of brisket, 4 slices of pork belly, and 3 ribs.  Could we have eaten more? I was pretty full, however my counterpart said she could have eaten an extra order of brisket and ribs.  If you're hungry, maybe 4- 1/2 orders will do for 2 people.  I will be honest and say that my stomach wasn't feeling too hot afterwards but it's hard to say if my brief moments of pleasure while eating weren't worth the few hours of pain afterwards.  Overall, this place is a gem.  Come here maybe once or twice a month if you want to spare your arteries."
"I love BBQ and this is the first time visiting a BBQ joint without stepping out smelling like smoke. Well ventilated,  no; I figured they roast there meat not smoke it. The pulled pork, chicken leg and chopped brisket barely have a smokey undertone. The pork and brisket are way over sauced and the sides are bland. Also, be mindful of ordering chicken, it may not be cooked all the way through and still pink on the inside. Why are there such high reviews? Rustic decor and $4 PBR."
Love BBQ and love Green Street Smoked Meats. Have been here a few times (most recently last weekend) and each time I am impressed by the food/drinks and atmosphere. If you haven't been you're missing out.
"Hey so I was at this place for about two hours on Saturday.There is a very innovative concept kind of like eating at a high school cafeteria but only with ambiance.This is one of the few meat places with a doorman and they need it because there was like 200 people standing in line.There is a good reason they are in line. The bbq beef ribs and brisket was my favorite.The doorman takes his job very seriously. Maybe they are trying to give off a hipster type vibe since some of the people that work  there have like 5 nose rings...Eh, interesting :)There was a guy in line who told me he has been there 16 times in the past 3 weeks which bring me to my next point- BBQ is their Religion and we are the flock just yearning for more. I will be back again once I get the OK from my cardiologist.Dont pass go. Don't collect $200 -just show up and have a unique dining experience. Oh yea and show up hungry!!"
Real good BBQ. I love the pork belly and beef brisket here. The smoke salmon is amazing. The salmon is smoked just enough that it is cooked and still juicy. The pork ribs and beef ribs are good too. The ppl here are very friendly.
"I'm a BBQ snob. and while I know that BBQ is an intensely personal thing, I find that most of what there is in Chicago isn't worth taking home. However - here's my take on Green Street: I would take my dad here.I actually took a coworker here who was visiting from overseas, and had never had BBQ, so we were in sort of uncharted territory. After explaining what everything was, we decided on a sort of sampler - ribs, brisket, and pork. The ribs were great - not overdone, tender and meaty, with a great tangy (do they use sour salt?) and black peppery rub on the outside. Maybe a little sauce glazed on, but not slathered in sauce like lots of places do. These were a big win. The brisket wasn't super moist and juicy, but it was super tender, huge pink smoke ring, and the most delicious bark on the outside. Again, absolutely worth ordering again. Pulled pork was good - but not as standout as the ribs and brisket. And the baked beans and cole slaw were also good - the slaw was super crispy with a nice tangy dressing - very much to my taste even if there was a little bit of green onion in there. The beans were pretty standard - could maybe use a little jalapeno or something to add a bit of interest.Atmosphere is pretty cool too - big, open space with communal tables and a bar that seemed to have a good (if not a tad eclectic) selection. The bartender was willing to pour a couple samplers for my coworker to try when she was unfamiliar with the options. Your ribs and brisket are cut off the slab when you order them, which is nice, and the people serving up the meats are helpful with suggestions. The place filled up with Blackhawks pre-game diners, which made for a fun vibe.Like I said, a lot of the BBQ joints I've tried in Chicago just aren't that great. I know it's personal, but I'm just not moved by what a lot of them have to offer. Green Street is some of the best I've had in the city...I'll definitely be back."
"We went on a Thursday night and it was very very busy. The total line wait was 1 hour from the minute we walked in, ordered our food and sat down. It wouldn't be so bad if you we sitting like a normal restaurant but standing in a line for an hour was horrible. The meat was good but the sides were only OK. You could get the same sides from a grocery store deli-- nothing special. I wish they had a Mac & cheese and not a macaroni salad. Thankfully pricing wasn't expensive. The music was waaaay too loud inside for a eating atmosphere.  It's more of a bar feeling so sitting outside is highly recommended if possible. The staff was friendly but I think that's because they can drink on the job?!"
"Casual, rustic, and no-frills, Green Street Smoked Meats focuses on meat (duh), beer, and cocktails. One issue is, however, that the casual night out becomes a little high maintenance because of how the place is organized.  There are no reservations, no real hostess, and you wait in line to order and receive your food. And the lines can get super duper long. So you either need some members of your party to ""hold"" a table and wait to get *their* food, or you risk having a tray full of food, and nowhere to sit (flashbacks to 7th grade...).  If you go with just two people, I imagine it's awkward and you are left waiting in line together, hoping to luck into seats once you've checked out.    Not being much of a beef or pork eater, I opted for the bone-in salmon.  It was tasty enough, but nearly twice the price of any other offering.  Still, $20 isn't a bad price for a healthy portion of salmon. My friends did rave about the brisket, and it looked and smelled authentic and wonderful.    The sides were actually my favorite part.  The Frito Pie was decadent and excellent in its unapologetically white-trash presentation.  All of the salads (potato, macaroni, broccoli) were chock-full of mayo without being too runny.  This is not a place to count calories. So it was a good experience (we ate outside on picnic tables; the inside is really low-lit and aggressively casual), but I won't be rushing back until they take reservations or the crowds die down in order to make the experience a touch less stressful."
"Green Street Smoked Meats is was very good. We had their St. Louis style ribs, frito pie, pull pork and brisket. They price their food by the lb well the meat anyways which can make things very pricey. They are great bbq sauces I liked their coffee bbq sauce. I feel their place is very nicely decorated. When you walk in it feels like you're at a real Texas BBQ Shack with classy causal feeling if there such a thing that exist.The service is very fast the food is ready to be served up as you order. They have a nice bar area if you want to have a beer with your food. I liked how big the dining room was and plenty of help yourself items like water, sauces and napkins. They have sinks to wash your sticky hands after your meal. I like it and I appreciate their smoked meats it was smoky and tasty. The ribs were tender the brisket was juicy and I am glad I tried it at least once. We know we like other Barbecue places over this one and the prices here too high for us to go more frequently. So Green Street you are great but for our pocket book it will be more of a special occasion type of place for us."
"You can't any better than this. The atmosphere, the service, and especially the meats. I definitely suggest buying by the pound and taking it home or sharing with your friends."
"Chicago has been a hub for so many different types of BBQ where some of it is exceptional, but most of it is average. This place has some of the best BBQ in the city IMHO, namely the brisket, ribs and pork belly - crusted and BBQ'd to perfection. The sides like the elotes, broccoli slaw, spicy pickles (which are the same from Au Cheval) and baked beans are stand outs too. I dig the plentiful seating akin to BBQ joints you find in the south which are great for large groups btw, and lining up for getting the food. While you wait, and trust me it's worth the wait, you can grab a drink from the bar in the center while chatting with your friends. I also like the beer honor system they have. Grab a beer from the ice filled sink and tell the bartender when you're done with your tab. It's a really friendly vibe.Once you get to the food destination, you have a nice buzz along with a delicious BBQ happy ending. Be careful though, you'll want to order everything so exercise some restraint. Also, the wait staff is awesome, the music complements the ambiance and interior design well. Overall, one of the best Chicago BBQ experiences I've had."
"I'm a huge fan of bbq and (in nyc where I currently live) have tried over a dozen places to find the 'best local bbq'  so when I learned we were going here for a besties bday I was pretty excited. Unfortunately they were closed that day however the reviews via word of mouth and on yelp however made me excited to go out of my way to try them. Overall I was very disappointed by the lack of flavor in the food, and felt the reviews did not live up to the food on the tray. The ambiance, and my drink were out of this world however.To walk in you have to walk down this secluded ally-like-way which is pretty cool, and once inside the place is really spectacular in it's own unique way. A lot of the other patrons could be described as 'hipstery'. There's long communal tables (seat ~10 comfortably) against one wall, a circular full-bar in the middle, and opposite the food tray are old roman Colosseum style bleachers for additional seating. The place looks full with seats hard to come by but they have the flow down pretty good and it wasn't hard to find a seat. The food line literally brushes against one side of the bar - a genius idea for those who want to sip a brew while waiting (me! and it's maybe 20 min in line during prime time). The actual food dispensary is the classic BBQ by the 1/2 lbs (#).---- For a beverage I got the Sweet Tea Drink (bourbon, sweet tea, lemon; $10) and felt it was Delicious (just enough punch while still enticing you for more).---- Sliced Brisket (1/2#; $12.99); I was extremely disappointed in this - especially since all the yelp reviews give it such praise. I felt like my meat was pretty dry and while there was a lot of flavor on the immediate outside, the actual meat tasted quite bland. Adding sauces (bbq, vinegar, and spicy) helped but real bbq should stand on it's own. (I realized after the fact that after the pit-guy served my brisket, he looked at the rest of it and was displeased with it and subsequently chucked it... This may have been why however I wasn't sure why he didn't replace MY meat if it was bad...)---- Pork Ribs (1/2#, $9.95) These were also disappointing as they were given good reviews and I consider ribs to be part of the basics of bbq. Similar to the brisket the meat was quite dry and all of the flavor was on the exterior barely penetrating in. The meat was honestly bland and a real let down.---- Smoked Chicken Leg ($6) this was pleasently rewarding; the outside seasoning provided a lot of flavor and the interior was quite moist and essentially fell off the bone when desired. Some felt it was under cooked however I liked it.---- Thunderbird Sandwich ($12.99?) another patron in my group got this and liked it; it was basically brisket, sauce, and spicy pickles and I was really happen with the bite I had (felt like it's other yelp reviews were on the mark). The meat was juicy and melted away in your mouth. the spicy pickles packed a nice punch but weren't overpowering.---- Chili ($4.95) true to any real bbq the servings are quite large, and you def get your money's worth. The chili had a nice balance of flavors with a little sweetness to it. There are a few (appropriate) burnt ends in it.---- Cole Slaw ($4.95) I wasn't particular about this but I also don't fancy slaw in general---- Potato Salad ($4.95) I felt like there was too much mayonnaise however another person in my group felt it was one of the best things we ate there.----  Macaroni Salad ($4.95) I'm used to having bbq macaroni as a hot side but this was served cold in a salad style. It was different ... but if you like cold macaroni salad you'd prob enjoy this.Overall, the service, ambiance, and beverages were exceptional however any real bbq joint has to have it's tray perform and sadly I felt this place came up way short. Perhaps this was just a bad slab of meat however I think I tried enough items on the menu...EDIT: 8 days later their business manager PM'd me so they are actively interested in their customers opinions / reviews. +1"
Amazing smoked meats.  The place is open and airy. I would make sure to get one of each type or come back a few times to try all the types.  The sauce is a typical sauce but you really don't need it.  Enjoy the meat for what it is and how they cooked it.
Everyone come here!! SO DELICIOUS!!  It's a picnic setting so you walk in wait in line and wait for food. I had the fun Stiegl which if you like gin is great. Also had a chartreuse mule which was also a great refreshing drink. Long was a bit long but moved pretty fast for a Friday night at 8. You get your food and find a seat at a large picnic table- most likely will be sitting near others. Ordered brisket sandwich- great. Pork ribs - great. Baked bean- also great. Macaroni salad not a fan but bland. Super hipster-y but would recommend to anyone who loves good BBQ! Only gave four stars because I wasn't a huge fan of the bar.
"Great new addition to the Chicago BBQ scene. Cool roadside-dive atmosphere with great outdoor seating in the warmer months. Meat was good, not great, but I really loved their wide variety of pickles - don't miss those! Also a cool spot to just stop in for a drink, they do not mess around with their cocktails here!"
"Best BBQ in the city.  The second you walk in you're hit with the amazing smell of all the smoked meats.  Love the simple options, the atmosphere, and the amazing quality food!  I've tried almost every option and have loved them all.  Partial to the brisket, potato salad, and hot links.  Can't go wrong at this West Loop restaurant."
"Talking about taste, this is one of the best barbecue restaurants I've been to. Absolutely amazing. My faves are the pork ribs and the pork belly (it's pretty fatty though). Drawbacks are standing in line and the employees could be a little more gracious.  And it's a little overpriced. But besides that, it's great."
"Great spot. Fun vibe and unique to the city. Great food, try it all. Love the hot link and brisket. Need to try everything else. Plenty of options with sauce to mix and match , though most of it doesn't require anything, just dive in. Awesome set up with bar and drinks and picnic tables. Especially the outside ones when the weather heats up. A really cool new spots to spend many hours drinking and eating. A great and unique addition to the city and west loop."
"As a native Texan I'm very particular about the barbecue that I eat.But hands-down Green streets is probably one of the top five barbecue places I have ever experienced in the United States.To pass up a visit to this establishment is a travesty to your taste buds and needs to be done at least once if not often.I highly suggest going with friends and trying a little bit of everything on the menu that way you can share the cost, as usual good barbecue is not cheap.The one difficulty is that this restaurant is so popular the lines can be exhausting but at the very least a slight redemption in the fact that the line goes around the bar so that during the course of your visit you will have plenty to drink.While the restaurant caters to everyone this is definitely a scene for those out on a date and with friends rather than family with children."
"TWO FRITO GITO!Exposition: Green Street Smoked Meats, a venerable meat-a-torium brought to you by the same folks responsible for Au Cheval. In fact, the pork belly on Au Cheval's lauded burger comes from Green St's 2 ton custom smoker. I've been there over 15 times as of this writing. I would have reviewed it sooner, but I've been too busy om-nom-nom'ing to get around to it.First ImpressionThe team who created and executed the vision for this eatery didn't just set out to create a restaurant, they wanted to create an 'experience'. They succeeded. This might be the best lit restaurant in the city - with strands of incandescent, nostalgic picnic lights strung from ear to ear. The warm glow cast throughout the space befits the warm aura of the wondrous barbeque delights being served up from the kitchen. Its obvious the producers of Green St. spent at least a little time studying in Austin, Texas, as anyone who's ever dined at Iron Works or Franklin's will attest to the kinship they all share. Food and Drink As I've eaten and dranken my way through this menu several times, I've certainly found some favorites. For starters, I recommend the Chartreuse Mule cocktail to anyone as it serves not only as an excellent aperitif or pallet cleanser, but its frickin' good too. Each cocktail on the menu is expertly crafted by your bartender which leads me to one of the only gripes I have of this restaurant. The bartenders here work hard and are in constant demand, not only because the crowd here usually consists of efficient imbibers, but also because each drink is measured, muddled, mixed and tasted before it is served to you. This means it can take several minutes before you gain the attention of your bartender, then several more minutes before sweet nectar may you savor.The name Green Street Smoked Meats may be the most congruous resto name in all the land. For starters, it is located on GREEN ST. Secondly, they painstakingly SMOKE their bounty, which just so happens to be glorious, glorious MEATS. A few highlights include the Pork Belly with secret rub, Brisket - both sliced or chopped with a spicy marinade, and Beef Ribs that slay the Kobe ribs at Q (yeah I said it). Other notable items include the Thunderbird sandwich (think McRib made from real meat), Frito Pie (Order by exclaiming FRITO GITO!), and the Salmon is pretty good too in case you forget to leave your yoga instructor, pescatarian boyfriend home that evening.The cold sides are filler, and seem like a bit of an afterthought - I usually skip these  But the elotes and tamales are worth a shot if you have a good size group and just want a taste. Final ShakeYup. This place is the real deal. The meat line gets long quick, we pro's get there right at the opening bell to avoid what could be an hour plus wait. Go on a nice day and sit outside on the patio. Makes for good people watching, and helps with the claustrophobia which ensues indoors. I've taken dozens of people to this spot, and only two of them weren't over the moon. One is a diehard KC BBQ fan whose car was once toppled by a rack of Brontosaurus Ribs, and the other doesn't know what she's talking about."
"i thought i wouldnt find a place as good as smoque, but dang i think i found one.I love this place because of the atmosphere and cause the entrance is in an ALLEY! awesome.I shared two different meats and a side or two, and it there was plenty to share.The beer selection is awesome as well. you must try local option morning wood, the tap handle is enough reason to try it. also noticed that all the guys working there had mustaches...awesome."
"I really enjoyed my experience and the food here. But caveat, I was here on an off time. I can see when it is crowded at peak times, the annoyance of crisscrossing patrons, bar staff, waiting in line, etc would be... tiring. But if you're cool with that, then this this place is definitely for you. If you like a quieter dining experience, I'd still recommend GSSM, but would suggest swinging by at off hours. The setting definitely hearkens back to a TX BBQ place nestled into the trendy urban Randolph corridor of Chicago. The food was very good. We had the salmon, which was extremely moist and delicious, the pulled pork, and the brisket (highly recommended). We had several of the cold sides which were hits throughout our group. The beer selection is good as well as the liquor. Not much in the way of wine, if that's your thing. My only concern is the payment process. It can be confusing if you have a tab open at the bar and order food after standing in line. Not that this happens all the time, but there was major confusion when I went to pay the bill. These kinks will probably work out with time, but it was a buzz kill dealing with paying for 20 minutes while the rest of my party stood outside waiting for me. So a suggestion is to pay as you go, perhaps?"
"If there's anything you can take away from this useless review, don't order two pounds of ribs - you are asking for the #meatsweats.If you do accidentally order two pounds like some fool I know did, don't worry, it still tastes good the next day.  A half pound of ribs is probably enough for one person.  The baked beans with pieces of brisket inside tasted very good with a profound smoky flavor.  I remember enjoying the pulled pork as well.   Definitely want to try the giant chicken leg when I return.Not a big fan of the sauce options, especially the coffee one.  No real explanation, just did not like it on my ribs.  Whichever one was the regular kind (the Texas one, I believe) was the flavor I enjoyed the most.The door man told us there was absolutely no service provided so we would do our own work. No biggie, I thought. Then someone came through and cleaned up our plates and bussed our table when we finished. A nice surprise!Remember!  You order by the HALF-pound, not whole pound. And the portions are definitely a lot bigger than they look when they pull out 2 pounds of ribs. A word of caution.Another Hogsalt success! Good job, good effort, Mr. Sodikoff."
"The combination of the warm summer night and juicy smoked meats (pork ribs and sliced brisket) with a cold brew was absolutely phenomenal. The line moves fast so don't be discouraged by the wait. Grab a beer, get in line and ponder the menu and you'll be ordering in no time. My boyfriend and I ordered the pork ribs, sliced brisket, macaroni salad and baked beans. Everything was fantastic EXCEPT for the macaroni salad. It tasted liked mushy macaroni covered in mayo, I've definitely not worth the $4.I would suggest trying all three BBQ sauces, but my favorite was the spicy BBQ sauce. I usually love vinegar BBQ sauces but this was way too vinegary for me.Go in the summer bring a bunch of friends and enjoy their outdoor patio."
"Mixed feelings. Ribs and Sliced brisket were decent. Got the frito pie too because there were no hot sides to get.  I would have loved some kind of potato or hot macaroni...but this wasn't an option.  As for the bill, $50 for 1lb of ribs, .05lb of sliced brisket, two sodas and a frito pie.  I felt this was a little steep for what I was getting, seeing i'm even serving/seating/cleaning up for myself.    The ambiance was neat. Very industrial. Interesting setup. Service was interesting.  Friendly staff at the meat counter but when we left, the door greeter was just blocking the door shooting the shit with a friend.  I seemed invisible when I tried to leave...I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think i'll be craving to come back anytime soon."
"Hipsters and meat. I generally try to avoid the new ""it"" spots, for a number of reasons, mainly which involve hour long waits in line to get food on a Saturday night. But I gave in and came with a group of friends. While the wait was there, the food was worth it. Of note - pork belly. Just melt in your mouth goodness. And while sweet pickles may seem like a rip-off at $4, for any pickle-lover like myself, it's a must. We stuck with the $4 Lone Star out of the tub (the madness on a Saturday night did not make me want to fight my way to the bar). Outdoor seating is great, and will be fantastic during the summer months. It can get a bit cramped inside. FYI: we arrived around 7pm to an hour food wait. Opted to sit around and drink beer until about 9pm, at which point the food line was down to about 15 minutes. But by that point, they had run out of ribs and a few other things. So it's your call. I suppose eating at the senior special time is REALLY the way to go here."
"This place was great and certainly a different experience. I loved the ambiance - it was cool, relaxing, and trendy. Unfortunately, I went right before it got busy and couldn't get a drink. I made sure I had my food though! I had a beef rib with an assorted tray of different sauces (ha!) and a side of macaroni salad. The meat was tender and flavorful! The macaroni salad was a good complimentary side. My only complaint was getting a drink. I was put in the mix of those ""just drinking"" and those trying to get one to compliment a meal. But other than that, it was a fun and different experience and I would certainly come back again."
"Love the concept.  Simple menu means everything is good.The brisket is delicious, could've used more burnt ends, but still very tasty.A good sauce can make or break a BBQ joint, their sauce is very good.  Their craft cocktails and beer selection were right on point.  Atmosphere was really gritty and industrial, very hipster cool.  All the way down to the music and the bearded / tattooed employees.  Loved the whole experience.  Enjoy"
"I have a mental catalog of all the places I go to, filed based on with whom best to go (eg girlfriends, parents, a date, platonic dude friends, etc). GSSM officially goes into all categories, except maybe minors. And vegans.You won't see it if you're just driving by, but just walk on the west side of Green St just south of Randolph and you will see a mural and a kind person asking if you're going to GSSM or RM who will then direct you to the proper entrance. Once inside, you will run into more kind people explaining how the line and ordering/seating system works. It's pretty self explanatory, but the initial greeting from the staff makes the place feel so homey and comfortable, as if the decor didn't already do so.As for the food, my favorite was the Thunderbird sandwich. The guy behind the counter described it as ""it's like the McRib, but perfect."" I can't say I remember what the McRib tastes like, the but Thunderbird was pretty perfect. The broccoli salad was also great and made me feel a little less like a complete meathead.Don't forget to try all the sauces!"
Best BBQ in the west loop! Great vibe and good food. If you like bbq this is a place you gotta try.
"Atmosphere is great but the food is okay. Good to try once but will not go back. If you want a place full of hipsters, then this place might be for you."
Pulled Pork!
"Like Green Eggs and Ham... Not appetizingBrisket gritty and toughSauces nothing memorableRibs ok but not repeatableReally a place to drink and socializeIf you truly love BBQ, it's a no fly zoneBeans sides were an after thought with no zest texture taste etc"
"A very peculiar set-up for a BBQ place: cafeteria style. The food was flavorful and nicely done, but not the best ribs I've ever had. NOTE: a full portion of meat is remarkably small - apparently 1/2 lb = 4 ribs. GET A SIDE. The potato salad was delicious."
"I ate here a few weeks ago but still think about it all the time, dying to go back! Sliced brisket was juicy and tender (ugh want right now ). Pork ribs were a bit too seasoned for me but my boyfriend loved them. I also wish the sauces were more varied but they were all decent. Macaroni salad & pickled veggies were the perfect partners for the meat; they also give you some white bread. I even think about the normal sandwich bread sometimes. Everything tasted better there. Ambience was lovely. We really enjoyed the outdoor seating, the abundance of lights, and the rustic decor. We ordered a grapefruit stiegl radler but they ran out after pouring us half the glass so they just let us keep it and order a different drink, nice service! Speaking of running out, like everyones already said, they run out of meats really fast. That was probably our only gripe.. it's a long wait so we had a long time to pick out what we wanted only to find out a feet away from the counter that there's only sliced brisket and pork ribs left. Hope we have better luck next time!"
"I absolutely love BBQ, so when my friend recommended we go there, I jumped all over the opportunity. First thing is that the entrance is cool - it's down an alleyway and the ground is covered in brick. It gives it a cool feeling already.Inside the place has some lofty ceilings and the lighting done in there was nice. They kept things rough around the edges in there, in a controlled way, which all definitely adds to the ambiance and makes it cool in there. Of course since this is owned by a famous restauranteur, the place was pretty damn busy. For some reason, I was expecting waiter service but it's not that. You order your food like you might at a fast food place and then sit down at one of the many seats/tables and eat. The line when we went was really long just a few hours after opening. We waited in line for probably 30 minutes before getting the food.I ordered the regular beef brisket along with the spicy pickles and cole slaw. The sides were good - the cole slaw is definitely not what you may be used to. There's no mayonaise in it which I personally like, but my friend does not. It definitely not for every cole slaw lover. The spicy pickles were good too. The brisket was nice and tender and the parts with a noticeable amount of fat melt in your mouth. The problem is that I don't think the brisket had enough flavor. It was not bad in any way, but I've had better brisket even in Chicago. In my opinion, it needs to be smokier as the amount of smoke was too subtle for me.For that, I'd give the food about a 3.5 as I have had better BBQ, even in Chicago. I'd give the ambiance a 4.5 or 5. It was good and cool. It transported you out of Chicago and into somewhere like Texas in a good way. Would I come back here? Yes, I'd like to try more of the menu (which by the way, not cheap. $9 for a tamale - what the FUCK is this? You have to be absolutely kidding me). I don't think it's worth the wait though, honestly. However, I do think that coming for a drink or two (mine were made well) is at least worth it for the ambiance. This is definitely one of those new hyped up places. I think the lines will eventually die down as the BBQ is not to die for at all, but the ambiance is still cool enough that it will keep the place full for a long time to come."
"Went on a follow up visit last night.Brisket was dry.  Flavorful still but definitely very dry.  Not nearly as good as the first time I went.  In fact, if my first experience was like yesterday's I probably wouldn't have gone back.The Hot Link was tasty and the chicken leg was average at best.  Both fairly overpriced at $6 for what you got.  Still have yet to try the ribs and pulled pork.Sides were blah.  Pickled Veggies were boring.  Cole Slaw had the same general flavor as the pcikled veggies and was unimpressive.  The potatoes salad was also sort of average.  The best thing it had going for it was that it tasted really fresh.Their bar options skew to the expensive side as well.  I know it's the West Loop but it's still sort of steep.  Few draft beer options for under $6 and most cocktails are around $10 to $12.Not sure how soon I'll be back."
"pork belly.nuff said.  friendly folks.  ramen in the basement.  pork belly.  pork belly.  lots of good, spicy condiments, pork belly, and pork belly."
"I'm not even a barbecue / smoked meats person and I am in love with this place. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich and the spicy pickles. Delicious! Atmosphere is cool, too. Most recently I went here with a couple friends and we ordered everything .. Literally everything. And it was all wonderful! Keep in mind this place can get very crowded, especially with the after work crowd later in the week, and it can be hard to find a place to sit.. As it is the type of place where you go up order and pay and bring your food to any seat you choose. Usually in summer or spring they have both the patio and the inside open so that gives more options."
"So much character!!! To get to this restaurant you have to traverse a little alley and find an unmarked door. You are then led into a restaurant space that defies logic. Rusted old metal sheets and construction wood sheets form the walls of this restaurant. Then you look up and see the hundreds of tiny lights hung from the ceiling which provide the dim lighting in the restaurant like a blanket of stars. This combination should not work but it just does! It is casual and classy all at the same time. The ordering process is a wee bit confusing, but a helpful 'host' explained how the restaurant works and also recommended what we should get. Basically everything from the water to the beer to the food is self serve. You walk up to the various counters and pick up whatever you want. No table service... period. You also seat yourself at community tables which were configured rather intelligently to be minimally awkward. My only advice to management would be to turn the volume level of the music down just a wee bit. We literally had to shout to be heard across the table. ... Which brings us to the food... In one word. OMFGreat!! This is some of the best BBQ I have ever had. Everything from the pulled pork sandwich to the baked beans were delicious!I can't wait to go back!!UPDATE: Went back again and still think that most of their food is top notch. However the Chicken leg was undercooked and flavorless. I would not order that again. Bumping rating down to 4 stars. RATINGS:Pulled pork sandwich: 5/5Fire bird sandwich: 5/5Baked beans: 5/5Chicken Tamales: 3/5Broccoli salad: 3/5Chicken leg: 1/5Hot link: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Service: 4/5"
Awesome Pork Belly.   If your a fan this is the best Pork Belly outside of Texas.   The Pulled Pork sandwich was perfect.   Put this place on your bucket list.
"I came here with 3 other people & we all split everything. Everything was delicious & amazing! We got pulled pork, sliced & cut brisket, ribs, sides of beans, cole slaw, pickles & potato salad. The portions of the sides were nice & full too.  It was so good & if we weren't all full, we would get more. The atmosphere was really cool too. I can't wait to come back to this place again!"
"Green Street Smoked Meats has me seriously thinking that the narrow alley and a giant metal door in the West Loop is a gateway to Texas where brisket is king. As you walk in, you could be convinced that you may have. With the nostalgic lights strung on the ceiling, sink tubs of Lone Star Beer under a cardboard sign labeled ""Beer $4"" next to a bar well stocked with whiskey, and the quick smell of smoked BBQ should make it feel all real. Opened in February 2014, within three months this place has become a hit with restaurateur Brendan Sodikoff whom created Gilt Bar, Au Cheval, and Doughnut Vault. Just like Texas, the beef brisket is king here. The perfect ring of smoke is clearly seen after they slice to order the beef brisket next to their 12,000 lbs smoker. Twice now I have ordered the Pork Belly and twice now the people in line behind me said they were on the fence getting Pork Belly until I ordered it and saw it sliced. Yes, pork belly is not your typical Texas BBQ but get it. You will not be disappointed especially the Pork Belly being smoked than how you might have had it before at other restaurants. Other things I have had were Hot Links that were good but nothing special. The Hot Links had some major spice and favor though. Pork Ribs were okay. With the Pork Ribs, they were clearly smoked but I am a fall off the bone rib person. I suggest the Frito Pie especially if you have NOT had a Frito Pie before in the South. The Cole Slaw were a vinegar based slaw. The Sweet Pickles and Spicy Vegetables were brine to perfection. Make sure you try all the BBQ sauces - Coffee, Texas Squeeze, Vinegar, and Spicy. The Coffee BBQ sauce has a nice smoky sweet and happen to be my favorite. Folks there are awesome. The guys that greet you at the door quickly explain how things work. The bartenders seem to spot your thirst before you walk up to the bar. The people behind the counter are awesome and helpful to inexperienced BBQ eaters and there seems to be many coming to this place. Like most of Brendan Sodikoff's creations, the hipsters and trendy foodies are quick to go to all Sodikoff's restaurants. It is apparent when you walk into this place with quite a few wearing plaid to fit in but unsure what to expect when ordering a Frito Pie. Expect to wait in line. A long line but do not let that discourage you! Currently the wait has been around 30 minutes but SUGGESTION - get a drink at the bar then line up. Then get another before you order when you get up front. This place is group friendly and the outdoor seating will make this place even crazier in the summer. The insanity of this place do not bold well with bringing a date but bring a group of friends. Just swing on in soon and get your brisket on so you can enjoy Texas in the West Loop!Food - 5Décor - 5Service - 5"
"Liked it, but not in love.Went here on a Tuesday with a large group after work. It was lively, but not slammed so we were able to find a table for our entire group, which was great.It's a self-serve kind of joint, so we ordered at the counter. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the baked beans. The sides are somewhat limited if you're looking for something hot. Aside from the baked beans, it's mostly just cold salad type dishes. I was really hoping they had Mac n cheese or corn bread, but alas, there was none. For just the two items it was $18, which felt a little pricey to me. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. The meat was tender and I enjoyed the two bbq sauces they offer (one is more savory and the other more spicy). The baked beans were good, but I wouldn't say they were anything special. All in all, if I'm going to pay $18 for a sandwich and a side, I need to be blown away. I prefer other bbq options in the city (Smoque, Lillie Q's, Chicago Q) where you get more for your money."
"This place is interesting.  We went on a Sunday night and had a hard time finding the entrance.  We walked up and down the street a few times before someone helped us out.  The entrance is in an alley, and it's the second door on the left.  In the alley, there are tables and seats for outdoor eating.  Seems like a good place for groups to enjoy some BBQ together.  From the inside, the place is big, but with the dim lighting and the long wooden tables, it feels very cozy.  You order meats at the counter and then order sides at the cashier.  If you're feeling like taking down some drinks, you can hit up the nice bar that takes up a big chunk of the interior space. We ended up ordering some sliced brisket, pork belly, pasta salad, and the pickled vegetables.  Although everything was very good, the star of the meal was the pork belly.  YUM!  It melts as it touches your tongue!  So delicious!The prices are a bit high, but it's good food, so it's worth it.  Try this place out if you haven't already.  You won't be disappointed!"
"I met a friend for dinner and arrived around 6:30...I'm glad that I didn't get there later because the wait was about 50 minutes.After having my ID checked by a very nice guy, he asked me to stand in a single file line that was wrapping around the bar. The vibe was definitely lively and this is a pretty fun place to people watch.You can opt to grab a drink while you're in a line or just hang out and talk with your friends as you inch closer to where you order food. We ordered pork ribs (huge and meaty), pork belly (dry rubbed but a bit fatty), smoked chicken (breast and leg that was very nicely smoked throughout ), broccoli salad, sweet pickles, pickled veggies, potato salad (all sides were generous sizes). We washed it down with a Lone Star beer. I would say that the pork ribs and sides were my favorite, but it was really difficult to carry a conversation because the music was BLASTING. We were literally shouting across the table (forget carrying on a conversation with discretion due to the music and the close proximity of our neighboring diners sitting on the communal tables.). I love the communal tables since helps create a laid back feel, but the dining experience would have been more enjoyable if I didn't have to shout at my friend.It's a great place for groups and for a fun casual night out."
"Meh. They definitely smoked the brisket well but I didn't care for the seasoning. The pork ribs were meaty, tough, and very peppery. The beans were hard and had too much carmelized onions. The decor was an abandoned warehouse style and you get served on trays. Bus your own table."
"Lots of variety of meats on site. Didn't need the frito pie, good but just took up room on my plate and in my belly that could have been used for the great bbq."
"This is a great group spot or even a decent date spot, given that you have an easy-going date ;)Finding this place is a bit tricky. It is right where 112 N. Green Street would be, but you have to walk down the cobblestone path and it is the first door on your left. As soon as you walk in you will notice three things:1) The massive space of this place. It's an renovated warehouse, so very large ceilings and a bunch of community tables2) The loud alternative music. For the majority of our time there, the Ramones was playing, which I absolutely loved. It is quite loud though, which is just something to keep in mind when you decide where to sit.3) The smell of smoked meat! Mmmmmm!The rules of the game are to 1) order a drink at the bar, you can leave your credit card here and keep the tab open for when you order food. 2) stand in line for food - first are the meats, then the sides, then the sauces. 3) find a seat - which surprisingly wasn't very hard to do for a Saturday night at 7:45 p.m.THE FOODAs a caveat, everything we tried was beyond delicious and I can't wait to come back here to try more!1) Pork Belly - The pork belly is surprisingly not overly fatty, which I really enjoyed. The meat is portioned out by 1/2 lbs. I would say 1/2 a lb of pork belly is good enough for 3 people, esp if you are trying other cuts of meat.2) Brisket - Everyone has been raving about this brisket, but I found it to be a little drier than anticipated. Sauce was definitely needed for this one. Maybe we just got the end of the brisket so it was a little tougher than the other cuts? Still really good and I would get it again if I came back. This was a perfect sharing for two people.3) Hot Link - We got one, because they are quite large. This may have been my favorite, just because it was very well seasoned and actually ""hot"". I think it's nice that when it is supposed to be spicy, it actually is spicy!Other meats I would try next time: Salmon and RibsTHE SIDES1) Beans - This is a really great accompaniment to the brisket. It's just how you would expect it with an element of surprise, which is another meat in the brisket. Note: this place is not for vegetarians :)2) Macaroni Salad - Unfortunately I have been depriving myself of pasta/bread/rice, but  the stranger next to me just turned and completely raved about how insanely delicious it was. I wanted to tell her that I couldn't eat it and she was wasting her breath, but I let her continue as I drooled away. My friend liked it a lot, I think that was his favorite side. 3) Coleslaw - This is actually really simple and unique. Instead of that creamy coleslaw Chicago is used to, this one is easy on the mayo and a little heavier on the vinegar/acidity component. The cabbage is also cut a little thicker so you really get that crunch. I think this was totally essential for our meal to cut the thickness of the meat. I would definitely get this again next time!4) Frito Pie - This is essentially a brisket chili/nacho cheese/jalapeno combination on top of a pile of fritos. The brisket is burnt ends (we think), and the cheese is really like that swimming pool nacho cheese. Not totally sure if this was a winner, but it reminds me of the walking taco at Big Star, so maybe they are trying to silently compete? 5) And finally, I believe all dishes come with the famous White Wonder Bread. :::memories:::: I was pretty jealous of the bread, because once again, I couldn't participate in the consumption of this. I bet it would be better if they served some butter with that bread. THE SAUCES1)  Coffee Infused - It wasn't overly coffee-ish, I thought it went best with the brisket.2) Spicy Texas - This was another favorite. Probably because I am Indian and spice is essential for my palate?3) Hmmm - I think this was the original? Not 100% sure. But honestly, most of the meats do not need a sauce at all in order to appreciate the smoke flavor of the meat. I really think it's just the brisket that required a little dab here and there.I can't wait to come back here again, and this time I will be sure to leave the Louis Vuitton at home and bring a hipster tote bag instead!"
"Awesome place. Everything that we ordered was amazing - and we ordered ALOT of stuff. The line was a little crazy, but it made it tolerable that you saw everyone else suffering with you. I can't wait to return to this spot. It was one of the coolest overall restaurant experiences I've had in a while. It's an awesome spot to bring family/friends when they come in from out of town."
Delicious brisket and awesome bbq sauce! Good drinks and cool atmosphere as well.
"The BBQ is average. The sides are average. I tend to rate BBQ places on there moist brisket, spare ribs, and collard greens; everything else is peripheral. The moist brisket was a dry brisket by any reasonable standard, no spare ribs on the menu when I went, and the collards were alright. The smoked sausages were pretty good, as were the baked beans. A cool venue, and a great place for a relaxed early evening dinner."
"I came here last Friday night with my boyfriend after hearing a lot of good things about. After reading a couple other reviews, it seemed like the set up made it crowd up very easy so we headed over around 5:30.We were immediately greeted by one of the employees who explained how it all worked, which was great. Basically there's the bar and the food counter. You can open a tab at the bar,  get some drinks, grab a seat, and then go get some food (and put it on your bar tab). Really easy process, and since none of the lines were too long it went very smoothly. We had our drinks and food within 10 minutes of stepping in the door.I absolutely love the atmosphere of this place. It's in a warehouse type space with string lights everywhere, picnic tables, paper towels on every table, etc. The music was great, loud enough to keep the energy level up but never loud enough that I couldn't hear people talking to me. As for the food? Amazing. Seriously. This is definitely one of the best, if not the best, barbecue I've had in the city so far. I got the pulled brisket sandwich with broccoli salad and spicy pickles. The meat was tender and juicy, with great smoky flavor. I also loved the sauces I chose - Texas and vinegar. The Texas sauce had a great south of the border flavor going on, and it tasted delicious on the sandwich. My boyfriend got the hot link and frito pie, along with potato salad and cole slaw. The hot link was good, and so was the frito pie. I demolished his potato salad.Drinks were good - I loved my Gin Radler but at $10 I couldn't justify getting 2. The beer selection is really good - everything from Local Option beers on the higher end to sinks filled with ice and $4 beer cans. My ONLY complaint was that it took forever to close out. By that time, the place was getting very crowded and I apparently picked the wrong side of the bar to try and get someone's attention."
"""Ugh, I hate hipster restaurants"" says my boyfriend as we stand in line, then 1hr later he ends with a ""We have to come back again tomorrow."" They have a bar that allows you to grab drinks while you stand in line, so not the worst wait by any means.The only problem with this place is how ridiculously full you get. I think I seriously refluxed for at least 3 days afterwards. Regardless, just thinking about the crust on the pork belly and the smoky fat on the beef brisket makes me salivate."
"I thought County BBQ was the cat's pajama's when it came to no-nonsense BBQ in the City, but they have since been trumped.  The Chopped Brisket and Pulled Pork were absolutely incredible and to get some of the pieces with the charred burnt end off the brisket was an absolute treat.  Yes, we heard of the horror stories of a long wait, but we timed it out strategically during a Bears game to walk in and be served our food in no more than 5 minutes.  The Frito Pie dish was a spectacle in itself and the baked beans were also very tasy and had a nice tangy finish.  But, there's not enough good things to be said about the tenderness of the meats here.  I will be going back to sample the ribs and chicken and to enjoy the incredlbly chill vibe around the large bar!"
"Great environment, and phenomenal meats."
"The Thunderbird sandwich is really good, ordered with a side of hot pickles, also tasty. It's  basically rib meat on a bun, this is what the McRib wishes it could be when it grows up.The sides are pricey, but the sweet pickles were worth it.  I ordered food to go. The entrance from the street down the alley is like a magical tunnel and quite welcoming when it's pouring sleet outside."
"While the food is enjoyable, a few quibbles took the rating down a bit.Mains: The star of the show.  We had feef brisket and pork ribs.  Both were very tasty, though the brisket was just a touch dry.  The rub was very good, though the sauces were very disappointing.  Thankfully, the proteins didn't need any saucing. 4.5 stars.Sides: The cole slaw and the pickled vegetables shared a similar flavor profile and were a bit one note -- all pucker, little flavor.  Advice, one is plenty to split and do not order both.  2 stars.Bar: They were out of Tanqueray (though the bartender took a bit of time before he realized it) charged $11 for a vodka tonic, and ended up forgetting the lime.  A vodka tonic ain't rocket science.  1.5 starsService: Ok.  It's cafeteria style.  The people were pretty hipster, but not in a friendly kind of way.  2 starsAmbiance: I wish there were more tables to eat outside, inside it's cavernous. 3 starsConcentrate on the mains and remember get here early, before the line forms."
"I had the pleasure of eating at Green Street for a fourth time this past weekend, and I continue to be impressed by the damn good BBQ coupled with a trendy ""hipster swank"" vibe.  Love the large, communal picnic tables... Large bar with great cocktails, craft beer, AND PBR tall boys... Soft glow lighting setting a nice mood... and rustic wood decor reminding you that although you're on frufru Restaurant Row, THIS IS STILL MAN FOOD.  Do not even THINK about leaving here without ordering the brisket!!Why not 5 stars?  The line for meat is inevitably long and awkwardly snakes all the way around the (huge) room at peak hours.  I don't mind waiting for good eats, but I feel like this could easily be solved with a ""take a number"" system... so you don't have to get into a (much shorter) line until your number is called or appears on the screen (and thus allowing people to relax at all the tables). And, though the meat is fantastic, the sides are ""just"" good.  (Except for the Frito Pie.  I want to bathe in the Frito Pie nomnomnomnomnom)"
This is one of those hidden gems in Chicago! Food the place and staff are amazing! The energy of the place is a really cool vibe! The great service starts from the moment you walk in! They happily greet you and help you figure out what you're looking for. It is a real kind of old-school personal service.
"Really loud music- so loud you can't even talk to the person next to U, pretty overpriced for the amount of food you get, and really poor setup. This place is poorly managed. Tell me how it makes sense to have only 1 person serving and chopping up meat for the long line of customers while 3 people are serving the sides and ringing people up, and 2 people are chopping potatoes...cmon- serve the people and take care of the line should be first and foremost if they want to run this establishment efficiently! Won't be waiting in their long line anymore for overpriced food and then having to carry a flimsy tray across lines of people with loud blaring music to try to find an empty spot to sit and eat!"
"is the meat good? yes, well....actually, if you go at a good time, and the meat hadn't sat on the counter for a really long time, yes. It is definitely good, after all, High Five ramen gets their pork from this place, but is it expensive? YES!!! it is very expensive.....I mean I would really love to go there all the time if the meat doesn't cost like 10$ a slice...it really just comes down to 10$ a slice of smoked pork : /Ok, maybe I exagerated it a little, it is more like 5$ a slice but still.....I get it that they are actually selling ramen quality pork but still......It's just pork....half of it is fat....no offense but please drop the price....I wouldn't expect to walk into a west style joint and eat at fancy restaurant price....I would be really happy to go there constantly if I could get a good meal with 20$ but unless I plan to get a sandwich (which I don't eat often) I really can't walk out feeling full...."
I've been hear a few times and the food is usually good.  It can get crowded and loud if you don't get here early.  The tip jar is a minor annoyance considering you have to get everything yourself and clean up after yourself.
"The food here is AMAZING. It's worth the trek. It's uniformly good BBQ - so good, as our party said, we didn't even need the sauces we brought with us to the table. It's ridiculously loud inside, so go with an empty stomach and a desire to just mow down a meal, not chat with your friends (or grab it to go). And yeah, the whole let's-not-put-any-signs-indicating-where-this-­joint-is business is a bit of self-congratulatory hipster BS.  Otherwise, it would get 5 stars from me. The food is so effin' good."
"Not super easy to find but if you know where RM Champs Salon is it's down that same alley through an unmarked door.  Cool atmosphere - I def enjoyed it.  Going for a very different vibe.  Dark, dingy, warehouse.  Beers in big metal tubs - very college feel.  Not a restaurant with servers.  Have to get up and wait in line for food then bring it back to a table.  The place is huge so I wouldn't worry about not having anywhere to sit.  The bar was packed though and the drinks are very different.  Get the Mezcal!  Everyone was very friendly.  The host & bartender acted more like friends then people who at work.  ""Grab a table, put your shit down, and get in line"" is basically how they talk to customers.  Which I'm not saying is a bad thing but might rub some people the wrong way.  The BBQ was okay.  The broccoli side & beans were really good.  All the meats were good but not great.  Don't mean to hate on the food b/c I really did like the place.  & I love Au Cheval - that is why we had to try Green Street.  Oh & for 2 people not even getting waited on it was $120.  To me that is pretty expensive BBQ.  I would go back for a Mezcal Marg but might skip the dinner portion."
"I've never been to Franklin's in Austin, but I imagine this is what it's like.  Line out the door, simple menu, and smoked meats that's THE BOMB.  We got literally one of everything (sausage, pulled pork, brisket, ribs), as well as the sides.  The people working there were great as well.  As an example, we happened to get one of the last hot links of the night, and it was about 3/4 the size of a normal one, and they just gave it to us for free cuz they're just cool people like that.  For the record, I would've paid full price for that thing.  It's so good we couldn't get enough, and sounds like no one else could either. Don't forget the sides either.  Their cole slaw is really legit, as are the potato, broccoli, macaroni salads, and the pickles. It's a bit hard to find at first, but just follow your nose."
Cool place good BBQCool musicCool atmosphere Would recommendNot #1 but when you factor in the coolness factor it's a big winner
"This place is fantastic!  It's expensive.  However, it's got a fantastic atmosphere and the tenderness of the meat really sets this place apart from other BBQ joints in the Chicago area.  The sliced brisket melts in your mouth, the rib meat falls off the bone, and my friend said the shredded pork was some of the best he's ever had.  In terms of sides, we ordered all 7.  Here's the order in which we liked them:  1) Broccoli salad, 2) Macaroni salad, 3) Baked beans, 4) Spicy pickles, 5) Sweet pickles, 6) Potato salad, 7) Coleslaw.  The broccoli salad is really good.  The potato salad had too much garlic, and the coleslaw seemed like just like a shredded cabbage salad with little flavor.  For the sauce ... skip all of them ... seriously.  You don't need sauce here and they're not that good.  Before you put any on your meat, put a little in a cup and taste it.  The spicy sauce tastes like molasses.  The Texas sauce tastes like chili powder.  The vinegar sauce is probably the best and wasn't bad on the pork; The pork tastes great on it's own.  No comment was made about the coffee sauce.  I'm still disappointed by the coleslaw.  I like to put it on shredded pork, but it wasn't right.  It was so good I would go back in a second!!"
"Most places do not live up to the hype, this one does. Been to BBQ places all over the city, and the pulled pork here was the best. LOVE the hot BBQ sauce and vinegar sauce! Only took one star off for the poor choice of sides.. $5 for pickles? Really? Besides that.. Amazing! Love the atmosphere as well!"
"Yesterday a group of friends and I came to GSSS to celebrate my bday. Not only was the food insanely amazing but the staff was fun and helpful. At first I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to grab a table for such a large group - but the staff helped arrange people to accommodate us. Must get the brisket, potato salad, chopped brisket, and ribs!!! The chicken was good too- it was very moist. Don't forget to load up on all the sauces- the coffee one was my face."
"I am a HUGE fan of this place. This place has it all - great character and mouthwatering food. The inside of the place is simplistic with communal tables, exposed brick, and strings of light. Immediately when you start walking down the alley the smell of deliciously smoked meats is hard to ignore. We got the tamales to share. For my meal I got the cubed brisket with broccoli salad. The tamales were just okay. BUT the brisket was so tender and had amazing flavor. It was fall apart tender and the BBQ sauce was just my style. The broccoli salad had raisins, almonds, and a mayo type sauce. It was very good. The meal also came with pickles which were good. They also have 4 different kinds of BBQ sauce. I loved the hot one. This is my new favorite BBQ place in the city!"
"I don't want to start any fights, but this was the best brisket I've ever had, even better than Stubbs in Austin. 2 nights later I had a dream about eating GSSM brisket. That was the whole dream, eating the brisket."
"My boyfriend is in love with this place and would give it ten stars if he could. We came here on a Friday night around 9:30pm. It's kind of hidden, there's a huge painting on the brick wall with their name but it's easy to miss. The decor is amazing. It has an industrial warehouse look with unfinished paint. Hanging lights all around with wooden tables. We were so excited but upon entering we were told they just ran out of food! They've only been open for 3 weeks so I'm sure it won't happen again. Luckily, ten minutes later they had scrounged up some food for the starving patrons. Grab a beer from the buckets, wait in line, order, pay, and grab a table. We had brisket sandwiches, tamales, Frito pie, broccoli salad, and potato salad. The brisket is chopped thick, tender, and not too fatty. My friend said it's better than brisket he had in Tennessee. The bread is so soft and thick but holds together well. Yum. Frito pie is essentially nachos, nothing extraordinary. Tamales are soft and the chicken is so flavorful. Potato salad and broccoli salad are amazing. My boyfriend says the ribs are delicious, super thick and super moist (that's saying a lot because he is a very loyal Twin Anchors man). He also said the pulled pork and hot links are amazing. There are four bbq sauces, I liked the Texas one and chocolate one the best. Towards the end of the night they were handing out fresh baked chocolate chip cookies... which were amazing. Not sure if they do that all the time or only because they ran out of food earlier. Very very fun vibe. A fun & eclectic crowd. I would definitely come back for dinner or even just drinks. Huge bar area."
"I was very excited to see a new bbq place in the area. The ambiance and feel from the restaurant is just awesome. I love the hip Texas style bbq restaurant. Everyone was friendly and high energy. You walk in and see a huge ass line but then you walk past the plates of amazing looking bbq as you get in line and decide this MYST be worth it. Then, when you realize you can get a drink at the bar the line wraps around, the long wait doesn't look too bad. My test of any bbq place is the brisket. They didn't disappoint. Probably the best brisket I've had in Chicago. They even offered me the burnt ends which were delicious. The bbq sauces they offer are also perfect Texas bbq style sauces. Loved them. The beans were rich and had bits of meat in them which I always prefer. The red potato salad was the best I've had at any bbq place. Ever. Everything was delicious. I can't wait to try the turkey or ribs next time. I took one star off for the super long wait. Not sure what they can do about that but I wasn't super thrilled about standing for 40 min In line. If they can speed up the line a bit, they would solidify a 5 star review. Go here. You won't be disappointed."
"Go Meat Meat Meat!  Yeah, I admit it, I'm a meat lover as is my husband.  Besides being a meat lover, I am a BBQ lover.  My favorite is a North Carolina style as I love a vinegar base.  I have 3 key things I judge my BBQ on.  1.  The Meat itself2.  The Sauces3. The SidesTonight we tried pulled pork, brisket, baked beans, potato salad, and topped it off with some wonder white bread.  For the meat.  The pulled pork was pretty wet, but not with flavor.  My husband was a fan, but I would not choose this again.  I didn't get a smoky flavor it just tasted like someone maybe spilled their water on my pork type of wet.  At least it wasn't dry but I can't say this was a winner for me.  The sauces helped.  The Brisket had some great flavor and we were both big fans of this plain and with sauces.  The only knock I have on this was it was a little fattier than I like.  It came close to Smoque, but due to the high fat content, Smoque remains my favorite Brisket in Chicago.  For the meat portion of the meal I give them a 3 star rating but want to try the ribs and hot link next.  On to the sauces.  We tried them all. Spicy- not so spicyTexan- this was good and flavorfulVinegar- was a fan although not even close to a true NC sauceCoffee- Ok.  For the sauces- I would pick Smoke Daddy and Lillie Q over Green Street for the sauce but they were good.  Sauces get a 3 starSides!  Sometimes the sides are the most important part of the meal.  There selection was pretty good herePotato Salad:  Awesome!  It was creamy and flavorful and the potatoes were cooked perfectly.  Baked Beans:  These were my favorite of the night and Green Street just took over as #1 baked beans in Chicago in my eyes.  Yup, they beat out Smoque for me on that one.  Overall 5 stars for the sides we tried, but I didn't see cornbread on the menu and I believe a good cornbread is a key part of a good bbq meal.  Maybe I missed it?  I do like the wonder bread option, but still longing for a piece of cornbread.  Overall, I give Green Street a 4.  Its in the neighbor (major plus), the staff was really friendly, the beer was good, I loved the lights strung through the place along with the cafeteria style service.  A little work on some of the minor things and this could be my favorite bbq joint in Chicago!  Either way, welcome to the neighborhood!"
"This place has done away with their wait staff and in a way it's cool and a way it sucks for the money you are paying. I also hate waiting in massive lines winding around this dark and dingy place. I was not super into the raw/cheap decor.  The one thing I totally hated was the music. I heard bohemian rhapsody 3 freakin times and the rest of the queen album. I am a fan of queen but that's way too much. Also the bartenders are very distracted with changing the record. The music selection sounds like typical wasp/douche rock selections with snoop dog gin and juice slipped in which didn't make sense even tho I'm somewhat of a fan of snoop too.  Also the sound system was clipping and sounded like total shit on top of the dirty records/needles playing with pop and skips.   It was nails on a chalk board to my ears! Ok I'm done bitching about the atmosphere now onto the better part.  The food was slightly short of amazing.  I would give this BBQ a 7.5 out of 10.  The sliced brisket was good and had a nice char too it but my piece was a little fatty for 12 bucks.  The chicken legs were good too but the portion was a little small for 6 bucks but it seemed the chief knew that and threw in a little extra compared to others. I guess he could see it in my eyes or read my mind haha. The hot link was perfect and the price was decent at 6 bucks. The beans were spot on too for 4 bucks.   The spicy pickle side was bland and could have had more of a kick if they were gonna call them spicy.  Come on this is a BBQ place u can make it spicy.  In the end this place is an interesting experience however, the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I found that take out is the best way to experience it and for that price I'm not all that interested.  My bill was 44 bucks and I had a PBR tallboy to wash it down with and I tipped 4 bucks because I had to bus all my own dishes etc..   Fix your stereo and your music.  Send a waitress around the line to take drink orders and hire a few bus boys to bus the tables I don't feel like doing that shit.  I feel Like this place is penny wise and pound foolish with it's staffing.  I would rather support an upscale place, with upscale prices, that pays an upscale staff, and doesn't make u do everything yourself.  That's why I go out to eat to be waited on for that price..."
By far one of the best experiences I've had living in Chicago.. This place reminds me if Soho in New York. The west loop is beautiful and I'll definitely be coming back
"To be perfectly honest, I like High Five Ramen better. They're located within the same building but downstairs and were having their soft opening last night when we went. Highly recommend everyone check them out while you're there!As for Green Street Smoked Meats, the line is pretty long, as I'm sure most other reviewers have pointed out. I think it was longest around 8-9pm when we were there so I'd recommend going earlier or later. You can drink while in line though, so time passes by pretty quickly. It is pretty dim and loud in here but I think it suited the atmosphere.The food we got was 1/2 lb of the beef brisket and 1/2 lb of the pork belly along with tamales, macaroni salad, baked beans, potato salad, and broccoli salad. There was five of us total and this was the perfect amount for us (although we ate some ramen downstairs before this). The brisket, pork belly and tamales all came in 5 or 6 slices/tamales. The reason I said above that I preferred the ramen place is because the pork belly that was in their ramen is better than any of the meats we got here. But between the two, I preferred the pork belly over the brisket. The tamales were ok and there was a variety of BBQ sauces to try with everything. Out of the sides we got, I liked the potato salad best, followed by the baked beans, broccoli salad and macaroni salad. Overall, it was a fun experience. The food all looked good so I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the other things on the menu!"
"heavenly! Food and drinks are both top notch. Recommend going during the week when it's less crowded. Although you will still probably wait, just not as long as you would on a weekend. I dream about this place at night. It's that good!"
"Hands down, best BBQ in the City...I LOVE THE BEEF RIBS.  Pork belly is fatty as expected...I would avoid it again.  Everything else is superb.  Yes, the wait can be insanely bad...avoid 6-8pm if at all possible...I go right when they open and take it to go for the family.  Service is fine...they arnt working for tips and the place seems like a bunch of friends said ""we make great BBQ and we like to have fun and drink...let's open a restaurant"".  I have NEVER had bad service or been rude to...one time the guy in front even took my stroller so we didn't have to push it around...I would say that's better than some expensive restaurants in town!  Seriously...if you like food and just care about the food then go here.  If you're looking for a 3 hours ""dining experience"" go to NEXT."
Great food with a very chill atmosphere inside. Bring an appetite. Fun spot to grab a few beers and have some solid bbq at the giant communal tables.
I can smell the delicious smoke as soon as I step out of my pad. The smoke pulls me to GSSM like in...what's that cartoon?The place is always bustling. The staff at the counter is awesome! Always energetic and enthusiastic. Bar staff is more mellow but professional.I recommend everything on the menu - they're all perfectly cooked and smoked but could use a spicier rub.
"BRISKET BRISKET BRISKET is a must! Super tendor and delicious! Portions are out of control big and the sides are fairly typical for a BBQ spot. Atmosphere is different. Almost like they bought a warehouse, gutted it and put a restaurant inside, but it's genuine and unique!"
"Come when is warm outside so you can sit outside.Came here on a Wednesday night around 5:30. There was no line which was nice. We ordered the brisket, and pulled pork and broccoli side and potato salad side. The potato salad was my favorite, best I've ever had, so good. The pulled pork was also very good. The brisket was alright, but I didn't like either of the bbq sauces that they had. I prefer the bbq sauces at Chicago Q much more. Overall great place to come, I wouldn't wait 1 hour for food though, it's not that good. The atmosphere and drinks and bar are awesome though, it would be an awesome happy hour spot to come with friends."
Oder by the half pound with sides $4/each. Picnic table in and out. Cool casual. And food excellent.   Best barbecue in Chicago.
"Let me preface this by saving that I'm from Kansas City originally, so I'm pretty picky about my BBQ. I've been to quite a few places around the city and I have to say this is one of the best BBQ places I've been to. Love the decor and way the line snakes through the front of the building. The seating process is nice because it prevents people from camping out for too long.  From an ambiance perspective I really enjoyed the place. I had the brisket and my boyfriend had the pulled pork. Brisket is a notoriously tricky meat that is dry more often than not. GSM does brisket right. The meat was juicy and not insanely fatty or greasy. A little dip of sauce to accompany and each bite was fabulous. The pulled pork was honestly nearly as good as my pulled pork mecca, Oklahoma Joe's in KC. The bread they serve with the meat is a little dense but sweet and goes well with the meat. All in the all the meat has a great smoky flavor which is what makes BBQ so damn good. It wasn't super greasy and the sauces they offer were actually pretty good. I believe we got broccoli, baked beans and macaroni salad as our sides. The broccoli salad was great and my bf and I fought over the last bite. The other two were okay - candidly they weren't really memorable as I'm more concerned about stuff my pie hole with delicious BBQ.If you need a BBQ fix definitely check out this place."
"Whoa....where has this place been all my life?First, the ambiance is incredible. It's got a Texas Smokehouse vibe with the raw floors, picnic table seating, and communal paper towel rolls. Be ready to stand in a pretty long line if you're coming for dinner- the place gets packed easily.I recently went with a friend and ordered the brisket, the pulled pork sandwich, and off a whim, a half pound of ribs. Everything was incredibly tender and had an incredible, smoky flavor that I won't forget anytime soon. The in-house barbecue sauce just took it over the top. The picnic table seating served us well, since we were sitting elbow-to-elbow- with other diners and were able to compare notes on the food. Next time, I'm definitely going to get the Frito Pie and the Warren Moon (Brisket and hot link sandwich). Food has a way of bringing people together and this place proved that.My only gripe was that they didn't have mac and cheese as a side, something I've grown accustomed to having at barbecue joints. It's a minor one though- not enough to dock a star.The price was a little high, but hell, we ordered enough food to take home and it was all just as good the next day."
"Great spot in the West Loop, where I was really not expecting to find such a great BBQ place. BBQ in Chicago can be tricky, there are a lot of places that disappoint. I can safely say that Green Street is worth stopping by. The vibe is more ""hip"" than your typical BBQ place, but you never feel unwelcome. Picnic table style seating really encourages getting to know your neighbors. Have patience, its cafeteria style and the line gets long. Thankfully you can grab a beer at the bar before you stand in line. Hot Links were perfect, pork belly really good as well. I think I preferred the chopped brisket to the sliced. If you want BBQ in Chicago, its worth the wait."
"Because Green Street needs more reviews? No, because this place and the staff working there are special. The tough part of yelping is having unexpected wondrous moments happen, and then ruining them by yelping and making those magnanimous actions the expectation.  So I will simply say that I talked up this spot to my friend Veeral, who has visited me in Kansas City for a gluttonous BBQ crawl, and traveled around his native Texas for another legendary one.  At the end of our Tanta/Purple Pig/Green Streets mini food crawl, we scarcely expected to even be able to eat.  When he complimented the brisket as the best he'd had up until Texas a few years ago that was more than expected.  When he then dug into the pork ribs and exclaimed it was better than anything in Texas?  Shocking and deserving.  Chicago has always had adequate BBQ.  It's fair enough but the lack of great bbq explains why i shelled out far too much money for my July 4th ceramic smoker.  Green streets smoked meats is light years from anything else in this city, far surpassing the improving but uninspired Smoque standard.  Get there before midnight and enjoy a patio full of ecstatic and satiated veteran Chicago patio hoppers."
"You have to take this place for what it is. It's a counter service seat yourself environment. We came here with a large group while out for work in Chicago. Probably not the best idea because of the nature of the place but we dealt. The food was unbelievable. Pork belly was probably the best I've had. Staff at the door was kind of rude and just was kind of annoying but easy to look past and I'm sure with how packed the place gets, wasn't in the best mood to start."
"Wow, this is some good BBQ.  Tried the pork belly and sliced brisket - the pork belly was my fave. Melt in your mouth good.  Had ordered a side of baked beans and then saw the macaroni salad as I was checking out, so I ordered that too!  Both were delicious but I could not stop eating the macaroni salad.  I think sometimes BBQ meat and BBQ beans is just a little too much BBQ sauce for me.   The salad balanced it all out.  My husband would not stop raving about his pulled pork sandwich and even said he 'liked it better than Smoque"". Ahh-blasphemy! But yeah it's a close contender for sure, but quite a bit more expensive (probably due to the location). I like the casual atmosphere: order at the counter, help yourself to a table. (Beware though that they do not let you reserve a table while your spouse/friend orders.) Would be a little easier and more efficient if you could order your beer with your food, but you can't. So, be prepared to juggle your tray and order your beer or be sure to dine with someone to help carry it all."
"Wow.I had heard about this place from a friend, and I've been craving good barbecue for the past few weeks, so I dragged a friend out here on a Wednesday night. After slinking through the rain from the bus stop, we stepped into an extremely loud and crowded restaurant. The restaurant itself felt like an abandoned warehouse that was decorated with string lights and made to feel even more run down. It had a cozy, yet loud atmosphere, with a mixture of rock and heavy metal music blasting. There is a bar in the center of the room with a number of local beers on tap. The seating is at communal tables, and you seat yourself after you get your food. It was a bit jarring at first because we didn't really know how the place worked, but we decided that if there was such a large crowd there on a Wednesday night, the meat had to be pretty good. So we walked to the end of of the line, which at that point had started curving around the bar in the center, and began to wait. It took about 30 minutes to get to the front of the line, and we were SO glad we waited.Between the two of us we tried the Roasted Chicken Leg, the Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Macaroni Salad, and the Broccoli Salad. While the sides were good, next time, I will probably skip on them in favor of ordering more meat. Each of the meat dishes we tried were just incredible. The brisket was so tender that it literally melts in your mouth. Literally. I probably didn't have to chew if I didn't want to. The roasted chicken leg was really well seasoned. And the pulled pork.. urgrghhh. Probably the best pulled pork sandwich I've had in my (short) life. If I'm not intriguing you yet, here were a few gems my friend let out throughout the meal:""I don't even know how to describe this brisket. Like, The Purple Pig is amazing. But this place transcends amazing.""""What did they do to the cow to make this brisket so tender. Did they just beat it with a stick over and over?""Five stars for awesome atmosphere and great barbecue. Needless to say, I will be back in the near future."
"We're fast becoming regulars and this is my new fave BBQ joint.   The BBQ here is just that delicious.  Meats served by the  1/2 #.   We've tried pretty much everything.  Our staples: the brisket, pork belly, smoked chicken leg, potato salad, sliced bread.  For our fam of 4, we usually order a pound of the brisket, 2 chicken legs and a  1/2 pound of pork belly.  Smoked and tender, it always keeps us wanting more though we still go home with leftovers.There's a rustic charm to this Texas style smokehouse...plenty of picnic table seating (make sure to bus your table when you're done), faded brick, stringed lights...lovely patio space outside.  Kid-friendly, our two kids love it here.  Walk up counter service and the line can get crazy especially on the weekends, but they move fast.  Expansive bar in the middle of the place and easy to grab a drink if waiting in line.   Tons of drink options - whiskey and beer especially.   Soft-serve ice cream.Staff is great - efficient, helpful, and friendly.We'll be back often."
"As someone who isn't a fan of BBQ, this place really gave me a change of heart. The smoked chicken was absolutely perfect, just the right amount of flavor and tenderness. One of the bartenders was incredibly rude, but I don't think that poor service is  systemic. Overall, I was very pleased."
"Green Street is a solid place for BBQ in the city without outrageous prices. Great atmosphere with a very cute outdoor area. However, I think because of the hype surrounding this place, it was just ok for me. (Tip) We arrived on a Friday at 5:15pm and there was zero wait and plenty of empty tables. Ordered food and sat down all within 10 minutes. I ordered the sliced brisket, potato salad, spicy pickles, and elotes. My favorite dish was the elotes- a corn side dish. Delicious and creamy. Definitely worth a try! Everything else was good, but not spectacular. Overall, I wouldn't oppose going back, but I'm not dying to return this instant. I still have yet to find a BBQ place better than Black Dog in champaign, IL!"
"Amazing!!!! I love that it feels like a literal ""hole-in-the-wall"" after that walk through the alley! My boyfriend and I had the pork belly, chopped brisket, coleslaw, and the frito pie! I'm not a huge fan of brisket, but he loved it! I was blown away by the pork belly!! It was mouthwatering!!! The BBQ sauce was also a great accompaniment to the meat. The coleslaw was vinegar based, and was perfect with the fatty pork belly! The lady serving sides let me try the potato salad and coleslaw to see which one I preferred, which was awesome! The frito pie was also great! I haven't had one of those since moving from down south and it was nice to experience that again! Hogsalt does a great job with all the restaurants, and I am a huge fan!!! We will be back! Maybe even this week!!!"
"Best brisket I've had, next to the brisket in Austin, TX.  Delicious hot link, pork belly, and broccoli salad.  Their spicy bbq and vinegar sauces are great.  Awesome atmosphere - the indoors is like a rustic dim lit tavern with tons of character. Love the outdoor area - string lights, picnic tables, kid and dog friendly."
One of my new favorite place with the fiance! Food is excellent. Atmosphere great. Staff is very nice! Pork Belly and Chicken are to die for. I always order a take home for next days meal.
Awesome music great vibe and the best pulled pork I've ever had. The wait is short and they have open seating. Which makes the atmosphere so much better.
Food is over rated. Beer is over priced. Food line is too long. Lots of better places.
"This place is overpriced and stupid.  Its packed, looks dumb, and the crowd is so pretentious.  The place is too dark, I hate the tables, and the grimy look they are going for.  Also, the line to get food was out the door.  Really? Hire some staff for the prices you charge. I will never return."
"Came here on a Wednesday night with two of my girlfriends. We barely had any wait time which was awesome! Everything is self-serve and communal here (including the tables) which made things very efficient/easy.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and shared the sides: macaroni salad, coleslaw, spicy pickles, potato salad, and baked beans. Sadly the pulled pork itself was a little dry and bland... Coupling this with their four selections of BBQ sauce gave it a little more flavor, but still mediocre.My friend ordered the beef brisket sandwich which I would highly recommend over the pork. Very tender meat. Lots of flavor. You won't need the extra BBQ sauce.Some might find this place a bit pricey (they charge you separately for the meat/sandwich and sides), but the portions are generous. Definitely go with a group of friends so you can share the sides!Ambiance is loud/casual--good for an outing with some friends. Wouldn't recommend it for dates."
"Their pork belly - to die for. This is probably the best cooked non-Asian pork belly I've had. I'm always skeptical to get this newly popular meat because many places just make it so greasy and non flavored. Green Street does it right, so you HAVE to get it. I'm going back just for their pork belly.The brisket and pulled pork sandwich were plain - nothing special, but the sauces made them very enjoyable.  The spicy sausage definitely has a kick and is full of flavor.I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw that came on my pulled pork sandwich - the cabbage was a little too raw. I did like that it wasn't a heavy mayo-based slaw, but I think I'd like my cabbage stewed a tiny bit longer and a little softer. Or maybe just cut the cabbage into smaller slivers.The other side we got was the pasta salad - a solid effort. Not too much sauce and the pasta was just south of al dente - which is what I like. None of the other sides really appealed to me, which was kind of disappointing. I'm not a huge fan of broccoli salad; the larger-than-one-bite-chunks of potato in the potato salad were intimidated; and the pickled veggies didn't look like they were worth $4. My lack of interest in the sides is what dropped this down one star.I like the relaxed vibe of this place and I like the whole ""wait in line and get your food"" - it goes with the whole laid-back feeling. They want you to feel like you can get up at any time, grab more food, grab a drink, etc, without waiting for someone to wait on you."
"Green Street provides perfectly acceptable barbecue in an awesome space. If I lived or worked in the area, I'd probably frequent the place. But in a city filled with good restaurants, I don't see this as being worth a trip.First - I think the wait is overhyped. Even if you're waiting 30 minutes in line for food, there is no waiting after an order is placed. Food is in your hand. Contrast the line to a typical restaurant, where you will likely wait 30+ minutes from the time you sit down to the time you have food in front of you.Green Street is awesome for large groups. Order a bunch of meat by the half pound, grab a seat at a community style table, and dig in. Very convenient for sampling the menu and not worrying about splitting bills.As for specific food items - I found the pork ribs to be the winner. The sliced brisket was good, but didn't wow me like a great Texas brisket would (I recommend Micklethwait for anyone who gets down to Austin). It was fairly moist, but the ""crust"" outside the fatty piece wasn't the most flavorful rub. The chicken was okay - perfectly pleasing and moist but nothing to get overly excited about. I loved the frito pie as a side.It's good - better than Q, but still nothing that will compete with Southern BBQ. Come with a large group and you won't be disappointed, but I don't think you'll be clamoring for a return."
"Let's just say, that if I could give it six stars I would. Everything we tried was delicious. We had the chopped brisket, the chicken leg, and pork belly. The chopped brisket was amazing. The staff was super friendly and this place has a great atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place!"
"I am a BBQ fan, but sad to say I have never had authentic KC or Texas BBQ so I would definitely not consider myself the authority on it. But I do know when food tastes good. This BBQ tastes good. Went with a group on a Thursday night. Place is super cool inside. Loved the look and feel. Rolling down an alley to an unsuspecting door. Picnic tables for seating with a 360 bar in the middle. Grabbed some drinks at the bar and waited in line. Counter service, choose your meat, your sides, you pay, you sit, you eat. Simple and fun. I have heard it can get quite crowded but for 8:00 on a Thursday night we waited about 20 mins and that was harmless. Food was awesome, we pretty much got everything on the menu and shared (salmon was already sold out). The sauces are nothing to write home about, but not going to knock them on it. I want to go back for sure.What to Order:Chopped Brisket Smoked Chicken Leg (everyone in our groups favorite)Frito PieBroccoli Salad"
"This place is simply amazing! The smoked meats are made to perfection and the sides have an astounding flavor as well. Tried the brisket slices, the hot link and the smoked salmon. All was delicious but wasn't exactly crazy for the salmon although they did provide a really good tartar sauce to go with it. Only other disappointment was that they're were no beef ribs available at the time to try. Aside from those minor let downs this place is instantly a new favorite! The staff is also very friendly and personable! I'll be back asap!"
"Went here on a weekday right after they opened and there was no line and the place was pretty much empty for the whole time we were there. For two females, 3 types of meat and one side was plenty of food. I love me some brisket and GSSM's brisket is spot on. You don't even need any of their extra sauces. In my opinion, the pork belly portion was generous, but a little too rich for me. I'll pass on that next time. The beef ribs weren't on the menu that day so I settled for the pork ribs. They were decent. I didn't care for the plain white loaf bread. The broccoli salad was good. If only they had some mac and cheese, though. Cool place, fun environment, great brisket, and awesome in the summer. I will definitely be back."
"Meat. Booze. Repeat.The main thing that makes Green Street Smoked Meat stand out is their lack of options, it's more meat focused rather than say a bbq place that offers pulled pork nachos or some sort of mac n cheese. This is not a dig, the meat was delicious and I distinctly remember holding off on the bbq sauce because I was in meat heaven. Beyond the meat options that come in Half pound portions and a few sandwich options, the sides are your classic picnic sides, coleslaw, potato salad, bakes beans.  Coleslaw was more vinegar based than the mayonnaise concoction I was expecting, it paired nicely with the brisket sandwich I ordered.The drinks on the other hand were a bit under whelming for their price. 12 Bucks a pop for house cocktails and top shelf liquor. Not bad for the cocktails but a good 4 dollars more for my Bulliet and Coke. And with the bar front in center in your wait for food, expect to get more than 1 drink. The space has a great feel to it, like a barn but you know.. a classy barn. It's definitely something different. The staff is helpful but you wont see them much. Overall a memorable experience and nice addition to Randolph street."
"Oh man, look at those photos of bbq and stuffs, you know you're at the right place. This is definitely my meat spot. Get the brisket! It's kinda hard to find the entrance and it's not cheap can be a long wait but totally worth it. They have lot of beer and whiskey selection too."
"Pork belly is amazing! So flavorful and the pork fat melts in your mouth. For all the great reviews, the sliced brisket was disappointing. It was dry and not particularly tender. Spicy pickles and potato salad sides were very good. The crowd is young, hipster. There are plenty of picnic tables to eat outside on a nice evening. There is no wait staff. The service is the equivalent to Chipotle. In which case, I think $16 for meat and 1 side is a tad expensive. But, I'd return for the pork belly."
"Green Street Smoked Meats has some mouth-watering BBQ in a unique restaurant space.  If you like meat whatsoever, I guarantee that you will enjoy this place - especially as you waddle away from the restaurant after your meal.GSSM has a cool atmosphere right off Randolph with awesome outdoor seating, but you MUST arrive early if you want your choice of seating (cafeteria style bench-tables). Overall, I really enjoyed the food - although the sauces and sides were not my favorite.The Sliced Brisket is moist and savory - let's be honest, I would highly recommend it every single time.  The Ribs were tender and had the right amount of flavor to make them well-cooked.  Add all that to the fact that they have a full sized bar and you're good to go!My one piece of advice: Make sure to get an extra wet wipe or two from the counter! You'll thank yourself after dinner."
"I never thought I would get Texas BBQ while in Chicago, but I'm glad my friends brought me here!!  Green Street has one of the coolest set up of any restaurant I've been to in recent years.  In a huge, open warehouse, these guys not only capture the look but also the taste & flavors of all things BBQ.Brisket, broccoli salad, slaw, spicy pickles, 4 varieties of sauce...all fantastic!  Cool bar with fun bartenders, fun overall staff too...outdoor seating is great, as well as the warehouse dining (string lights throughout) with plenty of picnic tables everywhere.If you want some authentic Texas BBQ while in Chicago, cross the river & get your hands messy at Green Street!!!"
"Blows my mind that what started as cheap food for the masses turns into a tray with some meat and like four sides that costs $150, and there were only 3 PBR tall boys involved, no actual drinks.  $17 without tip for a Woodford Reserve on the rocks ordered separately...what the fuck is up with that shit???  We are not in Tokyo.  The atmosphere was a bit clubby and douchey with a river north sports bar vibe (think American Junkie) but they were blasting Tom Waits as if to make some weird point that they were down home and cool.  Food was great however, and the beer was cold."
"This place was my personal hell.Insane crowds, terrible, loud metal music, communal seating, greasy bbq.In addition to the feeling of ""if a fire breaks out here, I will die,"" it also resembled...prison. Yes, prison. The food on the trays. The stack of plain white bread they give you. The picnic tables and benches. The black walls and boarded up windows.No thanks, I'll pass."
"This place is so over rated, and the food is so average. The website claims to be open until 2:00 AM - Not so. We showed up at 1:15 and they told us the kitchen closes at 1:00. This is the least of my concerns!The food: so uneventful. No smokey taste at all! The pulled pork was  total mush, and drowning in way to sweet sauce. It was like BBQ baby food! potato salad: equal to the stuff in the deli at the Jewel: Yuk!brisket - just, average. so average.Ribs: they were out of them, but I just cant find myself going back for anything. I just cant!I look around and can see why people think its ''cool'' ... but is it really? Its so over stated and so planned and predictably trashy - '' just like a texas roadhouse'' - SO WHAT! Is this the new vogue decor we are looking for? Is this why the public flocks here?!The whole place just smells like big investor dollars that came in and over planned the ambiance with '' cool'', having no motive other than to cash in on a trend ... paying no attention to what great BBQ  should be. Tourist trap. And, its really expensive!Please, try so many of the other great places if you want great BBQ:Smoke DaddySmoqueFat Willie's.... even Whole Foods on Kingsbury has outstanding BBQ options, complete with burnt ends and superb mac and cheese!"
"Fabulous social atmosphere!  Very high ceilings with a faux gritty look.  Big communal dining benches, great outdoor seating.  Comfortable and spacious feel.We got there around 9:30pm on a Friday, and the pork belly and beef ribs were all sold out, so we were deeply distraught.  Fortunately the sliced brisket was still available and it was to die for!  Best brisket in Chicago.  Pork ribs and hot links were ok...I've definitely had better."
"This place is phenomenal.  Smoked meat ... and smoked meat... and ... the Brisket is the star, followed closely by the pork belly, but honestly even the ribs, though I like mine better, are worth getting ... sides are truly only eh ... the frito pie was popular."
"I just tried going there for the first time the other night based on a friend's recommendation, but I didn't stay because the line was very long and moved extremely slowly.  I literally moved less than 5 feet in 15 minutes and would have probably had to wait at least 45 minutes more before possibly ordering, so I left.Whoever designed the place wasn't very smart about the size of the kitchen and ordering/paying areas, because the restaurant has plenty of space for indoor and outdoor seating and there were a ton of empty tables both inside and outside when I got there, despite the fact that there were at least 70 people in line for food.  Wouldn't the owner want to have his customers enjoying their food rather than standing in line the whole time waiting to order?They clearly should have made the kitchen and ordering/paying areas much bigger so people don't have to wait in a line for an hour.  This shouldn't be like waiting in line at an amusement park for a roller coaster.So while the food may be very good, that's not exactly very important if it takes forever to order it."
The brisket sandwich and frito pie are must-haves! I also loved the atmosphere. I wrote a blog post about my experience here:fromchicagowithlove.weeb…
barbecueeeeee!!! plus a really cool venue
"Ok, the BBQ here is pretty good.  Awesome even.  Why the so-so review? I went with 2 other guys, we ordered 4 main courses and three sides.  We all left asking each other where can we eat next? A double portion of ribs wasn't even a half slab!  It's ok though, you get free Wonder bread with every order.  That surely makes up for it right?  Also, what's up with the decor?  Looks like they took a dingy old warehouse from the movie Saw III, blasted everything with a pressure washer, and let it drip dry.  Then they found some sort of paper mâché zombie looking thing and made that the centerpiece.  Art!  Voila!  At least there is outdoor seating."
"Man what a cool place! Great urban warehouse feel. Obviously if you have read prior reviews you stand in line for a while that wraps around a bar, which makes getting drinks easy. Definitely a place to go if your not in a rush. The bbq was awesome and reasonably priced, the brisket is on point for sure. Oh and definitely go hungry!"
"Love the place, great food, operations SUCK. Waiting in line as soon as you walk in for 40 mins for food (they ""prefer"" you get your food before you get a table or even a beverage!). Please get table service. The value equation of a great space and delicious food drops considerably with the outrageous food line and having to fight at the bar to get a drink every round. Also, you need two credit cards too if you want to keep a tab open at the bar--one for the tab and one for the food. C'mon guys...hire some wait staff!Note-if you avoid peak hours (weekends--7-8:30pm) then the line will probably be significantly shorter.  But still a pain having to go to the bar every time you want another round."
Green Street Smoked Meats is excellent for great food at a reasonable price in an authentically executed southern and casual environment. The briquet was very tender and the staff was very personable and friendly.
"I don't understand the appeal. The place charges sit down restaurant prices, but has all the atmosphere of a high school cafeteria. Communal tables, plastic knives and forks and you bus your own table. All while 10 hipster employees in skinny jeans and beards stand around talking to each other at the front door. Put these twits to work.Food was good, but not good enough to tolerate the lack of atmosphere, poor non-existent customer service and price. Trendy place in a trendy neighborhood. All hat and no cattle, if you will. 2 years tops."
"My baseline metrics for city (i.e. not a standard Southern shack with a giant pig statue out front and kitch-y knick knacks arrived at via dirt roads with a phantom banjo riff playing in the air) bbq are as follows: 1. Kickass brisket or ribs but preferably both (I've learned to let the pulled pork thing go at this point though it's my spiritual favorite) 2. Solid to impressive bourbon collection 3. Smoke must cling to my skin or hair even through at least one next-day shower.Green Street delivered on all three counts, with the added benefit of being in what is now my favorite Chicago neighborhood, and having a hidden - speakeasyish flavor to it.  I took my team there for a sales meeting, and we ordered everything on the menu/board.  There were literally no misses.  Major kudos to the frito pie, beef ribs (second fav ever to Blue Smoke in NYC), daily pickle offering, and the pulled pork sandwich which was spec.  If I had to nitpick/defend my lack of 5 stars - the non-spicy sauces were pretty ordinary, and I like to have a good mustard-based slather for my pulled pork in particular.  Our sauce procurement agent failed to find one."
"GSSM, you win on atmosphere. 5 stars! You've done it! It's cool! People are flocking! Hipsters are combing their stashes! Order another round of PBR for everyone! Is this place a movie set in disguise?It could have been the night. Maybe we were too late, I understand, it's BBQ and there's a window of time to eat it (which is pretty large), but the food was just ok. Forget about the food though, let's talk about being there. This establishment is a real visual treat. It seems like the place where all the hipsters died and went to BBQ heaven. While we were there all we could talk about was the perfectly rusticated decor. We probably sounded like interior design school drop outs: ""Do you think that brick wall was there, or did they re-fabricate that brick wall to match the perfectly reclaimed wood wall? Sometimes Irish bars import bars from Ireland, maybe this place imported real BBQ feel from someplace south?"" Everything looks so perfectly established here, is it old or new? It's kind of confusing being here! It's lovely and wonderful and even the patrons look perfect and are having the most perfect time ever. The plaid to threadless-t ratio is perfect. The faux-hawks to inventive shaven facial hair ratio is perfect. My exaggeration to sarcasm ratio is equal to the Lone Star to PBR ratio. That doesn't make sense! Neither does this place! Arg, I can't wrap my head around it. It's perfect and pretty BBQ because it looks just like a place that's been there forever! How is that possible? BBQ is supposed to be the opposite, isn't it? It's the Vegas of BBQ joints. Anyways, I need to go here again, check out some different menu items have some good times with friends and enjoy it's perfectly rusticated decorum."
"This is an awesome meat house. Highly recommend the brisket, potato salad and broccoli salad. The atmosphere is chill and the staff welcoming and helpful with menu recommendations. A must stop if you're in the area and interested in smoked meats. Try the spicy BBQ sauce!"
"Brendan Sodikoff has a lot of a lot of nerve opening up Green Street Smoked Meats. Do you realize how many people are going to be late to shows at City Winery waiting in line for BBQ? Do you realize how many people thought they were gonna buy a good ass lunch tomorrow but now have to forego those plans because you stomped your ass into the West Loop and demanded everybody's last coin? Do you understand, that just a few months ago, people were mad at you because you had announced another reconcepted deli, only for you to just show up with a new BBQ restaurant in the West Loop serving the best BBQ in Chicago? Whew, you a bad bitch. God bless you. God bless your mom for birthing all that greatness from her. God bless God for even allowing you to be here. I mean shit."
One of the BEST meals I've ever had in Chicago.Believe the HYPE.Try EVERYTHING!
"Very chill vibe. Decided to check this place out since I'm a fan of their other restaurants, Gilt Bar, Au Cheval, Maude's, etc It looks like you've stepped into Texas in a rustic warehouse, dim lights giving the effect of a starry night. The brisket is the best. It's juicy, salty and moist. The pork belly is fatty but uhhhhh so delicious! The sweet tea cocktail is a great, easy to drink complement to the meal."
"The four stars is for the food. If they have something called Thunderbird on the menu when you visit, you gotta try it. The guy at the door recommended it, I forgot to ask what it was, deboned short ribs maybe, but it was phenomenal. Other usual suspects like brisket and sides are well done also. Wasn't the biggest fan of the ambiance though. I got the feeling a room full of corporate marketing gurus got together and sold some investors on the idea of a hip urban bbq for the west loop crowd, and this is what they came up with. Loud music, check. Industrial setting, check. Hipster bartenders, check. Communal dining, check. Still they hired the right people to do the menu and cooking, so well done!"
"Had such a great time at Green Street! First of all, I'm not comparing the food quality to something I theoretically *could* get closer to the Mason-Dixon line; we're in Chicago and this is a damn good barbecue place. Because what they offer is a hot commodity, though, be prepared to wait a bit. The serving style is as follows:1. wait in a line (that may or may not circle around the bar, depending on the demand)2. ogle menu items from afar (unless they're ruled out as unavailable by an imposing red line)3. order directly from the butchers (ogle meat more closely)4. choose your sides cafeteria-style5. pay and exit with your tray to eat on communal benches.It was my second time here, as the first time we tried Green St. it was a bit late in the night and they had run out of ribs. Although we were disappointed, the amazingly succulent pork belly and sliced brisket more than made up for it. Second time here, we purposefully came earlier to try to snag some ribs but lo and behold, they were off the menu again :( we ordered our meal and enjoyed it again nonetheless. The seasonings and rubs here are SO flavorful - you almost don't even need any extra bbq sauce!Upon walking back in for dessert (the soft-serve is so key!), we noticed that ribs were back on the menu... Of course at this point we were already SO stuffed, but I lamented out loud how the ribs had become available after dining here, since we purposefully came back a second time just to try them. One of the butchers overheard my lamentation and threw us some ribs in-kind! I can't say how much this altered our perception of Green Street. While meandering through the line, you can't help but feel like just another patron in a hipster bbq joint, but I thought this gesture really elevated my experience here. I'll definitely be back :)"
"Being a native Texan, this joint run by some boys from Houston is just what Chicago was missing. Amazing ambiance and set-up. It's classic self-serve style Texas BBQ joint. I can now proudly say this made me feel right back home in the Lone Star State (by the way they serve Lone Star = bonus). BEST BBQ IN CHICAGOBrisket is sliced right in front of you in order to retain all of that delicious juice and maintain the melt-in-your-mouth moisture of a well cook brisket. Make sure to ask for some burnt ends (gifted to me for being a fellow Texan). They are literally top 3 burnt ends I've ever had (1. Salt Lick 2. Franklins, both Texas treasures). Pork belly was also amazing. Great smokey flavor with the natural salty finish. MUST get the baked beans. Literally taste like they were cooked cowboy style. The potato salad was excellent, and loved the broccoli salad. Next time I'll have to try the cole slaw. Looks a little different from traditional Texas slaw, but I bet it's amazing. $4 Shiners and Lone Stars. That is all. Go here and enjoy the amazing hole-in-the-wall vibe and savor these boys carrying on the great Texas tradition of BBQ."
"It was Blackhawk playoffs on a Tuesday.  We needed to find a hip joint to accommodate 6 people for a small birthday dinner at 7:30....without a TV.  I'm Go-Blackhawks all day long, but who wants to fight with people over seats and drinks for a special occasion?    This was the perfect opportunity to try out the popular GREEN STREET SMOKED MEATS.  We were not disappointed.  Entrance through an alley bears a graffiti clad brick wall showing the way.  You know those places that you step through the doors and you feel like you've been teleported to anywhere but Chicago?  That's this place.  It's pure rustic loft with worn barn beams and ambient lighting.  There are no windows to see out of, so it's easy for the mind to escape.  Greeter at the door gives you the run down.  Order your food through the cafeteria line.  Brisket, Ribs, Potato Salad, Frito Pie, Cole Slaw, etc.  Grab your sauces.  Find your seat.  Grab your drinks from the bar.  Easy-peesy.  Seriously, the beef ribs, frito pie and potato salad were my favorites.  Every person raved about the food they chose.  You can share the $4.00 side.  So splurge on the meat if you can.  They offer a plethora of sauces for your dipping fancy.  Prices for the meat were somewheres between $8-$11/ 1/2 lb.  So, you can kind of gage how much money you want to spend.  Outdoor seating aplenty in the aforementioned cobblestone alley.  I expect long lines for this place this summer.  Overall, staff was super helpful.  The only difficulty was in the bar service.  You can order from all sides of the bar, so at times the bartenders were a little unaware of people waiting around to order drinks.  And of course, given the meal, we can always drink faster and drink more.  I'm a fan and will return!"
"I was impressed by the atmosphere here. It really got me in the mood to drink and eat bbq. Seating wasnt too tough to find, which was nice. I tried several diff items on the menu, and heres me feedback - porkbelly and brisket were 10/10. The ribs were 8/10, I've had better but they were good. They give you bread on the side for free, so we made some sandwiches. Finally, the various bbq sauces were all amazing.Then I had sides. The frito salad was great and all, but this was something I could grab at taco bell - I wouldnt say this was unique to the restaurant. I was a bit dissappointed by the coleslaw, but the people I went with liked it.. But then the baked beans were like my favorite ever! Get those.This is a place I can see myself going often. Good vibes in there and the food was solid."
"This place has EXCELLENT BBQ, however probably not my fav BBQ place in Chicago, though (but that's for another review). They have a tidy (limited) variety of meats and sides, but enough to slake any appetite.The vibe in here is great. They bought an old warehouse, dropped in some Christmas lights, a great, old bar and a smoker and made a terrific place to pickup a pint, come here with a large group and enjoy yourself. They even have a cool alley where you can sit and eat! It reminds me of a larger Big Star (in wicker park).It's usually slammed with people and will have a long line, but that's half the fun (if you don't mind the wait). The line wraps around the bar, whereby you can just walk up, grab a beer from the ice chest and wait/stand/drink until you put in your food order and just pay when you're done! Great place to bring friends if you don't mind the wait or noise.I really like the inside and the vibe of the place. Cool people work here and are super friendly / helpful.One star off for the wait and fairly avg. BBQ. Excellent food, but just not mind-blowing."
"I really like how this place is set-up. The bar is in the middle where it is easy to get drinks throughout the night. It is a great place to hangout with friends and eat some good BBQ. You wait in line for the BBQ and then you take it to a table. It is above average BBQ for Chicago, not the best. Be prepared to bus your own trays, no service staff."
"The atmosphere here is electric! I loved it! The set up is great - order at the counter, grab your meats, sides and beer from the tub, and find a spot at a communal table.  Hopefully it's nice enough outside to grab a spot in the cobblestone alley. Great meat options - the pork belly was probably my favorite. We also got the brisket and ribs, plus one of each of the sides. It's just some good, hearty, simple yet delicious grub. We'd just come from High Five Ramen next door and still had room for plenty of meat and sides. The bbq sauce with a kick is worth trying - it had a perfect level of kick and spice to it. I'd definitely recommend for a fun BBQ spot in the city."
Fun picnic communal seating. Atmosphere was positive vibe. Brisket was great. Lacking on a bit of variety in menu...but fun BBQ.
"I never thought I'd find Texas BBQ in Chicago.  Guess i was wrong.  Having lived in Austin, TX the last 11 years; i must say I've found brisket that represents Texas brisket.  Def. hate to compare regional bbq but hard not to having lived in the BBQ capital of the world.I'd def. come back here.I tried the Beef Rib and Brisketand both were excellent. Expect to spend at least 20 a person."
"A solid 4 stars - the meat at this place is YUMMY!  I had the chopped brisket and despite the fact that GSSM offers BBQ and Spicy sauce, my meat was juicy and delicious - it didn't even need any sauces.  My date had the sliced brisket - also as good.  The sides are decent too.  I also like the vibe of the place - hipster, but with a friendly (unpretentious) attitude.  I'm a long-term resident of the 'hood and I'm super excited we've gotten more visit-worth establishments in the West Loop. One star knocked-off for prices (tiny bit steep) and having to bus your own tray.  Will def be back!"
"I died and went to bbq heaven! I have had the brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken leg, pork belly (it's like meat butter, completely melts in your mouth), ribs, broccoli salad, potato salad, baked beans and ice cream.......everything is amazing! I just miss the tamales...... on the pricey side for bbq in the city but but always quality and delicious food."
"Ok, you should probably just ignore my review. I didn't eat here! (we had just finished gorging ourselves at Girl and Goat). And I just had a beer, so no point in reviewing drinks. But the atmosphere was awesome, the service quick and friendly, and everything looked and smelled amazing."
"I stopped in on a Wednesday night around 7 with a group of friends and it surprisingly wasn't too crowded. Upon finding the entrance in the middle of an alley, a person at the door kindly explained the ordering process to us since it was our first time there.You order your food à la carte at the counter and then find a place to sit. I ordered the brisket and pork ribs and got a side order of potato salad. I didn't so much eat the BBQ as it melted in my mouth like smoked meat flavored candy. There were several sauces available but the smoked flavor was so good, I cast them aside so as not to taint the flavor. It was roughly $10 for half a pound of each kind of BBQ which seems a bit pricey but the quality is definitely there. This is the Freddy's BBQ Joint of the West Loop (I SWEAR I saw someone who looked like Kevin Spacey sitting nearby).Just don't make the same mistake I did and order sides (which were about $4 each) instead of just ordering more BBQ. It wasn't so much that the potato salad I got was bad, but for only a few more dollars I could have gotten more brisket or ribs to clog my arteries at home. Also, you don't win friends with salad (potato or otherwise).  The restaurant itself appears like someone smuggled in a Texas backyard BBQ (minus the casual gun use) with its picnic tables, rolls of paper towels, beers in sinks, and strings of Christmas lights on the ceiling. Apparently, Brendan Sodikoff (of Au Cheval fame) acquired this warehouse and decided to open a casual BBQ restaurant so he wouldn't have to decorate too much... and it works. The speakers blare alternative and classic rock so it's definitely a unique atmosphere as long as you don't mind having to share a picnic table with complete strangers. Also, as a plus, the bathrooms are really clean. Extra points are awarded for the old-timey Western smoked mirrors. In conclusion: Mosey on by, ya'll."
"The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is they had no mac and cheese and that is by far my favorite bbq side!The brisket and pork were both delicious, and the cole slaw was very refreshing - a lot of times I hate it for being soggy with too much mayo.I also loved the bar. We came in and my bf got a drink while I waited in the food line. Afterward we headed to a table to dine, but after we finished we wanted another drink so we gave up our seats to head back to the bar.We got really lucky and ended up with two seats so we hung out for a bit. It's a great atmosphere and I love that they have a guy with an actual record player that provides the music for the whole place. It was so refreshing and fun not to listen to the same music that you hear in every other bar/restaurant in the city.I can't wait to go back and sit outside sometime now that the weather is nicer!"
"Feeling like my taste buds just hit the culinary jackpot. Super friendly staff, fresh food, delicious meats. Love the ambiance, totally wasn't expecting the cool seating areas inside and out as we turned down the alley, although we could smell some wonderful barbecue about a block away... My only regret is that we didn't find this place sooner."
"Went here a few nights ago with my wife. I would not go back.The food was pretty good and I have no complaints in that department.However, I did not like the feel of the place. We had to wait in a line for about 45 minutes until we could order.  I was surrounded by hipster guys who wore longer beards than Jesus Christ.  You can order from the bar while waiting in line so we did. They had a weird beer menu (hipster) so I ended up with a bikini something beer.  It tasted like nasty beer mixed with lighter fluid. I didn't even finish it. My wife ordered some type of hard cider that tasted like a nasty dry white wine. Neither of us finished our drinks. Once we got the food we sat down at a picnic table with some other people.  It felt pretty weird. When we were done we had to bus our own table. It was an experience that I would not repeat."
"Holy cow! What a cool place. Quite the combo - weird location, cool ambiance, and fantastic food. I am not really familiar with Chicago geography, but I think Green Street is in the meat packing district. Just outside of downtown. The building is an old warehouse with no sign. You walk down an alley to get to the entrance. Once inside, feel free to line up for some great bbq. We opted for pork belly, beef ribs, brisket, baked beans, and spicy pickles. Washed it all down with a pitcher of local IPA. The meats were delicious. All had a nice, thick bark on them. Great smoky flavor. The baked beans included chunks of brisket. Pick whatever sauce you want - Spicy, Coffee, Texas, or Vinegar. All were good. The place itself is very cool. Very much still a warehouse with picnic tables and a bar in the middle. Definitely worth a look...N*joy"
"AMAZING. Plain and simple, I felt like I was in an episode of True Detective. The ambience of this place is awesome. Playing vinyl through the loud speakers too? 100% awesome!We sat at the bar and had pretty solid service. Bartenders were super nice and awesome to talk to. After getting the seats we went back up to order which was added to the bar tab bill we had started.I went with the chopped brisket and my wife had the pork ribs. Smoked to perfection. The ribs had a rub on it that had some heat to it but was really tasty. The sauces were all great. I liked the spicy one. We also ordered the spicy pickles and potato salad. Both rocked. I will be returning sooner than later. With the outdoor option we passed on the way in, I can't wait for warmer weather to sit out there while sipping on tasty beer and eating deliciously smoked meats."
"Wow...this place is pretty great. The pulled pork is excellent.  A few of the people I was with raved about the Thunderbird sandwich (it's like a McRib, but with real ribs).  I'll def get that next time."
"YUM!!! That is all I need to say. The meat here is so flavorful and delicious. My boyfriend and I eat a lot of BBQ and this by far is the BEST!! We had the brisket and the pulled pork which was soooo good. My favorite sides were the pickles and the potato salad. Also, the guy that was working behind the counter was so nice! He introduced himself as Justin and answered all of our questions on the food. Got to love a place where the service is just as good as the food :) I can't wait to go back!"
Gives Smoque a run for their money... The brisket and ribs were fantastic... Cool place too...
"Relaxed and casual BBQ, just how it should be.Get the pork belly, sweet pickles, and white bread to soak in their sauces. Awesome beer selection including local option!"
"Down an alley in the West Loop - just off Restaurant Row on Randolph, lies Green Street Smoked Meats.  Poorly marked, but reasonably easy to find.  It's a pretty large space, with the string lights that are all the rage right now across the room.  We got there after 10, so while it wasn't super crowded, the music - a good range of indie punk was blaring (and I mean blaring).  GSSM is counter service only with the bar on one side, and the food on the other.  Since we were hungry and responsible adults, we headed over to the food counter....We each got a protein and a side - I went with the sliced brisket, Sara with the hot link - a nice contrast.  The brisket had decent smoked rings and a nice up front smokiness that was short lived.  The slices we received were either on the excessively fatty side of issues or on the overcooked dry side.  The flavor was excellent good smoke rings, and a nice immediate smokiness that hits quickly, but doesn't linger.  However, the texture just wasn't there.  I will add the caveat that we were eating at 10 at night, so I'll blame the texture a bit on that, and will probably give it another go earlier in the day at some point.   The hot link on the other hand, was a super plus.  Good texture, very meaty, the right amount of saltiness, and a decent kick.  There are four sauces - a coffee sauce, texas, vinegar, and spicy.  The coffee sauce was a dark, medium thickness sauce with a good savory flavor.  The Texas sauce was pretty unimpressive.  The vinegar sauce was quite different than a classic NC vinegar sauce - thin, but had a very distinct tanginess to it, and the spicy sauce had a nice slow heat to it.  The sides were a mixed bag as well.  The broccoli salad was fantastic and a must-get if you go - Stirred in with a light mayo and mixed with raisins that give it a gentle sweetness, and some seeds (maybe sunflower)  add a nice texture contrast to the broccoli.   The spicy pickles were cut too thin and lacked any bite - meh.  The orders we got satieted us pretty well - for about $40 it's a bit pricey, but not absurdly so.  Since we're in the middle of a kitchen reno - we decided to get some carryout for the next day - an order of tamales and a couple beef ribs.  And then we got home, and felt like we had to try a bit while it was still fresh...The tamale filling a great flavor and what appeared to be a tomatillo sauce that had a bit of spice to it, but the corneal to filling ratio was waaay too high - $9 for 5 tamales in an order ain't bad, but gotta fill it up a bit more to make it worth it.   And then I took a few bites of one of the beef ribs.  The rub is heavy on the peppercorns, but instead of having a bity spiciness to it, the addition of the green and white peppercorns, along with some sugar gave the ribs a subtle sweetness that complemented the deep beefy smokiness of the rib.  Can't wait to dig into the rest of this tonight, and would order these over the brisket anyday, although I can see myself going and ordering both.  Green Street is solid, and a great place for a group outing given the setup.  I'll echo most other reviews in that the music doesn't have to be THAT loud - it was almost deafening, but they probably do turn it up later in the night - and I promise, I'm not getting THAT old either.   As I've said before, good BBQ is has a lot to do with consistency, so it'll take another visit or two before I make a final verdict, but so far, so good with GSSM - my preference is still a bit towards County, but that may change with a few visits....Pics and more BBQ porn on my blog:eatinginchicago2014.word…"
"Second time here! Bottom line: Good weather = long lineTime: 8:45PM on a beautiful spring weekendService: Friendly - Long line is due to the servers giving each customer their undivided attention. - They don't rush you even though there is like 50 people behind you. - Genuinely concern on whether or not you get the service you deserve.Food - Melts in your mouth- Main: Brisket, chopped brisket, pork belly, and hot link. Brisket was a bit dry for my taste, but the chopped brisket was smothered in sauce and was to die for. Don't get me started about the pork belly. Literally MELTS. As for the hot link, all the right spices. It was spicy, but I couldn't stop myself. - Sides: Spicy pickles (comes with the chopped brisket), baked beans, cole slaw, and potato salad. (Pretty much listed from favorite to least favorite.) Something about the spicy pickles, maybe because I never really eat pickles and the flavors were on point. Not too much heat and really refreshing after the hot link. The beans and slaw were good, but I found Smoque to have made it better. I think it had to do with the meat in the beans. It was a bit tough and not soft enough for my taste. As for the slaw, I'm a fan of slaw that is light and not too heavy. This slaw was so light that I didn't really taste any seasoning. It was sort of bland. The potato salad was my least favorite because there wasn't much flavor there either. It was more bland than the slaw, if that's even possible. Overall, take FULL advantage of the patio. Beautiful atmosphere and delicious bbq. I love the patio because the ambience reminded me of Houston because it felt like you weren't in a big city. This place is tucked away in the West Loop, but you don't hear the hustle and bustle of the city."
"We loved it.  My fav guy, Brendan S, making my fav food--BBQ.  Just returned from a trip to NYC and this place has a very triBeca/LEC feel--although about 5X the size.  Typical Brendan S music blasting at my prefered sound level.  Place was packed, but fun--they move the people through.  Great place--looking forward to sitting outside as well.--They were out of beef ribs at 6pm--I  however,have had a lifetime of flanken in my youth."
"Still four stars even though we waited 40 minutes. Go early or later if you don't want to wait. Plenty of seating now that the outside is open. I'm still missing some cornbread or Mac and cheese or something. Hot link and pulled pork are awesome. Skip the chicken, it's a lot of bone and nothing special."
"For Chicago, this BBQ was pretty good. For a Texan, it was meh. The atmosphere was great and reminded me a bit of home. The food was not bad. Ribs were cooked well but there was a hint of sweetens on the rub that was weird. Brisket was really juicy and tender. If probably go back for that. Sides were alright. I'm more of a potato salad, creamed corn, fried okra kinda girl. No what I'm sayin'?"
This is an awesome place for BBQ.  The food and the ambiance is top notch.  The Brisket is a must and I believe they have the best brisket in the city.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back for more BAR NONE!!!
"It's like Austin, TX in here.  It's cool, I like it!  I'm sorry I mean kewwwwwl??? No I don't have a beard.  No I'm not a hipster.  No I'm not a hillbilly.  WTF what am I? This place reminds me of that free concert thingy tv show live from Austin or whatever that's on wttw.  Food was just ok.  Nothing like outstanding or great.  Service is PITA cuz you gotta work!  Only this guy could get away this, here.  Smart guy.  closed on sun, mon.? Wow wet dream.  What is this bankers hours?Food wise, It was actually a bit of downer because I absolutely love his food at all of his other places. I think there's huge room for improvement in his BBQ sauces.  2 of sauces I wouldn't eat period n by default I liked the 3rd because the other 2 I wouldn't even consider n I had no other choice.  I might like snort the 2 sauces if I run outta blow cuz I dunno what else to do with it.  Coffee I did not like,  I think vinegar is the one I liked but waif sht, I dunno, I forgot.  Why am I even writing this review? Fooook me, sorry ai ai ai. Vinegar or spicy is ok.  Coffee is crap from what I remember.3 stars seem harsh so I give it unenthusiasticly limp 4.  It's def not a blonde guys sorry.  Maybe redhead wo all the freckles.But it's Austin Texas Y'all, heehawww or is it yoyoyo these days, I dunno anymore. You go n tell me."
"YEE-HAW!!! Hells Yes.  This place rocked my socks and my boots off.I'm from Texas so my expectations and standards on places like this are high... and they got it 90%-95% right.  Well done overall.Entire experience was great from the second we walked in until the second we left.Greeted at the door by Corey who was helpful and explained the ""rules and regulations"" of how to order, where to sit etc.You can grab a brew out of the ice in a tub next to the bar.  Very cool/fun.  It doesn't take much to keep me entertained so grabbing your own beer out of a tub of ice makes you feel involved, like you're at a real BBQ.  Loved it.Wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the place was immaculate (yet was supposed to look ""worn"")...  very well done decorators.The drinks were delicious and strong.  Giddy-up.The food....  Wowza.  We had the pulled pork, brisket and pork ribs.  Just LOOKING at the brisket I said ""I won't even have to chew this, it will literally melt in my mouth""... and it did.  Amazing and tasted like home.  The sweet pickles were fantastic as well.  Have to try the spicy ones next time.  I ate way way way too much meat and don't regret a second of it.Only 2 small complaints. A. The music was a little loud (It was just a bit annoying.  I can deal with some Devo or Boomtown Rats now and then.  I like to rock out myself BUT....  It just didn't fit the mood of the place.  B. This is my #1 concern and they HAVE to address it. The sauces.  They are NOT memorable and it will kill this place if they don't get it right.  As a Texan, we judge our BBQ on the meat AND the sauce and the sauces were all forgettable. They have 4 sauces...  1 was tasty (About a B+ grade),  2 were average at best (C-) and 1 was bad (D-).  I can't tell you which is which because they are all forgetable. Sad face.The ambiance, service, originality, food, environment, staff, drinks will keep this place around for a while.  It is great!  But to be a real home run they have to fix the sauce situation ASAP.  Go here!"
Only three stars cuz the door man was a pushy asshole and told demanded us to get food while we were trying to sit down with our drinks first.
Wonderful. Get there right at 5 when they open. We had a large party with 3 kids and the communal tables and divey-atmosphere were great. Great prices too. A tip: grab a drink before you get in line (have someone hold your place for you) and sip as you wait.
"""The transition to more causal dining with BBQ by Hogsalt""Disclaimer: I am a fan of Hogsalt. I like all of their venues, but they are mostly sit-down places with waiter-service. With the change to self-serve and ambiance of a steampunk-like barn, that means more focus is made on the quality of the food. Here is my ranking of the COMMON proteins you find @ Green Street (Best to Worst).Pulled Pork, Ribs, Brisket, ChickenUn-common proteins found here:Salmon - If I only get to choose one meat, this would be it.Pork Belly - Need I say more?Sides: I highly recommend the potato salad and coleslaw (vinegar based)Sauce: There are plenty of selection (texas, coffee, spicy, vinegar) but there are two problems. One, I can't really differentiate between the sauces. The spices and other ingredients are just too mild. Two, RIGHTEOUS Que DON'T NEED SAUCE.This place ties with Smoque as my go-to BBQ place in Chicago."
The food is awesome: The chopped brisket sandwich is amazingly tasty. The beer selection is first class. The people are awesome: I lost my train pass under a table on a Friday night. The staff found it and kept it safe until I came looking for it the following Tuesday. Now that's customer service.
"I find it to be a complicated task to review this place: do I compare it to other Chicago barbecue places or do I compare it to all the great barbecue places in Texas, Carolina, and Memphis?  If you use the former, this is a 4 star place, but I elected to do the latter--because when I bite into pork ribs, I can't erase memories of all those great backwoods barbecue places found in the South.  And when I do that, I can't say this place is more than mediocre, unfortunately (take it however which way you will).Anyways, the ambiance is best described as Williamsburg meets small town Texas, if you can imagine it. It is ""Sodikoff-esque"" if you've been to his other places like Bavette's, gilt bar, etc.  It's a large open space emulating those old shacks in small southern towns complete with long picnic tables both inside and outside.  I actually rather like it.  However, they require you to stand in line, order your food, pay, and then fight for space at a picnic table.  I think this works in a small town, but in Chicago--I'm not a fan. Now, how about the food?  As I said before, if you view it in the prism of Chicago: this is probably one of the best spots in the city (if a little overpriced).  On the spectrum of all barbecue places, it's merely average.  The brisket and ribs were a bit too tough and dry for my liking, which wouldn't be a problem if the sauces weren't all forgettable--they have four: coffee, vinegar, spicy, and ""Texas"".  The exception is the pork belly: I know pork belly is a cliche at this point, but that was some fatty, melty goodness...the beans, potato salad, and frito pie were ok, not worth 4-6 bucks each.So overall, it may seem like I'm being overly harsh on this place, but in reality this is a fine experience (though an expensive one at probably 20 per person not counting drinks).  It brings that all-American pastime to an area that was missing a great BBQ jointThat said: Call me a traditionalist, but doesn't it seem strange to hipsterize barbecue, that all-American blue collar activity? But then again, if Sodikoff did it to donuts and steak, why not barbecue, eh?"
"Holy holyshit. The ribs are the best! Meaty, tender.....lots of meat. The sauces for the meats.....ahhhh, I'd like to take a bath in the Texas one. I hate potato salad, have never liked it. Have tried many kinds. I LOVE their potato salad. The put eggs in it and some other fun surprise thing that makes me love it!!! Normally, I go to smoke on Pulaski, which makes great pulled pork & their smoked chicken is awesome. But green street has mastered the ribs.....sincerely."
"Went here at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. We just missed the rush, so we only waited about 10-15 minutes in line. We ordered the pork belly, chopped brisket sandwich, frito pie, and coleslaw. The chopped brisket sandwich was amazing!! The coleslaw added a refreshing light touch to a meat-heavy meal. The pork belly was super tender but almost too fatty for our taste.Great ambiance (picnic style tables and lights strung overhead) and reasonable pricing ($34 for all of the previously mentioned food). Would definitely return."
Yes for the drinks! My boyfriend and I went for a quick drink and they were amazing! The bartenders are awesome! Go get a Chartruse Mule!
"Green Street Smoked Meats is SOOO Austin, TX cool meets Fulton Market trendy.  The atmosphere is loud and fun, but not overwhelming or stressful.  It has big communal dining benches and great outdoor seating.  I went on a Tuesday night so the food and drinks wait was about 15 minutes, with plenty of seating available.  Must note that the male staff rocks some serious mustaches   I tried the Brisket, Pork Belly, Hot Link, Frito Pie, Macaroni Salad, and Spicy Pickled Vegetables - loved it all!  The portions are huge and great for sharing.  I am definitely going back!"
"Chicago's equivalent to NYC's Hill Country.. FANTASTIC meat, great drinks, Randolph Street location, plenty of nearby parking, great casual place for a fun night out with friends, your love or just stop in by yourself and slam some ribs and margaritas. Its not cheap but its not expensive either. Expect to pay $20 for dinner and about $12/cocktail.  I'll be back over and over and over again!"
"Had the best time here. Listen to the person at the door, grab a drink, and enjoy some of the best barbecue in the city. The guy at the door the night we went was the coolest."
"Up there with smoque being best BBQ in the city. With green street smoked meats opening this year , the buzz and hype is real and the lines are mad long. Best tip I can give is go with a group of hungry ppl, order everything and go when it's raining. Chicago had some heavy rain during dinner and I passed by the joint. I saw no line!  You go in, to the left and down the stairs is ramen and street level is the sweet smell of BBQ.  There is a central bar in the middle to grab a drink while in line, there is a sink full of beer too that you can get for $4. Had the beef ribs and happy that they sell them. I only know of honkytonk and smoque that has beef ribs. The pork belly was good but I rather have it roasted vs smoked. The brisket was on point and a must. The potato salad was great. If they are selling elotes get two of them. And try all of the sauces, I like the spicy one.  I will go again but right away when they open their doors or during another storm :)"
"The perfect barbecue place: the atmosphere is comfortable and clean, the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating (without being over the top or phony) and the food is barbecue heaven.My friend and I had pork belly, sliced brisket, a thunderbird sandwich (boneless rib meat served on a bun with spicy pickles), baked beans, cole slaw, and potato salad.  Rather than tell you about each dish, I'll say this: you won't be sorry with any of it.  If you are, give up barbecue forever because nothing will satisfy you.And I'll finish with this: I live 30 miles from this place and I absolutely loathe going into the city.  But I will--gladly--for this place.  Count on me coming back."
"Great barbecue. Fun atmosphere. Lots of outdoor seating. The brisket is excellent. I also had the salmon, which was also really good. Sure, the line for food can get very, very long. Enjoy a drink from their terrific bar menu while you wait. I will be back for sure."
"Delicious!!! A must try!!Loved the pulled pork, pork ribs, broccoli salad (must try!), potato salad. One of the best Micheladas I've ever had.Very cool atmosphere. Line was at the beginning of the back wall, took about 45 minutes and totally worth it."
"Amazing brisket! Worth the wait, and good cocktails to boot. Expect lines but you can drink while you wait :)"
"Best BBQ in Chicago.  It's Texas style and definitely stands out among the rest.  If you come during a busy time, grab a drink from the bar as you wait in line.  Their cocktails are strong.  I like their version of the classic Moscow Mule.  As for food, the brisket is good but my personal favorites are the frito pie and pulled pork."
"We live in the neighborhood, and were very excited to have a new Sodikoff restaurant opening up. We've been to Gilt, Maude's, etc., but being from Houston, the idea of a backyard BBQ feel appealed to us. Food was delicious. Brisket, pulled pork, Frito pie, sauces, and a great beer selection. Very affordable compared to other restaurants on the Randolph Street corridor. We got there early on a Friday. Music and atmosphere were perfect. Vinyl records,  blues, etc. Considered it our favorite bar in the city......until around 8. At 8 (on Friday and Saturday: we went back to see if it was a one-time thing, or if it was standard), vinyl went off, iPod went on, and the music went from country/folksy/blues to hardcore rap. For example: Geto Boys, Snyper, Public Enemy and Dre. It TOTALLY killed the mood for me. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the music. It makes a huge difference.Hoping since Green Street Smoked Meats is relatively new, they will take some of these reviews to heart. When I'm drinking a Lone Star, having brisket, and sitting next to a smoker, the last thing I want is Snoop blasting."
"Absolutely astonishing food with a cozy, interesting interior with bare-bulb overhead lighting.  Deli-style ordering with tubs of cheap beer and a full bar for more top shelf beer and mixed drinks.  Friendly staff that helps orient newcomers and makes sure everything goes smoothly.Our first visit we arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday night.  Parking is notoriously difficult in Restaurant Row but, once we parked, the place was pretty easy to find (even though we ventured down the wrong path once).  When we arrived the place was about half full, but it quickly filled up after we'd sat down and started eating.  The g/f and I ordered 1/2 lb brisket (the cook even gave us some burnt ends!), 1/2 lb ribs, a hot link,  Frito pie, and cole slaw.  The sauce choices are nice and varied (Spicy, Tangy, Texas Squeeze, and Coffee) and all complimented the meat in different ways.  The brisket was INSANE.  There was literally no need to chew it, it was that tender and juicy.  The ribs were delicious and meaty, and the hot link was just spicy enough to change the pace a bit.  Finishing up with the brisket chili Frito pie was tough because we were both getting pretty full but, rest assured, we persevered.  The cole slaw is a tangy mixture of cabbage and cilantro that was pretty different in taste from what I'm used to.  Mix all this up with a cold PBR tall boy and I was in heaven.Definitely will be frequenting this place again.  Like...tonight."
"Great spot but get there early  or you won't eat. The bar takes forever as well. Best for summer, big parties (if u grab a spot) and trendy but casual"
The bbq was pretty good until you consider what you pay for it. $40 for 2 pulled pork sandwiches and 2 sides is pretty ridiculous. I've had much better at a fraction of the price. Not too mention it kept me up half the night with a stomach ache. Only reason I'm not giving one star is because the staff was very friendly and on point.
"Loved this place!! The ambiance is amazing and it makes one feel like they are out at a country farm BBQ.  I love the fact that as you're waiting in line for food you can grab a drink! It helps pass the time.  That being said, the line moves pretty quickly! Get the ribs!!!! The rub they put on them is spicy and sweet. It's a perfect combination.  I also suggest the vinegar based sauce!!!! I will definitely be going back!"
"Not very good... The brisket (almost $13) was extremely fatty and I felt like I did not get any actual meat. The smoked chicken legs were not that great either, they felt to be slightly undercooked and they were extremely salty. Macaroni salad was nothing special and desperately needed salt & pepper."
"OMG we had a great time here last night. The place is a super hip mash up of city warehouse barbecue pit hip are spinning 70s soul classics mixed with bass heavy urban house. Once inside, the smell alone will have you salivating and ready for dinner. But not so fast...  Belly up to the bar and get a glass or pint of your favorite micro - craft brew, or better yet partake in some of the great whiskey, bourbon and rye proudly presented on the shelf space in the middle of the bar area. The place will be mobbed, but that's okay. Relax with a drink, take the edge off, and wander over to the line of people -probably the full length of the restaurant - and slowly make your way up to the order area. Order up your meat by the half pound, definitely try the Frito pie, pay your bill and find a seat that one of the large extra long picnic table like seating areas scattered around this giant place. The vibe is city, most definitely city...there is nothing country or redneck about this barbecue joint. And the food... Damn, the food is great."
Hands down the best BBQ I have had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into. We had the sliced brisket and the pork ribs. Both were so fricken delicious!
"Loved it! Was never a huge fan of BBQ or smoked meat in general but that may have changed after a visit to Green St. Worth the wait...love the ambiance n the chill factor. Dreaming of the brisket n the Mac salad. Pork ribs, corn, spicy pickles, Fritos Pie and hot links are all great choices! And the white bread...ok just kidding!"
"I learned of this place before the doors even opened to the public and I must say, it totally lives up to the hype.  The food is incredible.  The Frito Pie is a $6 wad of spicy heaven.  The pulled pork melts in your mouth, as does the brisket.  The baked beans have just the right amount of sweet/savory.  Oh yeah..did I mention they can make a hell of an old fashioned for a restaurant where you order at a counter and sit down community style to eat?  We are now regulars and know the door guy (Dave) on a first-name basis.  It helps when you visit more than one time in a single night (dinner and 4th meal...don't judge).  Highly recommended.  Don't let the line discourage you.  It moves quick and it passes the bar...get a double, sit back and enjoy the ride.  I promise you it is worth it!"
"I've been to Chicago's promised land of smoked meats! Thank you Green Street for doing it right and not being boring like the other places (looking at you Smoke Daddy). The last time I had brisket that made me weak in the knees I was in Memphis and the last time I was this excited about bbq I was on a back road in the deep south..So I could go on an tell you I had the pulled pork (awesome), hot link (also awesome), potato salad, spicy pickles and tell you how great those items are but all you need to know is the brisket it UNREAL! The line will be long, the wait will be just as long but it wraps around the bar so channel your inner Rust Cohle grab a Lone Star and think about time being a flat circle."
"Eat pulled pork! Eat Brisket! Drink Beer! And be happy at Green Street Smoked Meats.  Also has a great atmosphere, definitely worth checking out...multiple times."
"I have never had good BBQ in Chicago until I went to Green Street. The atmosphere is also really freaking cool...it's like being at someones backyard cookout with the lights and the picnic tables. And, it smells amazing.We went on a Friday night, so it the line was pretty long, but it moved quickly. We were able to order drinks at the bar while waiting. Drinks make everything better. You order your food kind of how you would at lunch in high school. Everyone has a tray and you move down the line telling the person behind the counter what you want, and then you pay. I wasn't really expecting that kind of set-up, but it works. Finding a table was really easy, but I think we got lucky there; again, it was pretty crowded.I had ribs and broccoli salad and cole slaw. My friend got the pulled pork and spicy pickles. I really enjoyed the ribs, but I don't think I would get broccoli salad again. Maybe it was the sauce? I don't know, but they have other options to choose from.I would certainly go back! They have tables set up on the patio...should be lots of fun this summer!"
"The food is fabulous, but personally I think there are way too many good restaurants in Chicago to wait in line for 1-1.5 hours for BBQ.   In addition the hipsters there definitely were negatively commenting on everyone standing in line.  I'm sorry that I am not wearing super tight jeans and a 1970's vintage store plaid shirt; I guess I just don't fit in here."
"Got here on a Saturday night after a movie.The place can get busy and noisy. Unless you're prepared to yell to be heard by your companion (and a few strangers), conversations are impossible. The music is loud, very loud and so is the background noise. The drinks are good. But the lines at the bar discourage you from returning for a second. There are no waiters to take drink orders.The food is mediocre at best. The pork belly is very fatty; the ribs fatty as well and overseasoned; the brisket ok.The sauces, I found rather irrelevant.Chicago continues to lack a quality BBQ. I don't expect Austin's Salt Lick or Salt Lake City's Sugarhouse BBQ but I don't think that a club-wannabe bar that serves smoked meats will satisfy Chicago's need for decent BBQ."
"The smoked brisket was really quite good, even though it was fattier than most of the BBQ joints in the area.  Nice smoke flavor and a good amount of bark.  I was disappointed in the sauce.  The regular sauce and the spicy variety were both one note wonders, chili powder and cayenne respectively.  I settled on the  vinegar sauce (not called a Carolina sauce here) as it was the best available.Side dish options were slim for me as I don't like mayo and ALL of the salad are mayo based.  I chose the baked beans and they were good but nothing out of the ordinary.  I'd have opted for pickles but there is only one size for all of the sides, that would have been far too many pickles for one person.  I suppose it's fine for sharing but I was there alone.I'd like to see one-meat and two-meat platter options for a more economical dinner.  A tasting option for meats would be nice too.  I'd have loved to try the pork belly but had no interest in a 1/2# of it.  The line moved a lot faster than many of the other reviewers suggest.  I arrived about 5:15 on a Saturday and was sitting down with my food by 5:40.  With all of the great BBQ options these days I won't be making this a destination spot but if I'm in the area I'd return."
"This is the best BBQ in Chicago. Hands down. I'm from Alabama, lived near Kansas City for 5 years (Go Jayhawks!) and live and die BBQ. I know good BBQ. I know bad BBQ (hello Chicago). I know great BBQ. I know competition BBQ.This is great BBQ! When people in Chicago talk about ""how great so and so's fall off the bone ribs are"". That right there tells you the place and the person know NOTHING about great BBQ ribs. Ribs are never supposed to ""fall off the bone"". That's a stupid Chicago myth. It means they were boiled at some point in the process (not just smoked) and just smothered in the sauce at the end (hello Twin Anchors).The pit-masters at Green Street smoked meats know what they are doing and they are doing it WELL. The Ribs are incredible - competition worthy. The dry rub has incredible flavor and spice and the meat itself is incredibly tender and juicy. The brisket, pulled pork, pork belly are also great. They were out of the beef ribs. We didn't have any of the other meats.The sides are good but no BBQ place should ever be known for sides or that probably means the meat sucks.The bar is cool and it's nice that the line wraps around it. We got there at 730pm on a Friday night (oops). The line was 90 minutes. We drank in line, it was fine. The meat made it worth the wait.For those bitching about the picnic tables and casual atmosphere...this is a BBQ restaurant. In the south and Kansas City, the best BBQ places are shacks in the woods (Dreamland Tuscaloosa), gross hole in the walls (Franklin's) and sometimes even in gas stations (Oklahoma Joe's). That's just the name of the game. If you want nice and trendy...march your high heels or frosted tips over to Randolph or Hubbard street and leave the BBQ to the real carnivores.Cheers to great BBQ finally landing in Chicago."
"While the food here was pretty good, I don't know if I would return given that I felt it was overpriced for the amount that you get and the wait time to even get your food.  I had the sliced brisket which was tender and tasty with the BBQ sauce that they had.  The potato salad was great!  The only complaint I would have was that it was a bit too salty; otherwise, it was so good!  The venue, I felt, was fitting considering that it was a BBQ meat establishment.  Very laid-back and casual place where you order yourself and sit wherever there's an open table."
"Delicious food, fun atmosphere and music. This place is not particularly good for kids but if you go before 9 it is probably OK. We went on a Friday night with our 1 year old at around 730. The meats are lean and well seasoned. We had the macaroni salad, pickled hot vegetables and broccoli salad for sides. They were also very good. They also have some tasty local brews. This place is definitely good for groups."
"Outstanding!  Awesome food and fantastic decor.  Loved the bar area with tons of great beer and whiskey options.  Super nice staff too.  Great addition to the neighborhood, will definitely be back."
"Exceptional. I went pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken leg. Each was excellent. Beef rib was especially good. Several excellent sides too. Other bbq joints, watch out. There's a new kid on the block and he's tossing his weight around.Only gripe, they need to work out the entrance/exit logistics."
"Love, love, love, love, love! Just had dinner here today with some girlfriends and couldn't wait any longer to gush about the place. The food is just delicious! It's just barbecue, but it's very good. I had the brisket sandwich, which was very large and filling, and the elote side dish (yum!). We ordered an assortment of side dishes so I also got to try the macaroni and potato salads; both also great options. I didn't realize this going in, but it is cafeteria-style ordering. You place your order with one person, move onto the sides, and so on. There is a completely separate bar in the middle. I did not love waiting so long to just catch the bartender's attention and order a drink, but in their defense they were quite busy on a Tuesday at 6:30. Thought it might be hard to snag a spot for 6 of us at the communal style picnic tables, but we actually found outdoor space pretty easily. Can't wait to go back!"
Yet another hit from Sodikoff. From walking in the door I felt the unmistakable ease of being at a best friends back yard barbeque. There are not enough words to explain what an awesome establishment this is. Another jewel in Chicago...ahem Sodikoff 's crown.
"- The brisket was dry and cold. (Tuesday 8:00 p.m.)- The staff were a bit pretentious and condescending...- Very expensive- The pork ribs were pretty good- Great atmosphere. I would go early and try to beat the lines, hopefully everything will be freshly cooked because clearly whomever served me my brisket had served me brisket that had been overcooked and been sitting out for hours. Not worth the money, all about appearances."
"Ok, the food is good, but I just looked at the prices on the menu and realized the bartenders overcharged me Twice.  Two different bartenders. Once for a chartreuse mule, once for a daisy cutter.  $1 extra each time. Lame.  Either update your menu, or fire your bartenders."
German Brew Hall meets Texas Roadhouse!!
"FANTASTIC!!! Luckily I live in the neighborhood, but I would travel across the city for this place.  It can be a bit difficult to find if you have no idea where you are going, but trust me it is worth the hunt.One of the best things you can do here is to go with a few friends or your family and get a whole bunch of different items off the menu to try, you will not be disappointed.One of the best, if not THE best, BBQ places in Chicago."
"Very good brisket and great sausage.  SO many beers, I lost count.  Still hard of hearing since it was very loud.  I would go back once my hearing recovers.  I will probably have to grow a beard first to not feel out of place.  Brisket, sausage, beer...all good."
"Just had dinner here last night with my girlfriends and it was pretty awesome!  If you love BBQ, then I highly recommend this place.  The food is amazing and you leave feeling very stuffed!  I had the brisket sandwich and a side order of potato salad.  Normally, I think potato salad is just meh, but there's was very flavorful and garlicky!  I tried my friends' other side dishes and they were also delicious (elote, macaroni salad, pickles). The line to order your food was rather long, so be prepared to wait awhile...though there is a bar in the middle so you can grab a drink while waiting. I recommend the sweet tea!  It is communal style seating and I recommend the outdoor seating...very cool venue.  Looking forward to my next visit!!"
"Had the pulled pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, pork belly, and brisket. Sides were spicy pickles and baked beans. Everything except the beef ribs and pulled pork were excellent. Pulled pork was very good and the beef ribs were average at best. Long line can be avoided if you eat at the same time as your 80 year old grandparents. It is very loud inside and the booze is expensive. They have about 10 tables outside which are quieter. A little expensive but really good food."
Be sure to come early because they do run out of certain items in the menu
"This place is cool! I took my hubz here for Sweetest Day. It's a super masculine place so he enjoyed because he didn't have to remember which fork to use. Crowd was pleasant, food was delish but just a tad bit pricey.. literally two ribs were fifteen dollars. HOWEVER, I will definitely be back as the brisket was OFF THE METER. Oh, and the hubby liked it."
"This place was quite a unique experience to eat. This cafeteria style eatery had a great atmosphere. It was well lit and they played great music (a little loud for my groups taste, a little hard to carry on a conversation). We had a good variety of the menu (smaller menu so easily done). The ribs and pork belly was our favorite the rub was the perfect accent for these dishes and they just melted in your mouth. To be honest the Brisket was unremarkable, didn't have as much flavor as the others and the sauces didn't elevate the flavor quite enough for my taste. We had one of each side and you really can't go wrong with any of them. Very fresh and flavorful. The only other thing I'll mention is that none of the meat really had a strong ""smoked"" flavor. Overall a good eat and totally worth standing in line at the cafeteria. (Ps. Valet park for sure!)"
"Huge Sodikoff fan but the food here is just bad. Tried the pulled pork, the ribs, and the brisket. Let's start with the good. The space is great. Huge and tastefully decorated in a way that successfully makes it seem like nobody tried to be too cool, I wouldn't mind hanging out here for a drink. The cocktails, while pricey (it's the West Loop after all), were very good.But if you're operating a BBQ resto, you've got to have good barbecue. The pulled pork was a soggy mess devoid of smoke flavor. The brisket was crazy juicy and had a gorgeous smoke ring. But it was flavorless. No smoke (this is clearly a theme) and not much beef flavor either. Very strange. No good. Ribs. Oh, the ribs. Problem #1 - why not even offer the tips? Problem #2 - the rub is overloaded with sugar - this stuff tasted almost like caramelized meat. Problem #3 - you can guess this one - no smoke flavor at all.Won't be going back. But it'll remain crowded. Sodikoff makes money, the people who like it are happy, and I don't have to eat it. Everyone's happy!!!"
"I am OBSESSED with this place! Everything about it! Their pork products rock my world! They have dr pepper floats! Love the Cole slaw! The side dish of pickles is YUM. Love the pork belly, the ribs & pulled pork! Thank you GSSM for entering my belly!"
"I went here couple of months ago with my brother one early evening. The interior is like a warehouse with picnic-style benches and tables. The place was packed and we had to wait 15 mins in a long line. The food is made and cut in front of you.The food was good but when I was told how much my order cost ($50 for 1/2 lb of sliced brisket, 1 rack of ribs, hot link and 2 sides), my jaw literally dropped. Be aware that the prices adds up quickly. The sides were massively overpriced and were mediocre to say the least but the main BBQ was tasty, especially the hot links. It was my 1st time having the sliced brisket and it was very fatty but it was pretty good.The food (apart from the sides) is good but overpriced. This is a hipster paradise though."
"I do not understand the hype about this place at all.  Every single employee our group interacted with was incredibly rude.  This place is trying too hard to be trendy and is failing.  After dealing with a very rude front door man, who yelled at my 65 year old father to not sit down and the meat guy who refused to answer our questions, I expected the food to be fantastic and at least make up in some way for the awful service.  Unfortunately, it did not.  We ordered the sliced Brisket and it was WAY too salty.  I like a good crust on brisket but this tasted of pure salt and nothing else.  AND they don't even have Mac and Cheese, which is what I automatically crave with barbeque.  The sides basically consisited of various pickeled vegetables, even the coleslaw tasted like straight vinegar.  I HATED this place.  It really pissed me off that I even spent my time and money here.  Don't waste yours!  I'd reccomend Rub's Backcountry Smokehouse in West Rogers Park if you really want amazing Brisket with a great flavorful crust, that isn't just salt.  AVOID GREEN STREET AT ALL COSTS!"
"Much different than the other places in the hogsalt restaurant group. This is a quick and fun BBQ spot. You walk up to the counter to order and pay. Then sit at communal seating. The BBQ was tasty. It is a bit hidden, just look for the outdoor seating just south of Randolph on green street."
This place was absolutely amazing! The only downside here is that so many other people know about the delicious food so if you don't want to wait in line for 1-2 hours try to get there early. Got the brisket and ribs and We has zero complaints about either. Pasta salad was nothing special but u really enjoyed the coleslaw. Grab a beer while you wait in line and enjoy a super cute and rustic outdoor area with bench seating while you pig out!
"Rustic atmosphere that provides for a lot of fun. Staff were all vey pleasant and helpful. Good selection of meats and sides that were all good. As for real Texas barbeque, though, I would have to say 'nice try'. The meats were tasteful, but the smoke flavor was largely missing. I would go back for the fun atmosphere, but for those seeking more authentic Texas barbeque there are better options."
"Over-hyped. While I love the venue and the ambience, (very cool, hip vibe) I did not think the food was anything special. Ordered the brisket, spicey pickles, broccoli slaw, and coleslaw. Sad to say the star was the coleslaw, not the meat or their coffee sauce which doesn't taste like coffee. Not to mention $26 for 3 small sides and 1/2 pound of brisket is $$$. Not going back."
"I may be the only person who doesn't like this place.The pork ribs were great, but otherwise the food was average, especially for the price -- I got three small ribs, with no sides included, for $9. The experience of eating underwhelms, too. I went there looking for a dining-out experience, but you shuffle through a line for your own food, then carry it to a table, eat it in 10 minutes out of paper trays with plastic utensils, and you're done. Fine for a quick lunch or takeout, but not for dinner with friends or family.Finally, something about the atmosphere doesn't work. The decor is great, but it feels fake. New windows made to look old, old-school shoes handing from the telephone elides out front... It's like the Disneyland version of a BBQ joint, the hipsters' Rainforest Cafe."
The most killer BBQ I have ever tasted!  The staff is awesome and totally cool. It's super low key.  Don't expect anything but rolled paper towels and Lone Star beer to accompany your meal that you have to bring to the table yourself.  Absolutely amazing!
"Hipsters galore! Love their patio and the fact that they have local option beers on draft! YUM! The BBQ looked delicious, but the line was so long! That too for a Wednesday evening! WHAT?! Definitely going to go back and try their food. The beer reeled in me and will be taking me back."
Love the atmosphere and how it's next to a champagne bar. It felt like on one side you had the snotty aristocrats and on the other the plebs with there BBQ and hard rock music.  Anyway the food was mediocre by my BBQ standards.  I had the brisket and baked beans.  The baked beans were solid by the brisket was hit or miss.  A good slice was great but I also had super tough and pure fat slices.  Hot links looked good so did the Mac salad but I though the side selection was lacking.
Unbelievable meat!! The atmosphere rocks! Great addition to my neighborhood. I had the brisket and pulled pork Sammie. Brisket was killer! The pulled pork was delicious! The bun was a bad choice though. My bun was pasty and soppy wet. The sauces were good. My biggest complaint is the sides. I saw the mayo based sides that you can normally find in any jewel-Osco deli case. C'mon guys!!!! Where the heck is the Mac n cheese!?! The BBQ beans were excellent! I will be back though.
"We came here on a Wednesday night and by 6:30pm there wasn't too much of a line. I felt like I was in a rustic bbq shack with the string lights and antique decor. We didn't know what to try so one of the guys suggested a sampler plate. We got the sliced brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and ribs. They were all delicious!! We wanted to get some sandwiches to go but the line got pretty long. Makes a good excuse to go back! Music was loud so it's kind of hard to hear. But overall it was good and I would definitely go back!"
"The meat is good but not mind blowing.  People complain that it's fatty, but isn't that the nature of BBQ?  The sauces are fine, but like the meat they aren't particularly special.  The coleslaw, pickles, and beans are good.Here's what's not so great about the place:-It's pretty overpriced considering it's a glorified cafeteria.  There's no table service of any sort.  If you leave your cafeteria tray at your table someone will probably remove it though.-Bar service is slow.  They have about six people at the bar performing random tasks, but only two are actually serving drinks.  The others are debating what record they should put on, etc.  If you catch these non-bartenders eyes they'll give you a look like ""that's not my job.""-The food service is slow too.  The bottleneck in the whole operation is the cashier.-It's kinda loud.  It's not oppressively loud, but it's not a place for meaningful/intimate conversation."
"The wait was short (20 min total) for walking in on Saturday night around 8pm. The menu is pretty simple & it's all a la carte. My husband & I ordered the Thunderbird sandwich, 1/2 lb Pork ribs, cole slaw, tater salad, frito pie & beers = about $50. Seating was limited but we squeezed in between some nice strangers. The potato salad was honestly the best part! The Thunderbird was awesome too (the same concept as the McRib minus all the questionable meat + spicy pickles on top). The other items were pretty good but not overly impressive especially for the price. I opted not to put any sauce on the ribs so I could taste the smoked flavors but the meat was a little dry. The Frito Pie was probably my biggest regret--$0.25 cent bag of chips with nacho cheese, chili & beef brisket chunks (barely any) and jalapenos for $6. The warehouse atmosphere was really cool & some great beers on tap (about $7 a pop). Overall, a good experience and makes for a good substitute when all the other restaurants in the area have a 2-3 hour wait!"
"I love beef ribs and I love Green Street.  What's to say that hasn't been said?  The BBQ is fall off the bone delicious.  The brisket is tender, juicy, and mouth watering.  Also, the BBQ sauces are all very good.  I've been waiting  for years for a genuine BBQ place to come to Chicago and this is it.  I can now get my fix on a monthly basis.  This will, no doubt, hurt my wait line, but it's worth the sacrifice. More beef ribs please!"
"Wow. Great pulled pork, sausage etc at big outdoor tables. Much better than expected. Lagunitas beer at good prices.  Close to perfection"
"The meats are out of this world and the atmosphere is awesome. Also, in the summer they have an outside area which makes for a great scene. Probably on the hottest street in chicago with the soho house and other restaurants close by."
"This was my first pork belly... and after that first explosive bite of flavor, my life has felt dull and colorless in comparison. I now spend my days sitting by a window, contemplating when my next occasion to sample Green Street's supple delicacies will be."
"Soo freaking good ! Very flavorful ! You must try the pull pork sandwich , broccoli salad , potato salad , and baked beans! I had a friend get the salmon and that was delicious as well ! It's open seating and there is usually a line to order but I always buy a drink while in line ."
"Recommended by a business associate who took me there for dinner.  We went on a Tuesday night and arrived shortly after they opened.  Luckily, we did not experience the long line and wait (on his previous visit, they waited for an hour and a half in line).In general, I really like the ambiance and feel of Green Street.  Seems to pair well with what they do there.  I was not put off by the cafeteria style service and really liked the beer well near the bar.  We were not rushed or hurried and enjoyed a few cold beers after dinner on the patio.We had chopped brisket, pork belly and pork ribs.  Sides were a mix of sweet and hot pickles, broccoli slaw and frito pie.  The ribs were dry and basically tasted like ham not ribs.  The brisket was solid, not overly done but also did not really light my smoked meat world on fire.  Now the pork belly was something else all together.  Perfectly done and just the right level of smoke with a delicious melt in your mouth fat layer.  The pork belly bordered on being so good that I might return just for more of it.The sides were OK.  The frito pie was fun but eat it right away or you'll be left with a bag of soggy fritos.  The pickles were average (and I love pickles of all kinds) and even the spicy version was very mild.  I was not a fan of the broccoli slaw as it contained quite a bit of fresh dill, which I find to be overpowering.If they upped the flavor level and refined some of their meats a bit, this rating would easily jump to 4 stars."
"One of the most amazing pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. The slaw on it was also delish- mayo free! Homemade vanilla soft serve for dessert made it even better. Funky atmosphere, big picnic tables to seat yourself and marks on the floor let you know how much longer until you order. Loved this place!"
Originally from Texas and never satisfied with BBQ anywhere up north. This place was pretty damn outstanding. Great atmosphere.
"I really enjoyed the vibe and the outdoor seating was pretty cute however food wise I would give this a rating of ""Meh."" It wasn't bad at all but it did not blow me away or become my new favorite BBQ place. It certainly isn't a go to stop for BBQ adventurers of Chicago.What I ordered:Appetizers - Potato Salad and Frito PieThe potato salad was just again eh. A little too much mustard for me, kinda made me wish I got the macaroni salad (BTW no mac n cheese? wtf is up with that?)The Frito Pie was just ok, everywhere i read online said this was the item to order and I skipped ordering baked beans to try this, and I'm sad that I did. Its essentially just chili and cheese with jalapenos on top of fritos. Not too exciting or flavorful, certainly no smoke flavor or sweetness in the chili.Main Dish - Ribs and Chopped Brisket sandwichThe best thing about the brisket sandwich was the bun, it seems the overall flavor of this place is that sweet and sticky BBQ. They brag about their wood smoker but I honestly could not taste any great smoked flavor at all. The brisket was nice and tender and there was a slight zest to it. however again, not very impressive.The ribs were the showcase of the meal and if i went back i would definitely order them again. They had a wonderfully balanced flavor, were not smothered with BBQ sauce and there was a great balance of fat that melted in your mouth."
"This place knows it's way around meat.  We had the brisket and beef ribs with a side of potato salad.  All outstanding.Minimal service (no wait staff, walk up to the bar and serving area), but it keeps prices reasonable and the decor is great.  Lone Star long necks and the bartender's playing Billy Joel's 52nd Street on vinyl.  What's not to like?"
"If you like mediocre food in a super casual environment, this place is for you. Fatty meat with average BBQ sauce with a side of plain white bread (literally plain- no butter allowed), and dirty hipsters every where. Seriously, if you look too 'normal' no one will talk to you. Paper plates and nothing exciting about this place. A thousand better restaurants in Chicago!"
Not much to say. The best barbecue I have ever had. No need for sauce on the ribs cause they are just very tasty like that. My favorite is the pork brisket. Potato salad is also good. Pay for the ice cream up front so you don't have to wait in line all over again.
"I'm giving this place 5 stars, AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE BBQ! I happened upon this place after a random night of late night partying with my dad and some co-workers. Although by the time we got there they were out of certain items, the brisket..... OMG! It was EVERYTHING! The atmosphere in there is barnyard, meets biker bar/ tattoo shop and it works! Communal style tables and you cafeteria style service. I would definitely go back! Plus, I loved the fact that it was open super late."
"After a huge monsoon outside, a nice gentleman was standing on Green directing lost patrons to this outstanding BBQ. It took about 20 minutes to get through the line...not bad, especially when you can get drinks at the bar while waiting. A $14 mezcal negroni is steep, but I'm a sucker for both mezcal and negronis, so I was sold. I tried the pork ribs, the pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw (comes as a mini side to put on te sandwich), spicy pickles and the elote corn salad. Everything was incredible and I will certainly be back with a bigger group of friends."
"This place gets 5 stars for it's atmosphere, meat, and beer selection.  I like the first come, first serve model.  I can walk in any time and grab a bite and a beer and be entertained by the diversity of the crowd.  Great people watching and easy to mix it up with people at the bar.  The self serve ""meat bar"" flows quickly and efficiently.  There's a guy who will describe the menu and answer questions while you wait, which is helpful and keeps the line moving.  The guys who serve the meat are efficient, enthusiastic, and take pride in their product.  The meats are as good as they come for barbeque.  The sides are good, but not great.  Would like to see more along the lines of the vegetable category.  The broccoli salad is good, and slaw is fine, but doesn't bowl me over.  Perhaps more choices would be good, starting with some roasted veggies or something along those lines.  As for the bar service, I give it two stars.  I had to wait 10 minutes before being acknowledged at the bar, despite having several employees come and go right in front of me, including a bartender or two.  Unacceptable.  Other than one bartender, who came over from his side to serve me realizing that no one from the opposite side had acknowledged me (he comped my first beer, which was the right thing to do and great awareness of the situation on his part), the others seemed more interested in socializing with each other than paying attention to their customers.  This is a service industry folks...the customers don't care about your interpersonal soap operas.  Don't treat your customers like they're a job.  Treat them like guests in your home. Their enjoyment, and thus your tips and the success of the establishment depend on it.  If you improve upon that, You can easily rate 5 stars.  ."
"We had brisket and pulled pork, both so good! Brisket was really tender. Pulled pork comes with coleslaw on top. We also had spicy pickles which were awesome and macaroni salad. I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni salad, next time I would try baked beans. Definitely would come back. Spicy and Texas sauces were both tasty."
"Very cool place (and very hipster). A lot better to come on a warm summer night because the outdoor seating is awesome. If you come with one other person I suggest you get 1/2 of 3 different things so you can try it all. However, the ribs were by far the best. Definitely coming back soon and getting here early because it gets crowded fast."
"This place is the real deal.  Everything I've had here has been great except for the ribs, which I found to be just good.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that its the most expensive BBQ place I've ever been to.  My reference point in chicago for great bbq is smoque.  At smoque a pound of brisket costs $15 and it is just as excellent as green street meats' brisket... except theirs cost $24 per pound.  For those of us that eat more than average, it can get pretty pricey."
"Tasty BBQ and great atmosphere; be prepared to wait in a looooong line, but It's definitely worth it!!!!"
"Meat, meat, and more meat. I came in with a friend last night after a little bar hopping. My first time here and I was very happy with the food. I had the brisket and broccoli salad that were both on point after drinking. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the music which was some sort of grunge rock that sounded like scooby doo on drugs, but to each is own. The food was good enough for me to drown it out. I also liked the set up of the place with the lighting and the grimy look like an old meat packing house. Not a place for a romantic date by far. Check it out!"
Excellent BBQ!!  I didn't know Chicago knew brisket so well.  Also liked the wrap around bar while waiting in line concept.  Only negative is the huge wait and lack of side selection.
"Yummers!  We happened upon this place by chance and thank goodness we did! There is no frills, seating is first-come first-serve.  The line is ridiculously long and that's because the bbq items they serve up is delish!  We got to try the brisket, ribs, & sausage.  The brisket was the best and my mouth is watering just thinking about it now.  They also have outdoor seating which will most likely be packed in the summer."
Second time I ate here. Both times was crazy good. Gives any place on Texas or KV a run for their money.
Vegans/Vegetarians read no further. This is Definitely the place to go for smokehouse BBQ. Chicago is known for its great food culture and this place definitely adds some depth to that reputation. The meat selections are absolutely sumptuous. There is a great selection of sauces and the side dishes are great as well.
"Excellent place/atmosphere. Great brisket. Pulled pork was decent. A little pricey, but will go back again."
"Yelp recommended Hot and New and it was right on point. Slow valet but once you get in line you have a cool concept with cool staff providing atmosphere and entertainment. Go with people you like, you will be in line a while.  At least 2 drinks later a the wrap around bar you come to order.  EAT EVERY SIDE THEY HAVE, corn was not at the top of the menu but it was excellent. The meat: beef ribs were a bit bland but the chopped brisket made me forget about it.  The vinegar sauce and other bbq sauces were excellent.  Going back with more friends, the communal seating with great meats gave me a Game of Thrones feeling, which I loved. Great job"
"This hidden gem is not so hidden any more. Forget the fact that the door is not only unmarked but also down a random alley, it's gonna be packed. That's the west loop for you.I didn't eat on my stop here since I had just come from dinner, but the food looked pretty damn good and I contemplated trying it just because the smell was making me hungry all over again. I can say that the bartenders work hard to craft unique beverages. I spent more time watching the bartender work than I did looking my friends in the eye when they were talking. Oops.We managed to get some seats at the bar, only because we got lucky and walked by right as someone was leaving. I'd probably avoid this place on the weekends. With a lunchline style food service and no waitstaff once you're at your table, I can only imagine how difficult it would be to get drinks if this place was busy. Either resign yourself to food only, or go early, and grab a seat at the bar. I saw people going one person at a time to the food line so they wouldn't lose their seats... interesting tactic, but sadly necessary."
"Not your average BBQ place at all. Great vibe for families, young adults and those who want to enjoy some good beers as well.  While the line can be long, it is well worth the wait.  Been here before and have not had anything negative to say about the food. Cooked well and great sides. Seating outside is a bit tough during the summer months but if you have the time and want to enjoy a good atmosphere with great food; this is the place to do so."
"I'm not a huge BBQ fan, simply because it is so heavy. But this is one occasion where absolutely everything delivered. Beer, meat and pickles. The bartender was also really knowledgeable and gave some great advice for this picky drinker. As long as you realize you are going to a large backyard-like place with picnic tables and bbq that had my date wanting a round of seconds, green street smoked meats will deliver!"
"So came here and there was a private party so the entire place was shut down, they gave us a drink ticket that expired in 24 hours, thanks guys!"
"Ribs are so succulent, and the rub is delicious. Finished eating before I got to take a picture. Spacious room, cool decor - lots of repurposed materials.  Great to sit outside under twinkling lights on a summer night."
"So the first time I walk in this joint 100,000 years (KISS) is playing..on vinyl nonetheless.. this place is off the charts..atmosphere is cool, food is outstanding, music is hit or miss.. there's literally a turntable behind the bar, so it's ""bartenders choice"" which is the only gripe I have ... the bar staff...I had a bartender swipe my change off the bar when I left my seat to grab a tray or another side..($80.00 worth) for one cocktail of service, I liked the drink, but not that much!! he kindly gave an oscar winning ""so sorry bro"" performance and then gave it back..scumbag..but i can't knock the star off for that.. it was worth a shot, right?"
Chicago's version of Brooklyn's fette sau. Same type of patrons too. Delicious brisket.
"I was super excited to try GSSM out.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  There was a huge line which you would think meant great things but it wasn't.  The meat has zero smoked flavor to it, the salmon was blah and so was the brisket. The atmosphere was cool but way to crowded with the line.  And I've had way better BBQ.  My advice would be to judge it for yourself but I won't be back.  BBQ is suppose to taste smoked.  Especially if you have the word in your name."
"Eating here is like a boutique barbecue experience.  Mustering up all the niches of ""What is it to have a representation of the 4 meccas (Texas, Kansas City, Memphis, and South Carolina)?""  And have Chicago call this place uniquely it's own.  Thanks for meticulously doing it RIGHT Green Street Smoked Meats, and I cannot suggest this place enough."
Pretty good replication of the austin bbq scene.
I was hoping the location being a bit trendy lately wouldn't place location over food. And was ridiculously enthused. As good as the best in the south.
"Since coming to Chicago I have heard, ""Green Street Meats is a must."" With high expectations I didn't think thy could surpass them - they did. The beer, brisket and atmosphere all get 5 stars. The brisket melts in your mouth and is so good it is questionable if adding sauce takes away from the experience (2 of 3 folks I dined with skipped the BBQ sauce). The sides are good. I really enjoyed the slightly spicy, tangy coleslaw, not a huge fan of the sweet broccoli salad - it has raisins. The sour pickle was crunchy and divine. Definitely going back, this time to share different meats. Outdoor seating at communal tables next to the neighbor restaurant makes for great people watching."
"I love this place! My go to for BBQ. Their sauces are amazing. I love their chopped brisket! Cant say enough about their sides too - love the macaroni salad and potato salad (nice garlic taste to it). I feel like I am in Austin when I am here. The reason I took 1 star away was because 1 time I came there and the food was not up to par for some reason. Also, I thought the ribs were a bit dry. But I have been there a good 15 times already. I tried Smoque, but I didnt like it as much as Green Street. Dont forget to order a Michelada as your drink!"
"BBQ snobs will knock this place and every other BBQ joint in town, but for me who spends 16 hours slow smoking beef ribs, pork butts, and briskets come summertime in my backyard, I look for a nice deep pink smoke ring, a nice bark, and tender meat, that to me is the definition of good BBQ weather it's in Texas or Chicago. GSSM delivers good, honest, traditionally prepared BBQ. The graffiti lined back alley entrance into what looks like a secret abandoned warehouse party sets a  cool, unique atmosphere."
"Best Pork Belly I've had! The ambiance is really cool too, fun and casual! First come first served"
"The food was great as well as the place. Tried the brisket, pulled pork and the ribs, all awesome."
"Food is very good. Staff has a attitude. No one is in dinning room to help you or wipe tables.  Greater tells you where to get in line and they one rule"" you must take out you plates and trash"". For a average plate charge of $20 without drinks you get to bus your table."
"Disappointment after reading all the great reviews  we went there so happy to try it! the brisket was all fat!!! no meat , pasta salad tasted like sprite!! horrible the potatoes salad is good and so are the links, it is overpriced for both of us it was about 50 dollars so around 25 per person ( 1 pound of brisket two sides and a link) go to SMOQUE it has a better flavor! we wont be returning ( get there early everything gets sold out and a huge line horrible experience)."
"I'm not going to write a fancy review here like most of the ones I have read.Here's  the basics  $11.00 for a sandwich and $4.00 for any sides. About $3.00 for a beverage.  Not enough meat on the sandwich it doesn't even hang over the side of the hamburger bun .  This place is way over priced for the portion amount. Not going back ever . You can go it has a nice atmosphere and if your a guy  a lot of good looking woman. And a nice bar.. No wait staff, no bus boys,. If you want something Go get it."
"kinda pricey but solid bbq...No need for sauces.my favs: brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs, hot links, pork belly, and broccoli slaw.not impressed with: frito pie, salmon, chicken.wait in line with a beer and order by the pound.love the ambiance and music selection...Cool smoker/kitchen setup.I will be a regular at this joint."
Super cool space.  Great BBQ- especially the brisket.  Bartenders were having fun and so were we.  The atmosphere is perfect for the menu.  I felt like was at  a hip backyard BBQ despite the freezing cold temps! Sound system and music were killin'.  Excited to go back!
The food is ok. But to pay over $120 for 4 people and have to bus your own table? Never going back. It's hipster therefore the service isn't great...
"I would consider myself a BBQ connoisseur and I thought this place was ok.  I thought it was over priced, nothing special about the BBQ sauces/rubs.  I personally think I make a better BBQ sauce. Also the sides were ok, how do you not have corn bread or mac and cheese at a BBQ joint??   What is cool is the atmosphere."
"Good brisket, tasty Mac salad and loved the coffee BBQ sauce.  The sweet tee drink was $10, had too much ice and didn't taste very strong.  I had a whiskey gingerale later that was much better.  The line to get food was a little awkwardly placed between the door, bar and row of tables. It Was annoying to stand in it and I kept having to move to make way for people coming by."
love the atmosphere and the food. Everything was delicious.
"Came here before a Blackhawk's game as it is only 10 minutes from the UC.  Walked right in and ordered (granted it was about 5:00 p.m.).  Servers and cashier were friendly and helpful.  We had the sliced brisket, baked beans,cole slaw and mac salad.  All of it was excellent.  The sauces were good especially the unique vinegar sauce.  Atmosphere and music is cool.  Bartender was a little odd. I asked for two glasses of ice for our Dr. Pepper and he seemed a bit indifferent.  Whatever.  Gave him a buck for his troubles ha ha ! Put in on your list."
"I've been here twice now, and the food is just OK, and so, so overpriced.  Hot links are best thing on the menu. Brisket and pulled meats just average. Not as good as others."
"Pretty expensive but so worth it! The brisket, chicken and potato salad were by far the highlight of the dining experience (we ordered almost everything on the menu). The BBQ sauces were all lacking - but I suspiciously feel that was done on purpose to make diners who are used to dousing their meals in condiments learn to eat and appreciate the well seasoned, perfectly cooked meats without the sauce. None of the meats needed sauce at all. It's a cool spot, the staff is super friendly. If you're looking for a place that serves you this is most definitely not the place to go. It's cafeteria style to the point that you even bus your own tables. But it's so awesome and a great addition to Randolph's restaurant row. My only complaint was that on a Wednesday night, the music was so loud that my friend and I had to scream to each other just for conversation."
"Amazing-ass brisket. Wow. Fatty, sweet, smoky...all the best things in the cut of meat. Great sides. I like the $4 serve yourself beer bucket. The 45 minute line for cafeteria style chow was annoying but forgivable because the food was so awesome and because the staff was so cool (""how is your night been?""). I'll be back."
"Just ate here tonight any my mind was blown.Totally in love with the ambiance - You feel like you stepped into a resurrected meat-packing warehouse where there's a non-stop, delicious meat-eating party, accompanied by early 70's metal.As for the food, it's the best BBQ Chicago has to offer.  (It's about time!)Prices are reasonable - Four of us spent $15 each (to share a big tray) and we were all happy.Bravo to these guys.  The grimy-yet-simple, unpretentious-yet-hipster aesthetic, combined with simply killer food was just great.  I'll definitely be back for more!P.S.  Vegans - stay home (unless you have an Instagram fetish)"
"This is a great place to eat, I had the pork belly and the brisket. The pork belly is a little peppery with great texture and overall wonderful. The brisket is tender and tasty.  The side dishes are gigantic, the coleslaw is tangy and flavored just the right amount of vinegar."
I haven't found better BBQ for the price. Not much more to add than what's already been said. Doesn't get more casual or no-nonsense than this. Great food and great atmosphere for hanging out with some friends. Worth ordering a few different servings and splitting them up between everyone. Don't bother going downstairs unless you can't deal with the wait at Wasabi though. That's the source of another review.
"Melt in your mouth pork belly! Fantastic! Decor is a hipster vibe I felt like I traveled back to Austin, TX. So happy to live so close. Hope to go back to see if they have live music to make my meal complete."
"Very cool place. Definitely has a unique vibe. Looks like (and probably was) an old warehouse. Love the lights hanging from the ceiling, the picnic table seating. The food is great, the bar is fully loaded. Really a fun place for a group dinner.It's probably not for everyone. It's loud, can be crowded, lines can be long. ... But if you're looking for something different, definitely check this place out."
"Came here for some BBQ and def hit the spot. While the beef rib was on the small side and very dry, the brisket and pulled pork def made up for it! The hot link had good snap and a lil spice but nothing to go nuts about. The brisket was the best (maybe even best in Chicago). Ordered a 1/2lb and they give 2 slices of lean and 2 of fatty w/ couple of juicy, crusty end piece nuggets. For the sides, the beans were pretty good w/ chunks of brisket and for a veg the broccoli salad hit the spot. You go and order your food by the 1/2lb and then find a communal table, similar to places in Lockhart. And can't go wrong w/ tub of beer for $3-$4, stay away from the cocktails, 80% ice. Cat wait for summer to chill outside w/ couple cold alone Stars and meat platter."
Went late at night on a Saturday.  Most of the BBQ was already gone but did get some mix of what was still available.  Good food and a unique environment.
Man their ribs and pork belly are delicious!  So are their beans!  Wish they had a few more sides to choose from. I will be back!
"What an experience! Everyone should try this place. Amazing BBQ food and atmosphere. Yes, you have to wait in line to order (counter-style) but the line moves fast and the food is well worth the wait. You will have a great time no matter who you are with. Eclectic group."
"had the brisket, which was really good. The atmosphere is also great. Would go again"
"Very good. The place is awesome. Very unique interior. While some thought the order process was a pain since you had to wait in line at the counter I didn't mind it. You can go to the bar first and grab a drink if you want. It also allow us to get in and out super quick. And now, the most important part... The food. 1. Brisket was very good. Nice texture and tenderness. Not quite as good as Smoque, but probably the second best I've had in the city. 2. The ribs were great. Excellent rub which was so good I didn't even think a sauce was needed. 3. Pulled pork was the best I've had in the city. Better than Smoque, Lillie's, Fat willys, Pork shoppe, bub, etc. The star of the show. 4. Sides were fine. The theme is to be like a backyard BBQ. The sides were salads, slaw, beans, etc. Would have been awesome to have some fries. The frito pie sounded amazing... But was underwhelming and we'll pass next time. 5. Sauces were just Ok. Was kind of disappointed by this. They were all mild (maybe intentionally), but I think having one stronger flavor profile would have been nice. Very good though, can't wait to go back!"
"This place is amazing!! I've been to a few BBQ places in Chicago and this is by far my favorite! The ambience and decor is really cool and unique. However, they play really loud music which makes it a little hard to have a conversation. They have someone to help you as soon as you walk in which is really helpful since it was our first time there. We got the beef ribs, pulled pork, potato salad and spicy pickles, everything was amazing! The drinks are delicious and strong and they have a great beer selection.They have a few different types of BBQ sauces and the coffee and spicy were definitely my favorite, the spicy sauce kind of creeps up on you. I can not wait to go back!"
Crush BBQ.  Love. And beer. Shout out to Dave.
"Arrived last night at opening time, 5pm, to beat the crowds. The bartender was friendly and helpful and the beer list was decent, a lot of Local Option beer on tap. There was no one in the food line yet, we walked right up and ordered the brisket, Frito pie, broccoli salad and the pickles to share. The food came with 4 pieces of white bread. Of the several different BBQ sauces, the coffee sauce was the tastiest. All the food was really good, especially the brisket, but the prices are somewhat steep. Next time we are going to try the hot link. The cafeteria style format worked well and reminded me of the BBQ joints in Nashville. After eating, we had margaritas made to order and they were excellent. By the time we left at 6:15pm, the was a long line for food."
"Great BBQ, decent prices, and large portions. Get here before 8 pm if you want to get a seat."
Yesterday was the first time I've ever been here and I absolutely lived the pork belly. It tasted great and I loved the atmosphere there.For the sides my fiancé and I got potato salad and beans and we loved it. I hope we come back here soon.
"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service! Would definitely go back. Went with a group of 5 and ordered a couple orders of the brisket (sooo delicious, my personal favorite), pork ribs, and all the sides they offered. Everything was awesome. Worth checking out. Great for groups or date night.Ended the night chatting with one of the workers greeting customers by the tables outside. He had an impressive beard and long hair and was the friendliest guy!  Green Street Smoked Meats are doing things right."
"Just ok.  I would go back to go to the bar, because the drinks were good and strong, and the atmosphere is interesting. Food was only 2 stars.  We first ordered the ribs (so chewy), brisket (average), and hot link (that was the best), and an assortment of sides (tasty but really skimpy portions).  That was expensive but we weren't at all full, so we went back for chicken (also average) and tamales (those were good). Kind of disappointed, because I love all the other restaurants in this group."
Why is everyone obsessed with comparing all smoked meat with the south? This is NOT the south its the midwest!! I strongly recommend this place for anyone that likes an awesome atmosphere with good food. Yes this place is still working out some kinks but they are brand new stop being so critical. The meat is well seasoned and smoky yet not overpowering.  Most peoples complaints stem from personal preference so find out for yourself you wont be disappointed.
"I got the sliced brisket and potato salad. I also tried the pork belly and the beans. Overall I still prefer the brisket at Blackwoods, although that place is only open for lunch. I liked the pork belly and the sides were competent."
