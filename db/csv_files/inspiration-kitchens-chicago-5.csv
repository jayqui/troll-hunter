Inspiration Kitchens
"Three generations of us had Fathers' Day brunch and enjoyed ourselves. Our server was very friendly and welcoming. All our food was tasty and filling, with enough spice to make it more than run of the mill. Coffee was excellent and piping hot. The fellow busing the table jumped the gun and cleared our plates while my wife was in the restroom, but he seemed to be learning and that's a common beginner's mistake. One reason we chose this cafe' was to support their mission of training ppl to work in food service. They don't take reservations and were full almost all morning. About half the crowd seemed to be regulars; the rest newbies like us. We all agreed we'll becoming back. Overall, it was a four star day but the fifth star - and generous tip - were for the chance to help others while enjoying a tasty meal."
"Went after a 5k at montrose beachService was excellent!  Brunch was inventive, delicious, and served quickly. I had the biscuit and chicken benedict. My wife had the chorizo egg white omelete withe guac. I opted for the maple bacon cinnamon roll as well. Everything was tasted great!Wonderful brunch at a wonderful restaurant that works to give back to the community! Inspiration indeed!"
"So many awesome things to say about this place. We had brunch there this weekend and the service was wonderful, the staff attentive and friendly (very, very friendly- some of the nicest people!). The food is good, solid choices on the menu and everything was pretty tasty. What I love most is that they are a mission-oriented organization, the restaurant is part of their training program and every meal you purchase goes back to helping more people. What more could you ask for? Definitely give this place a try!"
"A gem in Uptown!My boyfriend lives in that cesspool, and I never imagined getting yummy food within walking distance from his place, but Inspiration Kitchens is the perfect place for brunch. The benedicts are truly inspired and the staff are delightful and welcoming. We had the Cantina Benedict and the chicken & biscuit benedict, and I cannot wait to return. The good stuff that is the backbone of the place is just hollandaise on the eggs."
"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The service was so very attentive and nice (our coffees and water glasses were never even close to empty).  At one point, the hostess was moving a table around so someone could get into their table.  They thanked her.  Her response?  ""No worries.  Only love here!""The food was incredible.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  And they use REAL cream!  I'm really tired of going to restaurants and getting that 'not necessary to refrigerate' stuff.  Also, fresh flowers on each table.This was a feel-good meal.  I love when places support their communities.  You should read up on Inspiration Kitchens.  What a great concept.  Our meals: The Whole Pig Breakfast Skillet (*drool*) and the Breakfast Panini (*more drool*).  The breakfast potatoes were perfectly crisp and delicious, too.  We will be back!"
"Delightful experience. When you walk in the door, a large painted sign greets you ""Dine well. Do good."" Both are achieved by choosing to dine at Inspiration Kitchens. Amanda, one of the employees, was prompt, polite, gave great recommendations and told us lots about Inspiration Corp. Food was scrumptious - especially the crispy Brussels sprouts and roasted red pepper soup. Overall great mission and great food."
"So while the brunch scene in uptown is still growing, a few places stand out and this is one of them.  Food:  I typically get the same two things.  Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy, or the Whole Pig Skillet.  If you're a pork lover then the latter is definitely the way to go.  I've never really had anything bad here, although I will say that I think they do savory much better than they do sweet, but that may also be a personal preference.Staff:  Seriously.  I read some guys review that the staff is rude. Judging by the tone of his review, I suspect he's the one with the attitude problem.  This staff is amazing and so friendly.  You'll note others make this same review.  See David N 3/23/15.  The waiters are super attentive, the manager comes around often.  She's chatty, but I happen to like that.  She knows her customers and goes out of her way to please.  The only complaint I've ever had here was that once my meal wasn't quite warm enough.  This place is great and you rarely have the monstrous waits that you do up the road at Tweet (that's not a diss of Tweet as I also love them)"
"Consistency is key, and this place continues to serve up delicious food (breakfast panini + chicken& biscuits) at great prices. Service is prompt and friendly. Coffee is hot, tasty, comes with real cream and refills. I'm so glad to have them in the neighborhood."
"The food was amazing!! I ordered the strawberry cheese cake stuffed french toast. Yes, I know sooo good. And it's not expensive at all. Great customer service, very clean, and cute small business look. Will definitely be eating here again for breakfast Everything in the menu looks good you can't go wrong."
"Why hadn't I been here sooner???!!I was sold on this place even before we arrived based off of two facts: The goal of the restaurant is to help those who are homeless/impoverished find employment and gain skills and its BYOB with no corkage fee! The atmosphere is cozy, with seating also available outdoors.I had the breakfast platter consisting of scrambled eggs, french toast, bacon (they ran out of turkey sausage) and breakfast potatoes. It was simple, yet filling. Presentation was clean and spot on! The customer service here - amazing. Everyone was an absolute sweetheart, which does nothing but enhance the experience. I was told by my friend I was dining with that the Garfield location has a different menu which consists of shrimp and grits (yum!), so I'll definitely have to check that out!"
"I work for a nonprofit that partners with Inspiration Corporation, so I try to go to Inspiration Kitchens as often as I can. This place is amazing. You're giving to the community by eating here, but you're not compromising quality. The food here is always great and affordable. The Cuban sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Great food, great prices, great mission. Can't beat that!"
"To dine with a good cause! At Inspiration Kitchens, they are dedicated to helping those whom have been hardest hit by homelessness and poverty. They offer individuals an opportunity to acquire valuable skills and experience that lead to employment in the food service industry.My parents and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon and were immediately seated. IK is petite but you will not feel cramped in the clean and crisp interior design. There is also outdoor seating for those whom would like to bake in the sun as they dine in. We ordered the vegetarian omelet, breakfast platter, and barbecue pulled pork benedict. Each of the entrees came with a side of potatoes and small cup of ketchup. The portions were just right with flavors steering towards the lighter end. I had the benedict and I was pleased it was not heavily sauced which I usually find overwhelming. The caramelized onion atop the pulled pork had a good effect in balancing the flavors with one being sour-tangy and the other being a sweet spice. Street parking was relatively easy to find. There are pay boxes but it's free on Sundays."
"I love that they are a mission oriented organization, the restaurant is part of a training program and every meal you purchase goes back to helping people.As we arrived, the place was packed so we waited for 10 minutes right outside the door. Our waitress came out & gave my 2 year old a toy to play with while we wait for a table. Once our table was clear, we were seated right away with 2 glass of water while we wait for my friends to come. My son was sitting down watching youtube while we just waited. About a few minutes into sitting, a waiter passes by the table fall down & the ice cold water was spilled on me & my son. NO STAFF came by to ask if my son or I was alright instead we got dirty looks because they think we spilled the cup of water that is why the waiter fell down. In reality, we were just sitting down & watching tv. My cell phone was soak so the table next to us gave me napkin to wipe my cell phone & my 2 year old shirt. The floor was drown with water & they tried to mop it with table cloth. So I request to change table, the waitress gave me a look like you are seriously want to change table. While another waitress came by & ask what is wrong. The 2nd waitress did clean the other table so that we can sit down.  By this time, I am piss off. Terrible service and not treated with respect. It took 5 minutes in while sitting in the new table for a menu then 10 minutes for 2 cup of water. I just kept looking around for a waitress but they kept ignoring me. So I went to the counter to ask for orange juice. Once my friends arrived, the waitress came by fast to take our order. Food was alright, they forgot my bacon in my dish so they brought it out separate plate but half of it was burned. My kid's food was good, I have ordered him a mickey mouse pancake. My friends liked their dishes. We kept hearing plates dropping inside the kitchen which doesnt give me much confidence on the staff. But overall, I wouldnt come back here to eat because of the terrible service."
"Bottom line: Nice local neighborhood place with friendly staff.Time: Brunch around 11 with 3 friends.Service: Friendly.- Very attentive and alert. - I really appreciated the waitress going through the menu and providing recommendations.Food - On point.- Got the chicken and biscuits benedict as recommended. The fried chicken was moist and instead of an English muffin, it is replaced with a fluffy buttery biscuit. Also comes with a side of potatoes or greek yogurt. Both sides are delicious.- Coffee was a bit watered down for my taste, so I might order orange juice next time. Overall, glad my friend suggested this place. It is a great place with an amazing concept. Very inspiring and definitely worth checking out. Get the chicken and biscuits. Surprisingly not that heavy, so don't worry and you can always counter it with some greek yogurt!"
Love their food and I feel good supporting such an awesome sustainable idea. Heart is full.
"Rude staff, overpriced food made by people learning to cook. AVOID this place at all cost, a million better brunch places to go. French toast is two poor slices of toast... literally."
"Great breakfast at a good price. The food here is a bit different from your typical breakfast, but is definitely something to try out. The eggs benedict with the fried chicken is a must have, along with the biscuits and gravy with chorizo. I felt a bit rushed when ordering and their credit card machine was down, but I will be back regardless!"
"One of the best deals for brunch in the city! We walked to Inspiration Kitchens after running the Make A Wish Foundation 5K at Montrose Beach. An interesting concept about this restaurant is that it has a social mission to provide social services to Chicago's homeless and help individuals transition out of homelessness by training and providing tangible skills in the food service industry. They even provide housing assistance for these individuals! I ordered the BBQ pulled pork benedict which was tasty and a satisfying portion after our morning's race. Everyone else ordered different items, but all were impressed with their dishes. All of the dishes were $10 or under. We had a friendly waitress, and the service was professional. She even gave us free coffee! Tip: Our waitress mentioned that it would be helpful to the business if we paid in cash. Luckily we happened to bring cash!"
"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because of their mission. We came for dinner on a Saturday evening, and the place was nearly empty.  The star of the 6 plates we had was an amazing roasted cauliflower entree, with quinoa, and a Romesco sauce and an olive tapenade that both complemented the cauliflower extremely well.  The appetizers were solid (crispy Brussels sprouts, fried goat cheese salad), but the dessert course was pretty underwhelming: my bread pudding was dense, and my partner's strawberry fried pies were underdone (the pastry was pale instead of brown). So overall, some hits and misses, and while it wasn't amazing, I love the price point ($24 for 3 courses), and I definitely plan to be back to check out their brunch."
"Fantastic brunch spot. Given that Uptown has been going through a lengthy and controversial gentrification process over the years, Inspiration Kitchens seems the perfect balance between competing interests.  Inspiration hires people from the neighborhood looking for training and job skills. Inspiration gives an intro to the food industry and puts people to work so they can stay in the neighborhood and have marketable skills. The end goal being to end homelessness and give locals the skills, confidence, and competence to bridge the class divide despite their life experiences, whatever they may be, that have made life in Chicago a struggle. Add to that the fact that this restaurant has STELLAR service and exceptional food and you really can't go wrong. I ordered their hash and was very happy with my meal, the presentation, and our waitress.  She greeted me like she knew me and I had to tell her it was my first time there. She was surprised and I was left feeling very welcomed.  My companions ordered the eggs benedict, the classic breakfast with french toast, and we all shared coffee as well as an order of tea. Inspiration Corporation is a socially conscious business  providing exceptional, lasting, relevant training. The proof is in the excellent food and service. I hope you go."
"Inspiration Kitchens is one of the coolest concepts I've heard of, and I wish there were more restaurants like this around. Read their story on their website! The staff are attentive, efficient, and very friendly. BYOB makes it even better. The prix fix dinner is a deal you won't find anywhere else in Chicago and you definitely get your money's worth. The sweet potato latkes we got as an appetizer were my favorite dish but the Brussels sprouts were spot on also. Brunch has some great dishes as well... The croque Madame and the whole pig did not disappoint, especially washed down with mimosas. Portions for both brunch and dinner were huge. The place is really tiny and somehow usually always almost full, but we've never had to wait for a table."
"What a lovely concept! Dine well & Do good!The menu was unique, food was excellent - I enjoyed my root vegetable hash. Service was good but I think this was the busiest they've been and everyone was scrambling to keep head above water."
"Love coming to a restaurant with such a great mission and plan to help its community members. And no mistaking it, the food is REALLY tasty. I had the cantina Benedict which had a totally bright and spicy cilantro hollandaise sauce , fresh veggies and corn with black beans. The Greek yogurt aide is worth a try-- super rich with a homemade blackberry compote to top it off.  Great service, casual atmosphere, reasonable prices, and street parking nearby. If you don't try it, you're missing out!"
"This place was great!  We had a group of 5 for brunch this morning, and everybody loved the food.  It's BYOB and a carafe of OJ is only $5, so your mimosas go a long way.  I had the chicken and biscuit benedict, and it was amazing.  Perfectly poached eggs, and the house potatoes were nice and crispy.  Love their mission, definitely will be back."
"What to say?Place:The decoration is very good, the place is very comfortable and you feel very goodFood:Fresh food, plate very weel done with good presentation. Order the soup they are very good !Service:Very professional, all well done, sympatic Price: For a quality like this the price is very cheep"
"This place was amazing for the price point. The food was delicious (I had the Cantina Benedict) and the staff was very attentive. THE FOOD:My eggs Benedict was absolutely perfect. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection (I told the waitress to compliment the chef on the perfection of the poached eggs), and the home fries were just right, crispy, but not greasy. THE STAFF:We had some group members who had several dietary restrictions, and the staff were gracious in not only identifying what on the menu would suite them, but also offering to modify the order to make it work for them the way they wanted it. They even had regular cream AND soy milk for my vegan friends' coffee. They would check in and fill up our drinks regularly without making you feel like they were breathing down your neck (do you know how rare that sometimes is to find?). It was the perfect balance. OVERAL:We all left very satisfied with our meals and want to go back for brunch next time we are in uptown. By the way, did I mention that they help train people who are down on their luck? How amazing is that? Not only is the food delicious, but they are giving something back to the community. RATING RATIONALI'm giving this place five stars because:1) The food tasted awesome for the price point. 2) The staff was very attentive and were able to walk that fine line between being present when needed but not overly there. 3) They not only made our dietary constraints work, but made you feel like it was truly no problem at all. THANKS GUYS!"
Great food for a great cause :)
"Inspiration Kitchens is a great community restaurant. ""Here at Inspiration Kitchens, we help individuals gain valuable skills and experience that lead to employment in the food service industry."" Not only is the food affordable, it is pretty dang good and the service is also great.I had the Cantina Benedict (guacamole, roasted tomato, black bean and corn salsa, topped with poached eggs on an English muffin and cilantro hollandaise, with your choice of breakfast potatoes or Greek yogurt) with potatoes which I loved! The guacamole has quite a kick to it and makes the whole dish a little spicy.My friend had the The Whole Pig Breakfast Skillet (braised pork, bacon, ham, caramelized onions and potatoes topped with two sunny eggs and barbeque sauce). I didn't try any, but his plate was licked clean before I could even ask.Definitely love the sense of community that Inspiration Kitchens thrives for. Can't wait to come back!"
"The brunch here is out of this world. My friend and I came here after trying to find a brunch restaurant in the uptown area. A 4.5 star average restaurant is a rarity indeed so my friend and I decided we had to check it out. I initially got confused because I went to the inspiration kitchen training center instead of the actualy restaurant. Luckily for me, it was only a few blocks away. I just wish that were a bit clearer on the other's yelp page. Anyways had to go BIG as I always do for brunch and got the whole pig breakfast skillet. Talk about meatzilla city over here: two eggs on top of tender braised pork mixed with a king's medley of bacon, ham and onions covering some perfectly crisp breakfast potatoes. It was an impressively meaty meal and the barbecue sauce that came with it was tangy with a slight spicy kick making the perfect condiment. Don't know how I only paid $10 for my meal but was smiling in delight while rubbing my belly for a couple hours afterward. My friend had the breakfast platter and she enjoyed it though it definitely didn't look half as exciting as my skillet.There was no wait on a ridiculously nice 12PM Sunday afternoon so either we were really lucky or not enough people know about this place. The service was excellent and the restaurant was classy and clean. Loved my experience here!"
"Came here for Sunday brunch after hearing such great reviews from friends. They certainly led me in the right direction as I've found a spot I love for multiple reasons.  I think we arrived around 11:30am and were seated immediately.  (does this happen anywhere in chicago?  no... except here (smile)).  The décor was modern and room was decently full.  Every staff member seemed busy and happy.   My brunch buddy was a frequent customer and some of the staff greeted him with hugs!  (so cute!)  We had Jackie and Ann who served and both of them were beyond wonderful!  They were all smiles, working each table with grace, and you could just tell they enjoyed what they were doing.  Both had us laughing and feeling great about being there.  There was a little water spot on the glass and one of them immediately found us new glasses (I saw her spot checking all of them to be sure they were all clean).  Excellent service!Brunch is BYOB so of course we brought champagne for mimosa's!  We had them chill one bottle in the back while we drank the other.  My brunch buddy ordered the hash and I tried the pulled pork benedict.  There was barely even a wait - the food came out so fast!  Both dishes were delish!  Seriously, yum!!  They did a great job with plating and portion sizes. So, there you have it - This is a wonderful and inspiring concept for a restaurant combined with an actual job training program that works, in addition to a restaurant that is better functioning and less expensive with servers who are thankful and actually enjoy their jobs.  So ultimately - eating here is a better situation than eating at some of the more expensive restaurants in the city where service is subpar and prices are outrageous... and you can feel great about supporting such a wonderful initiative.I'll definitely be back here again and highly recommend you check this place out.  And... if you really want to leave a great tip - leave the extra bottle of champagne with the staff. We did and I've never seen a group of people so happy in my LIFE.  When we told them it was theirs, they celebrated and all started hugging each other with excitement.  Rightfully so, they are clearly proud of all they have accomplished and they deserve to have a little drink to celebrate.  Each one of them makes my heart smile and I can't wait for my return visit to see them (and of course for the food) again."
Excellent food and service was extraordinary. The staff were so friendly and on top of things. This place has a great backbone and you'd be silly not to support their cause! I had the breakfast panini and would definitely order it again.
"Everything was fantastic and the idea behind this place is FANTASTIC, way to go! Can't wait to go back!"
"So you like to eat while helping out the community?  Go to Inspiration Kitchens, which helps homeless Chicagoans get back on their feet by providing foodservice training.  Their culinary programs teaches new cooks to pound out flavorful dishes like ""The Whole Pig"" and spicy eggs benedict.  Coffee is from Intelligentsia, and your cup will runneth over.  Pricewise, this is one of the best deals in the city.  Averaging around $10 - $12 per entree, you'll be wanting to order a second dish just because it's so affordable."
"Check out the pictures I just posted of the Valentines Day Menu that Inspiration Kitchens cooked up. I was looking for a restaurant to dine at for Valentines day, and had always wanted to try Inspiration Kitchens. I called and was able to snag the last table reservation for the evening. Well good thing I did, the dinner was nothing but amazing!!! Friendly service, great food and awesome atmosphere. I will say I was a bit disappointing that they took the regular menu away but again was pleasantly surprised with the Valentines Day menu. The only bad part is I am going to have to return to try the regular Prix Fixe Menu. What a shame! (Not Really). I  completely agree with the mission and vision of the organization and would be more than happy to return. (Not to mention the food and service was awesome!)Oh yeah FYI- BYOB!!"
"Yelpers rarely disappointed (at least from my experience) so we came here for some brunch based on Yelp reviews.  This was a small breakfast place and there was street parking in front of the restaurant.  I'm sure you would be able to find parking close by and walk over if the parking in front was full.  It wasn't busy around 10:15am so we were able to sit anywhere we wanted to.  There were a few people there enjoying their meals. Our waitress was nice and made a few suggestions like ordering the Omelet ($8) #3 which was the ham, cheddar, and spinach.  She told me that the omelet was a pretty big and it would be hard to finish so I had to see if she was correct. lol  My friend ordered the French Toast ($6) which she later changed to Pancakes ($6) because she didn't like cinnamon in the French Toast.  It took awhile before our food came out but we weren't in a rush.The Omelet looked small but it was a lot.  I enjoyed my Omelet and the potatoes it came with were good.  I was pretty full when I finished it so she was correct. lol  I tried some of my friend's pancakes and it was very fluffy.  That got me craving for some pancakes later on our trip.  My friend didn't seem to enjoy her food but she was like that ever since she told our waitress that she didn't want the French Toast because of the cinnamon.  Well, this review was about my experience and not hers so I liked my food. lolI thought this place was good and definitely worth checking out.  The prices were good in my opinion.  I would definitely come back if I go back to Chicago."
"Excellent place for Sunday Brunch!  I don't know if they change their menu, but if the Cantina Benedict is on the menu, ORDER IT!  Delicious.   Coffee is good too."
"Went here with 2 friends at 10 am on a cold Saturday and really enjoyed the food and experience. When we walked in, there were no tables available, but a server acknowledged us and said she'd seat us ASAP. There was no list, but we were not forgotten. As soon as we were seated, our server told us the specials and let us know they were running low on some of the day's pastries. We ordered the bacon cinnamon roll to share, and it was delicious. We were all having trouble deciding what to order, but our server did not rush us despite the crowd, and she kept our coffees quite full. I settled on the Southwest Benedict, and was shocked at how much food I received for the price. It was a well-balanced dish and I did not have to season it at all to my own taste. When we were ready to leave, they split our checks and we were out the door quickly. I would like to return and try some other items, though I will target a less crowded time- maybe 9 or 11 am would be better than our selected hour."
AWESOME! The food was exceptionally good. Very tasteful and well crafted. The service is good and the environment is good looking.
"Just had brunch here with my two friends. I live right around the corner and have been meaning to dine here for quite some time. Heard their food was incredible and after reading the other reviews, I had to finally check it out. First of all, I love their mission. Dining there in itself contributes to a great cause. (Read their story, because they are making a difference in the lives of the less fortunate). Their food is amazing! From the presentation to the flavor to the satisfaction, it's a total home run. Beautifully presented and the mix of flavors are wonderful. I left soooo full and satisfied. I had the vegetable hash which was incredible. My friend had the chicken and biscuit Benedict. Both were so amazing and such a great mix of flavors (sweet & spice). For dessert we had the turtle cheesecake French toast. I definitely recommend ending your meal with this to share amongst a group. It's a brilliant dish! Add this place to your list of brunch places around chicago. I wanna check out their dinner next, which looks fantastic as well."
Not sure what everyone is raging about from inspiration.Our whole meal was mediocre at best. I wish I just would have gone to Nookies instead of making the drive.Our waitress was awesome. Very nice woman in a Sox hat. Solid. That's where the good stops. Poached egg. Way over cooked. Eggs over easy. Way over cooked. Potatoes were near burnt and our food was lukewarm.We'll give you guys another run. Hope its better than this previous experience.
"A breakfast gem in Uptown! Finally, a nice cozy non pretentious breakfast spot just down the block from where I live. The wait staff are very attentive with smiles and don't talk like its been rehearsed (Normal, down to earth people? Gasp!) Waitress checked on us what I call a ""perfect"" amount of times. It's small, but very impressive for the quality they give.  Two thumbs up!! I'll definitely be back!"
"Their veggie hash with eggs and garlic pesto may be my favorite brunch dish. Great flavor. Filling, but not gut busting. Close to the el, and well worth the trip up."
"Delicious little place for brunch. I like the concept of helping others move forward and such a great way to help those who need it to the most. The service was great and the food was yummy! Got the root vegetable hash (added ham, haha), and it was just a good portion and the flavors went well with one another. Simple and delicious. Would come back again!"
"i love this place!while i prefer their dinner to their breakfast, they really are a wonderful restaurant. the staff is always very welcoming and patient. they are friendly and attentive. i love coming here because its pretty cheap as well with great meals.their food is pretty tasty! any of their pulled pork stuff is AMAZING. my favorite is the braised pork pierogis! also, in regards to accommodations: they also a really relaxed about any changes you may request -- i asked for mayo on the side and they gave me multiple options because they said i had to try the garlic aioli (which was fantastic!). they also have course meals -- ridiculously cheap too! 5 courses for $36 and 3 courses for $22. my boyfriend and i go here for breakfast because its cheap and tasty.i really love this place and what they do. their mission is fantastic. i highly suggest everyone check it out :)"
"This place is amazing!! Delicious food,  extremely reasonably priced and super friendly staff. Will be back for sure!"
"Good little place with great service.  We were able to sit on the patio with no wait and have our puppy.  The menu is a little limited, but everything we had was delicious. Creative offerings were much appreciated!"
"Inspiration Kitchens is part of a social enterprise which teaches people in need or looking for a fresh start culinary or service skills. Those in the program have very high job placement after.Putting that great cause aside. I'll cover our dining experience. The service was amazing. Perfect, and I can be picky. The decor and ambiance are very classy. Not only those 3 cool things but $20 for five course prix fixe and BYOB with no corkage?!? Awesome, right? As always I ordered impeccably.Crawfish Cakes with Cajun aioli and arugula salad Delicious and meaty. The sauce was fantastic. Shrimp and Grits with red eye gravy and scallionsSpicy. Not as good as mine, but nothing to sneeze at.Lentil soup with bacon (x2)We both liked it. It wasn't skimpy on the bacon.Lyonnaise salad with arugula, bacon, sunny egg, carmelized shallots, and red wine vinegarette.I don't think my partner liked it.Goat Cheese salad with Panko breaded goat cheese balls, spinach, toasted pecans and honey balsamic vinegarette. Great. All the elements complemented each other.Grilled hanger steak medium rare with a generous portion of well seasoned parsnip purée and chimmichuri (x 2)I really liked this dish. The flavor profile was complex. My partner didn't care for the parsnip purée or the chimmichuri. For dessert I got the sweet potato bread pudding and he ordered red velvet beignets. They were both really sweet and rich. The texture of the beignets disappointed; crisp on the outside but mushy inside. My bread pudding was good but rich and dense. I wish they had some other dessert options that are lighter or less sweet. Like a gelato or ice cream. We love those.I considered it a terrific meal and a steal at $20 for 5 courses, Byob, and fantastic service and atmosphere. I look forward to returning."
"We went during Sunday brunch and had the best eggs benedict I've ever tasted.  Specifically, it was the Cantina Benedict.  The best.  It also came with roasted potatoes which were skillfully cooked (lightly crisp on the outside, soft inside and most importantly NOT greasy).  My girlfriend had a chicken avocado wrap and that was tasty as well.   Their menu changes occasionally though.  We sat outside which was pleasant and service was nice.  The manager came out and gave us a courteous heads up that our food may take longer than usual since they had a full house.  Still, our dishes were ready in less than 15 minutes.Caveat: If you're looking for huge portions (large enough for two meals) and multi-page menus like those Greek diners, this is not the place.  Inspiration Kitchens does seem to be focused in what they offer and what they do, they perform with care."
"A good buddy of mine from work was raving about this place as he heard I had just moved Uptown. One of the great things about this place and its other location in Garfield Park is that it gives an opportunity to people that are poverty stricken & homeless or maybe an ex-con to have a job/2nd chance at being successful .My first trip was for dinner in which you have a choice of a 3 course meal and a 5 course meal. Me and my dining companion opted for the 5 course as I have heard great things. I started with the roasted red pepper arancini (very good) and then I had the curry chicken soup (star of the show...delicious). The charred caesar salad was good and then the pan seared tilapia vesuvio was very good as well. I got the flourless chocolate cake w/caramel for dessert and it was very rich and delicious...I needed a cold glass of milk to go with that...lol. My dining companion got the strawberry fried pie as I told her my buddy raved about it. She allowed me to try and it was as good as my buddy from work said it wold be. It really was a fried pie with lots of sugar and vanilla ice cream...good as hell!!!! This five course me was $26 a piece and was as good as any downtown/west loop restaurant that charges $150-200 for the same thing.I came back again for brunch as I heard that would be even better than the actual dinner. The root vegetable hash is my go to here as it a variety of root vegetables with roasted potatoes, pesto, two eggs your way and garlic & herbs...astounding! The place is BYOB for lunch and dinner so make sure you bring a bottle of wine (or 2) or bubble for the brunch mimosas. Service is impeccable here as I have had stellar service on every occasion here....shout out to the servers I had: Ann, Traci & Jackie :) The place itself isn the biggest but they make up for it with the delicious meals and great service. The fact that I live nearby means that I will be here constantly. Good stuff!"
"What a great deal! Most of the items for breakfast/ brunch were under 10 dollars when other places easily would have charged 15 and up. This is a small place but with somewhat of an upscale vibe.  Our waitress was great and seated us right away, we were lucky a table opened up as we walked in but I can see that this places gets packed quickly.I got the smoke salmon eggs benedict. The eggs were poached very nicely. The potatoes that I picked as a side could have been a little more crispier. One person at the table got the ""The Whole Pig Breakfast Skillet"". I tried the braised pork and that was phenomenal. Had I known I probably would have gotten that dish instead. Brunch is my favorite meal and this place definitely is a great place to go for it!"
"My friend and I came here for dinner.  The place was very cute - I had the Chicken Tortilla Salad that came with chunks of tortilla, seasoned with chilies, tomato sauce, and sour cream - this was okay, but the chicken was a little too dry; my friend had the sweet potato tempura which was nicely fried and came with a very sweet hoison sauce on the side (that was not necessary); I had the Pasta e Fagioli that came with white beans in a chicken broth with diced carrots and a melted cheese on a crostini on top, which was a nice added touch; the Spinach Salad with bacon was very simple and not too overdressed with the dressing; the Ribeye Roulade was good, and I liked the diced roasted potatoes with bleu cheese crumble on top - the steak had a nice roulade sauce that complemented it well; my friend had the Banana Crepes, which had caramelized banana slices on top that was really good, but the thick caramel sauce underneath was way too sweet; I really loved my dessert, which were the Sabayon pears - this was a delicate dish with nice poached pears in a custard sabayon sauce - very cool and refreshing, and came iwth a few sugar cookies on the side.  Great service and the interior was nicely decorated with sleek lines.+Ribeye Roulade+Sabayon pears dessert+friendly service"
"So, being a KC resident who is rightly proud of our city's BBQ, imagine my surprise when I found out that there was BBQ for breakfast on the menu here at IK.  I had the ""Whole Pig Breakfast Skillet"" for $10.  Here are the ingredients:Braised pork, bacon, ham, caramelized onions and potatoes topped with two sunny eggs and barbeque sauce.  (You can get them over easy - I did.)Small place, great food, good service."
"The cause is obviously the big reason to go, and I really applaud the concept. My fiancé had the breakfast platter which was pretty standard, nothing great nothing bad. I had the Croque Madame and it was genuinely disgusting how much bechamel was put on. Really I would be embarrassed if I had gotten this in front of friends, it was just so gross. No sandwich needs to be made into a soup."
"Ins-poo-ration Shitkins; or, Inspiring Community Service ... Mediocre Kitchens.Babes came up with these alternative names. We passed umpteen crazies on the way there, shoulda known.Five stars for the community outreach and our server's enthusiasm. But don't go for the food."
"LOVE this place. Delicious food, friendly service and a wonderful cause!  Everything on the menu is fantastic - I especially like the brussel sprouts and curried chicken soup."
"Amazing. The food was awesome and the service was fantastic. They kept the food to a short list, they performed well on it. Very few impressed!!"
"I love the concept and have been wanting to check out Inspiration Kitchens for awhile. Inspiration Kitchen's mission is to help individuals affected by poverty by providing social services such as food service training. We arrived around 1:00pm on a Sunday. Every table was occupied! I was afraid we were not going to get seating, but luckily there was not much of wait. The host was very accommodating and our server was very attentive and friendly. We came pretty late, so a few of the things were already off the menu.I ordered the ham, spinach and swiss omelette with greek yogurt. The omelette was delicious, not too salty. The greek yogurt, amazing! It came drizzled with this strawberry sauce on top. It almost tasted like ice cream! My friends got the french toast and really liked it as well. I would love to check out the Garfield Park location next!"
"As newcomers to Uptown, we are really hoping to find some things that make it a little less difficult to move out of Lakeview. Fortunately, Inspiration Kitchens is a little light in our current tunnel vision.We decided to stop for Sunday brunch and sat inside. The patio looks nice, but I didn't have my sunglasses.So...the review: The interior of the place is simple, but comfortable. It was about half-full, so the noise level was pretty low. Everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. The menu, while somewhat limited, offered plenty of yummy-sounding choices. The hubster picked out French toast, and I ordered the croque madame (grilled ham and swiss with an egg on top). DE-LISH! The French toast had the perfect level of eggy and cinnamon goodness. The croque madame was (and will be again when I eat the leftovers) a huge plate of cheesy awesomeness. Ann was our hostess, server, and guide to the area once we said we had just moved up here. She gave us the story and mission of the place with obvious pride. Our service was quick, never pushy, and always very polite. She also generously gave us some pointers on some other good and not-so-good spots in the area. We were given the dinner menus to keep - they also do take-away! - and that food sounded pretty fab as well. Ann said they even get out the white tablecloths and candles for dinner, so it's probably quite the nice meal.I'm holding out the last star for our next trip to the Kitchens, for dinner with BYOB and no corkage fee, and have high expectations that I'll be giving that coveted 5th star shortly after that meal."
Service is very good. I've been here a couple of times and I can say the staff is wonderful and very positive. Cozy environment and good food an coffee!! I will recommend this place to everyone.
Quick and flavorful! Walked here one morning with 3 of my friends. Both the restaurant and portions were small but detailed nonetheless.
"Great people, amazing cause, is there anything better than inspiration kitchens? Run! Don't walk :)"
"This review is long overdue. If a well priced and amazingly executed menu served by an energetic and caring staff isn't enough to get you in the door, look up what the organization does for people in the community (see Inspiration Corporation). I cannot thank Annie and crew enough for making the total dining experience so satisfying. Their million dollar attitude comes out in their creations. Something as simple as a fried goat cheese salad (yes, fried goat cheese) can fill your stomach and put a smile on your face. Regulars also know that their soups are all delicious. Pop in for brunch or make some weeknight dinner plans...you will leave happy.Keep up the great work Inspiration Kitchens! You are a gem in the Uptown neighborhood!"
"Inspiration Kitchens' mission statement of ""helping those during their hard times"" was what drew me to check out this restaurant for my 25th birthday. Service:  The service was on point - friendly, attentive, and fun sassy  :) .  Amanda was our server; she was amazing - probably provided one of the best customer service I've experienced since moving to the Midwest (especially for a party of 8)! Food: Pricing and food quality was decent. The diner menus are preset with a 3-course and 5-course option. Amongst the 8 of us, we probably sampled their whole menu. For recommendations, go for the Strawberry Fried Pies and the Crispy Brussels Sprouts.Atmosphere: The dining area is small, so it could get busy and crowded pretty quickly. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time for bigger parties. There was only one bathroom so that might be a slight inconvenience. Otherwise, great place overall :)"
"I think the food is okay.  I can't say it stands out all that much but the service and idea of this restaurant, I admire.  You can't really see the people really trying to work hard and they're so pleasant and nice, so full of energy.  I applaud the owner or creator of this idea of business.  Helping those in need and not by merely donating but something that will help those to improve themselves. Providing them with a skill set but most important,  providing hope.  I hope those who have participated in this restaurant's program, really do make the most of it and strive for the better future."
"I made a reservation for Mother's Day and was excited to check this place out. The reviews were very positive and the menu looked great. Come to find out they are having a prix fixe menu for Mother's Day - which I wasn't told when I called, nor was it indicated on their website. A little frustrating that our party had come based on the great reviews, looked over the menu in advance- and weren't able to order from the menu! OK, no big deal. Can you just sub out the scrambled eggs for over easy egg? No? Really? That's kind of silly. The staff was friendly enough and the food was fine. We left without feeling great about the experience because we had been eager to order from the menu, and that wasn't an option. How does a restaurant not communicate a today-only prixe fixe menu to people when they call, nor indicate it on their website??  The unwillingness to sub out 1 egg is a little irritating as well."
"This place was fantastic! We were trying to eat at Tweet, which turned out to be more than an hour to get seated, so we Yelp'd this place nearby, and we were all pleasantly surprised! Quick friendly service, and here's what we tried:Mint-Chocolate Chip pancakes for St. Patrick's Day weekend: Savory and not too minty. Perfect balance and just the right amount of chocolate to dip your pancakes in.Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy: Two of my breakfast favorites combined into one. It's pretty much as awesome as you'd expect, but you should split this with a friend and order a main dish too. Salmon Eggs Benedict: Good, but not great. Pretty much what you'd expect flavor-wise.The Whole Pig Breakfast Skillet: Braised pork, bacon, ham, caramelized onions and potatoes topped with two sunny eggs and barbeque sauce. What part of that DOESN'T sound delicious? Our whole party agreed that that was our favorite dish.We tried something else, I don't remember the last dish. But I would gladly come here again!We were welcomed, seated within 10 minutes, and finished our meal faster than it took to even get a seat at Tweet, and we took our time eating! I think that's a victory for our group! I'd love to eat here again."
"Planned to have brunch with a friend today at Tweet, just down the street, but around noon the wait was almost two hours...so we looked for a new place and decided on Inspiration Kitchen. Very small (like maybe 10 tables or less??), quaint place; street parking could be difficult but we lucked out with a decent spot on a side street. We were seated right away and a super nice waitress took our drink orders and have us time to check the menu. Single page for brunch, but the options were varied and sounded delicious. We both ordered the Whole Pig skillet (ham, bacon, pulled pork, potatoes, caramelized onion, 2 over-easy eggs on top w/scallions & BBQ sauce. We added cheese for good measure!) It was a large portion and very yummy, for about $10 I think! The premise of this place (helping homeless, teaching students, etc) makes it even better. I will be back so I can try some other dishes!BYOB. Credit cards accepted. Very casual (jeans, hoodies, weekend lounge gear totally acceptable!)They also sell some great flavored tea tins - highly recommend!"
"Wow, this place is delightful! We went for brunch on a Sunday at 10am and got a table right away. The food was delicious and creative, and the staff was very friendly and attentive. On top of that, they have a great mission. My new neighborhood favorite!"
great food and service!! Been dinning there off/on for the last few years and it just keeps getting better!! I highly recommend everyone check this place out!!
Ann is the best!!!!!! She is always welcoming and so friendly. They now allow pups on the patio :)
"I have eaten here many times, and it has always been great. The most recent time, I ate brunch with a party of six. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but the staff got us seated as soon as they could. Ann was our waitress. This is the not the first time we have been served by her and I hope it will not be the last. She is incredibly enthusiastic about her role and about the food. She made sure our table had a good time and was very excited to see that we enjoyed our food. Her passion for her job and the mission of Inspiration Kitchens shows in everything she does. The food is always good. I had the fried chicken and biscuits for brunch. It was like nothing I have ever had before. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the eggs and hollandaise were superb. The potatoes on the side were wonderful as always."
"Omg...amazing service!! Amazing food! Fast, fun, and friendly...thanks inspiration kitchen!! You made my Sunday brunch so good...keep it up. We gotta keep places like this up and running...the mission to help get folks back on their feet is heartwarming and well done. This place is a diamond in the rough & so are the staff :)"
"Went to inspirations cafe a while back with a few girlfriends. It's a cute brunch place with a wonderful back story. The food was good but they messed my order initially. I specifically asked for no bacon but it was on there. They were apologetic about it and replaced it. The place is tiny, which was a little surprising."
I love this place! It's great to dine for a good cause! The food and service are always great!!
I love this place! The mission statement makes me want to go back again and again. And with the food being pretty darn good and prices very reasonable I'm sure we will be going again very soon. Everyone always has a smile on their face. We went back at saint Patricks and my husband had their mint pancake special he really liked them!
"I took my grandfather there for Father's Day and I was not shocked to see this place packed! However the wait didn't take that long. During that time I brought my baby brother with me and the only issue I had with that was that they didn't have any extra baby boosters. Under the circumstance, I passed that up The food; absolutely delicious! I had the French toast and it has to be one of the best I have ever had! I'm a very picky water and if the texture isn't right I will NOT swallow my food. But they made it perfect here!The service; Everyone is extremely friendly and very respectful! There's not much to say Definitely a go to place for delicious AND cheap food!"
"I visited Inspiration Kitchens for their dinner service which consists of prix fixe menu choices of 5 or 3 courses. I'm really torn on how to review Inspiration Kitchens as on first glance you'll notice that whatever comes next your in for a value. $20 for 3 courses and $26 for 5 courses is a deal you aren't going to find many places in Chicago, and this isn't a special offer, this is what you'll get each night. You also have to understand Inspiration Kitchens mission, they provide training and services to those hit by homelessness and poverty and use this location as a place for their students to gain applied experience before moving out to other places. So, you come, you get a nice night out, a great value, and your contributing to a great organization. Nothing about this is a bad. So, as a party of 2 we did a 3/5 course split (nice that they let one person order 3 and another order 5, nothing stuffy or pretentious about this place). The appetizers were great, we tried the crispy Brussels sprouts and the butternut squash empanadas. In fact, this was probably my favorite course of the night. A lot of the other food was extremely solid and gorgeously plated but akin to a lot of dishes I could make at home. The service was warm and friendly, and the pacing was comfortable. For dessert we ordered the doughnuts and the sweet potato creme brûlée which we both agreed was their weakest course. One of my disappointments was there was no warning on the reservation confirmation e-mail that the place was BYOB (which again adds to the value but on this particular night detracted from my experience). I could see this as a really fun way for a group of people to enjoy a nice leisurely multi-course meal for a good value. I'd come back and I'd enjoy it, but I'd also match my expectations with what would be delivered."
"I am so lucky my daughter introduced me to this restaurant.  We love to go to the city and try new places so I was agreeable to whatever she suggested but she out did herself this time.  We arrived around 12:30 on Good Friday, 2 women and a baby.  We were greeted warmly from the beginning and the server suggested a corner side table where the stroller would fit better.  Throughout the entire meal we had superb service that was caring and efficient.  The food was superb.  We split a roasted cauliflower appetizer which I was a little nervous about but I adored, so flavorful with great texture.  We chose a vegetable sandwich and a meat sandwich and split both of them so we could try each approach and they were delicious.  The veggies were crunchy, the wraps soft and chewy and each ingredient contributed to two very different but completely satisfying sandwiches.   There as no rush at all so we relaxed a bit after the meal finishing our meal.  Our little baby needed to be fed and changed and it was a very comfortable place to accomplish both.  The whole experience was so pleasant - great food in a welcoming environment where your faith in your fellow man is renewed.I cannot wait to return."
"Had breakfast this morning and it's the fourth time I've been here over the last twelve months. It keeps getting better and now I think is better than my Andersonville favorites (Bongo Room, M Henry, etc.). While they have very good brunch basics, the more unique items, like the chicken and biscuits Benedict I just had, are really excellent. Each time I come I wonder why this place isn't more crowded. Finally, the people working here are great, love what they do and do an excellent job with customer service.  All in all living up to its name - truly inspirational!"
A meal at Inspiration Kitchens is good for your soul and your belly.  I have had this bookmarked for the longest and finally made it up here over Spring Break.  My mom and I split two sandwiches and the brussel sprouts appetizer.  I could have eaten ten pounds of those brussel sprouts as long as it came with an equal amount of the aioli dipping sauce.  Delectable!  Our sandwiches also did not dissapoint and I loved the sweet potato soup that came with mine.  The entire staff is super.  They are obviously well trained and they do their job to the highest degree.  The food is so delicious and afordable.  The bill was so low that we had to double check that they included everything.  I will come back here every time I can.  It deserves my support and I deserve their delicious food!
I am floored with how good this food is! I will come again. Make sure you get the Benedict!
"Had my husband's 40th here!What a delight!It was the perfect place to have a party of 30 ... We did feel a bit tight though.  Food was good .. Generous portions.We had the catfish with polenta and the root beer ribs.  Yummy!Service was very friendly and the cause of the organization is just outstanding.Things I wished were different that day though ... We were hurried out at 9:30 .. Finally leaving at 10pm.  I know the staff had to go home ... But my party could have stayed another hour due to the delay with the snow.  The drink service including coffee was confusing to the guest and they had to approach to counter to ask for drinks .. Maybe I was the confused one?  Overall, perfect place and everyone had a wonderful time.  Now I need to return for brunch!"
"My roomie and I had just finished a race in Montrose Harbor, and wanted to get brunch somewhere. Tweet down the street seemed like it would be crowded from all the runners, plus I had heard about Inspiration Kitchens and their mission statement, so we were both really interested in trying this place.The restaurant is so cute. I ordered the blackened salmon benedict, which was delicious. The first bite was crazy good, although it's a really rich dish, so I could barely finish it (even after a 10 mile run). It came with a side of fruit, which was the perfect way to end the meal. Decor is pretty, nice restroom, amazing prices (everything is under $10), superb service. Overall, my new favorite brunch place in the area and I would definitely revisit if I'm nearby."
"Stopped in last weekend with my girlfriend for brunch. I found the place through Yelp and had to try it since I fully support the concept and the food pictures looked delicious.When we got here on Sunday, around 12:30PM, it was halfway full. We were quickly greeted and told to sit wherever we want. I got the crawfish biscuits and gravy and my girl friend got one of the benedicts. For the price to portion ratio is perfect. I was overall satified with my food, only wish the buscuits wouldve been softer, but the gravy was tasty."
"Inspiration kitchen is a cool little concept that allows culinary students to get real work experience in a great environment. The menu and food coming out of here is good and very affordable - and BYOB.  I loved the brunch menu with eggs Benedict's, chocolate chip pancakes, pulled pork and eggs, and even a crawfish étouffée with eggs and biscuits.  Service is friendly too for a school. Would come back for their fixed course dinners with my own wine. It's also a great concept to support."
"i made sure to make a reservation but was suprised that the adternoon we came in wasn't very busy. nevertheless, awesome service and awesome food. the mixed greens salad is delicious. i had a ham pannini and was blown away. can't wait to check out more of their menu. waitress was very nice and apologized right away when there was an item that was unavailable. two thumbs up."
"This place has a good brunch, but their prix fix dinner tops the cake. For $25, you get four courses and each one is better than the last. Not only is the food and service great, but their mission to help and train the community is just what this world needs!"
"Inspiration Kitchens inspired me to write my first Yelp review in ages (that's how thrilled I was with their service and food!)! I work at Weiss Memorial Hospital and needed a decent spread for a luncheon meeting we held today. I'd passed the cafe before and was curious about the food, so I went online and was pleased to discover they offer catering options. I called and spoke to Chef Noelle, who worked out a sandwich and salad menu for my meeting with only a few days' notice.Our meeting attendees loved the food (some even gave me nods and mouthed ""this is really good!"" during the meeting) and all had clean plates at the end. Thanks, Inspiration Kitchens!The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they don't offer delivery with their catering orders (and I didn't see it stated on their website, so assumed they delivered), so that made for a little bit of inconvenience this morning. Also, the price was on the higher side, but I do like that we've supported a community restaurant with such a great mission. When I picked up the food, one of the staff members even graciously mentioned that our order was helping them out quite a bit this week. I definitely passed that info along to our meeting attendees!"
"The food, the atmosphere and setting, and the waitstaff are equally fantastic.  My husband and I live in Uptown and this place is one of our favorites.  Today, we brought his parents for breakfast/brunch and they were very impressed with everything.  The breakfast/brunch food was one of the best I've every had.  Mother-in-law and I shared the caramel turtle french toast and the fried chicken and biscuit benedict, and we both couldn't get enough of either.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender, and the whole ensemble was delicious.  The french toast was probably the tastiest I've ever eaten.  It was like eating dessert for breakfast, which I've done many times in my own house.  The coffee was strong and robust, not watered down like many other places.  I'm preparing to come back for the exact same meal next Saturday with friends!  (By the way, Ann(e) is the friendliest and the most cheerful staff member of any restaurant I've been to.  She is a great asset to this place.)"
"One word... unbelievable! I went with a group of people last night and had an incredibly good meal. Between the sixteen of us we ordered a wide range of the choices offered. The basic idea is that for $26 you get a 5-course gourmet meal - appetizer, soup, salad, main course, and dessert. I ordered the empanadas but tried the other appetizers as well. They were good but my favorites were the bacon covered cheesy tater tots. I also had the apple salad and the curry chicken soup. Finally, I had the hangar steak dinner and the apple cider doughnuts for desert. Sooo good!The restaurant is intimate, perfect for a great meal. And the story behind the restaurant is worth checking out at inspirationkitchens.org. Great redemptive work they are doing! Finally, the menu changes each month so you can look forward to something new. I think we have found a new favorite in Chicago that is both affordable for such a nice meal and involved in a good cause. Oh, by the way, you can bring your own wine and beer and have it with dinner! They even open the bottle with no corkage!"
"I definitely love this place, the food is really good. I had a jam and cheese omelette it was delicious. The service was juts wonderful I had this wonderful lady that was wearing a white sox had, she seems the most happiest person in this world and she projects that happiness to her guests. Overall, wonderful food, wonderful service, nice ambiance, and happy guests"
"Came here on a chilly weekend morning when we wanted to try something new that wouldn't break the bank. We knew very little about it when we decided to go - just saw a great Yelp rating, a yummy-sounding menu, and the price was right.When we arrived (around 1pm Saturday - prime brunch time!), the place was nearly empty. We were greeted by a friendly staff and allowed to pick any seat we wanted. Water and coffee was immediately offered.I ordered the pork belly benedict, and he ordered the guacamole black bean benedict. Both arrived promptly -- mine was piping hot, his a little cooler, but hey, it's guac -- alongside our Intelligentsia coffees. I kid you not, this was the best pork belly I've ever had! It had some sort of spiced, cinnamon-laced rub that took it over the edge, and I couldn't eat it quickly enough. Breakfast potatoes were fried to perfection, and I ate every last bite.The staff was friendly, goofy, and a lot of fun. We loved our waitress, although I can't recall her name. She joked around with us a lot, which was a nice change of pace. The restaurant was impeccably clean, with someone walking around sweeping or wiping almost the entire time. The decor was clean, uncluttered, and modern.What impressed me the most was their mission -- they help take struggling and homeless members of the community and offer them a job-training program, with transferable skills like hospitality, health code information, service, and culinary skills. They also offer housing assistance to get employees back on their feet. While I was sold on the delicious, and quite frankly very cheap, food, I felt very good about coming here and would absolutely do so again.Cheap parking plentiful on the street. Definitely check this place out!"
"I was tired, hot and sweaty trying to find a place to eat with my girlfriend after moving. We found this place on yelp and said to ourselves, any port will do! We walked over to where google maps took us and couldn't find it. I called the place up and who ever answered the phone easily disarmed my hunger induced crankiness and guided me in. The initial experience of ordering the food was fantastic. The menu had plenty to chose from in a variety of high quality food items. The pictures and description of the food did not disappoint, it was fantastic. I would definitely eat there again."
"We love the outstanding brunch here. Their food is exceptionally delicious, including wonderful omelettes (best anywhere), veg hash, and creamy Greek yoghurt with homemade toppings. Their service is also terrific! We bring my 96 yr old mother in law here, and staff remembers her every time with a big hug.  Truly an inspiration and a real treat. Enjoy!"
"It's wonderful that there is a restaurant with both great food and a great purpose for the community.  The staff is so amazing.  I enjoy every visit!  The root vegetable hash is perfection!  In the summer, it actually includes non-root vegetables (squash & zucchini).  The pesto is always fresh, garlicky and delicious.  It is hands down my favorite brunch dish in the city.  The crispy bacon, Greek yogurt with amazing fruit compote, and their Intelligencia coffee round out the perfect meal!The only constructive criticism I have for this near-perfect spot -- they recently removed the fabric ceiling treatment, leaving unattractive exposed duct work.  It gives the restaurant a ""dirty"" feel, instead of the homey and artistic feel it used to have.  I recently brought a friend after talking up how cute the restaurant is and was a little embarrassed that the room looked like it was under construction."
"Just had the blackened talapia sandwich with crawfish soup. Whoo! They should bring you a box of tissues with that combo. Spicy! Warmed me right up. Soooo good. Ann and Donnie took great care of us. Thanks guys.Ann does a fantastic job and is super knowledgeable. The tea selection is wonderful and she has tried them all it seems because she was able to take us on a little sniff safari through the tea samples.If you are nearby, try this place NOW."
"Good food, not terribly creative, nor particularly outstanding, but a nice selection of items well prepared at the right price point.Service is inconsistent from visit to visit which is forgiveable as the waitstaff is in training and errors are to be expected.Clean unisex washroomAttractively decoratedBYOB"
If you like eating well this is the right place to go!I got smoked salmon Benedict with greek yogurt ! Highly recommended  !
"Inspirations Kitchen... it's just a great place that you want to support.The prices are extremely reasonable, the food is spot on and it's BYOB.  It's also helping the community.  I had a very enjoyable experience here - and couldn't believe a three course meal was only $16.  Our server was Tracy and she was great.  Since I can see this place from my back deck, it will be on the regular rotation of food options."
"I so enjoyed my brunch this morning. For 11:30 on a Sunday, it was a 20 minute wait (unheard of here) and everything was prepared perfectly.  The eggs are where it's at. I will definitely be back, this is a place you feel good patronizing."
"I came to Inspiration Kitchens this past weekend for Sunday brunch under the idea that I would be comparing them to Tweet a few blocks north on Sheridan.  In truth, this place should not be compared to any other brunch spot or even any other restaurant since there really isn't anything else like it around.If you're not familiar with the store's model, they are primarily staffed by people significantly affected by poverty.  They have a rigorous training program that allows new employees to gain the skills needed to succeed in the restaurant industry... as they say, ""serving people on both sides of the counter.""And if that's not enough for you, the food is killer.  I had a BBQ Pork Benedict with hash browns and both were on par with the classiest of restaurants.  Overall, I feel like the value of the food I got was great for the amount that I paid.  Add on top of that superb personable service and the positive mission of the company... I'm not sure if anything could have made this experience any better."
"Good food, small menu, but love the reasoning behind the restaurant by helping others in need! Food is delicious and I recommend the tomato soup!"
"I don't know why I waited so long to return. I don't want that to happen again.Came here for brunch with some friends. Had the special Red Velvet pancakes with sweet cream cheese icing, and the hash browns. Service with a smile, food was good. BYOB, always a plus!Good food, good cause, good idea!"
Highly recommend BBQ pulled pork eggs Benedict w a side of Greek yogurt topped w strawberry compote. It was delicious!!!
Great food great customer service great price. I will definitely return to this restaurant.
"After three months of living next door to this place, I finally got the chance to try it. My brother and I went for breakfast and were seated right away. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful when you're as indecisive as I am. I ended up ordering their brunch special - Ginger Peach Raspberry French Toast. It was absolutely the best thing I have ever had for breakfast. It was 4 thick slices that were bottomed with a ginger peach mix and topped with raspberry reduction and fresh raspberries and mint. It was $9, and to me, that's pricey but completely worth it.My brother ordered the whole pig skillet... It was an insane amount of meat for $9. There was ham, pulled pork, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and an egg all topped with a barbecue sauce. If you want protein, that's your meal right there. I'd absolutely come here again. I'd like to try one of their more savorier dishes like the crawfish gravy biscuits. Sigh... If I only had more money I'd go there for lunch."
"Went for brunch and had the seasonal vegetable and orange juice. Not only was the food AMAZING, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and Ann (our server) made us feel right at home. Thank you for a lovely experience!P.S. the pesto was the best i've ever had. I wish they would jar it/sell it!"
"Great Food and Awesome AttitudeThis place has great food, an awesome staff and an amazing mission. I go back any chance I can."
"They're still keeping it rocking. I've moved away from the neighborhood, but have returned twice just for their perfect sample-of-everything breakfast platter (SO SATISFYING). You could not want more from your Saturday brunch."
"Never had a bad experience here. The menu changes seasonally and the chef's special, whatever it may be that day, it's always delicious. A true Uptown gem."
"I moved out of Uptown a few months ago and there are very few things I miss about my old condo. Living down the street from Inspiration Kitchens is one of them! The restaurant is cozy and comfortable and the staff are incredibly friendly. The restaurant has a wonderful mission and I always enjoy supporting local businesses. I like that the menu changes every so often, there is always something different to try. The food is always delicious and the prices are excellent (try the prie fixe menu- get a little bit of everything!). The last time I went, I loved the goat cheese salad (I'm sure it has been switched out since then) and the sweet potato soup is super tasty. I went for brunch a few times with family and no one has ever been disappointed! I miss Inspiration Kitchens so much, I need to go back to visit!"
I work in a 5 star hospitality property in Chicago and I felt that I had the same service We provide at inspiration Kitchens.  I came here with my family to enjoy Brunch it was January 18th.  I didn't have an idea what the restaurant group was about. We showed up and it was busy mostly people in late 20s to early 40s.  We grab the attention of the wait staff and they said they love having kids in the restaurant and offered different options with the kids. the menu was easy to read and the choice were all good.  I asked the waiter what she would recommend and she said the dad special which was the bbq .... I forgot the name but it was amazing.   when I paid the bill my name was used because they got it off my card. I was also thanked for dining and it was a marvelous way to start the day.
"Damn. Inspirations Kitchens is cooking out some serious fine eats and at prices that will not eat away your pockets. They had a choice of a three- or five-course meal this evening (three for $15, five for $20), with various options for appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, and a three-part dessert. The options are varied, the ingredients are fresh (the basil on my salad may have been a little too fresh), the food is terrifically prepared, the layouts are appealing, and the restaurant itself is small and quite charming.I had the Crawfish Cake, Panzanella salad, and Blackened Tilapia entree. The various aoilis and sauces were some of the most delicious things I have recently tasted, and the proteins were cooked just right. The tilapia was quite heavily seasoned (it was blackened, of course) and a little off-putting, but not nearly enough to keep me from devouring it. I did not try any specialty drinks, however, but the little bit of dessert I tried that my friend ordered was also quite tasty. I really appreciate that they used seasonal ingredients, too: sweet potato and apple cider in the dessert, more resilient greens in the entrees.I will say I am quite happy I did not go by myself; that would have been uncomfortable. For those of you who, like me, often are without company for dinner, save Inspirations for when you have the pleasure of a guest.Overall, my experience at Inspirations was... I would say inspiring, but I don't feel like being so punny. But it was that good. Damn good."
"Wow! Great find. Went for brunch and it is just adorable and the staff is so friendly. Meals are super affordable. Eggs Benedict for $8, crawfish gravy eggs and biscuits for $9, everything's between $6-$9! Byo so grab a bottle of champagne on your way over and get a karaff of orange juice. All of our meals were phenomenal. Crawfish biscuits and gravy is chock full of crawfish! Banana bread pancakes were incredible as was the cantina Benedict.On top of all that, the place ""serves people on both sides of the counter""...they have job training programs to help ""Chicagoans hardest hit by homelessness and poverty"" get into the food service industry. Yay for a great social business!!!Brunch is Saturday and Sunday 9am-2pm."
"I'm afraid I brought the unnecessary baggage of prior expectations, along with our little Friday night supper club here for dinner. I had only been here for breakfast, and was looking forward to the dinner experience. I'm sad to report that was very disappointing. Allow me to elaborate.First, the very good things. Big comfy booth for the four of us in the window. Nicely appointed table with cloth linens. Complimentary basket of fresh chips were welcomed and devoured. And the potato/leek soup. That was delicious and inspired. Attentive and friendly service erring on the side of too many hands in the process making us feel a bit rushed, And there was only one other table that evening. The rest was pretty uninspired.Besides the soup, we sampled a beet/endive salad, and the appetizer crab cakes. The salad was tiny, and of course created for one person. The light vinaigrette was a compliment to the nicely shredded endive, creativley presented with little cubes of cooked red and yellow beets. As far as the crab cakes go, I didn't know it was possible to make crab cakes the size of a quarter. Doll-house crab cakes if you will, and just OK as far as flavor. You should have seen the four of us try to split the three of those.As for the rest of the incredibly shrinking meal, my entree arrived with a plate of nicely shredded and cooked veggies topped with a chunk of salmon about the size of my big toe. Yes, this was the salmon entree, not an appetizer. It was a 2 ounce filet at best. Dry, over-cooked and tasted like it came from a bag in the Aldi freezer case. (I can get that salmon at home.) Friends ordered Chicken Vesuvio, Braised Beef, and Pork Tenderloin, which by the way when it arrived was Pork Loin Roast. The silence amongst us told me my friends were being polite. Their portions were a bit larger than mine, but not what any of us expected, I think.None of the warm food was very warm, by the way, starting with my soup. I was too hungry to send it back for zapping, and the worst that could happen is it would just turn into vichyssoise as it cooled.While the prices here are very reasonable, I could have thought of other better choices for our outing. And if someone had said that the current inspiration was ""nouvelle cuisine,"" as opposed to the generous servings I recall from breakfast here, I would have perhaps looked for more ""comfort food."" I don't mind small portions, but at least call it tapas.And service needs to be more than ""nice,"" and less than filling water glasses 20 times during the meal. The air was friendly, but it felt as if staff were just going through the motions, to get us in and out. Not sure what the chef was thinking. I would probably return fo breakfast, but not dinner. Breakfast still a 4, dinner a 2.5."
"We walked in from a drizzling saturday morning. The lady at the register warmly welcomed us and told us to find a place where we'd be most comfortable. For such a tiny place, I was surprised that we had our pick of tables. The food took quite a while to arrive; however, we soaked in the crisp, bright interior and once our food came, our weather-related dreariness quickly dissipated. My friends ordered an turkey bacon avocado wrap and crab cake benedict. I was intrigued by their green tea pancakes and ordered a ""half stack""  to share amongst my girlfriends, plus a salmon-spinach benedict. My benedict arrived sans spinach, but no matter, since I was too busy sopping up the roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. The pancake itself was very subtle, but the honey crème anglaise was definitely the star of the dish. It will forever ruin the relationship I have with pancakes and conventional maple syrup. I tried a little bit of my friend's crab cake benedict and had to refrain myself from gobbling up the other half of her plate. There wasn't anything exciting about the side ""hash browns""- which was more like cubed potatoes, but I liked how there was a mix of different spuds (including sweet potatoes) that added a savory element when you ate it all together.Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I will be coming back!"
Love this place and the ever changing menu. Service is friendly and helpful. The Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy for Brunch is amazing.
Went here for bunch and was served quickly with friendly staff. Food was great and reasonably priced. This place also gives back to the community. It helps homeless people with training and a job. So not only are you getting good food you are supporting a place that helps others.
"Cute brunch place with reasonable prices, good food and friendly staff. It is a great establishment!"
"IK gets five stars for its long-term goal of self-sufficiency for its clients. It had also been a place I'd made a *point* of bringing business, friends, and family (suburbs & out-of-town) to because of its mission. However, IK's service issues have kept me from coming back. The last 2 times I've gone, even though the dining room was less than 1/3 full, dishes came out embarrassingly late, the servers seemed out of their depth, and my food's been BURNED (Turning my quinoa cakes Crayola-black-side down doesn't cover up the scene of the crime, as if I couldn't *taste* the error--c'mon, now!) In both cases, because I had recommended IK and had brought guests across the city to go there, I apologized to them on behalf of the restaurant, which I shouldn't have to do. Having my emails to IK bounce back didn't help, either.That said, when IK was (is?) good, it's a great, well-priced place with its heart in the right place; maybe I'll split the difference between going back & not by checking out its Garfield Park sister location."
"Came here for brunch this morning and got the chorizo biscuits.Incredible food. Great prices. Super friendly wait staff, even on a freezing January day!! Plus, this place is doing good in the community. Definitely recommend!"
"Wonderful dining experience and delicious food! It's so great having this neighborhood eatery in the Uptown area. Went with a group of friends and we all had a wonderful time. the server was so nice and the food was perfectly prepared. Will definitely go back and I have even used them for catering which was so great! The catering comes from the Garfield Park location, but I was able to pick up from the Uptown location (closer to my home ) and save on the delivery charge. What a great company and such a great program for those who need it. Check them out!!"
"worst place.. came here thinking i was gunna eat breakfast but i guess not because it only on the weekends...ok?.. so i gave the place a chance and ordered some lunch. i order a ""beef burgundy"" soup with the guac burger. i get my soup and its tomato soup with veggies and mushrooms. a lot of mushrooms, why its called beef burgundy, idk. next i get my burger and its the smallest thing, the buns were twice the size of the burger, even the tomato slices were bigger. got no napkins and i had to ask for my check at the front cus the waiter never came after she dropped the food off, didnt ask how my food was either. bad experience, just had to get it off my chest"
This place was great! We went for brunch and both got the breakfast platter - great bang for your buck. French Toast is excellent and bottomless coffee is very good.
"We were the first to arrive at 9am and were welcomed by the nicest waitress I've had in a long time. She was very attentive and thanked us multiple times for coming in to support the organization. The coffee there is awesome and the food was great! I got the biscuits and chorizo gravy - delicious! The place is small (10 tables or so), very clean and efficient. We had our meals within 15 minutes of ordering. I wish we lived in town so we could go more often."
"Great concept and great dining experience. The food blew me away! I've been here a number of times now and I always want to keep going back. It's nice to finally have a higher quality restaurant in Uptown. The food could rival food at a high end restaurant in the loop or River North, but with manageable prices! Highly recommend!"
"Fantastic food, fast service and BYOB... You cannot go wrong here!!  We were so glad we wandered into this gem.  #1 brunch in Chicago - don't forget your champagne for mimosas with unlimited orange juice!"
"I brought friends visiting from England here for breakfast.  We arrived on a Sunday morning before they were open.  We were invited in to sit and have coffee as they were getting ready for the start of business. My friends were impressed by the mission of Inspiration Kitchens as well as the amazing level of service and care shown to them.  My friend loves to have pancakes when visiting the States and said that the pancakes were the best she'd had.  I had the eggs, French toast, bacon and potatoes.  Our server promised the potatoes were great and she was true to her word, perfectly cubed and browned potatoes with a wonderful seasoning.  They are served with a ramekin of ketchup, though none is needed.  The French toast was moist, full of flavor and perfect without syrup.  There are so many things to try on the brunch menu; I will be back again and again.  Kudos to all."
Delicious food you can feel great about eating. This is a five star even without the community impact angle but that puts it truly over the top. Definitely check it out and bring a bottle of champagne for mimosas!
"I went here based on all the positive Yelp reviews, and was disappointed. My girlfriend had the Traditional Benedict and she thought it was okay. I had the Biscuit and Gravy platter and was not too happy about it. The biscuits were hard and dry and the hash tasted like it was cooked literally out of a can. We were also seated right next to the bathroom doors, which was kind of of uncomfortable when other patrons would go to the restroom. There are so many better breakfast places in the city. I recommend passing on Inspiration Kitchens."
"Brunch was fine but nothing spectacular, the only thing that stood out were the potato wedges on the side of the egg meal I had, those were really the best I have ever tasted.  I kept telling my wife during the meal how I normally don't really care about potatoes during breakfast but how in love I was with those wedges.  Service was very enthusiastic albeit a little too enthusiastic and kind of awkward."
"Why I really liked this spot:1. The mission behind it- very inspirational :)2. Our party of four arrived at peak brunch time on a Saturday morning, and though we had no reservations and the interior space looked small we were seated quickly.3. Friendly service, with quick drink fills and always a smile.4. This was a catch up meal with a visiting friend, and though we dawdled we never felt pressured to give up our table.5. Great prices for good sized portions6. Close to transit and ample parking7. This is a bit random, but I liked that they group items on the bill by what each person ordered (ex. their dish and their drink).What was just okay:Importantly, the food. I had the crab cakes benedict which I found to be too salty. The potatoes that came as a side were good but just potatoes. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.But still four stars! This is a good little brunch spot for the number of food options, price, everything else stated above, and most importantly in my opinion, what it does for its staff and the neighborhood. That to me matters much more than stellar food."
"Slowly becoming well-known and acknowledged, Cafe Too is the perfect spot to grab an eclectic bite to eat while giving back to the community.  It's always pleasant to know what you spend on your food is assisting those less fortunate by having them earn some money and work experience versus being spent unconsciously by those who are already wealthy.  Believe it or not, they somehow keep prices low and reasonable!  *Nudge to all other Chicago restaurants*I was finally in the area to grab brunch here and was very pleased.  The decor is modern with canvas canopies drooping on the ceiling, unique back-lit walls, and fresh pussywillows on the table to celebrate spring in the Midwestern prairies.  The hosts seem to cover their butts by saying the wait is 3 times the actual time, so don't be deterred.  Just grab a cup of their coffee or check out their unique tea varieties which has little magnetic cups to smell each flavor individually off a platter.  C2 offers about 5 specials that are constantly changing so be sure to peek in the right corner when you step in the door.  This morning I was in a blah-bland mood and just got the Egg Your Way scrambled with bacon and a side of fruit.  I have no idea what their secret is but the bacon was finger-lickin' tasty.  This is coming from someone who usually avoids pork.  I also can't believe that I skipped out on choosing hashbrowns over the fruit dish but I did.  My boyfriend had the Breakfast Burrito which seemed to be the popular entree of the morning (well next to the chilaquiles which they ran out of).  It was really delicious with diced hashbrowns with sweet potato, eggs, onion, cheese, flank steak topped with avocado slices and a side of blackbean sour cream salsa.  Delicioso!I hope to check this place out for their dinner 3- and 5-course meals at bargain prices.  C2 is a great addition to the historic and culturally diverse Uptown neighborhood.  Oh and they also have a front patio to dine."
I love this place. The whole pig skillet is the best breakfast I've ever tasted! The service is excellent and I always leave happy and satisfied !
"Let me start by saying that I don't know  where you can get quite the same ratio of high quality food for price anywhere else in Chicago.  5 courses for $20 is CRAZY!  The food is inventive and fresh, overall quite enjoyable.  There might have been some favorite dishes amongst our group, but overall I really have to commend this establishment.  Not only are they serving something new at an astonishing price, they are changing the way we think about the restaurant industry.  Rarely does the ""idea"" of a restaurant permeate so whole heartedly through out a dining experience in such a positive way.  Would I recommend driving across the city to eat here?  Maybe not.  Definitely recommended for the area, as this is my go to place right down the street in Uptown."
Always a delicious brunch (I need to try out dinner!) and truly inspiring!! Inspiration Kitchens works to provide training and services to the homeless. Love giving back by eating brunch! Service is always fast and super friendly. BYOB and inexpensive too!
Great brunch and I love the concept. The food was amazing!
"What a surprise right in my neighborhood! The price is determined by the number of courses you decide to have, 3 or 5. My party all went with 5 courses, but we all left hurting. The food is too good to not eat it when it is sitting in front of you. Only two things discouraged me during my visit: 1. My steak, although ordered medium-rare, came out FAR too rare for my liking. 2. Some of the names of the items are confusing and don't really tell you much about what you are ordering. Although the element of surprise can be fun, I recommend asking your server about the food before you choose. My desert, regardless of its tantalizing name, seemed to be not much more than a 'slushee' made out of apple juice. I found myself jealous of everyone else I was dining with as no one else ordered what I did for desert. Maybe they just have a better grasp on the English language than I do."
"I gave them a second change - a new rating for their new name.  However, although the service has improved, the food quality tanked.The french toast was still good - I'll give them that.  But the pancakes were weird and tough, and had a single slice of strawberry on top for the ""strawberry bread pudding"" pancake special.  Also, mystery chocolate chips baked in, not on the menu - it was okay, but didn't 'go' with the other flavours.The omelet was the killer.  Make-your-own with tomatoes, spinach, and peppers.  The tomatoes were fresh but had the skins on, which sloughed off into the omelet when cooked.  The spinach was soggy and bitter - pre-cooked or frozen maybe?  The peppers were WAY overcooked, soggy and limp - pretty obviously pre-cooked for quicker prep.There may not be any other 'nice' breakfast places nearby, but I'll gladly eat cheap pancakes at Golden House then return here for honestly bad food.  I was not inspired to return.I still gave them 2 stars instead of 1, because I like the message (and the french toast).  But honestly, that was a zero-star omelet. Blech."
"With the passage of time, the name change, and a change of meals, my love for this establishment has grown! Inspiration Kitchens seems to be quite fitting name it helps to encompass all that they do, and they do so much! Programs to help those pulling themselves back up, food for those who need it, as well as wonderful, great tasting food in a comfortable atmosphere. I have been multiple times for breakfast (my favorite meal out). The crab cakes are wonderful, the burrito is fantastic, the caprese is tasty, and the sweet potato has browns are yum-o! The specials are worth a try, I have never been disappointed. We went for lunch the other day. The outdoor patio was open but it was a bit too chilly for me! Oh my, the food! I want to eat there again, like NOW! I had the ham and cheese pannini. It was huge and actually made 2 meals. It came with fries, which I upgraded to sweet potato fries and the whole thing was delicious!!! I could not turn down a cup of the potato leek chowder ($2). It sounded and tasted fantastic, and for that price, it was more than worth the calories! My companions both had the fish and chips. I have to admit that this is what I really wanted but was unsure if I could handle any grease. It was AMAZING! The small pieces of fish had a light breading and were not greasy AT ALL! They tasted heavenly! I had my eye on some tantalizing looking muffins for dessert, but after this feast, there was no room left in the inn! Really, do yourself a favor, EAT HERE! You get great food at an outstandingly nominal price while helping people help themselves. Does not seem to me like you should ask for much more!"
"A friend and I went to Cafe Too for brunch and found it to be a popular, but not overcrowded, neighborhood restaurant.  The wait for a table didn't take long and service was usually quick.  The biscuits and gravy were tasty, but not spectacular.  The ham, cheddar and spinach omelet was also okay.  A good place if you are in the area and want breakfast without too much hassle--also a meal for two for $25 wasn't a bad deal, either."
"SO terrific.  Sure, I've had hoity-toitier food, but this place had everything I require in a brunch, nothing I can't stand, plus karmic bonuses.-Three of us ate and drank well for $40 ($33 & $7 tip).-Yummy latte.-Service was perfect, not stuffy.-Easy to get to via CTA, and rock-star parking is not a problem.-They support a terrific charitable cause.-Fucking delicious.I had the black bean eggs benedict and was satisfied well beyond lunch time."
"We had a very pleasant breakfast at Inspiration Kitchens this week.The interior is light, airy and pleasant. It almost doesn't fit in the neighborhood, it's so nice. (Sorry to be so blunt, but if you'd seen the activity I saw out the window while dining. . .  yeah, it's still Uptown).The breakfast menu has a couple omelettes, but the main thing is, build your own breakfast sandwich. I made an Egg McMuffin style breakfast sandwich - whole wheat English muffin, bacon, fried eggs (hard - the server asked if I wanted them hard or easy), tomato, and swiss cheese. I chose every single item.My friend also ordered the build your own sandwich. She had whole wheat toast, sausage, scrambled eggs, American cheese, and cucumber.Remember that old fast-food commercial, ""Have it your way?"" Well, we got to have it our way, and it was all hot and delicious.The coffee is Intelligentsia. Good stuff.The server was a very professional, efficient and pleasant woman named Anne. She handled everything just right.The breakfast sandwich cost $5.00. That, my friends, is a good deal. You don't need a Groupon to get value at this restaurant.I would definitely go again. We were there on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all. It probably gets very busy on the weekend.Good stuff."
Delicious Cantina Benedict and with the outdoor patio we were able to enjoy a beautiful fall brunch in Chicago. I rival this to any Benedict in nyc or brooklyn so if ur uptown its worth heading over.
"Very Very awesome food and concepts where it gives back to the community. I came with a large party and they were great. I got the pancakes so delicious. Also the greek yogurt, which came with honey in it. YUM YUM. Definitely a place worth checking out and I plan to return."
"Don't hate me, don't hate me, don't hate me, don't hate me.Allow me to explain?I had been circling around Cafe Too for a few months but the timing was never right, until today.  The concept and amount of high Yelp-praise were big plusses, but the experience fell a little short of expectations.  The specials listed an egg scramble that was right out of my dreams: portobella mushrooms, spinach, crisp tofu, egg whites and rosemary roasted potatoes.  Yep!  Even the $5 blueberry pancakes on the regular menu could not dissuade me.  The dish in concept was perfect; the dish in reality was not.  The first strike was its wetness.  Just too much oil.  The second strike was the lack of portobellas.  Truth be told, I was distracted and didn't even notice it until after I'd eaten, paid, and left.  So really, I take partial blame for that, since if I had had my thinking cap on I could have asked them to correct it.  As it was though, I was dividing my attention between my food and the discussion of last night's Lord of the Rings: Return of the King viewing.  So, my bad...partly. The matter of the toast is a draw.  On the one hand, it does not come with skillet orders and must be ordered as side.  No problem, we figured it out, ordered and received some quickly.  The toast itself was amazins.  I am a wheat girl but the options were white and rye, so we went with rye to complement our savory skillets.  The bread was large and good, but the (rasp?)berry preserves were really, really good.  I almost ordered a second serving....and there were four pieces in the first.  There is a specialty coffee menu but the teas are pretty special too.  They're loose-leaf and steeped in a pot with hot water for 2+ cups.  I went for the green Wow Mint, and wow it was.  It was the all-time mintiest tea I've had, and was a whopping $1.60       The service was pretty good, and I noticed other tables' coffee cups were regularly topped off (no coffee drinkers at ours).  Seating was kind of unusual - we walked in and were seated up front at a 6-top although there was a 2-top in the back corner.  Then, when two more people came in, they were seated at the other half of our table, though they moved it a few inches apart.  Still, close quarters and their unavoidable convo further distracted me from discussing Frodo's journey with the ring.  Overall, more of a 3.5 experience and I do plan to go back.  Pretty good, with potential for even better."
"I want to thank my friend Adam F. for getting the brunch together a couple of weeks ago. It was a great idea.I've past this place several times but never actually stopped by. When I walked in, I was greeted warmly by the staff. I must say though, I'm really impressed with the concept behind the restaurant. Helping homelessness in Chicago. My server was Ann. Ann was a exceptional server. She definitely needs to teach a class to others on how to be a server/waitress. Very courteous and knowledgeable about items on the menu.I'm not gonna lie, the food was something to be desired. I had shrimp and sausage over rice with eggs. I concur that the food is bland. Not bad but bland. However based on the concept of the place and the amazing jasmine peach tea, I know I will be back."
"So, I wish I could say that my first experience at Inspiration Cafe was volunteering.  Nope, not unless I can count giving my taste buds a welcome back to delicious food party, after being sick.  This was my first visit, and most certainly not the last.  To start off with, I had the crab cakes, full of crab and just lightly breaded (yay!) they were served on top of a cucumber slaw that provided the right amount of crunch.  For the main part of my meal, I had a Turkey, avocado and bacon wrap, the slices of real turkey breast make you never want to get close to the processed stuff again.  Service was with a smile, which always makes food taste better imho.Everything is cleaner than clean here, you can tell that there is a dedication to this place that isn't forced or phony.  Inspiration Cafe does a lot more than prepare delicious food for people, they help prepare people for life.  This isn't some 3 hour, 3 times a week program, and it shows.  The men and women that complete the 13 week course go out prepared to be a constructive part of the hospitality field, with their own recipes.  The prices are more than reasonable, and they're byo.  It may be a little off the beaten path, but well worth the trip!"
Love this place! Super friendly service and good food at very reasonable prices. Another perk is that you're helping a organization that is helping people get their life back on track. Worth a trip!Just be aware that they are closed on Monday and Tuesday.
"Partner and I wanted to enjoy brunch al fresco this fine Sunday morning. We decided on Inspiration Kitchens because we both like the food the service and the mission. We don't go as often as we should and still haven't been there for anything other than brunch. I'm writing today to give a pecial shout-out to Jefferey, our server. He's a natural. He was friendly to everyone; welcomed customers warmly; knew the menu. He and the busser kept the water and ice tea topped off. I enjoyed a Ham and Chorizo Skillet; Partner relished the Breakfast Platter; we shared an order of Pancakes with Creme Anglaise and Fresh Berries for desert. We left gustatorally sastified with smiles on our faces."
"This place is fantastic! Delicious cuisine, cool space and wonderful service.  I think it's BYOB, get there early. It's got a fantastic vibe and great food - not to mention its wonderful mission to empower/train its staff."
"Cafe Too was on Check Please! so I HAD to check it out. I thought the location was awkward with brand new condo buildings in front of Cafe Too yet there was homeless people on every corner. Environment - Clean and modern but the space is very small. Waitress - Polite but we did not get a refill at all for our water. Food - GOOD. Nothing spectacular. My crab cake eggs benedict was unique and flavorful. My hash browns were pretty good with the sweet potatoes mixed in. My boyfriends ""make your own omelet"" with ham, spinach, and feta cheese was alright, a little bland. Price - about $10 for each entree, our total bill was about $21 for both of us. Not bad for two entrees that stuffed our stomach. I am not sure if I would come back here. I overall liked my experience but I probably won't be craving this food in the near future."
"No waitGood foodService with a smile and happy to be thereBYOB - you bring the Champaign, they provide the OJCheap prices and good portionsThis place is good in the food and their mission in helping others.... I got a new brunch place!!!"
"Had not been in a while and frankly, I have no reason why. Not only is it doing socially good things within the community but the food is GREAT!  One of the best Spinach salads I had in years, with some delicately fried panko encrusted goat cheese balls.  Lentil and Ham soup was spot on. My friend had the Corn Chiptole soup and it was spot on! This will go back in my rotation of great places to go.. and happy to say, the neighborhood seems to be changing for the better too..significantly."
"I love this place. The menu is diverse like the neighborhood they serve and it feels good knowing that this place is helping folks working here to become upwardly mobile and self sufficient; all while serving delicious food! The restaurant is smaller, but clean, cozy and I got a very good sense of community when I ate here. They have a nice out door area in the summer months, delicious coffee and a great staff whom all seem rather dedicated to the place. I will be coming back for more!"
"Totally awesome food, BYOB, and the prices are a steal!$15 for 3 courses or $20 for 4!! Everyone that worked there was super friendly, we didn't have to wait, and everything was absolutely delicious! And on top of it, it's a great company that works to help people in need. Check it out for sure!"
"Amazing food, great value and excellent service.  If that weren't enough you are helping out a good cause just by dining there.  Best brunch food in Chicago!"
"Just heard about this place and what's not to like?  They help the local community while providing great food in a great atmosphere.I went this morning at noon for the brunch and was easy to get a table.Our order was taken quickly.  The special that looked too good to pass up was the Sweet Potato and Pecan Pancakes.  YUM.  I don't think I can ever use Maple syrup after trying Cafe Too's spread.However, the Caprese Benedict was just underwhelming.  The taste was muddled.  The hash browns weren't anything special either.  It was nice that sweet potatoes were mixed, but I think that if the potatoes were cut larger or shreadded, the taste would have been a marked improvement.  The middle of the road isn't cutting it.I would come again.  The prices are reasonable and their ethos is very admirable."
"This place is great. The food was delicious and the servers were very friendly, helpful and kind of on the chatty side ;)I had the crab cake benedict. Only gripe was that I was expecting it to be bigger... the crab cakes, which turned out to be made with crawfish, were decidedly smaller than I expected. I guess when I picture a crab I expect more of a hockey puck than a silver dollar. But it was tasty."
I really enjoyed this quaint little place. I was very impressed with the food! Love the prix fixe menu. Our server was very friendly! It's a must try! I love the concept.
"Have you heard of Inspiration Cafe?* Well, Cafe Too is the other half of the equation. Every year Cafe Too helps individuals gain valuable employment skills in our endeavor to end homelessness in Chicago. (cafetoo.org) I love brunch, but I love BYOB brunch even more! Four of us arrived on a Saturday morning, armed with champagne and ready to stake our claim for a table. Shockingly, we were seated immediately. The cafe is small, but bright, modern and friendly with fresh flowers gracing every table. Since it wasn't crowded we were able to have a leisurely brunch and never once felt rushed; quite unusual, kind of like seeing a unicorn strutting the streets of Chicago. I ordered the blueberry buttermilk pancakes with a side of hash browns. The pancakes were good, but would have been better with more blueberries. The hash browns were an assortment of cubed regular and sweet potatoes; quite good, but I prefer a shredded potato. Service was friendly and attentive, our supply of orange juice never ran dry. We got 4 meals, a few sides and OJ for under $40; what a steal! The cafe's menu changes constantly and they serve more than just brunch; I can't wait to return and try more dishes. Before you get all ""ooh, that sounds cool, but it's too far north, blah, blah, blah"" know that it's very transit friendly. Several bus routes will get you close and the Lawrence red line stop is just a short walk. Now that you have no excuses, go fill your belly and support a great organization. TIP: It's not a very big space, probably not ideal for groups of more than 4 on weekends. * Inspiration Cafe provides restaurant-style meals, case management, support groups, life-skills training, financial assistance and other services to homeless men and women in a therapeutic community that promotes dignity and respect.(inspirationcorp.org/prog…)"
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food is always amazing, the prices are perfect, the atmosphere is cozy and the cause is amazing. I did a project for a sociology class on this place and learned a lot about the passion and the drive of the people who run this place, and even got a chance to talk to someone who was attending culinary classes through Inspiration. I have not come across a single bad word about this place. The only thing I've found to be disappointing is the menu changes often and the food is not always consistently good, but the prices cannot be beat, and for the cause I am more than willing to put up with a less than amazing meal. However, 3 of the 4 times I have been here I was wowed by the food."
"Brunch: Very fast. Awesome cause. Friendly service. Delicious food. Perfect serving size, not too much. And cheap. What else is there to say. ... I had the biscuits and chorizo gravy and I'll order that again when I return."
"2 Good2 Be4 GottenThis is probably scribbled in your junior high yearbook or ribbon or whatever the hell your school gave out but it's how I feel about this place in a nutshell. Food was devine and pretty cheap (spinach and goat cheese eggs benedict with turkey sausage was awesome and only $8 ), staff was attentive, BYOB so mimosas were flowing freely and they only charged us $1.50 for like 3 large glasses of OJ. Cute and cozy little spot that also gives something back to the community...what's not to love?"
"Good food but not great.Had the chicken, pesto, goat cheese panini with fruit on the side. The fruit was lackluster, the panini was fairy tasty. The BF had mushroom, florentine eggs benedict. We both enjoyed our lunches but were not blown away by anything in particular. The staff was friendly, the place nice and clean and the prices pretty typical of Chicago but I do not  think we will be going back. We don't really live in the neighborhood. Also we were not offered a refill on our sodas until the end of the meal! Our drinks had been gone for way too long and our food finished. Meal over, ""would you like more coke?"" No, not while I'm signing the check thanks, too late. That really annoys me. We were happy to try some place new but just really not that impressed."
Their food surprised me! It's really good dining place. Recommend it and I will check the up-down one soon!
"Our waitress was the friendliest and most genuine person we have had in a long time! I wish I could remember her name, but unfortunately I am terrible with names. However, when I think about our breakfast experience, the service is what jumps out as extraordinary! The contemporary style was cute and artsy. I loved my bacon waffle with juicy eggs on top. I would come back here in a heart-beat!"
"Inspiration Kitchens is an incredible social enterpise with delicious food, excellent service, and an amazing concept. I highly recommend it!!!"
This is an incredible restaurant! The food was amazing and the staff was so so helpful. We visited during lunch and couldn't have been happier! Soups were also crazy good!!!!
Cafe Too.  Featured on Check! Please.  Just as I predicted last month.  Forget Nostradamus.  You better check with Johnny T if you wanna know the future.  Cubs?  Will lose.  Arod and Kate Hudson?  Won't last.  Octomom showing out?  You may rely on it.  Will you find fortune and fame?  Concentrate and ask again.The cards never lie!!  Call me now!   ...cleo...
"My friend and I both had off from work on a random Tuesday. When Tweet was closed (what?! I know...closed on Tuesdays!) we decided to venture down Sheridan, kind of stupid, but it was in the middle of the day...I had heard great things about Cafe Too on Yelp so we checked it out. It wasn't very crowded maybe two other tables filled but that was alright. The setup was kind of half restaurant with 10 tables or so then half cafe with a bar along the wall for seating. We were talking about the FREE WIFI and the person who seated us promptly brought over the code. :-) This would be a great place to come and do your homework. It isn't crowded and there's no cheesy music. AnywayyyyWe were seated right away and the waitress was VERY nice and attentive, our water glasses were never half empty, nor were they half full (haha?). I ordered the BBQ Chicken Platter and my friend ordered the St. Patty's Day burger. My chicken came with a side of backed Maccaroni and greens. Very good and flavorful. I had thought I would get chicken fingers with bbq sauce but I got actual chicken. It was enough to be counted as a dinner meal and I took most of the sides home. My friend loved her burger that had chipped beef hash as well as a side of soup. Our check was $20 for two dinner-like entrees. Can't beat that. We mentioned to the waitress that we were going to get coffee at the 'cafe' part and she put in our order for us! How nice! My medium iced chai and yummy as well as my chocolate croissant. My friend's iced coffee with 3 espresso shots mind you and they asked if she wanted four was good as well. Pretty sure Starbucks only gives you 2 shots! The lady who rang up our coffee was very nice too! Here's the price breakdown:BBQ chicken platter--$10St. Patty's Day Burger-$9Medium Iced Coffee and cookie-$6Medium iced Chai and Chocolate Croissant-$4!!!I will be back for sure, if not for their great entrees then definitely for their CHEAP good coffee/chai/pastries. I also love the concept about teaching at-risk people culinary skills. They sure do a great job!"
Service 4 no coffee or water refillsFrench Toast 3 tasty but sm portion and I could make it myselfCaprese Benedict 4 a great dish but the mozz cheese was cold and threw off the overall experienceDecor 5 clean creative and great bathroomOverall we had a great time and are happy to support an community organization and a great place to eat :-)
I loved this place -- friendly and helpful staff and hearty not greasy or heavy breakfast. I had the eggs Benedict with side salad and bacon; all of it was delicious. It is also worth mentioning that it was cooked quickly. Only drawback was that its a little cramped. Don't let it stop you though!
"I went here for dinner with family. It is a small but very intimate place. The service was great and the food was also exceptional. Everything was at a very affordable price. I would definitely come back to try more things! Recommendations: crab cakes, slow braised beef, tilapia over crab cakes, and the tacos with mole sauce (the best overall)"
"We celebrated a birthday brunch on Sunday. It could not have been more successful! From dealing with reservations and catering (we had 14 people) to service, the process was flawless. Both Mikes (I am told there are 5 on staff) and Charles were most gracious and accommodating. I have a large crazy Italian Family everyone was pleased with the food selections.  The food was just delicious.  We will all be back."
"An enjoyable experience, creative menu with some noteworthy highlights - worthwhile supporting a good cause. Apps/dessert far outshone entrees:- blackened crab cakes: delicious- goat cheese salad: generous, perfectly breaded goat cheese on top of strawberries/baby spinach- smoky tomato bisque w/grilled cheese: - mocha affogado: mocha ice cream with espresso - perfect- chocolate tart with ginger coulis: surprisingly refreshingEntrees: not worth re-orderingsteak chimichurri - bland, definitely passbreaded catfish - the tiniest sliver of dry catfish (how is that possible?)blackened chili chicken w/polenta - chicken had an off-flavorService has some hiccups - didn't have our online reservation for some reason, service was awkward (only 1 friend ordered the 5-course, but this somehow confused our server - we had to request that the remaining 6 of us who ordered the 3-course be served in parallel). Cozy space suitable for parties of up to 6.  BYOB. Might try again, worth supporting its mission."
"Wow.  What a great little restaurant!  Completely off my beaten path, this little store-front restaurant has elegant, clean interior details such canopies drawn across the ceiling.It's inspiring to read their mission statement (teaching the homeless marketable skills in the restaurant world), and even more impressive when you take a bite out of the delicious savory entrees!  And extraordinarily affordable, given the ambience and food quality.A great experience, will definitely return!"
"Wonderful food, fantastic service.  We loved both our meals and the coffee was good to boot.  This is definitely a new favorite!"
"We went there on Saturday. It was easy to make reservations and change them. Our waitress was wonderful, and the food was even better. The dinner was to celebrate my birthday with some friends. The restaurant was very accommodating when my friends wanted to have them bring out a cake they brought as well. They told us the menu is changing in the next week or two, I can't wait to go back and see what is new on the menu!"
I love the story behind. The service is great but the food is just ok. I wish they have more lunch selection (sandwich type) during their brunch hours
"What a great cause!!! The Crawfish Benedict was FANTASTIC!!!! I had brunch here for my birthday. We were a group of 5, so we had to squish a little cause this location is smaller than the other, but the table still felt like it had plenty of room! I will definitely go back!"
"Would give it high grades just for the ""social experiment"" that Inspiration is doing, but the five stars are for the great service and excellent food!  Don't let the ""grit"" of the neighborhood deter you from the experience."
"Today was one of those lazy ass days. Christopher got back last night  from his driving trip. We were both really hungry this morning, so I suggested Cafe Too, because I had just bookmarked it last night. First off to calm the nerves of anyone who might have read the review from the 20 something white bread girl from the burbs.... this area is not that scary. Twenty years ago, yes the case could be made, but now, heck, even the alley was clean. Use the same caution and common sense you would in any urban setting and you will be fine. Now, as to the Cafe.... bright, clean, airy, and staffed by a great bunch of people who deserve this wonderful opportunity. We sat inside to get a broader experience of what the place is all about. It reflects all that is good in reaching out to others. Not only is the staff friendly, but I think the atmosphere and what they are accomplishing brings out the best in the customers as well. There is no better feeling , IMHO, than do do something for others. It casts a glow of well being over everything it touches. As to the food,we had the brunch today. Both of us ordered the biscuits and gravy platter. It came with very nicely scrambled eggs and a choice of bacon or sausage and sides of either fresh fruit salad or their hash browns. The food was nicely presented and generous portions too, but it wasn't food that left us hungering for more. It was a bit lacking in seasoning. In general though it was not bad. We certainly finished it all. I got the fresh fruit side, and asked our server if they could go easy on the honey dew melon because I am allergic to it. She prepared it herself and made sure there was none in it at all. I got so much fruit salad I took most of it home. We will be back many times I am sure, especially to try the dinner menu. This restaurant is a wonderful concept and I wish them nothing but success in the future."
"OK -- I already loved this place. I have been going here since it opened for lunch and loooove the Turkey Bacon Avocado Wrap. The breakfast/brunches are also delish and very affordable. Plus, you're doing something good for humanity by supporting this nonprofit. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Now, I love it even more. At night on the weekends, it becomes super fancy with its Prix Fixe meals! My parents had gone before, but I'm kinda cheap/broke, so still thought $18 for 3 courses and $24 for 5 courses was out of my price range. Then, my mom told me it was BYOB. I was in! My boyfriend, parents, and I went to Cafe Too on Saturday night for the Prix Fixe. I'm attaching some pictures. The food was sooo good and the presentation was gorgeous. BYOB just made the experience perfect. Reservations probably aren't necessary for dinner, but the place is small, so I err on the side of caution and always make reservations."
"Supporting great organizations AND delicious brunch? Sign me up! As a gal who lives south of Division, I rarely get to Uptown, but the lure of brunch/gossip is too good to turn down. So I dragged my hungover and hungry self up to Cafe Too for what turned out to be a better than expected brunching experience. Cafe Too is my kinda place. It's very clean, very bright and very, very comfortable. The white table cloths, simple place settings and lots of seating by the windows looking out onto Sheridan are welcoming and cheery. And the food is nothing to scoff at!  While it's fairly standard issue: omelets, bagels and lox... the usual. But it's done nicely. I liked the ""build your own omelet"" menu item, and I loved that you can get an egg white only omelet. My tasty combo of turkey sausage, cheddar and spinach was lovely. The hash browns are crispy. The coffee is hot. The OJ is fresh. What more can you ask for? Cafe Too is also one of the best brunch deals in town. Brunch for two, including 2 coffees, 2 omelets and 2 mammoth glasses of OJ came to about $25. Can't beat that!!!"
"I cannot tell a lie: my husband and I have dubbed this area ""Crazy Town"". Why? Well... there's a lot of crazies. I have no idea why the concentration of crazy is high here but, such is life. We only live a few blocks away so the crazy appears not to scare us off. No... we're not very PC. I know... we're trying. The moral of this story... expect some crazy but, all in all, they're harmless. Anyways, on to the review. We woke up early this morning and, well, I was feeling hella lazy and didn't want to cook. We discussed our options. The Mr. brought up Cafe Too... we'd heard about it word of mouth... it was on Check, Please! recently... it's blocks from our house. Now, when a place is on Check, Please! it's pretty much guaranteed that you will have a wait when you walk in the door. At Cafe Too this morning, that was not the case. We were one of three tables when we walked in. Sweeeeeet. Waitress: sunny, friendly, helpful, attentive. You can't get any better than that. Food: mmmmmmmmm. I had the (regular) eggs Benedict and the spouse had an omelet full of meat. Forget the fruit option... we both went potatoes. Eggs Benedict: poached eggs were perfectly cooked. Hollandaise sauce was mmmm mmmm good (I hate hate hate a hollandaise sauce with too much lemon... citrus has no place in my morning meal). Omelet: my husband is a walking heart attack... bacon, sausage and cheddar. Shockingly, and probably because it was our first time there, he let me try it. The bacon was crisp even inside the omelet... and that's just brilliant. Breakfast potatoes: I never thought I would say this... there were sweet potatoes diced and mixed with the regular potatoes... and I still loved them. We speculate they deep fry their potatoes; crispy yet to greasy. Perfect. The best part was we scored a booth by the window. While we're not normally the types that sit together on the same side of the booth, it was just so cozy we gave it a whirl. It was nice... sipping some tea after my meal, cozied up to my favorite person... people watching the crazies that went by..."
"This was a difficult review choice. My biscuits and gravy skillet was delicious, and pretty much two full meals for me, but it was my third choice after they ran out of my first two choices. I loved having BYOB mimosas. There was a really friendly and helpful server that happened to not be ours.Now, our server was pretty bad. He completely screwed up my two friends' orders TWICE. The first time, he told a friend that they ran out of regular salmon and asked if it was okay to put smoked salmon in the Salmon and Spinach Benedict. My friend said that was fine, and somehow his order came out as bagel and lox. Even when the server ""fixed"" this, there was no spinach in this salmon and spinach benedict. For my other friend, he somehow mistook Caprese Panini for a Ham and Cheese Panini. Those two sound nothing alike. When he ""fixed"" this order, the caprese panini came out with no basil or pesto. So basically, mozzerella and tomato and bread. The other server was much more helpful to us, even though we weren't her table. I really wish she had been our server, and that would have probably resulted in a 5-star review. I wouldn't mind trying this place again, but I hope I get that woman next time.On the bright side, I saw a modern day pirate here yesterday. He was wearing all black, tight clothes on a 88 degree day, a beret, and his shirt was V-neck to his navel, and he also had a limp."
I love this place.Not just for the food or the service but what Inspirations Cafe is and does.Inspirations Cafe gets people of the street and teaches them a skills so they can get back on their feet.Read more here citysbest.com/chicago/ne…The staff was very friendly and helpful even when the rest of my party showed up a half hour late.Yes I should have known better.Yelpers are never on time especially in large groups.Like groups bigger than one.My meal was very good even though the Crab Cake I was craving was sold out already.I hope these individual who took excellent care of us con be as personable and diligent with whatever path they take from here.
"Great food, kind, attentive, accommodating servers (anybody who makes up an exquisite salad of field greens, fresh tomatoes, onions and honey balsamic vinaigrette salad to substitute for the bagel/toast/pancake/potatoes carbohydrate-hell non-options becomes my instantaneous friend). Add to this their laudable mission of giving people job skills, and there's nothing but good in this place."
"Great mission & great food!I had some delicious cranberry walnut pancakes & the special pumpkin chai latte and...mmmm!  The pancakes were delicious & the chai was so good I did what I never do-- I had a second.  My husband created his own omlete & it was enourmous.  He really enjoyed it, but couldn't quite make it to the end.  The breakfast potatoes were a regular & sweet potato combo, and those were great.  The prices were so reasonable that I thought they made a mistake on our bill!  Service was a little slow, but the only had one server & one hostess, and they were consistantly full.  I never waited long for anything that made it seem more than ""relaxed.""  I really love what they do there.  I will continue to go back & support it, because they are actually helping their community.  They are giving people the tools to help themselves to a better life, and putting out a quality product.  I wish more businesses would follow their example."
"I am all for supporting great organizations.  The owner, who is also the owner of Inspiration Cafe, is doing wonders (amazing things) for Uptown.  Kudos for her!!!Eating at this restaurant since last year, I have tried the fruit salad and their chicken sausage Frittata Rosso.  Friend had the banana stuffed French Toast.  We both truly enjoyed our orders.I have nothing bad to say about this place what so ever. Definitely would go back!!!"
"My biggest problem with lunch at Cafe Too- everything on the menu looked SO good! I wanted it all, but finally decided on:crab cake salad- lunch specialtomato basil soup- needed some warming upsweet potato fries- for the table (yeah right i'll share ;))The soup was good, but once I started eating it I realized I wasn't really in the mood for soup.  What I was in the mood for...sweet potato fries! They were thick, covered with lots of oil...and delicious! I was nice and shared...although I didn't want to.The crab cake salad was nice too; the balsamic vinaigrette dressing on top of it was a good choice.I'll come back to try the brunch menu especially after Colleen C told me there is rarely a wait.  I hope they have the sweet potato fries on their brunch menu!"
"Inspiration Kitchens just happened to be near where I needed to be early Sunday so we decided to grab brunch here.  Definitely agree with the prior reviews the the service was one of the friendliest I've ever experienced in dining.  The portion size was good at the price point.  Food was good enough that I can see coming here again.   Decent decor so don't expect it to be a hole-in-the-wall just because where it's located. it is close enough to Tweet for those who normally dines there for breakfast so if you frequent Tweet, I would definitely give this place a try.   It's hard not to like a place with a mission like  IK - Do good. Dine well.  Come by!"
"Whole Wheat Bagel: ToastedLarge spread of thick cream cheeseSlices of fresh cucumberA thin layer of fresh smoked salmon.The Salmon Bagel Sandwich at Cafe Too: $6. Fantastic. Another reason to come back here. I'm shooting to try each menu item by March...ha! Also, never a wait. I guess I shouldn't say that, as I don't want to have to wait...but I will share. I guess. Ok. LOX! Do it."
"Located in my old hood, this little café is a popular brunch spot for folk in the area, though it isn't well known.  But as it is in many parts of the city, parking can be a challenge.They have daily specials and a nice menu selection, but are BYOB so you'll need to bring your ""hair O dog"" if needed.  It is very affordable.  Service is also good, but none of these reasons aren't the most important to patronize this establishment.  It is part of Inspiration Corporation which core goal is to end homelessness.  One way they do it is employ hundreds of homeless and low-income individuals gain the skills to succeed in the workforce and increase self sufficiency. Café Too helps these individuals through training, culinary training, job placement and more and that is the biggest reason I support this establishment."
"Hmm . . . .I may have come on an off day or maybe I should have ordered the special of the day, but on my recent visit, Cafe Too was just ""A-Ok."" Not that there is anything wrong with ""A-Ok""- other than I was hoping for an ""as good as it gets"" experience. We came on a Sunday morning for their brunch. The place was about half full and we were promptly given menus and told of that day's specials. Lots of choices on the menu, from giant omelette's, to french toast to the quiche of the day and their descriptions all sounded wonderful (of course I was hungry so that may have helped!)I had the Eggs Benedict. While one of the two eggs was perfectly prepared, the other egg was actually hard boiled. No runny yolk at all. Rather then send it back I ate it, but I still can't figure out how two eggs cooked for the same order could have such a difference in doneness, unless they precook (stage) their eggs. Very odd. Other than that mis-step-Cafe Too was good. I had brought a bottle of Veuve to celebrate a birthday, and we were immediately presented with champagne flutes and orange juice (for those who wanted mimosas). The servers were friendly and the bathroom was spotless. And the price?  Cheap for the amount of food that you get.If you drive- my suggestion would be don't. Parking in this area is a bit of a nightmare. I finally found a spot a few blocks away but only after driving around for awhile. This area is a little challenging- so if you want to keep the party going after brunch- you will probably have to walk down to Broadway and go to one of the bars there, as there really isn't anything in the near vicinity . I'll give it another try cuz I'm guessing my food was a fluke given all the great reviews on Yelp. And I love the whole concept of the place."
"This was only my 2nd time eating lunch here and it was incredible! The Uptown burger was delicious. Great mix of flavors between the homemade pickles, sautéed onions, and homemade patty. Also, the cream of Turkey soup is very very good. I'm not sure this place even has anything that isn't delicious!"
"Perfectly good food, pleasant waitstaff, nice interior. My Eggs Benedict was delicious, my 7 star companion's omelette was generous and tasty. Side of bacon and sausage - yum. The price was probably the best thing - very reasonable $20 breakfast for two.What it wasn't, was anything spectacular. The food was fresh and well presented, it just wasn't anything I'd clamor to go back and revisit. The area is still a little shady, and if you're up for some after-breakfast wandering and browsing (as we were) there just isn't all that much to find interesting in the neighborhood . . . yet. The menu didn't have anything I'd not eaten before - that's what racks up the stars with me. Although . . . it would be a great place to take my parents when they visit . . . it could have value as a place older parents would like."
"I went to Inspiration Kitchens with a group of 7, and it could not have been a better experience!  From the reservation process right through shutting the place down, it was a perfect experience.  Everyone was wonderfully responsive (multiple e-mails about reservations and menu questions, catering menus printed off as soon as we asked for them- which was immediately after our first bites of the first course!), and the food was seriously phenomenal.  Highlights for me were the goat cheese salad, the shrimp and grits appetizer, the crispy brussels sprouts appetizer, the sweet potato soup, the hanger steak (ordered rare- could not have been more freaking delicious), and the red velvet beignets!  I tried almost everything on the menu because my wonderful group of friends loves to share and sample, and while I had favorites, there were not any dishes that left a bad taste in my mouth.  Everything was beautifully prepared and wonderfully flavored!I also don't know what people are talking about when they say that portions are small.  $20 for a 5-course meal is an amazing deal no matter how small the dishes are, and these were all perfectly portioned!  Three of us ordered together in order to access as much of the menu as possible, so we had 15 dishes total, and all of them had plenty for each of us to have a substantial taste of the dish before passing and moving on to the next.  If anyone can manage to finish a 5-course meal here and still be hungry, that's a personal problem, not a restaurant problem.  :)Finally, the staff are AMAZING.  Super attentive, always quick to open our bottles and refill our glasses, and really friendly.  We chatted with the chef a ton, and she was so nice and willing to tell us all about just how exactly she got the brussels sprouts so crispy yet tender and why on earth a dish would ever be called airplane chicken when airplane food sounds terrible (it wasn't at all terrible- the best chicken I've ever had in a restaurant, and I'm picky about chicken!).Could not recommend more highly!"
"Great food and service! They really do a wonderful job.  Cute place and friendly people.  Five course meal for $20/pp, you cannot beat that!"
"I love Inspiration Kitchens in Uptown.  We stumbled across it one day for breakfast, and now it's one of my favorites. I've only come for breakfast, but the dinner menu looks delicious and reasonably priced [3 courses for $15 or 5 courses for $20!].I've had an omelet [though I couldn't tell you what kind... it was a while ago] and a Croque Madame: good bread, ham, swiss cheese, bechamel sauce, and a fried egg on top. The bechamel sauce on the Croque Madame was so good,  and so was the swiss cheese. It wasn't deep fried like some places do this type of sandwich, but it was more like a grilled sandwich. But better. And the sandwich was huge. I had to take the rest of it home to eat the next day for lunch.Something I especially enjoyed was a cranberry jam they served the first time I visited. It's got a perfect texture and is very tart. They still had it when I visited the next time, and brought a cup out for me to have with my toast. I took the leftover home, hoping to recreate it sometime soon.The service here is wonderful. Everyone is eager to share about the food--how it's made, the ingredients, what their favorites are. And everybody is so friendly!I love everything about this place. It's small, nice decor, amazing food and friendly staff.  What's not to like?"
"I have eaten here several times, and I enjoy the food, atmosphere, service, but most importantly, the reason they are there. Simply stated, they are an organization which helps those who are homeless and/or in poverty learn food industry skills. I have had the Chicken Caesar Wrap ($8) several times. I've tried some of their specials. I've had their fish tacos as well; they have good food. The front of the restaurant is all windows, so there is great bright light if that is your thing. Service: Anne has been my server every time but one. I like her a lot; she's great. On only one occasion have I not been too thrilled.  It was when I ordered avocado with a fish taco, I believe is what it was.  They brought me out this brown avocado in a dish.  I sent it back and asked for fresh.  I was a bit disappointed anyone would serve something like that.Info you may need- When they are not serving food, they still serve coffee, pastries, and desserts. Monday 7am - 10am Breakfast Tuesday & Wednesday 7am - 11am Breakfast 11am - 3pm Lunch Thursday & Friday 7am - 11am Breakfast 11am - 3pm Lunch 5pm - 9pm Dinner Saturday 9am - 2pm Brunch 5pm - 9pm Dinner Sunday 9am - 2pm Brunch"
"Love this place!!  The food was excellent!  My kids had chocolate chip pancakes that they loved!  The Eggs Benedict were some of the best I've ever had.  The potatoes were perfect...not greasy, and crispy.  On top of excellent food, our waitress, hostess and bus person were wonderful.  We live in Evanston and plan on coming back often!!"
I ate here brunch here last week when visiting Chicago from NYC. Their mission is Dine Well. Do Good. and that's exactly what you do. The food and service is great (we got the eggs benedict and red velvet pancakes) and it was such a bargain ($8-$9 an entree)! We made sure to leave a big tip to support such a great organization. I hope this a restaurant like this opens in more parts of the country.
"I've been here for both brunch and dinner, and it has exceeded my expectations. For brunch I had a crawfish dish, and I've lived in Louisiana and no what to expect. It was delicious. I tried some of my friends' dishes, and they were also tasty. I had a 5-course dinner and was very happy with it. The workers there are extremely friendly and passionate, which makes you feel good that you're supporting a cause for people who are getting their lives back on track. It's also BYOB, so you can't go wrong with that. The food doesn't have a WOW factor to it, but it is all really delicious."
"The food was delicious, the staff was very friendly and the food came out quickly. Everything about this place was great, especially what they're doing for the community."
"The menu online carries their real time prices.  Clean cut modern look to the place.  Food presentation, plating and settings are done well.  Imagine white linen table covers, square and rectangle ivory dishware, I found the salt and pepper shakers too hard to find.  (You figure that out.)  Brunch is very affordable, sampled the Eggs Benedict and French toast. My buddy had the Fritatta Rosso (A baked open faced omelet with spicy chicken sausage, roasted green peppers and onions. Topped with farmers cheese and our own roasted red pepper sauce, served with hash browns.  Everything looked and tasted good, with exception to the French toast, which tasted rushed and made with a too tough wheat bread.  In a shite economy like ours, their prices and servings are on point and of a good value.On Sundays, brunch ends at 3pm.  BYOB"
"""Dine Well. Do Good.""inspirationkitchens.orgA group of us went to Inspiration Kitchens for dinner after seeing that it was for a good cause and served good food.  It was also featured on Check, Please!  On their website, they say that ""Inspiration Kitchens has helped hundreds of individuals gain the skills they need to find employment and exit homelessness and poverty.""  Employees are being trained for careers in the hospitality industry.The restaurant was classy and intimate, our server did a good job (with help from a mentor), and the and food was delicious.  Dinner is served tapas-style and is great for a date night or small group.  Small plates and flatware are cleared and replaced promtly.The corn fritters were perfectly prepared and presented--crunchy on the outside and savory on the inside. The spinach and artichoke mac & cheese was incredible--the pasta was cooked al dente, with just the right amount of spinach and artichoke to complement the buttery mac & cheese.The slow braised beef was tender and served with an outstanding parmesan polenta and red onion frites.  We also tried the crab stuffed tilapia and crab cakes.  All were very good.  The fish was fresh and perfectly prepared.  For dessert, we sampled everything: caramel bread pudding, funnel cake sundae, banana pudding, and strawberry shortcake.  The banana pudding was probably the favorite among the group, but there weren't any leftovers either!Overall a great experience.  I give it an extra 1* bump for a great cause."
"Adam F. invited some friends to brunch and, never one to turn that sort of thing down on a Sunday, I came along.  First things first:  I'm embarrassed to admit I'd never heard of this wonderful cause before.  Especially since I run my own outreach to help those in need  (chicagonow.com/neighbori…). *hangs head in shame*  I am, however, now happily enlightened!  So what's my take on the Inspiration experience?The overall experience:  alright, let's give ourselves a little reality check here, haters.  This is, essentially, a school.  You're not going to get a meal cooked by a celebrity chef... these are people from the streets learning a valuable skill and that'scool.The food?  Not bad!  Was there room for improvement? Sure but I've also had significantly worse cooked by reputable chefs and I paid a whole lot more for it.The decor is lovely.  Yes, the dining area is small but it's not nearly as tiny as I was lead to believe.  There was plenty of elbow rooom for our party of three (and extra room for the bags of beer - it's BYOB)!Our server was a sweetheart.  A little frazzled but no big deal.In short:  go here.  You'll get a decent meal on the cheap and you'll be contributing to a most worthy cause."
"Wow, what a gem. Service was incredible and friendly with a smile. Food was creative, delicious, well executed and unique! Portions big! Awesome cause! This is my new spot. Highly recommended."
"Brunch is a really good deal here at Cafe Too.  We were surprised how little people were here on a Sunday.  We were seated immediately and for just four people, we got the biggest booth they had.I opted to build my own omelette with three ingredients for only $6 while sneaking bites of my friend's breakfast burrito (which had steak and avocado in it).  The food was just enough for us to be full but not too stuffed.  I noticed that they had free wifi and fresh smoothies that I will have to check out next time.I also noticed that their dinner special is:Choose any 3 courses for $16.50Choose any 5 courses for $22.50What a steal - I may have to drag friends back here to check out their dinner specials!  (I also saw sirloin on their dinner menu, too)Overall, a great meal for a really good price with little wait and it's BYOB, too!"
"The cafe's premise -- providing homeless and underprivileged individuals with training and jobs -- merits five stars on its own. The fact that the food is very good and an amazing value is just icing on the cake.Service is extremely friendly if somewhat unpolished (keep in mind their mission). And I'll take that anytime over smooth, cold, efficient service. After we told our server how much we loved our braised beef, she let the chef know, and the chef came out and chatted with us for a few minutes.We've brought friends for dinner here several times, and they've loved it. Haven't had brunch here yet, but heard its extremely good (and popular).Eat here. Trust me."
"I went here for the first time ever today with a friend for brunch. Delicious menu! Decent prices! But that's just to start. The staff was extremely pleasant. I can't remember when I went to a place to eat and the people working were happy to be there. It was like I had walked into someone's personal kitchen. Someone was constantly filling my water or coffee, smiling, checking in in a very non-annoying way. I felt very taken care of. Chef Kim is a warm and pleasant light walking around the cafe, making sure everything and everyone is well.Even with all of that, it gets better. The whole point of the cafe is to provide the homeless and underprivileged with training and jobs. This place is truly a gem of Uptown. Chef Kim is trying to start a Soul Food night on Sundays. Though I can't attend next weekend because I'll be out of town, I hope this becomes a weekly event. I would really like to come some Sunday night. I can't wait to go again!"
"While I've always been a bit skeptical of the culinary prowess and quality of ingredients at this restaurant, I continue to be surprised and delighted by their genuine service and creative offerings.  A recent visit allowed me to taste their summer omlette: zucchini, feta cheese and cherry tomatoes.  Also, their cinnamon rolls were of a crispy exterior and tender interior.  The portion sizes are perfect not to indulge overeating.  The quality of the coffee could be bettered, and sometimes the chef has a heavy hand on the salt, but all restaurants have things to work on."
"I finally made it to Cafe Too for brunch. And yes, you should mock me, because this place is an easy walk (just under a mile) from my front door. I don't know what took me so long, but now that I've been there, I'll be back.First of all, biscuits and gravy. Or biscuits and gravy madness, I should say. Why has no one else thought to put cheese on biscuits and gravy? If you're a purist, the very thought may horrify you, but if you're a gourmand like me, you say ""bring it on!"" And cajun sausage gravy. Oh mother.I had the fruit salad instead of the hash browns -- and quite the tasty combo it was, too -- but my companion had the potatoes, and the addition of sweet potatoes to the mix was a delightful surprise. More of a potato hash than hash brown, but potato/potahto is what I say to that. Was it good? Then eat it up!If you know anything about Cafe Too, you know it's run by the Inspiration Corporation, and part of its goal is to provide employment training for Chicago's poor and homeless. For my dollar, that translates into people who are happy to have a job. If you've had to put up with surly staff at other eateries, you'll be happy to know there's none of that here. Our sassy server treated us like family.What I didn't know until today, when I checked out their website, is that Cafe Too has a prixy fixy dinner menu. 18 bucks for three courses, or 24 for five! (Appetizer, soup, salad, entrée and dessert.) Considering that most places with a prixy fixy offer three courses for $25 (or more), and only offer it one night a week, this is a steal!"
"I think that Inspiration Kitchen is a fantastic idea, but me and my friend decided not to eat here after we even walked in due to service.  The guy behind the counter was nothing short of rude and made us both sound like idiots when we simply were confused by their not serving food until 5p when it was 4:50p.  This review is solely based on service for we lost our appetite and didn't end up eating.  If you want cheap food and don't mind terrible service, there are still a thousand other places in Chicago... but not Inspiration Kitchen."
"Wow, this was a seriously fantastic meal. I'm not a morning person, but I really like breakfast food. Luckily, there is brunch. A meal where I can get breakfast food at 1 in the afternoon. A meal where I don't have to get my lazy ass out of bed before early afternoon. A meal that fills me up and then leaves me sleepy so that I can go home and take a nap after only being awake for 2 hours. Brunch, you are my hero. Cafe Too happens to serve brunch, and what a meal it was. They had the great idea to combine biscuits and gravy with corned beef hash. And then they put cheese on it. That's right, cheese*.  Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this was going to be good, but it exceeded my expectations.  The entire meal was fantastic and I want it again, soon.The service was great; attentive but not intrusive and friendly but not in-your-face.  As we were leaving one of the waitresses even gave us a tip on a festival that was happening close by.  I thought that was a nice touch.  Plus, since this place is part of Inspiration Cafe (hence Cafe Too) dining here goes to a good cause.  Yay for charity!!I will make it a point to come back here soon, it is now a part of my brunch rotation.*See my review of The Grafton for a better sense of my love of cheese."
"Three stars for the food, one extra for their social cause.  In a neighborhood with so much poverty and homelessness, it's great to see an agency taking steps to actively improve the lives of these people.  The staff at the restaurant were all homeless/disadvantaged in some way and are all in a work training program.  I thought the food was a-ok, but not amazing... We had the caprese benedict which was pretty blah in both flavor and texture.  Likewise, the hash browns were little hard cubes of regular and sweet potatoes.  For my taste, they were too little and had been fried too long leaving them very hard and crunchy.  We also had the sweet potato and pecan pancakes.  They were good, although the pecans were really burnt and had a strong burnt flavor.  The sauce on the pancakes was probably the best part of the meal, and definitely trumps any regular syrup for pancakes.Check it out.  It's a good cause.  If I had been at M. Henry I would have been disappointed with quality of the food, but I'll cut them a little slack and will probably go back and give it another try."
"Solid 4.5 stars! 5, since I like to round up. :)The food is really good and inexpensive. The boy and I stopped in for brunch today, and for two meals (his panini was so big he has dinner too, haha) and a latte the bill was under $20. We were a bit confused walking in, everyone was busy but once someone noticed us, service was nothing short of great! A little slow, but they were very busy and water refills were always prompt.I had the berries and creme french toast (delish! and REAL whipped cream!), the boy had the ham/cheese panini with hash browns (they serve their hash browns chopped instead of shredded, which surprised him). The food is closer to 4 stars, it's VERY good, and not too fancy, as well as served in an appetizing fashion. Everyone who stopped by our table was friendly and all smiles, and I got a really good feeling from the place.The goal of the place, as a training program for the homeless to get back on their feet, has bumped this up from 4 to 5 stars. Wonderful job!"
"Absolutely loved the food, service, and atmosphere! I joined a couple friends for brunch, both of whom are regulars. The staff knows them pretty well so it was wonderful to be able to chat with the staff and hear what they really recommended to try. I love, love little neighborhood restaurants where you can develop that sort of relationship. The staff was incredibly attentive and helpful. And, they even brought out a free plate of their deliciously rich Bread Pudding. The food was also pretty darn fantastic as well. Everything was incredibly fresh, including my fruit salad (I tend to use fruit salad to gauge freshness). Overall, my taste buds were pretty pleased.It's definitely worth going to for the food and atmosphere, and it just makes it that much sweeter and more enjoyable to know it's directly helping people in the neighborhood. All around incredibly positive and lovely experience."
Amazing black bean breakfast burrito!
"Another brunch spot tried and tested.Cafe Too was pretty darn good. My friend and I went there today to check it out. We were drawn to the great reviews, great prices and the great work it does.I had the chorizo skillet, which was super yum and she had the crabcake benedict, which I tried and was also super yum. I took off one star for a few reasons. 1. They forgot to bring our coffee, which wasn't a huge deal. My friend's tasty hazelnut latte made up for it. 2. I ordered over-easy eggs for my skillet and they brought out scrambled. It still tasted good. 3. The food was lukewarm. I think they forgot about it, because the table next to us came in at the same time as we did and got their food about 10 minutes ahead of us.Even with all those things we both would totally go back. We got there at about 11:45 and had a super short wait to be seated, the servers were fairly friendly, the food tasted good and it's just great for the community."
"Taken by a friend who lived nearby....probably the shortest brunch wait ever in Chicago.  Nice airy space with a lot of light and a plain but clean and friendly.  My friend explained the concept of the background business, that takes individuals with a history of homelessness or poverty and trains them to provide all the services of the restauarant.  The service was great other than both of us having to ask for a few items twice, but little to complain about as we were promptly served.  Very cheap prices and well done food:  had the breakfast burrito which was a little on the dry side but a little hot sauce cured that.   Great concept for a well-done place."
"me and the mrs just had their 5-course dinner (at a prix fixe i tell you is without competition) saturday, which brought major smiles of contentment to our mated bellies in the end (this is served wednesday through saturday only).i'll single out the soup & salad - basil creme roasted tomato, and wedge w/ bleu cheese & ranch.  i can still taste their unique deliciousness.  all 5 courses served with such appetizing appearanceBYOB so we brought our own bottle (no corkage fee).  pleasantly friendly waitress always at the ready for usthey have a couple al fresco outdoor tables.  it is said their kitchen closes @ 9pm.  it is not necessary to couch this review in terms of chefs-in-training or it isn't quite the real deal.  we view it a full and fantastic dining experienceunfortunate drawback is street parking, but i made do.  and my wife got to pitch the empty bottle--no doubt our last--right across sheridan at the uptown recycling center which closes forever on july 20"
"First, I should say I the concept is a winner, and the recipes in general were interesting.  I will be back to try it again; perhaps the chef trainees were still new.I went with my mother and a friend of hers for dinner.  They had salads, which they liked.  I had a beet bisque which was too sweet.  However, I'm not a huge fan of cold soups, so I'll withold judgement.My entree was a flank steak with chimichurri gnocchi, which I ordered medium rare.  The steak was extremely unevely done: a small part was medium well, and the rest ranged from rare to ""seared and bloody.""  The server did stop by to ask if the steak was done correctly, but I had only taken one bite, and the sauce was masking the doneness of the balance of the steak.  If the steak had not been sliced and plated, I'd have sent it back to the kitchen for a minute or two on the grill.  Since it was plated, going back on the grill would have been problematic.  I ate about half.   I also wasn't given a steak knife.  The regular knife worked fairly well, but a steak knife would have been nice.  The chimichurri gnocchi were flavorless, really big for gnocchi (potsticker size!), and didn't have any chimichurri sauce.  I ate one of the three. My mother ordered the risotto, which had shrimp, bacon, and... some other stuff. My mother doesn't eat bacon, and I didn't notice it listed as an ingredient (although I didn't look too hard to check).  Since it was garnish, she scraped the bacon off, and dug in.  The texture was perfect!  But it was way too salty, and really buttery.  I expect it to be rich, but not to that degree.  It was too salty to finish.The third entree was an almond crusted chicken breast with sweet potato chips.  It was quite good.  I've always wished there was a way to get sweet potato chips to crisp up like a regular chip, but I've never seen anyone do it.Deserts were also varied:  The green tea crepe was well prepared, but the recipe was just not that good.  The funnel cake sundae was to much whip cream/ice cream, and not enough funnel cake.  Probably shouldn't have been served in a tall sundae glass, if they wanted to show off the funnel cake:  it was all hiding at the bottom.The plates were all too small for the amount of food on them.  It could very well be a cost saving measure to use a single size of plate, but perhaps getting the next size up would be an option?Both steak and risotto are difficult dishes to execute perfectly, so hopefully the student chefs get this and can improve.  Anyway, since it's so inexpensive, I'll go back to see if the chef has improved."
Great service. Great food! The brunch is incredible on the weekends and the menu is constantly changing. The 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular potato hash browns are fantastic.I highly recommend the 3 or 5 course prix fixe dinner there too.
"I ordered the Chicken Pesto Panini with arugula and mozzarella at Inspiration Kitchens in Uptown Chicago. This restaurant hires homeless people from Chicago and allows then to participate in an intensive 18 week training course on sanitation, personal hygiene,  food preparation, as well as how to cook, clean, and serve in a restaurant. Upon passing the course, those who were homeless have the opportunity to work in Inspiration Kitchens and get to take home meals everyday for their family. The food was AMAZING and the service and quality was beyond terrific. And the story of how it came about and the people this cafe/diner hire just makes the food that much more phenomenal. There was soooooooooooo much food because the portions are so large I couldn't even finish my plate - and I'm a big eater. It's located in a semi random part of Chicago but its probably Chicago'a best food. If there was only one restaurant in the entire world, this should be it. I went with a group of friends and we are all very picky. Every single one of us enjoyed the food and loved the priced. 3 of us ate huge lunches (and whatever took our leftovers home) for $25 before tax."
"food : 4 starsdecor: 5 starsservice: 5 starschanging lives: pricelessTIP: it's pay for parking on Sheridan, but there's free parking on Leland half a block south. The hostess was really friendly and helpful, treated you like family.So I ordered an egg white omelet with steak, caramelized onions, and goat cheese.  It came with a side of hashbrowns, and sadly they forgot my goat cheese.  It was a good omelet though--great size, the steak was tasty and tender, hashbrowns were country potatoes (instead of shredded) with regular and sweet potatoes!  I also appreciated the fact that you can even get egg whites!  It's an extra $2, and I even heard the hostess doing it for free!  Sadly, not for me :(  But for $10, and for helping people out with every bite I eat, I really don't mind :)My friend had the steak breakfast burrito thanks to the hostess' recommendation, and he said it was pretty good.  The food may not make your arteries feel better, but it sure does the heart  (and the world) some good. :)"
"This place was great. The service was really friendly. They were getting ready to close up for the afternoon, but they sat us anyway. The food was soo good! Everything on the menu is pretty healthy. There isn't much choice to choose something bad for yourself. I ordered an omelette with cheddar cheese, turkey sausage and caramelized onions. One of the best omelettes I've ever had. I also ordered hashbrowns with my meal. I could have chosen fresh fruit. The hasbrowns were diced up regular and sweet potatoes fried up with sea salt. Really really good!I love the atmosphere here too. Everything is really clean. I love the color of the walls, the ceiling, the tables and chairs, the pictures on the wall. It's a very nice, relaxing place to grab a great meal. I can't wait to go back for another!"
"Cafe Too is my new favorite place in the whole world.  Well, I'll try not to get carried away but the place is awesome!The food is worthy of at least 4 stars, you won't find a better deal in Chicago, and as a customer you contribute to a good cause.  I'm inspired after going to cafe too!!!!!!!!!!"
"We found Cafe Too after not wanting to wait in a 100-person deep line at M Henry last Sunday.I was grouchy about not getting my bread pudding on, but I realized while eating a delicious eggs benedict with balsamic redux and basil that new experiences are critical to living life fully.Thanks for delivering Cafe Too, I probably won't be back because you don't have something I need a fix of (like M Henry's bread pudding), but I had a great meal and would definitely recommend you.Tried the last sip of my husband's signature drink, the vanilla and honey latte....and I wish I would have had more!I love what the cafe is about, helping homeless people gain employment skills. Super sweet set-up.p.s. street parking was ridiculous, as people can't park. We parked about two blocks south.Also, small dining room...maybe 10 or less tables."
"This was our second time at this location. I had previously gone for a weekend breakfast and was touched by the story and the food. That was until you get home and feel sick for 48 hours....anyways we decided to try this place for a romantic dinner....where to begin...we made a reservation but were told there were only a few spots left...so we made one showed up and we were the only people in the restaurant ...we both ordered the 5 course meal....had the waitress not already opened our wine i would have already left before eating. when asked how i wanted my hanger steak ( a steak that is prepred always either rare or medium rare) i replied with rare to medium rare...she came back a minute later asking 'how's medium?' to my reply of how is medium rare...I have NEVER been to a place in Chicago that tells you how to order the meat and corrects you. UNBELIEVABLE.. in addition I was so fed up with the waitress reaching across the table placing things in the wrong spots. the meal was ok...the apps and soups were great for sure but the salads were just a pile of lettuce dry as can be and mine had an overcooked burnt sunny side egg on it which ruined it. then dinner came, of course my steak was overcooked and ice cold but i could not complain as I wanted to get out of there for one reason and one reason only....like most high scale places in the city they feature an open kitchen..i had a perfect view of it all and it deserves all caps. I WATCHED ALL THE WAIT AND COOK STAFF EATING WHILE MAKING FOOD AND LICKING THEIR FINGERS. IT RUINED THE MEAL AND I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN...some one needs to call the health code on this store...and yes we are still feeling sick from the meal so thank you inspiration kitchen for ruining the super bowl by keeping us sick for the 2nd time. I will never give this place another chance and I wish it could get 0 STARS"
Great breakfast burrito!  Plus free cookies came with the bill!!
"Love love love the concept. This is a smaller version of Delancey Street in SF so trains folks down on their luck in food service. Service was friendly and good, ambiance is nice. Creativity of menu for a small place is good.  Food? Eh. I had scrambled eggs, supposedly with cheddar, peppers and something I can't remember because basically I got dry overcooked eggs with tons of cheese melted on top. My companion ordered a 3-egg white omelet, which must've really been a 5-egg white omelet. It was huge and accompanied by a truckload of dry potatoes. Glad I went but don't make the trip for the food."
"Awesome concept, yummy food. I chose to create my own omlette. Pick three ingredients, anything there after is another $1. Bacon, tomato and sauteed green and red peppers....MMmMmmm! My one complaint was that the bacon wasn't chopped up. Oh, they forgot the cheese but were super quick to bring out a dish of shredded cheddar and it melted wonderfully into the piping hot egg and yummy mix ins. Try the honey vanilla latte, it's dreamy and creamy! The hashbrowns are awesome. Bits of regular AND sweet potatoes. MmMMmmm!Super clean restaurant, rather small though. If Chicago weather in April didn't suck right now the outdoor seating would have been great!"
"I suggested Brunch with friends at this place based on reviews.  I knew the inspiration behind the cafe because I lived in the community.  However, I was very disappointed with my experience.  I had a traditional, eggs and sausage, breakfast plate.  The food was bland, at best.  The sausage and hashbrowns tasted like cardboard.  However, the french toast with fruit was pretty tasty.  My friends were also unhappy with their meals.  The only reason we weren't totally upset was because we felt we were dining for a cause! The service was ok.  The staff/waiter was friendly but he forgot several things.  The atmosphere is really cute.  The french toast and mission of Cafe Too are the only reasons for the three star rating.  However, because I'm in the social service profession, I would be willing to try another meal to support the cause."
"We had brunch here on Sunday to celebrate my sister's birthday. This place is tiny, cozy, and quaint. The food was quite delicious. They have 4 different kinds of eggs benedict to choose from, and most of the other egg type entrees are mexican influenced, from a breakfast burrito to heuvos rancheros. The coffee drinks are amazing as well.What is definitely 5 stars is the price. They had a steak and eggs special with a NY strip for $10!!! You can't buy a good strip at the grocery for that price. I would highly recommend this place as a breakfast spot. The non profit concept mentioned by everyone else also makes it that much more of a comforting feeling to go."
"Dulce De Leche french toast rocked my WORLD. It was seriously the best french toast I've had in the city. Sweet, eggy and those crispy, cinnamon sugar tortilla strips on top were out of this world. The smoothie? Also the best I've ever had. I drank the 2 cups (one for the overflow) in less than 5 minutes and contemplated getting another! I was told the red tea base was the secret, but I think it's the awesome maker who when she told me they had mango, strawberry and banana, that her favorite was all three, so that's what I got. I will mention as many others have, that the service was the friendliest, most attentive and amazing. The chef actually came out of the kitchen, saw my eyes rolling back in my head after every bite of the french toast and sent me home with a little extra french toast care package, giggling and waving off my extreme gratitude. I live a few miles south, otherwise I'd be back here as much as possible. I can't wait to come back for dinner since our brunch experience was so sublime. (Oh, and you know this by now, but the quality of food and service for the price on the menu is practically criminal. SUCH a value!)"
"Yes. That is my review in a nutshell. Yes.Yes the food is great.Yes the service is amazing and everyone is super nice and excited to be working.Yes the mission of the restaurant is wonderful and worth supporting.Yes the price is insanely reasonable.Is there more you haters want? OK, the neighborhood is sketchy. So go spend some money there and help clean it up. Is this 5 star dining, famous chef? No. Is it delicious, fresh, creative food? YES! It is tasty and original without trying to hard. It is classy and yet familiar. I would have breakfast here every weekend."
"Average breakfeast!! The service was great and place is nice and clean but the music was too loud. For me the way to measure a brunch place is their potatoes which at this place was not good. The Eggs Benedict was good but nothing special."""
"I have been here for breakfast a few times. Each time, the meals have been great. However, you should not come here expecting anything extravagant. The food is simple and unpretentious. You might negatively translate this to ""uncreative"" and ""I could make this stuff at home,"" but the prices are about right for what you get. BIG PLUS for serving Intelligentsia coffee! BEST coffee in the city!Clean, friendly service, moderately priced simple breakfast dishes (I haven't been here for lunch or dinner), GOOD coffee, CONVENIENT location (for me), there's never been a wait when I've been there, and the bathroom is SUPER NICE!;-)"
"I've always enjoyed eating at Cafe Too, and yesterday, I enjoyed it even more because we got the buy one, get one free hookup thanks to our WBEZ Member Card. I've been here 5-6 times and have always found the food to be good-to-great and the service has always been pleasant and efficient.  Knowing that you're getting a good meal while helping to support an awesome program is great too!Yesterday, we went with the specials: spinach and portobella frittata with goat cheese and fruit salad, and the dulce de leche french toast.  Both plates were yummy, but not quite on par with M Henry.  Regardless, I know we will be back!"
"Great food, good cause, good service. I came here with a group of friends for a birthday and we were all impressed. We appreciated the BYOB and were surprised the prices weren't higher. We all did the 5 course Prix Fixe and did not have trouble finding an item that we wanted in each grouping. I will definitely come back!"
"Clean neat little place very kind staff. The area was starving for this kind of place.Im a couple of month regular now, hope the new name and staff keep it up"
"a tiny restaurant that serves delicious food, good customer service while providing a great service to the community.  I ordered the 3 course with app, soup and entree while my bf got the 5 course.  three fav parts of the night-FRIED CHICKEN APP! no need to explain further-beef masala dish-not really in a curry broth which was the reason why i didnt' order it, but definitely ate more than half of my bf's-when my bf's beef pho was too salty and he traded it for the potato leek, the chef came out to personally apologize and gave us a free dessert (i was more than tempted to ask him to nix the free dessert and get another app...but i thought i should be more mature and accept the dessert) **as a side note, don't order the chocolate cake-tasted like ti came out of a box with some chocolate sauce.  should've just asked for another app instead of the dessert.all in all, loved the place.  good food, VERY reasonable prices and BYOB"
"4.5 out of 5 stars? Right in my neighborhood? WHERE have I been!? I've had Cafe Too bookmarked for some time now and finally walked over and met a friend here for brunch. When I arrived, I realized that it was a lot smaller than I imagined. We were seated right away which was nice, but the booth was a little uncomfortable as the seats were high and the table was low. I felt like I giant.Anyway, ordered a glass of OJ. $3. Fine, but I always hate paying high prices for orange juice at any brunch place to begin with. I went ahead and ordered the lentil cakes that were marked as a healthy alternative. Phew! The dish came with the cakes topped with red pepper aioli, roasted potatoes and sweet potatoes, and a pile of steamed spinach. Overall, a solid dish. The cakes were a little smaller than I hoped, but they were tasty. The spinach tasted...well like spinach. I was looking for a little more spice to it, but I guess that's why they invented pepper, yeah? The potatoes were awesome though. Overall, a cute place in the neighborhood. Worth the hype? Eh...not really. I'm glad I came in, but with the cramped space, moderately higher prices, and not bad, but just OK food, I can't see myself rushing back. I gave Cafe Too 3 stars because I do support the goodwill they have for the community."
"I had to get the five course meal because I wanted to try everything. My BF and I chose different things so that we could share too. The appetizers, soup, and entrée were awesome. The salad and dessert I could have done without. I almost forgot to mention the free brie cheese (baked in a puff pastry with cranberries) YUM! I knew that restaurant has a mission to employ the under-privileged in an effort to get them back to work. But, I have to say the staff was on par with any fancy downtown restaurant, if not even more professional.The menu changes every week, so you need to check on line before going or you might end up there looking at a menu full of food you don't like. This place has become popular for parties (probably due to the BYOB factor), so reservations are a must."
"We had a private party here last night, and it was quite the soiree! We choice the 5 course prix fixe menu, and it was divine! There were a little too many fried things on it...but maybe I just ATE too many fried items since we did the main course family style.My favorite was the Chilled Yogurt & Lime Soup (cold beet soup!) and the watermelon cucumber salad....to die for.Try the Cheddar Corncakes, and either the Caramelized Catfish or the Blackbean cakes as a main course...the beef is delicious but a little too sweet and the chicken is nothing special. I think their menu changes frequently, so come often!The kitchen/wait staff were fabulous, and I love that this non-profit profits their employees so greatly. Will definitely be coming back!"
"After just moving to Uptown a couple of days earlier I took my mom and her boyfriend here for Easter Brunch.  The atmosphere was refreshing and so were the staff.  They welcomed us as if they were welcoming us into their home, which is exactly how I want to be welcomed when I go anywhere to dine.The food was pretty good.  It wasn't amazing, but it was better than good.  Make sense?  I had the french toast, which is dipped in an espresso batter that had just the right amount of espresso in it.  I also had the yogurt parfait, which I think, personally, would have been a lot better if made with plain, fat-free, greek yogurt, than vanilla yogurt, but it was still great.What makes this place truly amazing, is what they do there which is give hope and opportunity to students working to achieve self-sufficiency in their culinary program.  Every year Cafe Too helps individuals gain valuable employment skills in their endeavor to end homelessness in Chicago.  Because of this (and the fact that they serve coffee from Intelligentsia), the service and the atmosphere, I will proudly become a regular at Cafe Too.  I suggest you do the same if you live in the area."
"I have been volunteering at Inspiration Cafe through One Brick for a couple of years, yet it wasn't until today that I made my way to Cafe Too for Sunday brunch.  I highly recommend this place for good, solid food at very cheap prices in a small, bright, cheerful setting.I had the special Chocolate Chip Pecan Pancakes (and yes, they were healthy... they were made of whole wheat flour...and the pecans...that's protein, yo).  Very good and very filling.My dining companions had a made to order omelet and the biscuits and gravy plate.  They reported that both items were good.  For four main brunch plates, combined with some side orders, large orange juices, tea and a mango smoothie - our bill was less than $50.  And there was no wait at 11am on Sunday.Very impressed with Cafe Too's operation, notwithstanding its non-profit mission (that's icing on the cake for me).  I look forward to trying Cafe Too for lunch/dinner sometime soon.Get up on Cafe Too!"
"I love this place.  It helps that it is only two blocks from my apartment.  Lately, I've been going every weekend and love the food each time.  We have had blueberry pancakes, omelets, crab cake benedict, biscuits and gravy.  My favorite is the crab cake benedict, honestly it's tough to order anything else.It's not a huge place, but there has always been a table available when I'm there.They have their brunch menu available Friday-Sunday.  The prices are great.  The coffee is great.  Service, great!  Not to mention, the place helps train the less fortunate and supports a great non-profit.   Enjoy."
"An awesome deal that you can feel good about too!Cafe Too offers a prix-fixe dinner menu from  Th-Sa each week.  The menu changes each week and features either 3 courses for $18 or 5 courses for $24.  There are several selections for each course and if you choose three courses you can choose which three you would like.  You can also check online to see what is currently being offered.  Plus if you join their online newsletter you get 10% off your meal!Every item that I have had here has been delicious and inventive.  The restaurant is BYOB and there is no corkage fee, which is lovely.  The staff is friendly and the food is thoughtfully prepared.THE FACTS:$18 three course, $24 five course per personOffered all night Thursday, Friday, SaturdayGet an additional 10% by joining their mailing list and bringing in a copyBYOB with no corkage fee"
"No question: five stars. Everything about our Saturday brunch here was above-and-beyond.First -- it's easily accessible by car and there was parking right outside. Second, even though we arrived around 11:30 on a Saturday, we didn't have to wait one second for a table. Third, the service could not have been friendlier or more attentive (friendly in a good way, not friendly like they won't leave you alone). Fourth, the restaurant was really cute and sunny and lovely to be in. Fifth, we were almost shocked at how reasonable the prices were (huge brunch portions for two + coffee for two and some sides = under $20).And most importantly -- the food was great. I got berries and cream French toast (which I think was on special), and it was very yummy. Better than the chai tea latte French toast from Orange, if you're into comparisons. My boyfriend got a build-your-own omelet which was GIGANTIC and looked quite fresh and tasty. We split an order of hash browns that reminded me of McDonalds French fries in a GOOD way (by that I mean hot and fresh and crispy and delicious. Honestly, I shouldn't even have to clarify, because who doesn't love McDonalds French fries? Even if you avoid them, you secretly love them deep down. It's the American way). Anyway, I was really, really impressed with Café Too. We took a peek at their dinner menu as well, which seems to change on a weekly basis. I'll definitely be going back to give that a try. Also, for people who think Uptown is a scary neighborhood: relax. It's fine. The crazy guy on the street we encountered a block from the restaurant was extremely nonthreatening and actually dispensed some wise life advice."
"From a friend heard about this brunch spot and went on a Sunday afternoon at 12:30, no wait, nice decor and the cleanest bathroom I have ever been in!!! Staff very nice, food at great price and the eggs Benedict to die for!!! I have with the crab cake stuffed with craw-fish my friend had with brie and asparagus.... so good and cheesy hasbrowns, this is a hidden gem plus saw a couple went to the local Jewel bought a bottle of campaign and OJ..... oh ya, BYOB!!!! This is my new brunch spot and it supports a good cause!"
"I know you might have to wait for coffee.  I know it seems like the menu items come and go.  But there is just something about a breakfast with a side of ""doing something better than just feeding yourself"" that makes this place special.Patio is open (hallelujah, summer is here!), water comes with lemon, and service ALWAYS comes with a smile.Bring the champers (BYO, hello!), good attitude, sit back, and enjoy your brunch with a side of giving back."
"I have eaten here a number of times and have always been happy with the food and with the service.  The staff is helpful when I (usually) cannot decide what to order.  Plus its not the usual waiter/waitress saying ""oh yeah, everything is good, etc."" - the staff asks me what I like and then leads me in the right direction.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Another plus - the bill always ends up being less than I expected because its not overpriced like many other restaurants can be.  I guess I have grown accustomed to outrageously priced food.  Thank God for a local place that isn't out to gouge its customers.  I will continue eating at Cafe Too and would hope that people who have never been, please give it a try."
"amazing, eclectic food options for CHEAP. and you're doing good just by eating here.love their sea-food options, had an oxtail sandwich that was out of this world, their soups are incredible and taste fresh (the butternut squash will change your life), and the service is always friendly. i get a coffee here at least once or twice a week - their coffee drinks blow big competitors outta the water - but it's always a real treat to have lunch here as well.if you're in uptown, i highly recommend stopping by. if you're not in uptown, i'd feel bad telling you to go to uptown, except that this place is worth it."
"Came here on a Saturday evening with a friend from out of town and our significant others. The place is really small, but was dimly lit which gave it a pretty intimate but casual atmosphere.I had the 5 course menu because I wanted to try a lot of things:Potato and chorizo croquettes - delicious! Soft, perfect with the sour cream dipping sauce.French onion soup - oddly very smokey and thick. Not the flavor or texture of french onion soup that I expected.. I didn't finish it =[Roasted corn and black bean salad - good, but nothing too special.Honey orange glazed grilled chicken - the chicken flavor was a bit to subtle and sweet for me but it was super tender. The Swiss chard was really good.Granny Smith apple fritters - came with ice cream. It was really good but the fritters were cold and therefore a bit hard. They should really heat them up. =TI also tried the Potato Leek Chowder and the Shrimp Rotini. The chowder was delicious and the shrimp rotini was good but nothing special.All in all, it was a pleasant experience. The food was good but for me it didn't seem super special (I probably would have been happy with the 3 course). My boyfriend, who is a vegetarian, definitely liked it though (good vegetarian prix fixe menus are hard to come by) so we will be here again. They have a rotating menu and the price point is really good. Plus, I love the concept of the place, so 4 stars for the whole package!"
"It's not the best food I ever had but this place sure have some soul!The food is great by the way. The Jerk Chicken Sandwich with the veggies Chili and the Brie/Pear panini w/ sweet potato fries were delightful dishes. The service is impeccable as well. The price is right. And most of all the social program they offer to the employee is a brilliant idea. ""Dine Well. Do Good."" is the way to go!"
"On a Sunday morning Tweet wont do carry-out and with a sick child on our hands we wanted to stay in... found Cafe Too online and their menu sounded really impressive.Ordered their steak burrito, traditional eggs benedict, dulce de leche french toast and corned beef hash. Everything was ok but nothing to write home about, so to speak.* Hash browns are pretty tasty but were also really really dried out* Best fruit saladSo yeah... nothing special but I guess good to know they will do take-out brunch on a Sunday."
"concept: awesomeservice: suuuuuuper friendlyprice: extremely reasonableinterior: cute, clean, modernfood: ranging from kick ass to blechin case u don't already know the deal, cafe too is an employment service geared toward helping the homeless to gain employment in the service industry. awesome! they offer coffee and breakfasty items, lunch and dinner. we decided to come in for dinner. they offer a 3 course meal for $18 or 5 courses for $24. we chose the 5 course so we could try as much food as humanly possible.1st course: appetizersme: blackened chicken skewers with remouladethe skewers were fine, but unexciting. the remoulade tasted suspiciously similar to 1000 island. hrmm?my mans: salted cod on toasted breadok, but the bread needed a little more crunch to stand up to the cod, it got a bit soggy.2nd course: soupme: spicy black beanperfect consistency and a nice kickmy mans: chilled buttermilk and dill with beetshot pink and AWESOME. we were both dubious, but the soup had a slightly sweet flavor from the beets that worked perfectly!3rd course: saladme: mixed greens with eggplant, feta and vinegrette nicely balanced and perfectly saltymy mans: spinach, avocado and candied pecansnice combination of textures and flavors4th course: entreesme: polenta with mixed summer veggiesmy polenta was fried, which i found odd, and the veggies were pureed. i think i was expecting something different. either way, the puree was too acidic and slightly over salted. the polenta was good despite the frying.my mans: salmon with teeny taters (that wasn't the actual name)the salmon was overcooked and underseasoned. :( bad combo. the potatoes were excellent though.5th course: dessert me: corn cake with brown sugar ice cream and carmelized pineapplethe corn cake was savory, the ice cream and fruit were sweet. it was perfect.my mans: blueberries and strawberries in cream with a shortbread cookieterrible. absolutely awful. the cookie had a horrible chemical taste that i equated to pressboard and lighter fluid. still, a great concept backed by great people. i'll definitely be back... but i won't have the shortbread!"
"The email went out to my friends: ""Eat brunch. Do good.""  And so we did.  Five of us met here at 11 on a Saturday morning for brunch and were seated immediately.  I have mixed feelings on that, it's so great to be able to take a group to a brunch place without reservations and not have to wait (*cough* M. Henry) but I'm such a fan of what Cafe Too is doing that I want more people  to go there.  Cafe Too is BYOB so we'd brought a bottle of champagne, planning to have mimosas.  Almost as soon as we placed the bottle on the table, the staff came over to give us glasses.  Sadly, three of my five friends didn't want to drink and the two of us didn't feel like finishing a bottle of champagne at 11 in the morning, so back in the backpack the bottle went.  Losers.  Still, you have to appreciate that kind of service.  As far as the food goes, I had an iced coffee and fruit and yogurt parfait so I'm probably not the best to gauge food quality.  I did enjoy both.  My friends all selected more complicated (and cooked) dishes and all said that they enjoyed them and that they'd definitely go back.   And Cafe Too is cheap.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Or maybe Andersonville has just warped my concept of what brunch should cost.Immediate seating, good food, great service, affordable, and socially responsible?  Five stars, no question."
"Dine Well. Do Good.that is the tagline for Cafe Too, and i couldn't have stated it better myself. this wonderful little uptown cafe gives job training to those who need a leg up in the world. what a fabulous concept! and the food, i must add, is delicious! you'll dine well - and can feel damn good about doing it too.my friend jenny and i met for brunch there this morning. we instantly loved the sunny, quaint space - very intimate. the service was prompt and friendly. and the menu was perfect - just the right number of choices to have you salivating with indecisiveness, but not so overwhelming that you couldn't ultimately decide. and whatever you settle upon, it will be a winner for sure.there's a standard menu, as well as that weekend's specials. jenny went with the build-your-own-omelet; i opted for the benedict special (roasted asparagus, tomato and goat cheese). as they were out of fresh fruit, we opted for the hash browns. tasty and plentiful. we both left full and satisfied, clamoring to return again soon!"
"Sunday morning brunch. Hearing great things about this place, we headed north and after a bit of searching, found Cafe Too. It is not well marked, but we found it. Maybe we were still a little under the influence from Saturday night. Whatever. I ordered the Banana Stuffed French toast and S.O. ordered the Frittata Rosso omelet with spicy chicken sausage, green pepps, onions and cheese. The F.T. was pretty sinfully yummy, and before I knew it, I had wolfed it all down. The hash brown potatoes were way to over cooked, and didn't even look appetizing. The omelet contents were oozing out all sides and tasted delicious.I guess I was so hungry, I missed that this place helps people that are down on their luck and assists them in learning work skills. Awesome.Great value for what you get and even better service."
"Been there a few times and always great. Plus the fact that they are helping train the homeless and low-income to help them later in life makes it all the more special. Anyways they change the menu each week, so can't really tell you to try something specific, but the food is all great, the staff even greater.  They have a 3-course pre-fixe for $18 or 5-course pre-fixe for $24.  Cheaper than an entree at other places, with much better food. Definitely go check it out when you have the chance... oh yeah it's BYOB."
"We decided to try this yesterday based on the Yelp! Comments I had read. The issues we had with the food were simple, the sweet potato fries were all over cooked to the point they were black and could not be eaten, the catfish sandwich was done perfectly on the outside,  and raw on the inside, the french onion soup was WAY salty, and the burger was ordered rare and came out very well done, almost as done as the fries... I ordered the steak sandwich, which aside from the fries, was OK. When we sent 2/3 of the order back to the kitchen, the catfish was never replaced with anything (the blame for this is with the server NOT the cafe), and the burger was cooked past medium, however it was at least eatable. The pluses of this place include a FABULOUS salad dressing and great coffee and decent brewed tea."
"A yummy brunch Uptown with Husband today to celebrate his No-More-Working-on-Sundays!  I had the bagel/cream cheese with a side of bacon, he had eggs benedict; we shared the blueberry pancakes.  Everything was stellar and well seasoned.  While it's not on a particularly savory street Uptown, it's nice to see places like Cafe Too opening up and thriving.  It is run by the Inspiration Corporation, which offers a restaurant skills training program aimed at getting students entry-level jobs in food service.  Their aim is to end homelessness, quite the noble undertaking.So have something tasty, at a place that does good in the community.  How can you go wrong?"
Had the bisquits and gravy platter with the choice of sausage (turkey based) and hash browns. It was tasty but I did add a little hot sauce to the eggs and hash browns to liven it up a little. Service was good and surounds nice.
"I just had brunch at Cafe Too this past Sunday with a group of friends and fell in love with this little gem. Cafe Too is a cute little restaurant in Uptown that focuses on contemporary cuisines. The cafe is part of Inspiration Corporation and helps individuals that might have had a rough time and want to better themselves by studying the culinary arts. I ordered the eggs benedict with hash brown as my side, highly recommended by a friend. Wow, those might have been the best eggs benedict I've had in a long long time. I was extremely impressed with the presentation and superb taste of each bite. Once I found out the workers were students trying to better their skills in the culinary world I thought what a great idea, however the food might not be that great. I'm happy to report back that I was wrong. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well and best of all we enjoyed some great mimosas. What they serve mimosas? NOPE. But they are BYOB. So, that made the brunch experience even better. We brought 3 bottles of Champagne for 5 people and had a party. I love going to brunch but a tab can get expensive really fast if you have to purchase each alcoholic drink separately, however if you can attend a BYOB place then you can drink your day away and not worry about the bill. Have I convinced you? Great food, great cause, and BYOB. What can be better? Oh yeah, the prices are extremely reasonable. We split the bill and it ended up being $12 per person and that included gratuity."
"IKU is an excellent and affordable addition to the neighborhood, and I'm pleased to see that they appear to be thriving. Staff is friendly, food is good, prices are reasonable, and they help out the community; what more could you want?  Because they offer family-style dining and small plates, this is an especially good place to come with a group of people who are into sharing lots of different dishes around the table. Uptown tends to skew heavily toward fast food and greasy carryout places, so I like that Inspiration offers a somewhat upscale dining option a few blocks from home, without the hefty upscale price tag (or transportation hassles) of a more formal downtown restaurant. BYOB is also a plus, and I don't even think they have any corkage charge. If you haven't visited yet, you should definitely give them a try!"
"We had a lovely time this past Saturday night. Finding parking was easy. Pretty interior- a small, intimate space with open kitchen. 5 courses for 22 bucks is a steal!!! BYOB. Staff was very nice. Courses were hit or miss but the hits were amazing. Try the fried brussel sprouts and dessert trio. We lingered and never felt rushed."
5 course meal for $20.  4 out of the 5 courses were perfect.  The salad was only so so.  This place is quiet and romantic.  A true hidden gem in Uptown.  Guys bring your gals here on Friday night.  Steak lovers will rejoice once they taste the hanger steak.
"A friend and I visited Cafe Too today for Sunday Brunch. We got there about a half hour before they closed at 2:00 (we didn't realize that they were closing until after we had ordered).At this hour the restaurant was pretty sparsely populated - I felt kind of bad, but then thought of how Orange is packed right up until closing time. Also, if they wanted to close at 1:30, they'd have closing time at 1:30!I ordered the french toast with the Crème anglaise, strawberries and blueberries, as well as a glass of pink grapefruit juice. It was really good!The menu looked nice, but a bit small. There were a number of tempting sounding daily specials though.The space was very cute and cozy - a fine place for brunch. There wasn't anything extremely memorable or special about the food, but it all tasted good!"
"What a gem of a place in Uptown. I've been spoiled lately with excellent brunch options in the city so Cafe Too had to stand out for me and it did just that. How? Their food is really good and we should consider a couple things. One, they are pretty creative and just don't sit on the laurels of the standard menu. The culinary student chefs do a great job of varying what's offered and execute it pretty well too. On the day I went, they offered a quiche with Italian sausage and chicken ... it was simply delicious, nicely proportion and economically priced at 4 dollars!That brings me to another point, their brunch prices are cheap and certainly a good bang for the buck. Eggs Benedict start at $6, Pancakes at $4, French Toast at $6 and coffee under $2. If anything, trying this place won't hit you hard in the wallet ... after all, aren't we in a recession?I should note that Cafe Too is part of the Inspiration Corporation that helps homelessness in the community. Great food at a place that gives back!"
"I've been here many times for both brunch and dinner and Cafe Too has never disappointed. Their brunch is delicious and specialty coffees are always great and reasonably priced. And as for dinner, it is the best 5 course meal you will ever have for $23. And the best part is the menu is constantly rotating, so you never have to get the same thing twice!I highly recommend giving this place a try!"
"I've been here for dinner probably 4-5 times and it's one of my favorite restaurants. It's BYOB with no corkage fee and you have the choice of either getting 3 courses for $18 or 5 courses for $24. It's a non-profit that does something for homeless people though I'm not quite sure what it is they do.I've had better 5 course meals (for double the price and not BYOB) but typically I absolutely love at least threee of the courses. They have a cute patio outside that you can sit on but they won't let you bring alcohol out there, which is probably for the best since there are so many crackheads around there who would probably take it. Overall, great value for the money. I've only ever been there for dinner but I hear their brunch is good too."
"Ok, the food in this place is a solid 3.5-4 stars but the cost, presentation and cause bump it up to 5. I came here for brunch and had an omelette with spinach, tomato and goat cheese with a side of black bean salsa, my manfriend had the huevos rancheros, and we shared a plate of biscuits and gravy. Don't judge us, we are fatties. It all looked really pretty, the place was nice and light and clean, and the prices were more than fair. I think the only problem I had was that everything was just a little bit on the bland side. It was definitely solid: the gravy had big pieces of sausage, the tortillas in the huevos rancheros were like home-made crispy pastry shells, and everything was definitely fresh. I just felt like I could salt, pepper, hot sauce, and herb the shit out of everything.Still, 5 stars for the concept. Apparently the place serves as a means to teach the homeless to get into the food service industry (or something like that.) I'm all in for people doing good things not-for-profit, especially when it fills my belly for cheap."
"They only start serving dinner at 5, but we had tickets to a play and they let us come in 15 minutes before 5 and place our order to make sure we'd have enough time to eat.We ordered the 3-course meal and the food was excellent, but what I really liked was the service.  Granted, we were the only party for most of the hour, but still... Immediate attention, without the hovering.  Just as an example, the kitchen forgot to make one of the desserts...so to make up for it, they brought out, one by one, ALL THREE of tonight's dessert options!It's also worth mentioning that the place is a steal.  This kind of atmosphere and food this great at $18 for 3 courses and BYOB without any corckage fees is impossible to find anywhere else even on a week night.I can't wait to try their brunch!"
"I really love this place. The dining room is very small so it can fill up fast but I've never had to wait long for a table. The food is great and the plating is lovely. The hash browns are a mix of diced regular and sweet potatoes and they are fantastic. Sometimes they run out of certain dishes, but I've never been disappointed when I've had to pick a second choice. The prices are more than reasonable, and when you factor in what a great cause this is, you really ought to give it a try."
"I went here with a friend because she had a coupon for a buy one get one breakfast sandwich.  Arrived a little after 8 AM and the only other person in there was a newspaper sales dude.  Later a lot of other people came for takeout.  Great ambiance with crisp white tablecloths and napkins.  There are windows all along the front entrance so it's very bright inside.  Artwork is displayed on the walls and is for sale.  The waiter was friendly and prompt.My friend and I got the ""Build Your Own Breakfast Sandwich.""  You choose your bread, meat, eggs and cheese.  I got a croissant with bacon, scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese.  It came with a couple slices of strawberry and orange.  The sandwich was excellent - very filling and perfectly toasted.  We loved it and will definitely be back!  Especially because they have free wi-fi and it's about a five minute walk from my apartment.On their menus: ""Dine Well.  Do Good...Our food is prepared and served by students in our culinary arts program which helps men and women to achieve self-sufficiency.""  Very cool."
"I've been to Cafe Too once before for brunch and definitely had nothing bad to say about that visit... But today was absolutely amazing!  Ann was our server and she was super-friendly, helpful, and funny. She listened to us, happily re-explained the specials when we didn't catch everything {it all sounded soooo good!} and was quick. Someone walking by to grab a menu came by with their dog and Ann ran in really quickly to get the dog a bowl of water! Honestly, for me it's rare to see such a thing with people who work in customer service these days. I was completely impressed with her. I had one of the specials - the ginger-glazed tilapia which was AMAZING! I believe it was topped with caramelized onions and definitely with green beans, cucumbers, and carrots underneath the tilapia. Delicious. My boyfriend had what I believe was a rosemary chicken sandwich {another special} with a side salad which was also very good. I personally like the lunches better than brunch, but I also probably have not experienced enough of the brunch menu. Nonetheless, this is a really great place even if it is in a sketchy part of the neighborhood."
"Good concept.  Maybe I was here on an off day, but the food took FOREVER for an omlet and another somewhat simple breakfast dish.  The food was under-seasoned and my item was lukewarm (after waiting forever, I wasn't going to return it).  Beverages could've been filled more often.It's hard to know what you're getting since the staff changes every couple weeks.  I would go back again, because I like the concept and the menu seems to be creative and a good value, but I could see myself being VERY tempted to go to TWEET cuz then I know what I would be getting."
"Love this place ! My husband and I have been coming here for breakfast for a couple of years or so.The food has always been top notch, with great prices. Both the biscuits and gravy (with corn beef hash) and croque-madame are exquisite. The cleanliness and service beats the best around. We have also had a few dinners here that  were outstanding."
"I had brunch with a friend I hadn't seen in quite some time at Cafe Too yesterday!  It was lovely!She had the Juevos Rancheros (which I tried and will most certainly be ordering on my next visit).  I had the Frittata Rosso.  Both were excellent, as was the orange juice and the service.Added bonus: giving your business to this organization helps people hit by homeless and poverty learn job skills.  And they take so much pride in their work!  A truly worthwhile cause!All for about $9 per person, plus tax."
"My husband and I love this place.  We've been going here for coffee, pastries, and breakfast for the last 4 1/2 years.  It's a great spot to have in our neighborhood.  Anne and the rest of the staff are incredibly friendly.  We had dinner for the first time here last night, and the tapas-style dishes were amazing.  Definitely stop by if you are in Uptown."
"Lovely unexpected spot with terrific small plates and great value.And byob too!We had 5 plates - 4 were definite winnersHam and chorizo fritters, avocado and bacon salad, hangar steak w/ garlic mashed, and flatbread with carmelized onions and calamata  olives.  The only plate that was not fabulous was  blue cheese, bacon and shrimp quesadilla that was ok but overly salty.  Service was solicitious and friendly.  I've been meaning to try this place for quite a while and will definitely return."
"Bright, relaxed atmosphere, delicious breakfast, friendly staff... can't ask for more! Went with a group of people for a birthday brunch and everything was delicious. The crabcake benedict was superb, and I adored the chorizo egg dish. The berries french toast was a bit on the sweet side, but that can be tempered by just getting the creme anglaise on the side next time. Portions were just the right size, and most of the dishes were between $4 and $8 at most. The coffee was really good too.The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Best part about it is that it's a non-profit restaurant that helps the homeless to learn valuable work skills. Don't know how many people realize that. The earnings go toward Inspiration Corporation. Even better :)Added bonus: free wi-fi and fantastic baked goods for a quick breakfast."
"Service: Good waiter, though I can't tell if he was eccentric, or just hard of hearing (as we ordered, the tone of his voice was one of surprise).Atmosphere: Uptown yuppie, if such a thing exists. Clean, simple nice environment. 80s music playing.Food: Excellent upscale diner quality brunch, but with a little caveat: We ordered a side of sourdough pancakes that arrived flat and chewy; so much so, in fact, that we returned them to the kitchen. Our egg dishes, however, were very yummy. The bacon was crunchy (something which breakfast restaurants everywhere seem to screw up)!"
"I don't know why I haven't come here for brunch before, such a great experience!  And the prices are ridiculously cheap.  My eggs benedict was delicious and only $6!  Beyond filling but I wish they served the shredded has browns vs. diced potatoes.  We had gotten there fairly late and they ran out of the crab cakes benedict, just means I have to come back for it =)Service was really friendly, although I wish the server had given us more ketchup vs. the one serving when asked.  The space is cozy and inviting.  I'll definitely be back soon."
We went out to Cafe` Too based on yelp reveiws.   I have to say I was extremely impressed with the food.  What made it an even more enjoyable experience was knowing the purpose of the restaurant and staff serving a higher good.  Truly inspiring concept with delicious food!
"Cute, quaint, tasty, and cheap. What more could you want? We came on a Saturday night and it was pretty empty. Apparently people haven't caught on to this place for dinner yet. We had the 3 course prix fixe for $16.50. What an awesome deal. The service was very pleasant. The dishes were inventive and well executed. + Appetizers - The onion tart was savory sweet and full of  flavor. The lightly dressed spring salad it came with was delish. The eggplant bruschetta was also tasty.+ Salad - The avocado, bacon salad was fresh and crisp. The bacon was very good. The salad could have been bigger, but it was yummy.+ Entrees - Pork belly, was awesome! This was the best pork belly I have had. It was flavorful, nicely cooked, and tender. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The side of veggies were also delicious. The portion size could have been a bit larger though. + Dessert - Thin chocolate cinnamon churros with vanilla ice cream. Thi was a great way to end the meal. The churros was crispy and sweet. Everything was well executed and the service was good too. The portion size could have been a tad bigger, but for $16.50, you are already getting an awesome deal. If you come really hungry just go for the $22.50, 5 course dinner. This is a great intimate little gem."
"I wrote this as a submission to some random freelance writing gig I got an email about for Uptown... I'd forgotten I'd already written a review :D But why waste it, I figured.Cruising up Sheridan Road through Uptown, you might not expect to find a quaint little brunch spot tucked away between the run-down storefronts and folks panhandling you for spare change, especially on the blocks between Wilson and Lawrence. But that's exactly what you'll discover in Café Too (4715 N. Sheridan). The bright little eatery is a ray of sunshine on an otherwise bleak stretch of inner city blight, filled with bright colors and smiling faces. It's a bit cozy, but that only adds to the charm. Café Too is run by Inspiration Corporation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping the homeless by providing case management and real-world vocational training. As members work through the program, they eventually serve as wait staff, cooks, etc. in the restaurant, an ingenious idea that--by all accounts--is working to great success. So come for the inspiration, but stay for the food--because it is fantastic. Chicago's brunch scene can be pretty competitive, but Café Too easily stands right out front with the best. Three-egg omelets, amazing French toast and my personal favorite, andouille sausage Cajun biscuits and gravy served with hash browns and a couple of eggs--diners around the country would love to have THIS dish on the menu! There's also a full-service coffee bar so you can get your latte fix before you go. Next weekend, why take an adventure and trek up to Café Too in Uptown? You might be more surprised than you expect."
"A big group went here for dinner to celebrate a birthday and we had an amazing experience.The staff could not have been more accommodating to our group.  We brought booze to make cocktails and wine to have with dinner and the staff really made an effort to meet any and every request.They just changed their menu and we were a bit nervous because it was the first night of the new ""small plates"" menu.  We simply asked for them to bring us their favorites.  Their favorites are our new favorites.  The most delicious things we tasted were the crab cake stuffed tilapia, the braised beef on polenta, and the pork medallion on stuffing.  Honorable mentions go to the goat cheese wheel, the onion and brie tart, and the scrumptious ham and chorizo fritters.  For dessert, you can't beat a funnel cake sundae.For 8 of us, the meal came to under 140 dollars and we were all stuffed.  So, for under 20 bucks a piece, we tried at least 10 different dishes and were completely satisfied.  Add to that the mission statement of this restaurant in helping the community and we have a definite winner.Go eat here and then thank me."
Wow! The service was prompt and efficient. Great food! Great atmosphere! I love the idea behind this nonprofit. I had the red velvet pancakes and they were awesome!
"YUMMY!  Went here for brunch today with my bf.I got the caprese egg benedict ($7).  Eggs were done perfectly, the holladaise sauce was deletable.  It could have been seasoned a little bit better.  Also, the hash browns were more like country fries, I like the shredded stuff better.  BF got the basic 2 eggs, hash brown, and sausage meal ($6).  Good stuff.The portions weren't huge, but neither is the price tag.  Would def. come again!"
"Cheap food. Great food! Friendly, attentive service. Open for breakfast or brunch every day of the week. What more could I ask for?"
"I like that this restaurant helps the homeless to get back on their feet. Great concept. The restaurant was mostly empty when I arrived - there was only one other party there. With all of the positive reviews, I was wondering why this was the case. Now I know why. The food is just ok. I had the mushroom/spinach frittata, and the banana bread pudding, and the frittata was surprisingly bland. Well, not too surprising, because I read the Yelp reviews prior to going, and I read that the food can sometimes be bland. I was hoping that I would have a different experience. What do they have against salt and spices? Can I get a little garlic? How about some onion?? Anyway, the bread pudding was good but I will not be rushing back there for brunch. Just ok....Moving along to find the next great brunch place in Chicago. NEXT!"
"I was sadly underwhelmed by this breakfast/brunch spot.  After reading all of the great reviews, I was super thrilled to try this spot for some yummy breakfast/and help support the local scene.However, the street Cafe Too is on is super scary sketchy.  It was a cross between crazies/pervs/crackheads at 9 a.m on a Sunday.  Lovely.  Nothing better for two 20 something white bread girls... So, needless to say, we didn't eat outside by the patio.  It's very small and modern inside.  Decorations were minimalist and nice.  Coffee was strong and tasty.  Food selections were really small, but prices were super reasonable.  We each had breakfast and coffee and left spending $21.00 with tip.  But the food was just ok.  It was lukewarm basically.  My friend had the bisquits and gravy platter with eggs and sausage and potatoes, and it was nothing special at all.  Bland really.  I ordered the quiche special, and the eggs were wet and runny, there was barely any crust and it was really boring.  But at $4, the price was great.  Not worth it though.I wouldn't eat here again.  Service was attentive, decor great, food average and the area is like night of the living dead with zombies walking around coked out of their minds.  Swell.  I think maybe we just had an off day.  Or at least I hope so."
"Love, love, love it. Breakfast on Sunday morning was superb. It all looked so good, it was a difficult decision, but I went with the Berries and Cream French Toast. The berries were a refreshing delight complimented by the drizzled glaze. I love my bread and the french toast was perfect. My date orderd the Breakfast Burrito. The steak was marinated in something to die for and the little side of salsa was a nice added touch. Just enough...not too much, not too little. All the dishes are beautifully presented. Portions were just right for the price. Our waiter was great and service was prompt. As we walked out the door the barista shouted out a thank you from across the room. Quality, price, effort and service with a smile. Next time I go, I think I'll try the huevos rancheros, but who knows...everything is so tempting!"
"The menu is limited, but the food is always great.  It's also nice to know that your money is going towards a great organization.  They also lend a hand to other, smaller organizations in the neighborhood by donating coffee or other helpful items they are able to spare.  Good peeps."
"Very good time indeed. Came in with my 6 and 2 year old for breakfast. I was immediately greeted and asked to sit where ever I pleased. After asking for our drinks they brought the  kids two Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes with chocolate chips and whipped cream - said the chef wanted to make the kids something special. All this without me even asking. I ordered the biscuits and gravy - it ought to be called Mt. Biscuits and Gravy. I'm a big guy and couldn't even eat it all. Very clean - even the bathrooms! Very good service! Very good food - my 6year old daughter asked to tell the chef that her food was ""A""+.  I don't even know where that comment came from. And above all very welcoming for families with kids."
"By far, my favorite place in Chicago so far. What is not to adore about cafe too...? The decor is nice and pretty, the prices are very very good, ($16.50 for a 3 course prix fixe menu for dinner!) the food is always so creative and simply very good, the service is great, and while you are enjoying your wonderful meal you are also helping people  train in their culinary program/ fight homelessness.We went there for my brother in law's bday and service was sooo good it was just like being home but with better food!ps: if you have a membercard from NPR/wbez you also get buy 1 get 1 free for lunch or brunch...But the best is still the food which is wonderfully portionned in order for yo to enjoy each course you choose, the flexibility of the menu accomodating for everyone's taste, and simply their creative yet simple cooking...AND it is BYOB... a wonderful plus according to meA little note though, I wish the place was bigger : )"
Great French toast and excellent coffee. Service was fast and pleasant. Overall a very good experience. I love that they actually care about the community and not simply about profits.
"If you're looking for a great meal with friends or even a significant other, Cafe Too is a good spot....especially if you are on a budget (It's BYOB).  Recently, I went there with some friend to enjoy their $18 price fixe menu (3 courses) and it was very good.  I highly recommend the peanut crusted salmon, even though I did scrape a couple peanuts off the salmon.  A bit overpowering.  I also tried their citris crepes, even though I'm a chocoholic.  I feel like I should have gone with the chocolate.  The sweet cream in the crepes was a little too sweet for me, especially mixed with the small pieces of tangerine.One great thing to note...the atmosphere is great!  For an open space, the noise is limited and you can easily have a conversation across the table without having to raise your voice."
"I want to lay out the disclaimer that I'm a flaming liberal and I love the ""social change"" purpose of this restaurant.That being said, I would come here even if they weren't changing the world and whatnot because the food and service is so incredibly good.I've just done brunch but they have great food great coffee and a nice selection of teas. The staff is ever attentive to find you a table, refill your coffee (very important) or get you some water, in this super cool looking tiny Uptown Cafe. ALSO, as is true of many places in Uptown there's some pretty interesting people watching on Sheridan."
"My favorite go-to Chicago breakfast spot!5 stars because the food is good, the cause is worthy, and it is hardly ever crowded.  The service is amazing!  We have been there a handful of times and each time the waitstaff were warm and welcoming. The atmosphere is just so comfortable and friendly.  It is different than any other restaurant I have visited. Every time at least three people ask us if our baby wants a chocolate chip pancake.  The first time she could barely hold her head up and the waiter just brought one for her without even asking!  We felt bad... kinda... as we ate it ourselves!  Then they brought out ice cream for her!  Again, very sweet, but she is only months-old.  Someday soon, we will bring her to Cafe Too for her ceremonial First Pancake. I love the crab cake benedict.  I had a chorizo-shrimp torta today that was a lot of chorizo and the shrimp kind of got lost.  I still ate it all and I might even order it again."
"Loved!  I was treated by Briana J. to a very lovely birthday brunch.  As she explained the 'Eat well & help other'- they help train cooks and staff so that individuals can get back on their feet when times are difficult.  Great idea! The food was delicious!  I had the eggs benedict florentine.  It was excellent, and the frittata was just as appetizing.  The coffee was potent, and it definitely hit the spot.  Oh, the only thing I wouldn't recommend?  The creme brulee latte.  It definitely tasted like the dessert, but it would not be something I could finish.The place was quite small but cozy.  On ocassion, there was a draft from the entrance, so I'd recommend wearing a sweater if you're dining during this cold season."
"I went last night with a buddy.  This is a nice place and byob to boot.  And they hired disadvantaged youths and give them job training to become chefs.  Much better than just cutting them a welfare check.  The prices are really reasonable.  The wait staff is polite and friendly.  The sous chef even came out and talked to us for a while.  I had the chiote shrimp (tasty but there were only four or five smallish shrimps-and for someone who used to live in New Orleans that was a bit of a disapointment), gazpacho (only ok, too tomato-ish and no spice), a watermelon/arugala salad that was great and a perfect match with the Alsatian Pinot Noir Rose I brought, a corn meal encrusted barramundi with tomatoes and rice which was good.  Their flank steak with poblanos was good too.  And for dessert I had vanilla ice cream with melon balls which had been tossed with a cardamom simple syrup.  I would not have imagined that cardomom would go together but they do."
"I want to give it 5 stars, but I'll reserve that honor until I come back again--and believe me, that will definitely happen.Went here for brunch, and mannn it was good. We were immediately seated (an unusual occurrence for a brunch place). I had the peach sorbet French toast, and it was sweet but not too sweet. The sorbet melted as I was eating, so by the end my French toast was basically doused in peach syrup. YUM-O. I also had the ""hash browns"" which were as good as promised--but not hash browns, more like cubed potatoes. I don't think they tasted like McDonald's fries, but they were delicious. They're sweet and salty cause they're a blend of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, and I love potatoes and sweet potatoes. My chai latte was also quite good. Basically, the only thing that's keeping me from giving Cafe Too 5 stars is that I've only gone once so I don't know how consistently good their food is."
I've visited this place various times since 2008 and I must say both the food quality and the service have vastly improved. The interior is modern and comfortable and clean. Portions could be a tad bigger... not like Waffle House size but maybe a little more food would be good.
"Went here with friends during my birthday bash weekend. All of the food was fantastic, yet slightly under seasoned. Staff were very friendly considering their past! I would highly recommend this joint over the other one. Great menu selection! Will definitely be back to this place."
"New fave!  Went here with a friend yesterday morning after I saw the reviews and I loved it!  Very bright decor with a sunny feel.  The menus are printed on cloud paper, such a fun touch.  There is a barista for your java fix and then a selection of early specials that run from 6-10 AM.  My friend went for the traditional benedict and I created my own omelet (you get to choose 3 ingredients from a long list; I went with spinach, goat cheese and portabella mushrooms).  Both of our dishes came with the choice of potatoes or toast and we both had potatoes.  The food was extremely fresh and delicious.  The best part, between the two of us ordering two beverages and entrees...our total bill was only $18!!!  It is killing me a little inside to give Cafe Too more exposure...I know it is only a matter of time until this is one of the most popular places for brunch in my area."
"came here for brunch after reading all the rave Yelp reviews, and maybe went in with too high of expectations.  The food was good, the service was superb, and the atmosphere was bright and cheery.  Nothing, though, was amazing. I ordered the fritata rosso - eggs filled with chicken sausage and peppers and topped with red pepper sauce and farmers cheese; breakfast potatoes on the side.  my eggs were just alright.  and my potatoes, well, i left all of them there after a bite.  i will say that the coffee was very good.the good thing about coming here though is that it is affordable and you are giving back to people in need.  so, really, eating here made up for all my sins for the year."
"Great food, great value, great cause.  What more could you ask for?  We went in for breakfast with our two small kids and couldn't have been more impressed with the service and the food.  Everything is fresh and and impeccably made to order.  And did I mention the excellent service?  These folks were some of the nicest waitstaff I've met in a long time.  They really do care and are an inspiration.  Will definitely be back."
If you're looking for a weekend brunch option on the northside and don't want to have a long wait....come here for delicious food.  I am obsessed with the yogurt parfait and the espresso french toast has such a unique taste....really good comfort food at awesome prices.  The atmosphere is calming and the service is fantastic..  So glad we have this fantastic business in Uptown.
"Been wanting to try cafe too ever since I saw it on Check Please, and finally made the time on a Friday morning for breakfast.Went with two friends, who knew nothing about the concept, but were eager to check it out once I filled them in.We arrived around 10, and the interior was packed with a staff meeting or private party of some sort, but it was gorgeous out and we grabbed a table out on the patio. The hostess came out right away, apologized for the crowded interior and told us drinks were on the house! The weeknd brunch menu might be a little more extensive than the weekday, but we each found something different to try. I ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich, and my two friends ordered a 'choose your own' breakfast sandwich and eggs any way.  We also had coffee.  The coffee came out right away, and our server was lovely. Asked if we needed cream or sugar, but immediately remembered they were out of cream. No worries-we went with soy instead.Our meals took a little while to get to our table, but maybe because of the large group inside? It was such a nice day out that we didn't mind. Plus our waitress came out with coffee as often as we needed refills.The food was very good-standard stuff-but the best part is the portion and the price. Not your typical breakfast platter, overfilled with potatoes and too many sides, it was just the right amound - we all left feeling satisfied, not stuffed.  And all that for under $20 for the three of us. I'll definitely be back to try their three-course dinner soon."
Great place to eat at any time of the day. One of the best breakfast menu's in the city. Jeffrey was our waiter yesterday for breakfast and he provided great customer service. This is one of my top picks in the city to take family and friends when they visit
"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat brunch after he suggested the Golden House on broadway and that place looks like a condemned building. After a brief disagreement over my ""high standards"" we found Cafe Too. Great Find. I had the french toast and it was awesome. I also ordered hash browns and they were these crunchy  chip-like skillet potatoes. I'm normally not a fan of surprises at restaurants, but this was a good one. Plus any place that serves Intelligentsia coffee gets an extra star."
"There is a lot to like about this place.  First off and most important the concept of the restaurant is really admirable.  Everyone from the waitresses to the cooks are people who have faced difficulty in their lives (homelessness, addicts, etc).  However, the nonprofit that runs this place provides training to the staff and help get them back on their feet.  Such a great concept.The food is good here...although to be honest I wasnt competely blown away.  It was a strong 3 to 3.5 stars.  I ordered the crab eggs benedict.  My other compliant is that we had to wait about 20mins for a table, which is common for a brunch place, but still a waste of time.  Finally, the coffee is Intelligencia...which I'm not a big fan of.However, this is a nice and reasonably priced brunch place with  a grea social mission."
"I loved this place. I just went this morning for my friends bday (Alice L.) and I was quite pleased. The waiter was the friendliest man ever. He explained the the cafe gives back to the community...I was impressed with the story. Eat well and help others....best idea ever.The food was great. I had an omelet(make your own) and it was huge! It was six dollars and I was stuffed. The hash browns were amazing.My friends has the eggs benedict and the frittata. There was so much food and so reasonably priced.The space itself was small but clean and warm. I really cannot wait to go.Oh, I had a holiday latte...and it was just alright but the regular coffee was strong and wonderful so stick to that!"
