Pinstripes
"Since my first review, I have ordered the pizza and chicken and goat cheese pasta for take out, and had dinner on the outdoor patio. Both the pizza and the pasta were delicious; it is also worth noting that when we went to pick up the food, there was a mistake with the toppings on the pizza so they made us a new one for free and were super friendly and apologetic for the mistake. My experiences with the staff here have been incredible - truly some of the nicest staff that I can think of anywhere. For dinner on the patio, we had the braised short rib - it was amazing. Easily the best short rib that I have had in the city. The short rib, mashed potatoes and vegetables were all delicious and topped with a tasty sauce - this is how a short rib is supposed to be done! We also had more cocktails - I highly recommend the limoncello martini and margarita italiano - both are super tasty and nice pours. Overall, I have been to Pinstripes four times now and each time has been great. You truly should check this place out for great food, drinks, service, and the beautiful patio. A hidden gem downtown."
"I've been coming here for happy hour after the movies at AMC River East. And enjoying it. The restaurant part is actually quite nice, with a nice looking dining room and outdoor patio. The bowling lanes are way off to the side in another area, so it's not like eating in a bowling alley, and the bocce court looks like fun. But for me the only exercise is raising a cocktail glass. So find me in the bar area. The bar has comfortable seating and there are high top tables if you prefer. Service is friendly, and my Manhattan was well-made. No complaints there. The happy hour specials are really appealing. Wine and beer for $4, half-price appetizers, and great flat breads for $7. Chicken + avocado flatbread had a good crust and was tasty (it's a ""club"" so tell them to hold the bacon if you don't want it). My friend's pepperoni suited him to a T. The filet mignon trio with mashed and asparagus was a decent entree, but this is no steakhouse. Like I said, a very serviceable happy hour. Just be sure to get your orders in before 6:30!"
"This rating is really only for the food. The location itself is quite classy and very close to the pier. You can choose to dine here without bowling or bocce. I only saw the bocce setups--it looks like all the bowling is downstairs.Service was slow, but I think it was because dinner service had just started when we went. I got the spicy chicken sandwich and it was okay. There was nothing really to ooh and ahh about. I don't think it was worth the price we paid for.Server was very helpful in choosing beers, but again, there wasn't an extensive selection. You're better off with wine here.tl;dr short beer draft selection, ok food; a bit on the pricey side. Come here if you're interested in in bowling/bocce and it'll be more worth."
"The River East Building has not had good luck with restaurants.... so this review is strictly on the restaurant.Upon entering this massive restaurant, I had noticed how cool this restaurant is with the exposed beams, brick walls, wooden floor and the brightness of this space is.  We were seated right away since we were having a late lunch.  We had opted to have a booth.  There are various seating configurations to accommodate everyone.George had greeted with a great smile and personality.  He went over the menu with us then proceeded with our drink order.  Everything looked really good. George had brought us our drinks then took our order. I had ordered the loaded mac n' cheese (I tend to judge a restaurant on this item).  My companions had ordered the Salmon Sandwich and the Prosciutto Sandwich.  We also had ordered three cups of the chicken dumpling soup since it was a cool day.  The soups were brought to us right away.  The soup was very good.  Then shortly, the food runner had brought our main courses.  We had sampled each other meals and none of us had any negative thing to say.  The Mac N' Cheese was one of the best I've ever tasted.  I've had some bad Mac N' Cheese.Throughout our meal and dessert/coffee, George was great.   He really added a great experience.  After our meal, we take a tour of this complex of restaurant and bowling and bocce areas.  The areas looked really spotless.  The restaurant has an incredible patio over looking the river.  If it's cool night, don't worry, there are blankets and several fire pits to keep you warmI would highly recommend this place.  Looking forward to my next visit."
"First time at this location.  Usually go to northbrook location cuz closer to home.  But was in the city with family n went with kids for dinner and bowling.  The good...Bowling was pretty cool!  Had the blue lights goin on n kids loved it!And it was half price on bottles of wine!!!! The bad...Service was a bit slow.  We were all super thirsty from walking around all day and we needed lots of water but it was hard to get it.  Missing a couple place settings.  Also hard to get.  Food all came out at different times and so some finished before others.  But not too much of a big deal cuz we're staying to bowl anyway.  Was't in a hurry. The ugly...the foodI LOVE PASTA!!  Ordered a chicken Alfredo kinda penne pasta dish.  Don't recall exact name.  But No gusto!!  I love al dente ""noodles""!!!  Love to twirl it on my fork and take a huge bite!   So I asked to substitute the penne for spaghetti noodles.  Big mistake.  When you switch up a dish I guess chefs panic n it just doesn't come out right.   Or at least that was the case here.   The pasta was way over cooked.  It was like eating a big bowl of thick creamy mushy noodle soup.  But the flavor of the sauce was ok. Just not a good pasta experience.  Hubby had ribs.  He liked it.Kids had spaghetti.  Didn't like it but sausage was good.Cousins had a Cajun seafood risotto dish (basically looked like jambalaya) that was a bit salty n a salad they liked.Prob will return for bowling n half price bottles of wine on Friday nights.  And I'll try not to substitute anything!!!"
"Looking for a cool place to lounge while playing some bocce or bowling.. You found your spot! Right when you walk in it seems like a cool huge wine bar.. Then you go further and there's a restaurant, patio (with a great view) and then some bowling and bocce!  So much fun!!! Not only are the drinks amazing like the Moscow mule or grapefruit n vodka the food  n dessert is on point!  Got to try some pizza, the toppings and crust were perfect and the dessert was to die for!  A lot of people also rave about their salads so gotta remember to order that the next time I'm there.  So if your looking for something different to do with a group of friends or date rather than just go to a bar, this is the perfect spot!"
"I attend a Yelp Elite event at Pinstripes and I will say they have a great space! Two MASSIVE floors.During my time at Pinstripes, I spent most of the time playing Bocce. They have three turf lanes/courts in the bottom section of their establishment. You can play with a few players - probably max of three per team so you can have a fair amount of turns. It's A LOT of fun. Some people get heated, so they include a tape measure. Trust me, it's necessary. I ordered a few drinks, and the service was a tad slow. I actually ended up chatting with the manager on staff, Kyle, and made the experience much better! He is incredible kind and attentive. For this reason, I'd deff go back and play some more bocce and grab drinks. They also have a bowling alley - did I mention it's a huge space - on the ground floor but I never left the bocce lane. This is a great place to go have drinks and hang out with friends. It's a relaxed environment with two awesome activities. Why would you stay at home and play beer pong when you could go to Pinstripes? Check yourself!"
"$8 Kids' meal is an awesome deal, dessert was awesomeWe didn't have a reservation but was still able to dine in the lounge area before our visit to the Navy Pier (read from fellow Yelpers food in the pier is horrible). I wasn't expecting too much from this place given the 3.5 rating but was genuinely surprised. We had:Prime Rib Sandwich served with fries - deliciouss! Juicy and tender, the brioche bun was perfect for soaking up the au jus in every dip. The au jus wasn't salty, but just had enough flavor to up the ante. Fries were shoestring and perfectly saltedPepperoni pizza personal pie - standard pizza with spicy pepperoni, my wife liked itChocolate Smores (dessert) - Damn, why don't I make this more often? Oh, yeah, it is a pain in the ass to make (easy to burn the marshmellow and a mess to clean up). While it is still messy to eat, I have no clean up and they made it just perfect with no burnt marshmellow tasteIntelligentsia coffee - My wife prefer this way more than Lavazza But here's what my daughter had for $8!Marinara bread stickOrange JuiceMac and Cheese2 Chocolate Chip cookiesIt was a steal. Granted, my daughter is not yet 3 so as my wife pointed out, this meal probably won't be enough for older kids. But add a side for them and they are good to go!"
"My husband and I stopped in after our city tour for quick beers.  Once we saw the menu decided to order a few apps and they were delicious, the slider are cooked to perfection and the chicken club pizza was awesome.  When we are back in Chicago will visit this place again."
"Twilight Bowling, upscale desserts, food, waterfront views, playful vibe. Pinstripe nails everything from a casual night out with friends to a fun classy dinner with a date.Will be back for Bocce. Don't forget the free glass of house wine on Tuesday night"
"Nice place for family they have bocce, indoor bowling alleys and a full bar, craft beers and amazing food for adults that enjoy eating in Chicago.  Won't be let down. Prices are good and outdoor dining overlooking river."
My husband looked up this restaurant on Yelp. It had great reviews and I agree with them.  To begin with the focaccia bread with pesto was served warm and was delicious. I had the chopped salad (with salmon ) and hubby had the cobb salad. Both were truly tasty and ample for either lunch or dinner. Loved the ambiance and the service. Would definitely come  back.
"We went there to celebrate our 14th wedding Anniversary with our daughter. We were looking for a place where we all can have fun and this was the perfect place. We bowled first then went for dinner out to the patio. I think Pinstripes has one of best outdoor sitting spot in chitown next to the Chicago river with an awesome view! It was very romantic to watched the sunset and cuddle with the bonfire even fireworks from Navy Pier. Staff was very helpful and friendly specially our waiter Greg and Alex Michaud who at the end of our dinner brought us a complimentary dessert, it was delicious! Food portions are decent and reasonable prices. They have a wide selection of wines. I will definitely recommend it and continue to come to this place, also been at their oak brook location which I totally loved it. Thank you guys!"
"Silverware and napkins were dirty, so they definitely need better dishwashing soap! Kevin was an excellent server. Ordered lasagna which was hard as a rock. I  replaced with tenderloin sliders which was Kevin's suggestion and they were delicious but a little well done for my taste! My friend had spaghetti and meatballs and said it tasted like it came from a jar. Good ambience though! We didn't bowl or play bocce! Order desert sample to go to eat later. I hope it's good. Ask for Kevin and he will make sure you have a great experience! I would stick to burgers, sliders, and salads here! We will come back and know what to order now! I hope next time I can give a four or five star review, especially because I live in the neighborhood!"
"I was lucky enough to attend the grand opening, and folks, you're in for a treat!! Even with masses of people, the site was ready to serve! All the food was phenomenal- my favorites were the italian jambalaya, chicken Parmesan slider and all of their amazing desserts! (Ok, the wine wasn't bad either) This pinstripes has two huge levels- the top is darker and more sexy, while the lower level had white lights and felt more romantic. Both levels had bars and games. Lovely bathrooms too!This is sure to be a big success as it gets going. I can't wait to come back!"
"Like other reviewers, I came here with a friend for the Yelp Elite event. I was impressed. When I first walked in, I wasn't sure if I had the right place because it feels like you're walking into a restaurant. I tried to peer beyond the restaurant tables to see if I could spy the bowling alleys, but they are discreetly at the back in another room. You wouldn't have thought that they had bowling and bocce. The bocce is in the basement and the set up was pleasing. There was also a bar there and plenty of seating. The whole venue is classy, spacious, and pleasing to the eye. Great design.Bowling was a lot of fun. I loved that they had logo'd socks if you didn't have any. Their shoes were so shiny and new, as were their balls...tee hee. Tito's and Buffalo Trace were featured in their cocktails. I stuck with the bourbon ones and the cocktails were excellent.Food: I had the Italian beef flatbread or pizza...couldn't tell which, but it was good. Desserts were good as well.They get one star knocked off because service started a little slow and was feast or famine, and food was ok, but they're trying to work out their kinks as I'm seeing in the other reviews. Our waitress was sweet and nice, despite the fact that Yelpers allegedly (i heard from a bartender at another yelp elite event) not tip well, if at all, at these free events.  She was busting her butt.I'm a fan and would come here again."
"I really loved Pinstripes! It felt like being in a wine region venue more than anything else - you'll know what I mean when you go. The place is spacious and roomy yet by the bar it's cramped.We had drinks and were lucky that they had $5 Bloody Marys and $3 mimosas. They also have a wonderful Chenin Blanc which I became addicted to. The service was professional and friendly.We didn't bowl or play bocce ball but plan to next time.If you have a special event, I suggest looking here because they have a large private room downstairs.The only reason why I didn't give Pinstripes five stars is because the music is atrociously bad - adult contemporary elevator music was their choice. IMHO opinion, if they want to have a more elegant atmosphere, I'd suggest they play jazz."
A very nice experiences. To bad we got there to late to enjoy the dining. But we did get to bowl and only had options to pizza and flat bread only. They are super delicious! Impressed. Service was great
My family is in from out of town and we stopped in here on our way to millennium park. Such good service and absolutely phenomenal food. I will definitely be back here and hopefully play some bocce next time! Highly recommend the spinach and shrimp flatbread.
My first time here was for a Yelp Elite Event. This place is amazing. Is your one place  for a amazing date night. There is a amazing restaurant with great beer selections and a bowling alley all in one place. This bowling alley is amazing!  I don't see myself going anywhere else to bowl after this amazing experience. They also have outside sitting. Go check it out!
"Go here on a Wednesday or Saturday night. If you're outside on their beautiful patio (maybe sitting cozily around a fireplace) at 9:30, you will a great view of the fireworks of Navy Pier. Also, each guest gets a free sorbet or gelato with a check in. Do it but also check out their other desserts: great selection throughout. Pinstripes is in a category of its own when it comes to venues. It combines a great restaurant with a great bowling alley with an incredible patio -- that together has a great country club feel to it. At a venue this pretty and amazing, food is often an afterthought, but Pinstripes nailed it. My friends and I shared the following dishes. Margherita Pizza: 3.5/5 -- The dollops of tomato didn't overpower the cheese or the basil. Overall solid pizza! The pizzas at this restaurant are traditional-styled. I definitely needed a break from the overpowering cheese that is typically found in Chicago. Barbeque Chicken Pizza: 4/5 -- More flavorful, great barbeque sauce. Aesthetically very pleasing as well: quite beautiful.Chicken Parmesan: 3/5 -- Solid and the chicken was alright. Standard chicken parmesan to be honest. Took only one or two bites from this one. Maple Glazed Salmon: 4/5 -- A bit too tangy for my liking but still very high-quality fish, sauce, etc. Italian Jambalaya Risotto: 5/5 -- This dish took the night. So many spices along with delicious peppers, shrimp, chicken, and sausage. I love jambalaya and I love risotto. And I have never seen the two combined. Very memorable. Would come back just for this! If you can handle the spice, don't worry about ordering anything else. Caramelized Cheesecake: 4/5 -- Also never tried a caramelized cheesecake before. Another interesting idea but found the cheesecake to be less than stellar beyond the caramelized top layer. Amazing service. Remember the fireworks (paragraph 1) and remember the Yelp check in (paragraph 2). Pinstripes was an awesome find."
"I went to Pinstripes the other day for an event and I had a great time. I will definitely be heading back to pinstripe with my friends to enjoy some good food, drinks and bowling!Bowling: The bowling area located on the main floor is very cozy with nice leather chairs and loveseats that made me wish I could take them home with me. I believe they have 12 lanes available which is nice because it just makes for a more intimate environment.Food: The food was delicious, especially those sliders and Italian Beef Pizza. I highly recommend trying these if you dine here.Location: very spacious spread out over 2 floors yet managed to pull off a warm/inviting feel.Staff/Service: was very friendly, engaging and informative when I asked about Pinstripe."
"I always enjoy playing backyard bocce ball in the park or in a family or friends backyard in the suburbs.  I love that most of my friends and family members have little to no skill when it comes to this sport so everyone's at the same ability level.  Additionally, lack of bocce ball skills seems to prompt more socializing, drinking, and fun and less ""serious"" play (definitely a positive in my book).  I think it was about five months ago I was searching for bocce ball courts in Chicago and came up completely empty-handed.  I had been to the Northbrook Pinstripes location a couple times and always wondered why they hadn't opened a downtown Chicago location.  The owners of Pinstripes must have also realized there was absence of bocce courts downtown because they finally opened this new location in February!  You can only imagine my excitement when I learned that I no longer have to travel to the suburbs to play bocce ball!Eager to try out their new location, I made a reservation for 9:00pm bocce on a Friday.  It was $10 a person and that would include court-side drink/food service.  (If you don't go on a Friday or Saturday during evening/night hours it's only $5 a person.)  Our group of four decided to arrive early to go to the bar for dinner and drinks before our bocce reservation.  We were very happy to see that they had drink specials each day of the week INCLUDING Fridays.  Finding a drink deal on a Friday downtown is not easy to come by so we were impressed by this good value!  Their Friday drink deal was half priced wines under $50.  Of course we decided to go with the Friday special and decided on a cabernet sauvignon which was great for the price we paid.  We also shared a calamari appetizer and margarita pizza which were both great.After some food and drinks we were ready for some bocce ball!  At our 9:00pm reservation the group before us wasn't quite finished so we were led downstairs to the bocce ball courts around 9:15pm.  There are three courts downstairs and we had the middle court.  Additionally, they have some lounging areas where groups can hang out when they aren't playing bocce ball.  Our court-side bartender said that we were supposed to get half of that area but the group against the wall had taken up all of the chairs.  It would have been nice if they had talked to the other group about sharing because we ended up laying our coats and bags over the court railing.  Next time I would request the court farthest from the wall because they didn't seem to share their lounge area with another court.  While playing bocce, we continued to take advantage of the half priced wine on Fridays and tried a few beers on tap.  Since the group before us was running 15 minutes late it was nice that they allowed our group to also run 15 minutes late so we receive the full hour we paid for.After we played bocce we decided to check out their patio on the river.  They had a fire pit, complimentary blankets, and an outdoor bocce court.  It was pretty large and super nice.  It will definitely be a real gem in the warmer months!  We also walked by the bowling alleys and they had some really nice lounging areas you can hang out in when you're not bowling.  Overall, Pinstripes has a cool/trendy atmosphere, great daily drink specials, good food and, of course, bocce ball courts downtown! (Pinstripes- I hope you keep your daily drink specials going!)  I'm so happy I no longer have to travel out to the suburbs for some bocce and drinks!"
"I LOVE PINSTRIPES.  There.  I said it.  I feel better.Bocce is probably the funnest thing out there.  My husband and I went together for a Yelp event, and we had the best time.  The snacks that were passed around were also delicious.  We loved it so much, we went back a few days later on a double date.We started off great--we ordered some appetizers and drinks and started playing.  Unfortunately, there was a mix up with our reservation and our game was stalled for a little, but the manager (Chris--love that guy!) quickly swooped in and basically made the night for us.  When I say the service at Pinstripes is unparalleled, I mean it.  He made sure we had the best night, and we definitely did.  The food was also incredibly delicious--everything we ate was amazing.  I'd highly recommend Pinstripes.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I think it would be a fab choice for a first date, a night out with friends, anything.  The restaurant/bowling alley/bocce is gorgeous and high end, but without the crazy prices.  GO NOW WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR."
"My girlfriend and I went to pinstripes in Chicago before I was proposing to her last night and had an amazing time. We met a manager named Joe who made the night more than memorable ! We were seated outside on the patio, had great service, enjoyed the nice weather and great food. Joe came out to our table to see how our night was going and when he realized we were celebrating- he went above and beyond to make our night even more special. He was personable, provided exceptional hospitality and was extremely professional. Joe made us feel welcomed and because of him we will definitely be returning ! Awesome job !"
"So much fun! Bowling, bocce, pizza, and wonderful desserts. Service is also super friendly, and the best part?Fire pits on the porch, with blankets! :D"
"Pinstripes, I have never heard of you.  But you exist all around Chicagoland.  Now you are right in the middle of the city.  When I first heard of you, it was through Yelp event, and I realized you were next to Lucky Strike.  Bowling alleys, especially Lucky Strike, conjure bad vibes from me.  Going into this place, I braced for the worst, club/lounge like atmosphere, hooligans, apathetic service.I was quite wrong, and glad I gave them a chance.  Think of this place as a classy casual restaurant or winery with bocce ball and bowling alley.  I was only downstairs for my time, but I had a blast.  The service was super friendly and helpful, the ambiance was warm and relaxing.  You can look out onto the river while enjoying food and drinks.  I wouldn't say that the cocktails were something to write home about and not sure I would really try any fancy cocktails.  But the wine they had was very good so I would stick with that.  I never played bocce ball, but they have 3 ""lanes"" for the game.  My only issue was that the lanes were too close together, there should be a little buffer so we can have places to ""loiter"" while our teammates are taking their turns.All in all, I would definitely consider getting a group together and coming here, maybe even when patio is open.  This is much more up our alley than Lucky Strike."
"I went to Pinstripes last night and it was fantastic! The ambiance of the place is like no other--I really like how they built in the different areas still keeping the art gallery look. That is really unique to the space. They have a giant level in the basement with bocce ball and a full dining room and bar. Upstairs you have bowling and another bar as well. There really is a lot of space for groups and I personally love that because I usually hang out in groups of people. The food: This place has so much good food. They have phenomenal bruschettas that I ate a ton of and they have great little mini burgers as well. They both had particularly distinct flavors that I have never tasted at other places that offer this type of appetizer. The drinks: They have great wine on deck--the merlot was my favorite and I had a couple of glasses of that. Their mint moscow mules were also fantasic--sometimes too much lime in it though but other than that the taste on these were also distinct. I'm a fan of anything moscow mule. The vibe: The vibe here is great. I'm all about good vibes and this place makes it happen. The staff here were all fantastic---it all started at the door when you first walk in you are greeted right away and they want to help you. The hostesses are not just standing around unaware of what's going on---they actually know what's going on and even give you suggestions. I dealt with Amanda and Cynthia and their customer service and stature were beyond outstanding! I have never gone to a bowling alley with such good service. They made sure my group of friends and I were comfortable at all times and even joked around with us. In short, they made sure that we were having not just a good time, but a memorable time. If I owned my own company they would be hired in a heart beat! I will definitely be back to Pinstripes and I'm 100% sure that I'll choose Pinstripes over Lucky Strikes that is down the block any time that I want a good night out. I also cannot wait to try their brunch!"
"Monday Night All-You-Can-Eat chopped salad and spaghetti! Need I say more? Actually, great pours by the bartending crew and always a ""Welcome Back!"" when we walk in the door. About as good as a neighborhood restaurant can get!"
"I have been several times for lunch and dinner with my family and each time I am extremely pleased with a delicious, fresh meal. The menu has something for everyone. One of the best veggie burgers I have tried and have had my share of them! The waitstaff is always very friendly and well trained.  Great atmosphere and beautiful outdoor seating on the river."
Stopped in for a quick drink on our way to the Navy Pier. I ordered a mojito which was very good. We asked for the bill and before I was able to finish he took it away. Not a good thing to do especially before I leave my tip. Bad service great drink
"Well, it looks like I was right about how everything is always better when things are free! We came back here with a group of friends on a Friday night a few weeks ago for some bowling and bocce fun only to be absolutely disappointed and angered by the total lack of customer service and professionalism at this establishment.But then again, I guess that's what you can expect when the managers look younger than you and you're not even 30 yet. ;) Oh and while they have separate managers for their food and gaming areas, that certainly didn't help with the service at all. If anything, it just seemed to contribute to the overall confusion.In case you're wondering, I do work in a service-oriented industry (Consulting) and even though my clients are companies instead of individuals, the principles remain the same and to make/keep your clients happy, excellent service is always a differentiator and can be a competitive advantage when done at a high level.Anyway, I'll just fast forward and provide the highlights (or shall we say lowlights) of our awful experience:- The lane we were given (lane 5) was clearly broken with the bowling balls behind the pins visibly not coming back. We thought if we started bowling, the balls we rolled would help push them through the machine but instead more balls just got stuck instead of coming back- The intercom button did not appear to bring anyone to our lane or give the ability to call anyone for service as we tried it a couple times to no avail- We were not offered a different lane even though many lanes were empty and we clearly weren't going to get through the two games we paid for in the hour of reserved time given our lane was clearly broken. Note that the lane also randomly shut down a couple of times while we were bowling even though our time hadn't expired yet- They extended our bowling reservation time but yet our lane still shut down at our original end time so that had to get fixed yet again with the help of the manager- The food manager gave us a small slice of cake (it was delicious though) to split among five of us to attempt to make up for our troubles - a refund or a free game of bowling for our next visit would have been more appropriate- The waitress only provided us with a glass of water after asking numerous times. Note that we ordered many beverages and food that night so we weren't being cheap- It wasn't busy which made the lack of service by those doing nothing quite appalling- Near the end, one manager did offer to refund us for the game we didn't start due to all the lane issues and because our bocce reservation was coming up, but when we came to the front, the lady who was instructed to give us a refund said we had played all the games we paid for (computer showed 5 games played/paid for even though we paid for 10 games - 2 per person)- This same lady then refused to look at our receipts and do any math (maybe she didn't know math?) to verify or refute our claims and just kept pointing to the computer instead. Um yes, computers can be wrong due to user error ;)- Only after getting to the point of being angry and accusing them of swindling us, did the unprofessional manager finally give us a refund but the damage was already doneNeedless to say, we didn't stick around for our bocce reservation and will never be back. What a travesty since I live right next to this place and it started off with so much promise during their grand-opening party. Hire some EXPERIENCED, service-oriented and polite managers and train all staff how to provide GOOD customer service immediately!The sad part is, its location in a high-traffic tourist area will probably keep this place in business without making any staff or service improvementsSave yourself the trouble we experienced and avoid this place!"
Loved it. The patio. The food. The service. All excellent.
"Hosted an event here for work with 35-45 people, and they were very accommodating.  They let us design our own signature cocktails and served them at the bar in the private room. Bowing isn't my thing, but if you are even casually interested in it, this is a good spot to hit.  The food is okay - nothing extravagant but sort of what you'd expect from a place like this.  Overall, earns the 4 stars because of the concept, location, and event accommodations"
"excellent food, excellent service, reasonable prices. My new favorite restaurant in Chicago"
"Delicious drinks, friendly staff, and wonderful atmosphere. I can't wait to come back again :)"
"My plus one and I had a blast here at the Yelp Elite event! First of all, we both love #free stuff. Second of all, who would have thought a bowling alley would have good food? We had mini burgers, pita and hummus, and various desserts. And of course, drinks! After we enjoyed some of the food and drinks, we headed over for a few games of bocce ball! Gonna have to come back for bowling, though."
"Good menu, good drinks and friendly staff. l recommend making a reservation if you plan going on the weekend."
"The food is always amazing and the staff makes it the experience better. The servers and management are all friendly and attentive. The jambalaya risotto,  short ribs, and ribs are really good.  Sunday brunch has a great assortment including perfect omelets, fluffy yummy waffles and juicy prime rib."
"The food (chicken avocado flatbread, lasagna, spinach artichoke dip) was fresh and delicious. The free bread they bring out beforehand is also great. The decor and ambience is nice and the space is big, lofty, and comfortable. Plenty of bathrooms and everything was clean.  It's only a few blocks away from our condo so we were really excited to try it. However, service was pretty much nonexistant. Not sure what was going on because it wasn't very busy and it was random thursday night, but person A took our drink order like five minutes after we had been seated, then person B (who turned out to be our actual server for the night) showed up later to take our order. Our entrees came out pretty quickly but our appetizer didn't arrive until we were done with the meal--and they only figured it out because we flagged down a random employee and asked them about it. No one checked on us throughout the duration of the meal and our drinks were not refilled until we asked for the check. I'm not sure if they were short staffed or what but was pretty disappointed by the experience. Hopefully our service that night was a fluke and their delicious food and fun concept will entice us enough to come back."
