Community Tavern
"So there we were.. strolling through Portage Park and thinking ""wouldn't it be nice if we could find a French styled Steakhouse somewhere around here?""Yeah, so that's not exactly how it happened...Ok, our besties read about Community Tavern and we decided to give it a try. Glad we did.Lisa and I were with our foodie buds, Adam and Janet... and were determined to take advantage of the menu.The decor is a conglomeration of styles.. from industrial to French. But it works and will hold your interest.. well, at least.. it held mine.The service was top notch throughout the evening.For appetizers we shared the Short Rib and Oxtail Terrine (don't miss it! kind of a fancy meatloaf with an egg on top), King Crab Legs (small portion, but a taste for everyone) and the House Charcuterie Plate and because we just wanted to try them.. we ordered a side of the Breakfast Radishes as an appetizer too. One of the things we love about our friends is that if someone suggests something they are always like.. ""sure, why not?"" I'm the curmudgeon but they all put up with me anyway.We almost forgot to order the Cheddar Bacon muffin, fortunately, we recovered in time to have one before the meal was over.I had the bone in Berkshire Tomahawk Pork Chop, cooked perfectly.. it was delicious.. in my opinion only eclipsed by Lisa's order of Braised Short Rib on Risotto (OMG!) which was not only delicious but surprisingly not at all fatty.. that's what I'll get next time. Or maybe I should get what Adam ordered.. the Steak Delmonico.. I didn't taste it, but it looked delicious and his discriminating palate thought it was pretty terrific. Or..maybe Janet's Dry Aged Rib eye....she loved that, so...All of the food was excellent!We were stuffed but shared a Brownie Sundae, just because."
Great cocktails.Had the filet - perfectly cooked.Special appetizers were unique and filling!
"Amazing every time we go there.The service is terrific. The drinks are great. The food is incredible. A tad noisy when busy, but what do you expect from a hip and happenin' place like Community. If you are in the northwest side of Chicago in the 6-corners area, please please please go here. You won't regret it."
"Community Tavern does traditional American food right.CT is new and I am glad that it brings great quality to the 6 corners neighborhood. There are many prime locations in this area and CT takes advantage of this opportunity. CT is a finer dining restaurant with the service and food to go with it. I had the chicken which was elegantly plated and tasted phenomenal. The wife and I shared the side of mashed potatoes at the suggestion of our server. The portion was enough for us to share. The wife also threw back a few glasses of a wine that she said was amazing, I think it was the Cline Ancient Vines Mouvedre. I had the (insert beer) which was also good.We spent a good amount of time here, had dessert, and enjoyed a pleasant evening. We look forward to coming back to try other menu items."
"Everything about our first experience at Community Tavern was top notch. The service was spot on.  The staff treated us like we were VIPs when we're just a couple of folks from the neighborhood.We tried a couple of the house cocktails and were quite impressed. The ""dark Manhattan"" (using dark rum instead of whiskey) left a positive impression on my palette. My wife had the whiskey sour and it was one of the best sours I've had the pleasure to taste. My first cocktail was a lovely gin concoction whose name now escapes me. I could have had several of those if I wasn't driving that evening.The charcuterie plate is highly recommended. Community makes everything on the plate in-house, with the exception of the mustard (whole grain, delicious). I could seriously have had several servings of that plate and that would suit me for an evening.I tried the vegetable potage and was very pleased. The dish screamed ""fresh!"" I could have had a large bowl and been entirely satisfied.We had the 16oz ribeye and the tomahawk pork chop. Both were cooked and seasoned  perfectly. The accompaniments to each dish were expertly matched. I wish I had an extra two stomachs so I could eat more of Community's offerings.We were so full we weren't going to have any dessert, but Quay convinced us to give their banana cake a try. We were glad we did. Community is definitely on the pricey side, but for an upscale joint in Portage Park/Six Corners I highly recommend it.I'm in love with this place and will be back again and again."
"Beautiful subtle ambience. Very comfortable, welcoming feeling. Quay did the decorating from the antique mirrors to the gorgeous lighting fixtures to the comfortable seating. Very well done. Staff was excellent, friendly and accommodating. David was our server and he was charming.  If u get him, you will be well taken care of. We started with the steak tartare which was extremely tasty. Others had a wedge of lettuce and soup. My partner had the pork chop for his entree which he said was outstanding. Two others had steak and raved. I had cassoulet which I had never had before. It was a nice mixture of sausage, duck etc. I thought it was good. We ended sharing two desserts, one of which was a crispy brownie which was a great end to a lovely evening. The coffee was very good. I Wd go back to try something new."
"We decided to come here because my boyfriend saw Community Tavern featured in an article about Chicago's best new restaurants. I thought the food was delicious! We had a party of 4, but none of us were particularly hungry so we ordered 3 entrees to share. We got the bouillabaisse, the braised short rib, and the bone marrow steak. Each entree really featured a different type of protein, and I thought they were all cooked perfectly! I would definitely go back! I only give it a 4 star only because I think the menu selection could be a little broader. I mean I had no problem picking out something I liked, but I know my mom had some trouble with it. But overall loved the restaurant!Taste: 10/10Portion size: 6/10Service: 4/10Ambience: 7/10"
We had a wonderful dinner celebrating my husband's birthday.  I had the steak frites and he had the short ribs. Both were out of the this world.  So happy to have the restaurant in our neighborhood! Very friendly wait staff and loved the design of the restaurant.
"We came here last night for apps and cocktails tonight and it was an excellent experience! While we were at the bar, we spoke with Jose, the bar manager. He is clearly invested in his craft--he personally created many of the cocktails on the drinks menu.The major winners of the night were:* the basil-infused vodka martini with a twist* the wedge salad* the french onion soupOverall, their menu is fantastic--you cannot go wrong!"
"This place is it for me. It has everything I love. The bar is on it's game with inventive and delicious cocktails. The wine list is wonderful. I think I have been here ten times since it's opening for dinner and once for a wine event. Dinner never disappoints! I have done the whole roasted fish, the bouillabaisse, the steak frites and several other things. The cassoulet on Thursday is simply divine! Like eating a warm hug. As far as the small plates go, I am pretty sure I have eaten all of them. Highlights are the escargot, the charcutterie (seriously incredible) and the trout salad. The atmosphere is sexy but still comfortable. Service has developed over the past few months and I feel like it is really hitting it's stride. This is my new special occasion and Thursday ""just cause"" restaurant! It can fulfill both roles. I just adore this restaurant!"
"The owner of Portage has done it again for Portage Park. This new addition to the community is sparking a revitalization to the eateries in the area. I went to Community opening night and the staff was well prepared. I've been back 3 more time since then. Everything is delish! Tried almost all the apps including their seafood towers...yum! Have had the fillet and cheeseburger, yes I said cheeseburger. It was melt in your mouth good! The staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. The place does get busy on evenings and weekends so booking a reservation is recommended, which you can do online.Parking can be found in the parking lot a block over and even on Milwaukee.  Also, there is one bathroom per gender."
"Home run for Quay and team at this new gastropub. Incredible that he did it in this neighborhood and delivering a quality experience. Food, wine, beer, cocktails, all exceptional. We started with then foie gras butter with biscuits.  Then tried the seafood tower with shrimp, crab legs, oysters, salmon ceviche, and tuna tartar. Did not disappoint. We had a nice Syrah with our entrees that included the duck confit special (with beans, andouille sausage, and pork belly), roasted chicken, steak and Frits, dry aged Ribeye, and double cheeseburger (kids had this and loved), and a selection of sides (kudos to the cauliflower mac and cheese like dish). Great service topped of the evening.  Want to come back to try the specialty cocktails that we didn't have room for. Plus, it's just cool place to hang out at."
"My buddy and I sat at the bar for dinner. We had reservations but we didn't want to necessarily sit at the table they offered us.  If you take a chance to look around you will see the faux bird cages surrounding the lighting. I found that unique. At the bar it was easy to notice that they were experts in making cocktails. They also have an excellent wine list.  I don't know that I have any particular type of gem to share but I know this. They have the best french onion soup I ever had.  It was sweet and salty. They use a manchego cheese. My buddy and I also ordered the beef tartare. If you like beef tartare it will hit the spot. It isn't anything special but they did it correctly.  I am not sure the quail egg they added was entirely necessary but it presented well.My buddy ordered the steak delmonico which they told us was new to the menu if I understood them correctly. He had nothing but great things to say about this steak. It was perfectly done. They served the marrow in a large bone.  I ordered the steak frites.  It looks exactly as the picture shown on their website.  They use a skirt steak.  I ordered it medium rare.  We shared a bottle of their 2004 bordeaux.  I love this wine. After it was opened I tasted to check if it was corked. It was not but came off bitter. By the time we got the steak the wine became super mellow, very smooth, not bitter at all. To sum this visit up,  it was home cooking at its best for what we ordered.  We were very satisfied and happy to make the journey from the Gold Coast out to here. I think that this restaurant is perfectly named. I would have to visit multiple times to get through this menu. I am sure I would enjoy every visit too.Thank you to Community Tavern for the comfort food."
"Loved the food! Ambiance is amazing! Perfect date night or dinner with friends! Food is creative, unique and delicious. GO!"
"We celebrated our first year anniversary here. Excellent choice. Atmosphere perfect for an intimate dinner or small groups. Highest marks for short rib and oxtail terrine, lyonnaise and crab/avocado salads, porterhouse and filet. Perfect cooking and served absolutely hot. Drinks also excellent and unique. Service friendly, professional and not intrusive. They remembered it was our anniversary (we were provided a champagne). Superior in very way."
Omg my double cheeseburger was so good the bun was toasted ..the owner is super cool. Every time we come he makes us feel welcome which is great Nice guy..
"So I was a little cheezed off originally when I  came here at 5:30 on a Saturday for a quick meal. The hostess working the front said that they were ""fully committed""in a room that was half empty.  She  offered some seat that stares at the wall 12 inches away. We gave it another try early on a Thursday and I'd say that this is ""just what Portage Park needs"".  The  steaks were nicely done and ""Get Together"" cocktail was layered with great flavor. I did not care for the bone marrow, although I crave this from other places. The bread was greasy tasting. The wedge salad also left us wanting- it's not a wedge at all- and seemed a lil limp. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves."
Fantastic spot! Still battling whether I like the portage or community better...leaning portage but it doesn't matter because they are both great. We had great drinks and a very good affordable wine. My drink was a whiskey sour and it was awesome!For meals the steak and pork chop and both cooked perfectly. The sauces that came with both were fantastic. Sides were mushrooms and mashed potatoes.Dessert was the cobbler and it was deliciousService was excellent. My only downside is that I don't get to come here every weekend
"Having already tried their sister restaurant, The Portage, my wife and I were excited for our anniversary dinner reservations here at Community. I can tell you that it did not disappoint at all. We started with the house charcuterie plate, which I happened to read about in a Crain's Chicago business article. All the meats were very good, and the berry jam was a nice touch as well.I had the 6 oz filet mignon, which came out absolutely perfect. I paired it with the mashed potatoes which were also great. We finished up with the cherry cobbler for dessert, which was mostly cherries and ice cream, very little crust/crumb. It didn't detract from the overall dessert, but just be aware if you're used to and expecting a cobbler in that style. To top it off, Quay was gracious enough to stop by and talk with us as we finished up. It's not too often you get to meet the person who puts it all together, and even more so, it's not too often you meet someone who is truly happy that you stepped through their door to stop and eat.Having just moved to the neighborhood from Andersonville a few months ago, I had talked myself into being OK with having to hop on the blue line to get any sort of good food. However, I'm so happy that we have The Portage and Community within blocks of each other. Not only are these two restaurants tops in the neighborhood, I would stack them against anything else in the city - regardless of neighborhood.We'll be back again!"
"I personally told the owner this today but the service from every single employee there was just amazing. ( and I grew up managing in the hospitality industry as well as serving and bartending myself). Everything was brought out with great timing and they were so efficient with changing and replacing silverware and offering refills of yummy wine. We  had our four-year-old daughter with us and staff members took the time to give her attention and talk to her,The food was over-the-top amazing, ( very highly recommend the aged ribeye) , and even the ambience of the entire place was just so positive. A truly memorable and wonderful dining experience that will help us coming back again and again. Thank you!!"
"Must go. The food was amazing and the staff just incredible. Everyone was so friendly. Steaks perfect, wine delicious. We arrived late near to closing time and they welcomed us in. Great experience."
"Delightful. A perfect balance of homey and trendy. The entire staff was warm, inviting and knowledgeable. And the owner, just as at The Portage, is as good as it gets. He could give lessons in this stuff. Our table was late getting ready, and while we didn't quite mind enjoying drinks at the bar, they gifted us with oysters as an apology as soon as we did sit down. Clear sign of folks that care.Four of us almost ran the table on all the appetizers. Such great variety of tastes and textures. Shared whole fish and Porterhouse for dinner. The homey/trendy balance flowed through the food with bold complex flavors punctuated by a keen eye to presentation and style.We will return."
"Home run.  They fit my husband and me in last minute on a Saturday night, great table in the middle of the restaurant.  My husband had the steak frites, which were very tasty, and I had the vegetable cocotte.  Also very good.  We had bread as an app and the brownie sundae for dessert.  My husband had a cocktail, I forget what it was but he loved it, and I had a nice red.  Overall, everything was perfect.  The food, the service, the ambiance.  Thrilled that this is in our neighborhood.  We'll be regs."
"We stopped here both Friday and Saturday night. It was our first time exploring Portage Park. Very happy we found Community Tavern (right next door to the Portage Theater), a relatively new place. Both nights we had a small group and they were able to accommodate us. However, to be safe you should make reservations. The place filled up fast.  Both nights the service was great. Everyone was very friendly, had a great sense of humor and knowledgeable. They also have a well rounded beer menu.  More Gastro Pub than steakhouse. It is upscale but laidback and not pretentious. Both nights we had the Crab and Avocado salad. It's a great portion half an avocado greens and lots of crab. On friend did not like the amount of onions present. We also enjoyed the side of Roasted Mushrooms. I could have had a few of these little cups of mushrooms. Our first night we tried the Tuna Crudo. The Tuna was great, the toppings of olives, peppers and some grapefruit was really strong for me. I brushed about half of it off and at one point all of it so I could enjoy the fish. We also had the Salmon. Wow, what a portion. Usually you get a small 6oz Salmon filet.  They are very generous here. It was almost too much for me. The skin was crispy and flavorful and inside flaked apart. The Gnocchi underneath was warm and soft. I really just wanted the Gnocchi.  Our second night, I paired the Alfredo with Beef Stroganoff with a side of the Roasted Mushrooms. It was the perfect amount of food for me. The Stroganoff is a smaller portion. The noodles are soft; the meat is tender with the juice as a perfect sauce that is not too thick. It was nice to have a non-creamy sauce on this type of dish.The food and ambiance are warm and inviting. You will not leave hungry.  Come for a drink early, enjoy hearty food, grab a dessert and call it a great night!"
Fantastic meal!   What a great addition to this neighborhood.  Should do very well and draw from a wide area. We will for sure be going back very soon!!
"This place is worth the drive west. A great place for a date. My husband and I split the bacon cheddar muffin, market fish, wedge salad, & brownie sundae.  Everything was delicious. Our sever was excellent and had a good sense of humor. The owner Quay Toh was there managing the house and saying hi to guests. We will definitely go back for the ribeye."
"Portage Park has been graced with more options for dining.  Walked in on a Friday with no reservations and the place was packed!  I didn't have high expectations going into the place, but boy, was I wrong.  We ordered the house charcuterie plate and I was hesitant since my wife is very picky with eating new types of food.  However, she loved it and the fact it didn't leave a lingering taste of what some restaurants tend to do.  For dinner I had the Ribeye and she had the Pork Chop, both were delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and most of all the way the restaurant is setup, it has a very relax/chill feel to it."
"Community Tavern is a hidden gem.  No sign and an address in an area where one would not expect such a high class restaurant makes it seem that the owner is reluctant to overexpose his wonderful cuisine and enticing ambiance.  Maybe he's right.  Enough appreciative e foodies have found Community Tavern to keep the friendly and competent wait staff sufficiently busy.The food, the drinks and the service are all first rate.  You may have to look around a bit, but this place is worth the effort."
"My husband and I just dined here and had absolutely delicious meals! Not only was the food great, the service was on point too! We love The Portage, and now we LOVE Community Tavern as well!!"
As usual - not enough tiny toasts. But that didn't stop my wife and I from devouring the excellent Oxtail and Ribeye terrine.  A highlight for sure.  The steaks we got were lovely and paired with a minty mashed potato that I very much enjoyed.My wife is not a steak lover and likes her meat well-done.  The staff was kind enough to cook it a little more without making her feel bad for her poor taste in steak doneness. I appreciated their kindness for her one character flaw.
The decor is casual and not pretentious. The inside is tight so if you are claustrophobic then this probably is not a place for you.  The drinks are gin and bourbon forward.  It would be nice to see them add some tequila drinks.  I had the ribeye which was perfect.  Just the right amount of fat for flavor and at $33for 16 oz. it's a perfect size.  My wife had the bouillabaisse and she thought it was very good. We split the roasted cauliflower which was delicious.  We had a party of ten and we were packed into a small area but made due.  Everyone loved there food but thought it was too loud for a large party.  Very difficult to hear everyone at the table.  This is definite place for couples but not large parties!
"It is hard to believe that Quay has 2 unbelievable restaurants in Portage Park. The food here is incredible. Such wonderful service from the staff at both places.Love both of these places.It is so great to see someone who is invested in Portage Park as Quay is. We need more people and businesses like him.Thanks Quay and staff for always making dining at either of the restaurants an unforgettable,joyous and delicious experience."
Food and the ambiance were superb...I had the fillet Mignon..out of this world..Definitely will be back..
Yummy stake frites.Very good food and ambiance. Great cocktail selection.  More of a Bucktown restaurant in Portage park.Excellent
"This spot is delicious!! We decided to try it on the spur of the moment - a parking spot right in front, so we said ""Why not?"" Wonderful from the get go. Host and hostess very welcoming and showed us to two spots at the bar. Bartender excellent - attentive but not intrusive. We had decided on apps and libations. First up was Wedge Salad - soooo good with thick cut bacon and tender grape tomatoes. French Onion Soup was delicious. Then we had a pork belly dish that was outstanding, escargot (little too lemony for our taste but still delicious), and creamed spinach. Now we love the creamed spinach at the Metropolitan Grill in Seattle but this creamed spinach took it to another level!! Divine and the cream part excellent soaked up with some bread from our escargot. A very nice experience all the way around!!"
"I picked up this place for a special occasion. It is reflected as an upscale place but I realized it is more chill and casual ambiente after getting in.The initial greeting was OK, however, just because I changed my reservation time they seemed little panicked. I do not think that was necessary because I went there before the dinner hour to avoid the crowd.I tried two dishes. The double cheeseburger, definitely not a good burger. If I am paying a steakhouse price 16$ for a double cheeseburger, not even a gigantic one I would expect better quality. The fries aka fritas served with the burger was not good at all. Very greezy taste. I could not taste the potato or the seasoning at all. Honestly, way cheaper places makes better fries. The burger can not even compete with Stanley's or Epic Burger which is half price of this place.Filet Mignon - the quality of the meat was very good. Every place I went the steak is always served with a small side, even if it is a tiny side they put something. They just served the little meat just the meat on a huge plate. I had to order the spinach side by paying 8$ extra.Their peak hours are between 6:30pm to 8.00pm. The crowd is definitely not from the area.Giving one extra star for the cut of the filet mignon. That's it."
Quay and Joey have done it once again with this Gem of a spot!The selection is spot on with a variety of Meat and Seafood exactly what the Portage Park area was missing.The wine list and cocktails are A+ Amazing!This is a great neighborhood spot and if your not from the area a destination spot that you for sure need to travel to!
"I love supporting our neighborhood restaurants! It's my belief that Portage Park and Jefferson Park are the next hot areas of Chicago. After eating at another newly opened restaurant called Community Tavern, this evening we have added the next hottest steakhouse! David-our server, was amazing. Quay-the owner, is gracious and grateful to help bring great cuisine to the area. Everything was 1st Class. Our hats off to the Chef The french onion soup had depth and richness, the ribeye was cooked perfectly as requested. The tuna tartar was chilled perfectly and the chips were amazing i could not stop eating them."
"I enjoy a good steak.  And I cook a better one.  Yet, I sometimes wish to go out for a steak, while avoiding the $300 price tag for the pleasure, a near inevitability for any refined couple in one of the downtown steakhouses.  Whatsoever shall I do?  How will I cope, you might ask?  I'll tell you - I'll visit the newly opened Community Tavern.The steaks here are fantastic.  Kelly ordered the filet and she enjoyed it very much.  I ordered the dry aged ribeye - rare, and you'd be advised to do the same - and it had a rich, earthy, bloody flavor.  The steaks are certainly acceptable alternatives to a trip downtown.  The whipped potatoes side was light, creamy, and very buttery.  Even the french fries are superb, and worth a trip to have at the bar.  The appetizers were more of a mixed bag.  The crab legs appetizer was superb - fresh, served cold, with a light lemon aioli.  The miniature boule of bread was fine, but the butter was overly salty.  The salad was a bit salty too.  I was intrigued by the foie gras butter and biscuits, but I did not order them this time.  However, I saw an order and it looked like the foie gras was baked in to the biscuit, which was not a selling point.  You may wish to inquire for yourselves.The cocktail list is fine - Kelly enjoyed her gin drink, and I had a Bulliet Rye Manhattan.  It was very well made.  I would have liked a bigger glass, but we are just quibbling at the point.The wine list is predominantly American, and heavy on the Napa Valley cabernets.  There was but one Bordeaux, but it was very affordable at $55 and a rich, earthy old world wine that matched perfectly with the steaks.Just one word of caution - the brownie dessert with the ice cream and caramel sauce - has pork belly the ice cream.  Not bacon, but fatty hunks of pork belly.  It was, to be kind, a greasy, extremely unpleasant discovery, and not listed anywhere in the description.  If you are the sort who enjoys bacon in everything, then you might like this, but I think bacon needs a bit of decorum and needs to learn its place.  Which, in my opinion, is nowhere near ice cream.  In any event, you have been so advised.  We were able to send the dessert back without incident or cost.We will definitely be back.  Perhaps I'll see you there?"
"Community Tavern was a perfect spot for my husband and my anniversary. The ambiance is romantic and they had 2 glasses of champagne for us when we sat down. The waiter was so friendly and wished us a happy anniversary multiple times. The food is excellent. I had the steak frites and my husband had the pork chop (the small portion was huge!), and we had the mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach as sides. Loved every single thing. Love these hidden gems in our neighborhood."
