The Office
"We were treated to a craft cocktail-of-the-gods evening by a friend in the beverage industry. We started at the Violet Hour, which was extremely cool and I loved the vibe (if not the noise level). We ended the evening at the Aviary, which was mind-blowing, but our middle stop was The Office. The Office will haunt my boozy dreams. I had a barrel-aged cocktail called Mind Over Matter that was simply the best drink I have ever had. It was dark, complex and ridiculously delicious. Good thing it was $26, otherwise I might have been tempted to have, like, three of them. One of the cocktail chefs stopped by to chat with us and our friend. Seriously, it was like taking a master class in mixology. The creativity in The Office and The Aviary is astounding. So is the service. This is an experience, not a cocktail bar. Now that I've experienced The Office, every cocktail bar is going to seem sad in comparison."
"I've had the pleasure of going to The Office four or five times now and I have never once been disappointed. What separates the office from the aviary is that the drinks are personalized to you. Upstairs in the aviary you will be presented with one fantastical scientific looking drink after another that you may or may not like. The Office has a menu of phrases that choose from and that phrase will spark a conversation between you and the bartender. The conversation will lead to developing a drink that will suit YOU. The food for the most part (foie gras snickers aside) is exclusive to the Office. I splurged once last summer and order everything. Not a single bad option on that menu, but as everyone else is saying..do not go home without trying the snickers bar. The other nice thing is that its not stuffy. A ""secret"" fancy bar inside an already fancy bar that is hidden behind a locked door? I immediately thought it was going to be stuffy service but that was not the case. I'm comfortable wearing jeans or shorts to the office. (Granted they most likely could care less if I was wearing a thong and only a thong so long as I was paying the prices I was paying)"
"It does exist. The extremely exclusive hidden The Office truly does exist and it is as amazing as the tales I have read and heard. This speakeasy hidden below Aviary and Next is something that every person that could have a chance to enjoy a beverage should. We received the privilege in entering The Office after some amazing drinks at The Aviary (yelp.com/biz/the-aviary-…). I felt like that The Aviary was the pre-show before the main attraction. There is a drink menu but the real drinks are crafted to you. After a series of questions on my likes and dislikes, shortly after I held the perfect drink in my hand based on my answers. Everyone could not say a single negative thing about their drink. It was like telling an artist ""paint me something"" and they made the perfect painting based on everything you love. The bar nuts were not your typical ""everyone's hands in a basket"" bar nuts. It was salty and sweet roasted topped with crème fraîche. We had a snickers bar with foie gras. Yes, the foie gras was made inside the snickers bar and it was amazing. Because how intimate this space was, the bartender could give you exclusive attention whenever you needed it. Not more than 25 people can be in The Office. The decor was perfect to the point what you would imagine an exclusive speakeasy would look like. Paintings on the wall with leather chairs and couches to lounge into. Two locked glass cases with vintage liquors dating as far back to the early 1900's. If you can get in, please do. Do not pass any opportunity to come to The Office. This is a place where handcrafted drinks are made for ""you"". Small groups are best. Dates will most likely be placed at the bar however this would be the best place to get after dinner drinks ""ever"". I want to go back. I need to go back. I will go back.Food - 5Décor - 5Service - 5"
"Exquisite entrées, experimental libations, and exemplary service.It should go without saying that The Office is exclusive, almost to the point of being exorbitant.  Enter $$$$/$$$$ (extraordinarily expensive).....That being said, Eric S had an exceptional experience.  Alright, time to cool it with the excessive alliteration.A Wednesday evening table for 2 was my Mother's Day gift (cue the 'awwws') for a wonderful woman who appreciates such fine dining.  Coming inbound on the Eisenhower at 6pm on a weeknight, we were running a bit late and they were very accommodating in getting us seated, communicating graciously via text message.  When we arrived upstairs at The Aviary, a blutooth-wearing gentleman came to retrieve us and lead us downstairs to the speakeasy, accessible only by key.Inside, there are maybe 16 seats max.  I counted two small tables, some bartop seats, and a few plush armoires.  The Office is serviced by a resident bartender/mixologist and lone waiter (Josh and Ryan, respectively) who were simply outstanding.  20% gratuity is automatically added to the bill, and every penny of it was well-earned.  They truly are masters of their craft.  The ordering experience was highly interactive; we weren't asked what we wanted, but rather what kinds of things we were 'in the mood for'.Instead of receiving one of the predetermined items from their menu (see photo), we were presented with custom cocktails--my mom got a refreshing drink fashioned from a house-made sweet pea soda, accented with serrano pepper and chartreuse.  I had a tequila-based drink that featured honey, lemon and paprika.  For our 2nd round, I was feeling daring and asked for a surprise.  What I received was WAY stronger than I was prepared for--it was a smoky mezcal drink made with Peychaud's bitters and 1 very large homemade ice cube.  I wish I could recall more, but at that point I was three sheets to the wind and was gorging myself on baguettes.  Speaking of which....BY THE BEARD OF ZEUS the bread was delicious.  It had a salt crust and light olive oil drizzle that might take the pole position for best bread in the history of the world, and that's not hyperbole in the slightest.For 'light' bites, we ordered the beef tartare ($40) and foie gras ($30).  The tartare was delicately-prepared, although I usually prefer its tuna counterpart, as the raw fish has a more poignant flavor.  The foie gras came in an adorable terrine and was spectacular.  It was so smooth (not to mention rich), we might as well have eaten a jar of deluxo butter.As always, the check is written in immaculate calligraphy and sealed with red wax.  Though for the amount of dough I dropped, I was honestly hoping to take home a piece of furniture.It's hard for me to recommend this place to most people due to the insane cost and sparse availability.  I'm writing this off as a one-time deal and the likelihood of me ever returning is small, simply because my middle name isn't 'Moneybags'.But if cost is no object to you, perhaps The Office can become your new Fulton Market hideaway.  For average schmucks like me, one visit here is enough to last a lifetime."
"The Office. No not the TV show but the Speakeasy.  I had the pleasure of being invited to the Office after being done with the kitchen drink tasting menu at the Aviary back on March 7, 2015.  I personally don't like the crowds and enjoy going unnoticed when I go out.  I'm not the bar, lounge or club scene type of person.  I personally don't give a sh*t about getting bottle service, sitting a level up from the dance floor, and having 300 random people look at me at a club.  Why?  Well, it's simple.  I don't know those 300 people and don't give a sh*t about what they think of me.  It sounds harsh but it's true.  I'm no longer in my 20s looking to be ""ratchet"" and I want my experiences in life to evolve.  As I aged, I prefer exclusive, classy, refined, polished and elegant experiences.  Here is where all the Michelin 3* restaurants, Sam Pellegrino restaurants, fine dining, the Aviary and the Office come into play.  The Office has every element of a Speakeasy but it was a step above the rest.  It's small, dimly lit, exclusive, quiet and played 90s hip hop. Actually, 90s gangsta rap to be exact.  Seriously.  What Speakeasy plays Eazy E's Real Muhf*ckin Gz as background music?!  Dope. I think the only other Speakeasy that could compete with the Office would be Palmer & Co in Sydney, Australia.  However, Palmer & Co is very loud and an all out party like the speakeasy scene in the recent Great Gatsby. The Office's bartenders were really great and helpful. They had recommendations and knew how to make a drink.  Well, it's expected since it's part of the Aviary. The Office bill was one of the classiest things I've seen.   It was hand written and sealed with wax or simply one of the lit candles there.  You could see the seal stamp on it.  The quality of the paper was amazing.  It totally added to the whole experience.  Very classy.Lastly, it's definitely worth the hype if you're looking for something intimate, relaxing and actually get invited.  It's classy, exclusive, a real speakeasy and down right cool as f*ck.  You could actually hear yourself think and your friends talk."
"Wow. What an experience.If you have an opportunity to come down to the office, take advantage.The nice thing about this place being so exclusive is that it's never crowded, so you get plenty of attention from the excellent waitstaff. If for some reason you can't find something to suit your tastes on their extensive and jaw-dropping cocktail, spirits and beer menu, they are more than happy to create something completely customized just for you. The atmosphere is just comfortable and welcoming.It's just cool. This is the gold standard."
"We managed to get tasting reservations for a party of 4 at The Office with a few days notice (super lucky I know). We arrived 15 min early for our 6 o'clock table and were the first ones to get seated. The Office is decorated with wood and leather, making for a very comfortable ambiance. There are about 3 seating areas for groups and a few seats at the bar.I wasn't expecting to get much food, but surprisingly we were really full by the end of it. We enjoyed oysters, foie gras, chicken pate, and some other delicious finger food snacks I'll leave for you to find out.The drinks as expected were impressive. My companions are well versed in the art of cocktails and the Office won their respect and admiration. The food and drinks aren't presented with the flourish chef Grant Achatz is known for, but with the quality and flavors you receive, you don't mind the simple delivery. I think my favorite was the Japanese whisky, but it's hard to choose.The service was great and very friendly. Even though we were slotted for two hours, I believe we stayed there for four! We never felt rushed and truly enjoyed everything. Definitely book a table if you can."
"I am an exclusive person.I wanted to come here just because its so exclusive.Finally, on my bday we were able to get a friend to get us down here.AMAZING!  I think I just like it because its uber small and no one knows about it...for realz.I love the bathroom keys and the servers are EXTREMELY knowledgeable.  Like, I cant even appreciate all of the things they have to offer here.Dark, boozey, smoochzy....you feel special...whether or not it is...ha!BRING YOUR WALLET!"
COLLABORATION BEER rocks!  Exclusively made for The Office.  Woo hoo!Last Word -- Xciting!  Historical.  Made pre-prohibition.  The tartness grows on you.There Goes the Neighborhood -- refreshing.  Bit sour.  Interesting use of calamansi (very Filipino).  Amazing aroma of peppers.Port Hole -- taste like beer!  LOL. Berry flavors is the after taste.We love IT so much that we are buying a TO GO.  *wink
"I wish there was a way to give this another star so I don't have to edit my other bar reviews. This is truly deserving of a 5-star rating, definitely sets the mark.When the host escorts you and your group through The Aviary to head downstairs towards the restrooms, don't be surprised to get looks from everyone in the room. If they've heard about The Office, they know where you're going and they're wondering how they can get there, too!The old menu used to have a cocktail list, now they simply have a list of phrases that sparks a conversation between you and the artist who crafts a custom drink based off the conversation. With all the taste combinations behind the bar, I'm comfortable in saying that they will most likely never serve that beverage again.The staff is amazing, they are incredibly respectful, never condescending and are trying to figure out how they can make you the best damn drink you've ever had. If something doesn't taste right, they're going to fix it for you.The vibe of the room is great, a relaxed lounge feel. The artwork hanging is interesting, but the better conversation starters are the cases of very rare, old liquors on display. Chartreuse and whiskies dating back to the early 1900's, bottles you never knew were available in Chicago, etc. Its all very impressive stuff.To summarize, while incredibly difficult to get in, best drink in the city and most amazing staff (exclusive of the other Achatz establishments)."
"We had a good but not amazing experience at The Office last weekend.The bartender asked us what kind of drinks we wanted and we kind of thought we were going to be getting something off-menu like many other Yelpers have reported, but he ended up just choosing drinks from the cocktail menu that he thought would suit our tastes. Still, the drinks were really good and I had no complaints! I can't remember what I had, but it has rum and mustard in it and it WORKED.Next, I tried a There Gose the Neighborhood from their beer menu and thought it was fantastic. My husband had another of their special beers and was very impressed by it.For our third and final round, Ia sked the bartender to make me something ""Christmas-y"" and then I finally got something ""unique."" I was pretty pleased and wished I had just asked for what I wanted from the start! I think that would be my advice to future Office visitors- the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable, so don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for advice and if you tell them what you want, you'll be sure to get it.Overall, a really cool experience but I think I ultimately prefer Aviary."
"The hype lives up. Everything we had was good. I really am crafting a plan to somehow make that basement my permanent residence, without the staff knowing. I'll be like a human-size Borrower (remember that movie? god, i'm old). End your night with their sundae!"
"I'm not sure if this should technically be a separate business as it is actually the hidden and more exclusive bar inside The Aviary but it is definitely worth checking out. They will let you in the office if they have room and ask about it. Generally this means being nice to your server and enjoying a couple of drinks at Aviary.Now I was a little too drink to tell you exactly what I had but the drinks were concocted based on a series of flavor profile questions the staff asks you when you are ordering. I would definitely say that they are doing some innovative stuff here, but not as over the top as upstairs in the Aviary. You can still always feel free to ask for a take on one of your favorite drinks. Overall great experience, classy Ron Burgundy-like interior. The staff even brought out cashmere blankets when a couple girls in the group got cold."
Not one place in the city makes cocktails like they do here. You can order a classic cocktail or have your drink personalized. Hands down the best cocktails I have ever had.
Easily the best and most innovative cocktail bar I've ever been to (previous 1st place was Drink in Boston).I asked to be taken on a tour of last word variations starting with mescal.  What came back was a hickory bbq smoked mescal based last word with a spring of thyme in it for aromatics.  Absolutely incredible.I'd be careful here if you're going to be doing a cocktail pairing upstairs.  The drinks are so good its easy to blow way past your point of self-control.  Let's just say 2 cocktails at The Office followed by a 10-course cocktail pairing at the Aviary made for a very painful flight the next day.
"Impressive intimate bar with the most amazing drinks.  You don't order a rum & coke here, you tell the server the types of drinks you like and they make you a delicious concoction that will outshine anything you've had before.  There are only about 10 seats in this cubby and they're all comfortable couches and arm chairs.  The food menu also includes some delicious small bites, and the breads are worth every calorie, so order as many as you can afford.  It's not cheap, so save your pennies and impress your date with drinks at this gem of a bar."
"If this isn't the best bar in the world, it's heads and shoulders the best bar I've ever been to. The prices are what you would expect from a one-of-a-kind institution that sources its own whiskey barrels direct from the distilleries. But you wouldn't be here if you were concerned about price.This is the ultimate drinking cave. I can't get enough antique leather furniture to enjoy fine, dark spirits. The staff was beyond knowledgable of all libations. It's a finely curated experience. I cannot wait to come back."
"Ok, call it ""gimmicky"", call it ""trying too hard"", call it whatever you want.  But the Office is awesome regardless of what you think of the atmosphere and process to get in.  We had no problem getting reservations for this past Saturday evening for a party of 3 and walked over after dinner at 8:30 to have one of the more mind blowing alcoholic experiences of my life.  My husband and his brother and I were immediately escorted through the Aviary and downstairs through an unmarked locked door into a very cool, basement/library-esque/speakeasyish room.  Theatrical?  Maybe, but I dug it.  The lighting was very dim, excellent music, a very chill and quiet but friendly vibe.  There is a glass case in the room containing some of the most rare bottles of whiskey I've ever seen.  We were given seats on a nearby leather couch and our host came by shortly after to discuss our drink preferences with us.  The discussion was open and free and really just centered around what types of drinks and alcohol we typically enjoy and prefer and what type of mood we were in that evening.  My husband and I both went with bourbon based cocktails.  My brother-in-law typically enjoys whiskey based drinks as well, but to spread out the variety he went with rum and gin based cocktails that evening.  We had a variety of drinks with each round, everything from whiskey influenced by cardamom to cayenne pepper to coconut to chai.After our second round, we were asked to move to the bar to accommodate space for a larger group.  No problem - I wish we'd been seated at the bar from the beginning.  Watching Julia, the most amazing bartender I've ever seen, concoct her creations was incredibly entertaining.  For the new group that had entered, she made a drink that involved burning rosemary and pouring liquid fire into each glass at the table. Some yelpers have complained about the price.  And while $20 per drink is steep, I'd much rather pay that for a true work of art and amazing creation than the typical $13 for a basic boring drink at any other bar in Chicago.  The Office is a little bit like a Vegas casino, in that once you enter, you lose track of all time and the outside world.  We spent 4 hours there easily without even realizing.  I can't wait to go back to this amazing alternate universe."
"The Office is like unlike anywhere else I have been.  This place is truly one of a kind.  There is no menu - but as others have stated they have ""helpful phrases"" that elicit a meaningful discussion about what you would like to experience.  I say experience, because it truly is an experience.  It's a little intimidating if you don't have a lot of knowledge about the different components of a drink - but the bartenders are SO amazing, they would never make you feel foolish, but will ask you a lot of questions to understand what you enjoy and what you are in the mood for as well.  They are also incredibly knowledgeable.  Seriously, the bartender who won the award for being the best bartender in the world works here.  How amazing is that!These are not the folks at your local bar who call themselves mixologists.  These are true trained artists (really!) who will create something amazing for you.  They are really passionate about it to and are so excited to see you enjoy their creation.  The space is small and dark, and resembles an old school library or office (ha!) and is super cozy and feels very intimate.  It can barely seat 12 people and I have no idea how you go about getting a reservation because I went with a friend who knows the folks who work there, but if you have an opportunity to go - you should go!It's pricey - absolutely, but this is not where you go for a cheap happy hour deal or a rail drink.   I am a pretty standard drinker and the first drink I had will stand out in my memory for a very long time, for very good reasons.  It looked lovely, smelled terrific and tasted amazing.  These are drinks to be savored, not gulped and take the time to linger and take it all in.The handwritten checks are also sealed with wax - I mean, seriously, someone really thought this through.  Despite the exclusivity surrounding it, I never felt judged or out of place and had a fantastic experience.Until next time (I hope!)"
"What can I say...?  Veni Vidi Vici! Perfect antidote to the rest of the ""empire"".  Skip the rest and just figure out how to get here.  Intimate, warm, and cozy.  Like where you'd imagine the men ""going through"" on Downton Abbey but without all the stuffiness and lack of women.  In my humblest opinion, best bar in the Windy City.  Just let us come here sooner in the night, pretty please!!!"
"==Julia is a freakin mindreader (or incredibly perceptive, you be the judge)==If you don't know The Office yet, it's because the invite system is designed to stay mum. But if you are lucky enough to catch an invite here, cancel all your plans and find a babysitter, because you just needle-in-a-haystack'd your way into one of the most exclusive and 5-star deserving bars that I've ever had the pleasure of drinking in.There's a nice booklet for a menu here with one page for bites. While you might be inclined to order a drink off the pages, people seldom do that. It's all about trusting the bartender with your cocktail. On our Valentine's Day visit, this was accomplished with a simple personality questionnaire. I supposed the bolder individuals would get bolder drinks, but there was also friendly chatting involved to get a whisky confession outta me. Julia was the sole bartender in the entire establishment with dedicated barback from ""The Boss"" Anastasio and 1 or 2 others. A busy girl Julia was, but even sitting there and watching her concoct drinks was a tremendous experience from shake shake shake to burn burn burn burn to look-the-bar's-on-fire.-=-Smokey Glass Whiskey-=- The cocktails here are customized and no-named so I can only roughly describe them. I've had a smoked glass whiskey before at 1886 and loved it. As Julia described it: it was a treat for your nose as well. IMHO whisky is best old-fashioned, so ding ding on that also. Let me say that the whole bar smelt incensed-ly fabulous for a shortwhile.-=-Foie Gras-=- We were embattled between the foie or the truffle. With my addiction to foie that was the must, but we can all agree that truffle is also delicious. The foie was prepared as a mousse covered by a hardened salted butter layer over toast. There's also jam, but it didn't seem to pair well for my palate.-=-Truffle Whiskey-=- Julia overheard our food struggle and my love for truffles. As a treat, my second cocktail would be infused with truffle flavoring. Pure surprise. Same strong whiskey base, and when the truffle flavoring started getting killed by the whiskey, she would add more truffle drops to keep the pizzazz.-=-Aviary Only Drink - In the Rocks-=- This is probably one of the most unique of drinks anywhere. The Vieux Carré base gives you that absinthe tingle, but aside from the excellent cocktail, the gimmick is also spectacular. This drink is served as just a round block of ice in a glass with all the liquid encased within. With help from a slingshot tool, that ice block bursts open and the Vieux Carré cocktail inside spills into the glass. Probably the most creative drink in the world. Forewarned that this drink is only available at the Aviary upstairs."
"Any place that you have text to ask to be let into their restaurant is ok in my book.  A good buddy of mine had been here and said we had to check it out.  We went in on a Wednesday night, were greeted with an aperitif and escorted downstairs to the bar. Their selection of booze is pretty solid and what is cool is they have prohibition era alcohol but bring your coin purse because it is going to cost you.  A mixed craft cocktail will run you $20 bucks but they are masterfully done.  The bar tender has a vast knowledge of ways to craft a drink that you are sure to like.  It was truly an art to watch.  They have some exclusive bourbons (Pappys) at a pretty solid price considering this place is going for the speakeasy vibe.I heard the food is awesome but is very expensive.  We came post dinner so unfortunately I cannot comment on the food.Also, anytime your receipt comes in handwritten calligraphy with a wax seal you have done something right.  I couldn't afford to go here every night but it is a pretty cool little place."
"""Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like."" ― Will RogersTruer words have never been spoken. This quote from ""Liz G"" describes our experience perfectly:""Check arrives and we get grief for wanting it split. Gratuity is already included...not worth it.Go to the office if you are trying to impress people by showing them how cool you are. ..You know you are overpaying but you do it so you can tell your friends about it.""Including the exorbitant gratuity for a party of 4, it came up to $200. That's with merely 6 drinks and a waffle. (drinks were good)Fancy, a $40 waffle. At that price I expect something much more than a glorified Chinese plate (see photo).Overall the only redeeming factor was we met Grant and took tequila shots with him."
"Very cool concept, no drink menus, but themes instead like ""what is old is new again."". Tell the serverswhat you like and let them take you on a journey. It was cool to have the best bartender in the world slinging drinks right behind me.  Quality of the drinks was awesome, even if there were a couple misses for my personal taste.  Of 14 cocktails, 11 were stellar.  The list of liquor available is mind numbing, stare at an 1895 cognac or 1936 Chartreuse. Strong beer list as well, not sure what else you can expect. If you like the flair or gastro food, stick to the Aviary. If you're looking for that here you will be disappointed. Come here if you want just great drinks, quiet space, and a fun room to hang out in."
"The Office:  I have thoughts.  Unsurprisingly.I should start by saying that I totally buy into concept.  I love the design, the mood, the exclusivity.  However:  if you're going to brand yourself with this concept of luxury and exclusivity, you should make sure that you're on time with your reservations.  We had an 8PM reservation and didn't make it past the locked doors into the office until 8:30.  Wouldn't normally mind, but it was cold outside.  Not really an excuse for this.Our server was phenomenal.  Very sweet and very knowledgeable.  She gave us the lay of the land--The Office is full of very rare and also extinct spirits.   That part of the office, I expect, is really only for someone with a lot of excess cash to throw around.  Unfortunately, that is not me.One of my friends had a delicious Perennial beer that wasn't too outrageous, and was really delicious and unique.  My husband and I went the cocktail route.  The cocktails here are a little strange.  The cocktail menu is structured like a choose your own adventure.  You choose a line (for example, ""Old is New Again"" or ""Picking Herbs in the Italian Countryside"") and then you are asked a number of questions (do you want a more spirit-forward cocktail?  do you prefer gin or vodka?  do you prefer acidic or sweet?  etc.).  The cocktail you receive will set you back a hefty $20.  I had three cocktails (and was really feeling each of them--especially the third cocktail--the next day).  All of the cocktails were really, truly delicious.  HOWEVER.  I'm not sure that this experience (minus the ambiance and exclusivity) is truly unique to the Office.  The cocktails I had at the Office were just as good as any cocktail I've ever had at the Violet Hour, and those cocktails are a good deal cheaper (and easily as customizable).  That's a bitter pill to swallow for me, and hence my 4-star rating.I'll also mention that the people we interacted with outside of Jeremiah, the door guy, and our server were MISERABLE.  The hostess at the Aviary was nasty and dismissive to my friend.  The other servers looked like they wanted to stab someone.  I understand your clientele can be a pain, but ease up on the sourpuss!  No need to be rude to patrons who have not wronged you."
Place is bank but you didn't come here for cheap drinks anyways. You came for the ambiance. You came for the wow factor. You came for the VIP feel and respect. All of these things are provided at a high level and they even have this cool old school wax seal for their papers.Intimate setting for a small group so you should definately check it out. Just remember to drink before you come unless you are ready to take some damage to your wallet.
"This is an amazing place to relax with friends and it's definitely worth the price! It's like an elegant basement in someone's house complete with the bartenders of your dreams. There's only seating for 20 and the ambience is very cozy. Look around and you can see a treasure trove of liquor bottles all around the room. Let the bartender know what you're feeling for the night and they will whip up some of the most delicious drinks you've ever had. The only sad point of the night was when we learned they had discontinued the ice cream sundae that is so famous on its yelp page. For this year they have the peanut chiffon - whipped peanut creme with pretzel brittles on the bottom. Still delicious, but it's not ice cream. I can't wait to come back and see what they make for me to drink next time. Props to the amazing staff!"
"There's not much I disagree with most of the yelpers who already been here and reviewed it positively.  Its definitely a place you should come and try.  Its a bit flaky to get into here, you have to have text a phone number, and the conversation will be very business like. You ask if there is any availability and if there is, you will get a text back. A friend of mine took care of this and was telling us how it seemed a bit ""shady,"" in a way that we would show up and they would have no idea why we were there.Glad to say it worked. We got down there (by the way, this is actually just the basement of the Aviary, which itself is a superb cocktail lounge). The usher had to use his key to let us inside The Office (which could also be called The Basement), its usually a locked door so no one can just walk in.Once inside, its a very cozy atmosphere. Small of course. Few couches, some chairs and some stools at the bar. All decor is done exceedingly tasteful. Once you get situated, the bartender will come and ask what you feel like.At this point, I say be creative. Don't be shy and tell alcohols you prefer. Instead, tell the bartender the mood you would like to be with the cocktail. You can say you like certain alcohols more than others, but if you give atmospheres and descriptives flavors, you will be surprised at the results. Here's what I said I wanted - something peet-y, something that invokes camping and fires with a summer evening flower scent. The bartender went to make it and I will say that it was hands down the best cocktail I've ever had (and I've been to the Aviary upstairs, along with the other fancy speakeasies in Chicago, NYC, SFO, Boston and San Diego, so I'm saying quite a bit how good my drink was compared to the places in other cities). If you enjoy finely crafted cocktails, can be creative, don't care too much of how its presented, AND like to be part of the mixing process, then find a way to come to the Office. Otherwise, if you rather just have really good cocktails, presented in a way reminiscing of theatre production, then go upstairs to Aviary. The menu is set already with very interesting and well made cocktails, coming out in a very spectacular way, that you won't see anywhere else. Also, its easier to get tickets to Aviary then it is sometimes to get a seat at The Office."
"I've been wanting to come here for soooo long, just because, I mean...it's so exclusive, so douchey, so omg-only-cool-kids-can-come-here kind of atmosphere...why not.All it took was a quick last minute text to the oh-so-exclusive speakeasy, and they told us we were good-to-go. They were also very nice about the fact that we initially said 5 people, but 6 people showed up.You enter through the Aviary, let the person in front know that you're there for The Office. Then a very nicely dressed good looking man comes and takes you downstairs to where the bathrooms are, whips out a key, and opens this door that takes you inside to The Office. A LOT smaller than what I imagined, but very vintage-y looking, grandpa's office atmosphere. Just. my. style. And so different from modernness of The Aviary upstairs.The drinks here are completely different from the drinks upstairs. Everything is more from a classic bar menu, but they let us know that if we let them ""have-fun"" with a classic drink, the bartender would be glad to add a little twist to a common drink.That's what I went with - a classic gin & tonic, and I asked her to let the bartender do what he wanted with it. The waitress asked if I wanted to note of fruits, citrus, etc. and I asked for a note of fruitiness. What came back was an amazing gin&tonic with a note of passion fruit, topped with a rosemary. Waahhhh, it was so goooooooooood. And it was $20.Other people I came with ordered the Aviary beers, and two of my friends ordered one of the wines. Everyone was pretty much disappointed. Beers were...probably more for the acquired tastes...If you like Stella's or ciders like me, the beers here would probably not make you happy. Next, the wine was not what my friends were expecting - smelled and tasted more like whiskey than wine, so neither of them ended up drinking it. The waitress was so nice about it and took it off the check.Oh, and the checks come out in these adorable old parchment-paper-like material, with a FRESH red wax seal stamp, and each drink was hand-written. Small details like these make me so happyyyyyyyy I felt like I was in Harry Potter.If it was solely based on MY experience here, it would be 5-stars, but everyone else was so disappointed, so I dropped a star...But seriously, I think people should just let the bartender take control and make what they want to make!!"
"Got a cheeky text from a fiend recently that said the the ""office"" is the place to have a drink... After texting a secret number and eventually getting a formal response back saying 2 spaces just opened up, my friend and I dashed from a party we were at and headed through the gate way of the aviary to find these lovely people escorting us downstairs to the office. The atmosphere was very demure and sophisticated and staff extremely friendly. They ask what flavours tickle your fancy and they conduct the following to make a drink just for you, to make your taste buds go wild.The office is truly a chilled place to end a night or to start a tranquil exotic adventure!"
"Best cocktail I've ever had!!!!  We went here by accident because we were early for our reservations at the Publican.  The manager at the Publican suggested we go to the Aviary and ask to go to the Office.  We had no idea what to expect when we got there.  What an incredible surprise when we entered the Office, the downstairs speakeasy of the Aviary.  We were blown away by great service and amazing drinks.  The two person staff of a waitress and a mixologist made my sisters birthday one we will never forget."
"Well now that I've been here a few times I'll have to downgrade the violet hour to four stars. I might even have to downgrade the aviary. I'm pretty sure the bartenders here are clairvoyant. I asked for something floral and got a drink with cantaloupe juice and what I think was probably unicorn tears -  there is no other way to describe the rapture I found in my glass. Now I just need to find a way to get rich fast so I can become a regular. P. S.  The truffles are by far the most I've ever paid for an appetizer. It delivered. I'm almost sad that it delivered cause I'll have to either start selling drugs or win the lottery to support my gluttonous habits.P. P. S. Julia is amazinggggggP. P. P. S. I haven't been back since Charles Joly (a real renaissance man) left, but it seems that they've changed their entry system a bit and now take reservations as well."
"I'm a sucker for exclusivity. If I can snag booth one at best restaurant in town, I'm happy. I'm not bordering on Patrick Bateman, but I do have my moments. And I'm also a sucker for a cocktail that's made with painstaking attention given to each ingredient as it is lovingly added and mixed, shaken, or stirred. So when I heard about The Office and knew I would be in Chicago, I knew I had to be there. And I wasn't disappointed. Dave knows his way around a bar: a riff on a Manhattan using amaro, followed by a sazerac using mezcal. Oh, and oysters. With tinctures of flavors to mix for a variation of flavor. And the bill is hand-written and wax-sealed? Perfect.Would I go back? In a heartbeat. It's the ultimate speakeasy, where nobody knows you're there except you. Patrick Bateman would be jealous. And that's all that matters."
"Despite a reservation, we had a wait because they only have a few seats downstairs. But once we got there, it was a stellar evening of perfect cocktails, true speakeasy style ambiance, and very friendly service!"
"Cocktails were delicious, and I enjoyed watching the bartender do his thing. Really small, intimate, and exclusive place.The bartender even told us that the band Wilco was sitting in one of the booths behind us (we were at the bar), though he asked us not to turn and look.Loved the look, too."
"It's like drinking in your grandpa's library (except you have to pay for the booze). Getting a reso actually isn't too hard; I'm sure someone you know has the number to text or you can test your skills on google. The cocktails themselves are very complex in flavor and they use giant ice-picked chunks of ice so your drink won't get diluted as quickly. It's quiet enough to have a real conversation and the background music playlist is great. From my party, we order one drink off the menu, one by giving the bartender preferred flavors, and one non-alcoholic drink and all three were fantastic. The bill will set you back a bit, but it's good to treat yourself to a relaxed, intimate evening with a great drink in hand once in a while."
"Interesting concept, maybe trying to be a little too New York? Yes you need the 'key' to get in. I'm not entirely sure it's all that worth it. I had the rum cocktail and the sundae for dessert. The rum cocktail was truly very well made, and I would recommend it every time you go there. I wasn't a fan of the tequila cocktail, it seemed too similar to a margarita, but a little more subtle. The others that I sampled were the gin one- very good too, and the bourbon- well made, but not outstanding. The sundae was incredible though. The ice cream itself was good and it comes with a variety of toppings, my favorite match with the ice cream were the oreos and the peanuts. The place looks a little like the Ralph Lauren cafe. Dark, lots of wood and leather. Not the place to eat and drink comfortably however, more like someone's living room so depending on where you sit you may be juggling your crockery."
"There must be some bit of irony that I am writing this review somewhere, especially out of all places, yelp. I am not a firm believer in writing/reading reviews about food and drink (yes I am totally aware of the contradiction). At the end of the day, you still have to try it yourself and cultivate your own experience, no matter how many people poo-poo or yay their experience at a place. So if you're sitting on your ass, sipping scotch in your living room or riding the CTA while the faint stench of dumpster wafts through the carriage and you're reading if you should go to The Office, this random nobody says yes. Absolutely, experience it for yourself. That is the short end of it. Find the number or ask when you go The Aviary next time and if you weren't a terrible customer, my guess is they will give you the number. $20 bucks a cocktail (since March 2015) and yes service fee is included in the bill which I feel is totally justified as you are pretty much paying someone to not only provide you service but make/""cook"" your damn drink (very very very well). If you have more time, continue on, if not, go make your reservations already.While you won't be able to live vicariously through this review I thought I might as well dump my thoughts into the river of reviews that is Yelp, oozing with weird business ethics and self-righteous nonsense. Anyhow my time spent at The Office felt...time couldn't touch it (had no idea nearly 3 hours passed). You are probably in the office the staff hangs out at during the day most likely and it is quite comfy indeed. The place has an extremely comfortable vibe, low lights, and good beats in the background, noticeable but not intrusive in any sense. The drinks. Oh the drinks. I came here because I wanted to see what a master could do with their craft. As other reviews will state, you can ask to make a customized drink. It's not just simply blurping out flavors to some sort of flavor machine/server but it is a conversation (at least it was for me). I wanted something that tasted like ""Chicago"" and ""California"" and gave my reasons of what that would taste like, what elements I wanted, and what I didn't want in it. They nailed it. From the description I gave down to adding their own touches on the view I have. While a skeptic could say ""well they are just adding elements and flavors you asked for"" the point is, they do it so well. They execute an abstract idea into a tangible drink, WELL.  I am sure someone reading this has had a ""new creation"" made by a friend or a bartender attempting to make something you felt in the mood for that might be new, and we all know probably 90% of the time it tasted terrible to the point where you envy people who get fed through IVs. Not this case! From my experience, the more you give to your server/bartender, the more they can work with what you want.  I do realize the price ($20) is steep for something that will ultimately turn into urine but in my experience, it is totally justifiable. Overall, if you are looking for a place to slam down jack and coke in one hand while sloshing a red bull and vodka in the other, I would suggest your local drunk hole who could service that to you at a much more affordable price (or hell, just stay home and do that too and play a drinking game while watching reruns of Monk). If you're looking for a place where you wondered what cotton candy might taste like as booze or want something with a creative and new flair, this place just might be a place worth looking into. Just to let people know, they don't have ice cream sundaes at this point still, while my hunch is the menu continues to change, as of March 2015, no ice cream."
"So while we were having drinks at the Aviary upstairs, we pleaded and begged our way down to the secret library (or ""Office"" as Grant likes to call it) and no wonder it's so hard to get into, the door is locked (literally--someone has to unlock it with their key to let you in) and there are only three table tops and four seats at the bar! I imagine this is where Hemingway would have a secret meeting with James Bond to figure out how they can rule the world. Though I felt less like Hemingway and Bond, and more like a clumsy Alice in Wonderland, who fell down the rabbit hole and ended up in some weird, warped underground speakeasy. Where am I? Who am I? Why does the waitress have such bad halitosis? Those are all good questions. Maybe someone should get her a drink. I feel woozy...that drink I had upstairs must have been stronger than I thought...hmmm...The decor is as you would expect, a library with books, paintings, leather couches, and what every library needs--a bar. Surprisingly, the drink menu down here is much more varied and interesting than upstairs, they have a huge Belgian beer list. The food is super expensive as you would expect. I did enjoy the crab but I was really grossed out by the beef tartare (yes, I know beef tartare is supposed to be raw) but this was literally a mound of raw ground beef mixed with raw onions and topped with a raw egg. Luckily, the ice cream sundae made it all better. Look at the pictures--yes, that giant tray is just the toppings. It's $25 and it feeds four and it's well worth it. When you're in la la land and having dessert with the purple striped cat, you too can have whatever you want on your sundae--gummy bears, oreo cookies, bananas, nuts, cake, Heath bar, cherries and creme fraiche. Although I've given it four stars, don't feel obligated to go there...chances are, you won't be able to get in anyway since it's by invitation only. But it's no big deal really. I'm not even sure that I was there...I think it was all just a weird dream..."
"Oh my, my.Visiting The Office after meeting Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert was the perfect night cap for quite possibly one of the BEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE. Words cannot express my gratitude for how impossibly nice Jason Cevallos was to our party. The Office is intimate without being overcrowded, upscale without being pretentious. I don't think the cocktail I ordered had a name, however it did have whiskey and something with cigar essence I believe. Fantastic and innovative stuff here, people! I generally dislike when people use words like ""epic"" or ""legendary"" to describe their evenings out, but I'm honestly still speechless by how awesome my experience was here. Don't pass up the opportunity to check this place out."
"Got in here after the Aviary and continued snacking with the ""Foie Gras"" which meant I must have been a little tipsy... It came as a spread and was the richest thing I can ever recall devouring. Ugh, so so good. My friend and I really enjoyed ourselves. GLUTTONY."
"The Office is the ""less-showy"", more grown up cousin of the Aviary. It is a speak-easy, located in the basement and it only sits up to 14 ppl.  TIP: Text in advance for a reservation. Ask any server at the Aviary for the phone number. Jason, the one and only bartender who runs The Office, is a very knowledgable and enthusiastic mixologist. In contrast to the Aviary, there is no flame, flowers or foam on the cocktails. Every drink served at The Office is made personally by Jason and Jason only. So be patience, because the cocktails here are all very well thought-out , sophisticated, and carry layers and layers of flavor. DRINKS:I ordered a cocktail on the menu, the components included -  Scotch, Bonal, Brioche, Macadamia Nuts, and White Truffle. It was a steep $20, but it was Instant LOVE. One sip, and the flavor of  each ingredient gradually unfold on my palate one by one. For my second cocktail, I asked Jason to customize one based on some flavors I enjoy. He did a brilliant job by combining scotch, black garlic oil, and some magic. SNACK:Foie gras terrine with black truffle. Served with a side of berry confiture & frisee salad. All of the dishes served at the Office are prepared in the kitchen at Next. Generous portion and perfectly seasoned. Who can resist food from Next? I love the respect and appreciation the bartender has for his cocktails. Every drink is beautifully crafted with syrup, oil, and essence all made in-house. It's non-pretenious, comfortable and laid-back. It does not exist for those who are looking for glamour (sorry aviary), but it exists for those who just want to relax on some fine liquor."
"Uh...would it be frowned upon if I asked to move in here? Pretty sure I would be happy crashing on one of those cozy couches for the rest of my days.My husband and I had dreamed of coming here since...well, since before he was my husband (or even fiancé). When we got tickets to Next (and had been sitting on the number to text for reservations for a while), we decided to try our luck and were able to secure two spots.The Office is, in short, like your really wealthy and hip friend's basement (your friend may or may not be James Bond in this instance). You tell the bartender the kind of drink you're in the mood for, some magic happens behind the bar and it appears in front of you. All the while, great conversation is being had, the bartenders are playing around with different combinations (some of which you may get to sample, if you're lucky), and you start feeling good. It really feels like the world's best house party.Drinks, as others have mentioned, are pricey. However, in a town where a standard ""booze+mixer"" runs you almost that much in a nightclub and many cocktail joints start their more expertly crafted drinks at $11-12, I don't mind paying that for a custom drink in such a great environment. In our case (we sat at the bar and conversed with the staff and other patrons a great deal, so I can't vouch for how common this is), we ordered two rounds but in actuality saw more than those two drinks come our way (a sample of a tequila I mentioned I enjoyed in my drink, a taste of a drink a bartender was working on, and a shot's worth of fernet before heading on to Next), so in my eyes our roughly $100 bill was more than reasonable."
"Thank you to a close friend who recommend this place for us.  Insanely great atmosphere that was comfortable and enjoyable. The staff members were all truly experts in the industry and were able to concoct the perfect drink based on the description we gave on what we were dreaming of in heads.  The peanut chiffon dessert was perfect for 2 (we were planning on the ice cream, but they didn't have it on this evening).  This is a must return for me if I find myself back in Chicago!"
"As a huge fan of the Aviary (3 visits in a 6 month period this year is an indication of that), I was angered that a co-worker who'd only been in the city 6 months stumbled upon this super-secret, super-exclusive speakeasy tucked right under my nose in what's already the most exclusive bar in town. Invitation only? How could I have been left out of the cool kids club? Graciously, my buddy decided to share the wealth. I felt like Patrick Bateman as I was handed the slightly off-white business card. On one side was printed ""The Office"" and on the other ""text"" and a number. Thrilled to finally be in on the secret, I quickly booked a reservation.When the big night came, we were led past the Aviary kitchen, down the stairs I'd traversed several times before towards the bathrooms, and into the secret room that once served as Grant Achatz's actual office. The room itself is decorated to the nines and really feels like what I'd imagine a 20's era speakeasy to look like. Think Persian rugs, leather chairs, and dim lighting. It doesn't get much sexier.Unfortunately, the hype and the style are where the magic came to an end. We absolutely liked our drinks, and I appreciate the obvious thought and care that went into making them. And frankly, if hand-chipped ice and a concoction of tequila-claret-applewood-eucalyptus-lemon balm or a snifter of 50-year-old absynthe is your thing, you probably won't be disappointed. But just compared to the wizardry that goes on nightly upstairs, and for $20 a cocktail, I wasn't blown away. Same goes for the snacks: good? Absolutely. $30 for 6 oysters? Debatable given they weren't far and away the best oysters I've ever eaten.Admittedly, our night at The Office came smack in the middle of a month-long victory lap of Chicago culinary favorites, so I'm inevitably stacking it against other favorite haunts. But when I do so, and for the price, it just doesn't stand in the upper echelon. My recommendation: get over the whole exclusivity factor (no one's denying that Grant Achatz is a marketing genius as well as a culinary one), book a table at the Aviary and have a magical time."
"Grant Achatz, Craig Schoettler, Jason and co. have done a phenomenal job of delivering on their promises. Each time I leave this corner on Fulton and Morgan, I think to myself, it can't possibly ever get better than this. But I'm proven wrong time and time again. I am still a little dazed from my experience last night at the Aviary and the Office. After two hours of nibbling on the detailed and delicious bites at the former, we had the opportunity to lounge about in the latter for another three hours. I'm almost reluctant to write this for fear I won't do justice to the establishment.Suffice it to say that if you're going to be eating at the Office, bring as many friends as you can to share in the decadence. I ate more foie gras in one sitting last night than I ever have in my life. It was covered in black truffles and chive and accompanied by delicious black mission figs, frisee and balsamic. They brought us more brioche after we finished the first plate of it and had barely made it halfway through the terrine. I felt gluttonous, but have to admit each bite was more spectacular than the last. The beef tartare was also incredible. It came topped with an egg yolk and served with rye toast points. Rich, elegant and lovely. As for the famous $25 sundae? First, two cocktail glasses were set before us filled with homemade vanilla ice cream. Then a tall, narrow container of hot fudge and a glass serving tray with banana slices, maraschino cherries, chocolate toffee, gummy bears, peanuts and whipped cream. I've been dating my boyfriend for more than four years and it was only the second time I haven't seen him finish dessert.The drinks are worth every penny. I started with the kirsch, cherry, thai long peppercorn and flemish ale, and it tasted differently from the top than the bottom. That was just the beginning of the intrigue. I also tried the best gin and tonic of my life through a lovage straw. And even though I was stuffed to the brim, I couldn't help but order one last smooth red peppery cocktail; call me a bourbon convert. The geniuses behind planning and executing these menus create meal experiences where you feel like an absurd hedonist for breaking nearly every one of the seven deadly sins, but also like one of the most blessed people in the world. And last night I guess I was one - of 14. Thanks for the magical privilege!"
"How does one finish a trip to Chicago after eating at Alinea and drinking at The Aviary?  Why, visit the Best speakeasy bar in the US of course!Relaxed at The Office, which is a chill cozy place with a full bar area and sofa/chair seating area, from 11-2:??Time really does fly by when one partakes in the following:Osetra caviar with creme fraiche and crispy yummy potato chipsHodgepodge - huge smorgasbord of numerous tasty spreads and a big basket of delish bread2 bottles of champagne :)  (I know they're known for mixed drinks, but I wanted to leave Chi-town with a bang.  Will of course be back to have the mixed drinks!)Hospitality is unmatched! (manager, waitress, bartender)Did I mention I had the honor of meeting Chef Achatz?!  WOW!  Much better than a ""Oh, What a feeling!"" Toyota moment."
"My friend texted me that the Skarhead show he wanted to go to was canceled, so we should go to the Aviary.I figured we needed to see if we could do the chef's table for sure, and see if we can get into the Office, so I emailed the Aviary reservation address with less than 24 hours notice that I wanted the chef's table or the Office for four at 10pm. The next afternoon I was confirmed and they prompted me which one I'd prefer, which was absolutely wonderful of them, and I picked the Office. Reservations set.I reported back to the troops and was met with questions of ""can I wear my Skarhead basketball jersey to this place?"" I knew fully well one of the things I would be hearing belted out by a large insane Irish Catholic was ""man this Brioche is even better than swallowing a giant load!""We got our first round. I got the cognac drink with tonka berries and a vanilla bean. I honestly only ordered it because of the tonka beans, its stupid, but they are these little beans from a flowering South American tree called the Cumaru that are illegal and regulated by the FDA. In large doses this chemical coumarin can cause liver failure, however they cook with tonka beans in Europe because they have this slightly bitter taste and amazing vanilla scent. Coumarin was first isolated from tonka beans for medical purposes before it was largely synthesized. I hate cognac but this drink was the bomb, and I ordered another after my first one.Everyone else got the whisky and bourbon drinks. We traded glasses and everything was pretty sick. Rick had whatever the drink was shaken with egg whites which is always delicious.The first course we got was the King Crab, sort of a dish for two that we inhaled in a few bites.The layout of the office is kinda particular, as is the upstairs. I dunno who they had design it but it was definitely some shmuck who likes dining in hotels. I get that they tried to get a bunch of antique stuff to match some of the antique booze (they advertise that some of their chartreuse, rum etc is from the 40's) but it just comes off like WASP parents tried to make their den look like an old hunting lodge and tried way too hard. Awkward low tables and mismatched furniture. Maybe it was aftermath from the awful flood? Give em a pass.Terrine of foie gras, served in a ceramic goose lidded terrine with a side of simply dressed greens, some brioche toast triangles and killer berry preserves. We inhaled the foie as well, not touching the preserves or greens until it was gone.We ordered another round, I switched to a whiskey drink and Donny switched to beer. I started teasing him about not ordering the fancy stuff because its available and we're splurging, but I didn't realize he did this to save thirteen fucking dollars a drink and that it was a really smart move. I had factored my share of the bill to be around 150$ but that was more based on food. The cocktails are all 20$ a pop. I'm fine paying that for a fancy place like this where I saw the meticulous job done for all the ingredients that went into them (juicing, freezing, ice prep, herb prep, veg prep etc) not to mention all the more fun side of things like the weirdo ice molds that the chefs get to make themselves in Martin Kastner's design studio, cask conditioned booze in the walk ins and such. Point is, drinks are expensive.Iberico ham with some fancy south american (brazilian?) nuts Donny says I should just buy at Costco, and some tomato-y bread that's like bruschetta but they call it something else. Tartare plate next. Ice cream sundae. As if we weren't full enough, huge head-sized ice cream dishes with this platter of idiot candy and multiple vessels of literal melted brownie fudge dough to pour over.11 cocktails, more drinks, five dishes, 700$ well spent. Don't be a wiener, its just a restaurant. Don't be a cock either, these people work their asses off.Oh, whats his face, the bartender/chef assigned just to work in the Office is the bomb and the waitstaff are hilarious if you prod them enough."
"The OfficeQuaint and secluded, The Office is one of my favorite watering holes in Chicago.  The more modern and trendy Aviary which resides above ground is now my second favorite.The Office is a small space, which can fit maybe 14 - 16 people at a time, and you need a reservation or invite to get past the locked door (it's not hard to find a way in with Google).  The decor is something that fits my personality and style perfectly.  Take a recipe of wood, brown leather with a hint of fine scotch and you have a fitting description of what The Office looks like.  It manages to make you feel like you are in your own basement having your own private party (with an magnificent mixologist, more on that below).The drinks at The Office are custom made to the tastes of each individual.  Tell the mixologist what you are in the mood for and he will create a alcohol infused potion that will take you there.  Sweet, refreshing, savory, woodsy, campfirey, the list is endless.  I would recommend you read up on your cocktail tasting notes to get the most out of your experience there.  The more color you can add to your cocktail request, the better your end result will be.  The quote of the night when I went with my wife after a drink she described was ""a warm winter cookie that makes you drunk.""Overall, I would highly recommend The Office for everyone to experience.  It is not a place you go to on a weekly basis, however, it is a place you wish you could.pbarot.blogspot.com"
"I'll have another, sir.Can I come back here every day, please?I was so damn impressed by this place and I think that means a lot since I gave the Aviary 3 stars.  The Aviary is where you go to try to be cool and The Office is where you hang when you actually are cool and don't need to flaunt it.  I know that sounds so freaking lame, but that's how it feels. The Office is as my date would say, ""like Grandpa's basement but upscale"".  It literally is in the basement which makes for a dark, cool and  intimate vibe.  You do need a key to get in and out which I understand b/c it is located near the bathrooms so they want to limit random people from walking in but it also requires you to remember the damn key on your way back.  We sat at the bar and chatted with Jason, the bartender and obvious creator of the amazing drinks served there.  I felt fortunate that my date knew Jason and frequents a lot b/c he made us specialty drinks not on the menu.  He simply asked what type of liquor you want, if you dislike specific flavors or herbs and then creates the most delicious cocktail. Ahhh, heaven!There is also a cabinet featuring rare liquor you can't just get anywhere.  We had the Chartreuse which is a french liqueur.  I had never heard of it and found the story of its origin interesting. Jason knows a lot about alcohol and tells a great story aka he doesn't make you feel like an idiot for not knowing.Every employee I met there was extremely professional including Jeremiah (great name, btw) who we chatted with for a bit.I think this place may be hard to get into but I can understand why.Try to go here. It is worth it!  Really great for a date or a small group of people."
"Drinks and the room was amazing but our server was a a huge snob and prices were very steep. The only thing that I thought was pretty unique was she writes your bill with a quill. Now that's talent. Would I return yes but I would't want her to serve me. Also, I think she thought since we were young we didn't have money. I hate people like that who always judge by looks. PROS: ambiance, decor, drinks, the billCONS: Our female server and prices"
"Being at the office and doing a real check-in does kinda mean that I'm better than you. Well, maybe for those two hours only as I'm really not better than anyone. I just want to feel like I am, ha. I'm still kinda in the post-coital glow of having been here after a friend hooked up the reso for here after our trip to next. Now, office was going to lead to a very balla night from me, so I had to make it all count. Naturally I had to hit up one of the cocktails. I got the gin based drink and it really was one of the best cocktails I've had. Period. Was it worth the $20, who's to say. But, I did enjoy the shit out of it and really enjoyed watching the man behind the bar make it (I hate using the term mixologist, but he was also way more than a shitload better than a  ""normal"" bartender). Me being me, my eyes naturally were going to dart to the scotch list. Obviously everything was top notch. I mean, everything in the Office was top notch, so why on earth would I not expect the scotch list to be anything but? So, yes, yes it was a great list and I enjoyed two killer scotches. Granted, they weren't cheap, but yet again, how does one put a price on tasting some of the best in their life? Why will I not say what they were, because I need to keep those for myself and try to get the scotches around town!Simply put, The Office ruled. This is one of those places you need to go if you get the chance. Cheap is not the word to use here, but you don't come to the office to have an affordable night with PBRs and wolfschmidt vodka. You come here to have an amazing experience with killer drinks. You can keep things somewhat more affordable here, but I couldn't allow myself to do that. While my wallet needs a bit of a rest from here, I will return and enjoy the experience again."
I took my boyfriend here on his birthday after drinks at the Aviary. We sat at the bar ( highly recommend) and had the pleasure of learning a bit from Julia the best bartender alive! I am usually a vodka drinker but Julia had me drinking and loving whiskey drinks all night. She asks myself and my boyfriend different questions about what we like to drink and different tastes and then she did her magic. Watching her work was almost as fun as drinking her drinks. Needless to say neither of us wanted to leave. It's a little pricey but so worth every penny! A must for special occasions!!!
"The Office really is a special place. It's a type of place that you won't frequent often, but if you do you better make the most of it. My girlfriend and I had reservations there the other night and were greeted at the front door by the host who asked us if we were ""there for the Aviary...or??"" And with sheer power and excitement I replied - ""THE Office"". The host asked for my name, and having the inkling for the James Bond type of place this was I replied, ""H ... Pat H"" Without hesitation (of course) we were escorted through the Aviary, and down the stairs through what appeared to be just a storage closet. Straight out of the 1950's, this place would be a favorite to the likes of Sammy, Dean, and the rest of the rat pack. We sat down, got our first round of drinks which were tremendous. I got this bourbon drink with ramazotti, banyuls, quinine, and pineapple. The old lady got this tequila drink with grapefruit & horseradish. Interesting combo but she loved it. Next was the beef tartare and you could just tell it was made with high quality beef. The ingredients were all fresh. One of the best we've ever had. Finally we got anther round of drinks and on to the ice cream sundae which was completely over the top in a good way. They first brought out all the toppings which we ate almost all of before they brought out the ice cream.  It was a perfect dessert to end the evening. Overall the office was a phenomenal experience. From the old school atmosphere and vibe, to the drink selection. This is a place that you must try once while you're in Chicago. You'll be in for a James Bond type night like I was."
"We showed up early for our 7:30 reservation was told we needed to wait due to the room being full. Fortunately they set us around one of the tables by the kitchen in the Aviary, and comped us a round of drinks. I very much so appreciate good service and in exchange they were tipped well. About a half hour later we were led to the secret room next to the restrooms.So the downstairs is a very different vibe than the Aviary.  I felt like I should have been wearing a smoking jacket and a monocle.  I like it. They offer you complimentary sparkling water, yay.  After intently studying the menu, I saw ""Homemade Milk Punch"" under Cordials.  This peaked my interest and I found out this was a liquor infused with herbs and milk. The milk curdles, but they strain the curdles away, and you're left with a very thick, syrupy liquor -- thicker and sweeter than a Moscato, and whatever herbs they infuse it with make it taste like you're also smoking a cigar.  Not my cup of tea, but maybe it's yours.I ended up getting the gin cocktail -- passion fruit and frothy egg white is what I remember.  It was supposed to have cocoa nib but I barely tasted that. My palette must not be fancy enough. I still enjoyed my drink but I don't know if it was worth $20.We also shared the ice cream sundae.  Four of us sharing a serving for two was plenty. There was a nice selection of toppings on top of a fancy lazy susan.  Since we had just gorged ourselves at dinner, I think we all felt the need to eat ""healthy"" and polish off the banana slices first.  Our waitress exclaimed that she's never seen that happen before. I think we were a disappointment.Iberico ham and $50 tartare also graced the menu. That's for next time."
"So it's come to this, the first 1 star review. And at a place that others seem to adore - reading these reviews I'm not sure we went to the same place. Disappointing, pretentious, overrated, rude - that's how I would describe The Office.To start they give you a dog and pony show about even getting down there, I get it, it's small & everyone and their mom wants to go there but just be realistic about wait times and everyone will be happier. So when you get your golden ticket and get to go downstairs behind a locked door (seriously, isn't that a fire hazard?) you are given seats in an intimate setting. The decor is nice and what people have said, wood paneling, books, a variety of reproduction paintings. I did appreciate the numerous Matisse painting, he happens to be my favorite. So we were lucky enough to sit at the bar and get served directly by the bartender. No qualms with him personally, he was nice enough and and even shoed away an aggressive male, but he did embody the elitist attitude that The Office seems to be going for. And I'm not opposed to elitism, when you have the good to back it up - The Office does not.  The cocktails. I don't understand the obsession with sugar when making a 'craft cocktail'. Some people, me, don't like a lot of sugar. So when I tell you that I want a drink that is in no way sweet, it still ends up too sugary. I think I'm going to start telling bartenders that I'm a diabetic. The bartender made me a tequila based drink which was ok, but still sweet. Not worth the steep price by any means. As a reference point to explain my taste I mentioned that a vodka martini with blue cheese olives was my go to cocktail. The bartender looked at me with disgust as if I just suggested a cocktail with rubbing alcohol. 'We don't server vodka here' Yeah that's a direct quote, I'm not sure what to do about that. So with this 'craft cocktail' revolution comes an renew interest in egg whites. Now I'm a fan of egg whites, in the morning for breakfast, not sure about them in cocktail. But to each their own, I'm sure some people pretend they like them with booze. What makes my skin crawl is improper handling of eggs by barehanded bartenders. When cooking it is advised to wash your hands after handling raw foods. The bartender cracked an eggs, separated the white then proceeded to make the drink, touching the shaker, liquor bottles, etc. These drinks take a while, I don't think it's too much to ask to add a hand wash after handing raw eggs in there.Let's go back to the locked/ fire hazard door situation. The bathrooms are outside the door so if you need to use them you have to be let back in. We were there late and the doorman was mia and my friend got locked out, not cool.Add in a bar manager who made it his purpose to skirt around and be rude to people. It's a bar's prerogative to limit the use of flash (I think it's to protect all the priceless art reproductions) but you could at least deliver that message in non condescending way. We had another cocktail which was also average and expensive and contained sesame oil. Nothing like putting an overwhelming oil in a drink to mask all the other flavors. Nothing about either drink I had was worth $20.Check arrives and we get grief for wanting it split. Gratuity is already included - for a party of 3. Annoying but I'll roll with it. For the amount of money we spent I would have at least liked people to treat us better -or a toaster to take home with me. I'm ok with spending a lot of money on food and drinks when they are worth it, these are not worth it.Go to the office if you are trying to impress people by showing them how cool you are. The Office is like a steakhouse in downtown Indianapolis - exits for people with expense accounts in town for business and not for the regular population.  It's the fine dining set's equivalent to bottle service. You know you are overpaying but you do it so you can tell your friends about it. Thats just not my scene."
"Who knew that a short trip downstairs from The Aviary would transport you to back in time or to another world where one cocktail is an experience.  Pick a phrase, chat with the bartender about what flavor profiles you enjoy and an inexplicably perfect cocktail will be made.  The seating arrangements are so that you feel you are the only people in the (already small) bar.  Bring someone you enjoy talking with and savor a couple of drinks, share some oysters or foie gras."
"God, I skipped out on dinner with my parents who were in town for 5 days to come here (sorry Mom and Dad). To be fair, I went to dinner with them the previous three nights. I'm probably still a bad person. Oh well. Yes, we got the sundae. I don't even LIKE dessert, but I loaded that little cup/goblet up with ice cream, oreos, candy, cake bits, whipped cream and gummy bears. Am I 10 years old again?In the Aviary, I feel like there's some dissonance. Something doesn't seem to fit. The Office just works, though. The drinks are more straight forward, the decor and music are low key, and the service is possibly the best ever. Our laid back server was the coolest, which made us feel almost too comfortable. No really, I almost fell asleep in a cushy, high-back leather chair."
"This place is trying way too hard to be nyc. BIG SNORE , it was a small room with 5 guys. Ug."
"Oh delicious indulgence.  We finally got in.  I came with a larger group to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect.  Drinks were perfect, though expensive ($20 - we started off ordering off of the menu, then moved to the bartender's recommendations).  The steak tartare was by far the best I've ever had (with an egg yolk on top).  We also ordered the oysters, which came with droppers that held different flavors (smoke, lemon, curry, etc) so that was fun to experiment with.  The BEST part was the sundae bar that came with heath bars, oreos, gummy bears, bananas and more.  Everyone in our party got two scoops of ice cream with hot chocolate sauce on the side and we were free to make our sundae as we pleased.  The service was fantastic and the bar was super comfortable.  My only (tiny) gripe was that we spent $800 and they kind of pushed us out after a while.  I feel like if I'm going to spend that much money, I should be able to relax as long as I please... No matter - I still had an amazing birthday.  Go to celebrate or impress someone, but it's obviously not an everyday place.69/365"
Looking for a dark quiet place with great drinks to take a date? The office is the place! I would say you are going/paying more for the ambiance here though... But they do have a pretty good whiskey /scotch selection.
Trendy and a touch gimmicky?  Why yes.  But don't let that stop you from enjoying this sexy little spot to have some masterfully mixed cocktails that will knock your funky socks off.  Worth every penny.
"Simply put, if you get a chance to go, go. Just. Go.If you have to use the facilities, be sure to grab a key from the doggie butler.The drinks are amazing. I'll be back for the food. This place is seriously one-of-a-kind. Seriously? Beautifully-calligraphed checks stamped closed with a wax emblem? The experience is just perfect to the last detail."
"How did this happen? I'm not a lucky person, stuff NEVER goes my way. One night, after dinner at Boka, a show at the Merle Reskin, and drinks at Aviary I figured what the hell I'll text this number a friend had given me and see what happens. We had two drinks each at Aviary and when I texted the number the guy got right back to me and we were in within minutes. I'm not going to lie, all of the people jealously drilling holes into the back of our heads made me practically squeal with delight. We were taken down to the office and the rest is history. None of the drinks have names but mine had rum and vanilla and it was WONDERFUL! I mean Next and Aviary are elite enough but at least you can make reservations at Aviary and buy tickets for Next. You have to have a specific number to get into The Office. I'm still high on happiness that I even got in. The bf thought I was insane. You text a number and a man asks you if you would like to meet his friend? That's crazy talk right? Jason, the bartender here is amazing and quite the conversationalist. The ambiance? There is no way to describe it. I guess it's exactly what you would want a speakeasy to be. My bf said his man cave will one day look like this place (if his man cave is anything like The Office he'll have to share it with this woman!). They have two corners dedicated to big comfy chairs and couches. One corner is the bar with four stools, and the other corner is a round table. We sat at the bar and it was amazing in a way that words cannot do justice. In order to get to the bathroom you have to take a key with you because the door locks automatically. Gosh, I felt cool. I could have spent my whole night here if I had the wallet for it but alas I didn't so I had my drink, paid for me and the bf, and booked it out of there. I'll be back to spend some more time in the ""man cave"" admiring the art on the walls. It's literally like a museum down there. Oh and did I mention that literally everyone knows your name. A guy I hadn't seen all night bid me good day when I left. This place sure knows how to turn a profit ($20 a cocktail) but it's worth a visit!!!"
"The Office is perhaps the classiest bar in Chicago and a visit here truly makes you feel like a VIP. The Office is Grant Achatz' super secret, invitation only speakeasy located in the basement of The Aviary and Next. The Office seats only 14 to 16 people (three tables for four and a few barstools). The lighting is dark, accented by candlelight and there are no windows. There is plush, comfortable, elegant, classic furniture and decor that makes you feel like you are in the private lounge of a powerful politician or famous mobster. Eclectic music plays in the background and the walls are adorned with oil paintings. The menu at The Office features a page of divine sounding cuisine such as oysters on the half shell, caviar, foie gras and the like. There is also a fancy decadent ice cream sundae available as a dessert. However the food is very pricey and is more for a pre or post dinner snack than a meal. There is also a page listing approximately ten specialty cocktails featuring the finest ingredients and interesting blends of contrasting ingredients that enhance one another. All of the drinks sounded tantalizing. My wife ordered the Cognac which was served with the coolest looking hand carved sphere of ice and a very aromatic vanilla bean sticking out like a straw. The cocktail also included some black pepper to add some heat. I opted for the Tequila based cocktail that was essentially a margarita on steroids. The fine tequila was again mixed with some spice to add a heat component and finished with a fruity aftertaste courtesy of lemon balm. All the cocktails are priced at $20. There are also pages of spirits as well as well over a dozen of the finest craft beers to choose from and a handful of wines. Whereas the upstairs lounge (The Aviary) is all about whimsical concoctions that appear like they were whipped up in a laboratory, The Office is all about taking you back to a forgotten era and serving up the finest classical cocktails. The service at The Office is a high end as the drinks. Our servers (Bri) was with us as often as she was absent and was so interesting and friendly to speak with. Grant Achatz always seems to find the most amazing service staff who have that rare blend of exuding professionalism and polish, yet being totally down to Earth and engaging.  You feel like you are in a really special place, but there is absolutely no stuffiness or awkwardness. The Office is a great retreat from the real world. A special, unique venue where you can forget the stressors of your daily life, relax and feel pampered. A trip to The Office is a true privilege and something to cherish."
"Admitting my respect for Chef Achatz and his creativity from the very first time I heard of Alinea I have to say that for someone who largely does not drink alcohol or (ever) go out to bars my reasons for wanting to visit The Office were mostly to see what it was all about, say I'd been there, and to check out the food menu; I feel no shame in admitting that and neither should anyone else because it is a simple fact of human nature that exclusivity has a direct correlation with desirability and all things being equal The Office is about as 'exclusive' as it gets.Dark and serene with oil paintings dotting the wall and only two servers plus a bartender working the room it was mere moments after entering The Office and plopping down on the softest leather couch I've ever found that we were greeted by our waitress, a cheerful young woman who welcomed us in a style more befitting Alinea than Aviary and presented us with menus for both food and beverages.  Making small talk and apparently informed that we'd dined at Alinea earlier in the evening she informed us that she would be going for the first time on Sunday and inquiring about the menu she appeared as much a ""fan"" as an employee and leaving us to make our decisions I instantly felt much more comfortable in the relaxed confines and low light of The Office than I ever could have upstairs.With menu prices earmarked to fit the experience we spent a few moments debating our choices before our server would arrive and after asking about the portion size of the foie gras I debated the order to which our server mused that if I could eat that after a meal at Alinea she'd place my picture on the wall (a tempting offer that if she had such authority I'd have certainly taken her up on.)  Deciding against such gluttony largely because no one else in the group enjoys foie we instead placed our orders for three drinks and a something equally gluttonous but vastly more sharable.With time moving slow down in the office due to the low light, low noise level, and lack of windows we spent some more time chatting and browsing the works on the wall before our beverages would arrive, my sister again ordering the most punchy of the group in the form of Bourbon, Pecan, Cinnamon, Thyme, Lemon, Sparkling Cider served with a similarly carved ice ball to the drink upstairs.  Intense and spicy with the pecan notes particularly lingering on the finish this would prove to be the sort of drink that benefitted by letting the ice melt just a bit as the flavors better separated out as the alcohol was diluted.Moving next to Nate's selection, the sweet but slightly-too-hopsy-for-my-palate ""Kirsch, Cherry, Thai Long Peppercorn, Flemish Ale"" would prove to be a favorite at the table but at the same time also a confirmation that no matter how good the preparation or ingredients I'm simply not a beer guy.For my choice, the ""Gin, Huckleberry, Averna, Clove, Angostura, Eggwhite, Black Pepper"" would prove to be my favorite drink of the evening with the frothy eggwhite head providing a smooth foil to the black pepper while the admixture of alcohol, berries, and cloves shined beneath with an almost fruit-punch smoothness punctuated by unique herbal tones that I'm guessing derived from the Sicilian Averna.Enjoying our beverages the grand finale of nearly 7 hours of Achatz would arrive in the form of the ""Ice Cream Sundae for two"" modified for three.  Beginning first with the arrival of a nearly twenty-inch diameter crystal Lazy-Susan laden with gummy bears, crushed Oreos and chocolate toffee bars, maraschino cherries, salty peanuts, fresh bananas, and hand whipped cream and subsequently followed by three silver chalices with at least two cups of hand churned vanilla ice cream in each plus a porcelain pitcher of melted milk chocolate the whole experience was quite like being a kid at a sundae shop and just like said children the next half hour was spent with each of us dabbling with the various ingredients to form the ""perfect"" sundae.  With the ice cream dense, smooth, creamy, and intensely vanilla I will simply note that while some may think $37.50 seems expensive I personally found the experience to be every bit worth it for both the quality and the quantity of the ingredients and considering the cost of ""designer"" ice cream these days I actually did not find the cost all that substantial at all.Returning to find our ice cream bowls, the chocolate vessel, bananas, whipped cream, and cherries gone as we picked at the Oreos and Toffee our server noted that she was ""impressed"" (the second time I'd heard this after dessert that night) and asking us if there was anything else we'd like I joked that I was still pretty sure I could handle the foie gras to which she laughed and said she'd get the tab - a hand written bill sealed in wax with tax and tip again included - and with the bill paid we made our way to the door, the hour now just after midnight and all of us with smiles on our faces."
"Yep, this place lives up to the hype. We recently went to The Office for a 30th birthday celebration. There was a group of 7 of us and I don't think anyone had any gripes. The drink menu is fantastic. I tried something from the menu for my first drink, and for subsequent drinks I simply told the server the flavor profile I was looking for and the bartender delivered a delicious concoction. A few others took the same approach and loved their drinks as well.We had some appetizers and the ice cream sundae, too. If there's anything at all negative about this place, the apps were quite expensive. I can't remember the exact prices (cocktails are $20), but I do remember having sticker shock upon seeing them. That said, they were delicious. We ordered oysters and they brought several different liquid flavors (fennel, curry, ginger, etc.) to experiment with by placing small drops on top of the oysters. We also had the beef tartar, which was perfectly seasoned. Finally, we ended with the ice cream sundaes which included an assortment of no less than 7 toppings. I highly recommend taking a trip to The Office and experiencing it for yourself."
"Wonderful place to for a cocktail in an upscale full service lounge. They actually only let a round 15 to people in at a time, so noise levels are perfect and wait staff is able to spend time getting your drink right."
"This place is NO JOKE.  I hadn't even heard of The Office until a friend called with the secret password and got us an 11:45 pm reservation.  Okay, who makes a reservation for such an obscure time at a place that no one knows about?  Someone who knows what's up, that's who.  And I'm glad I didn't question his sanity and went along with the game plan.  Cause it's worth it.  This place is a gem hidden below the Aviary.  Granted there are no windows and it's a little random (you could walk right past it going to the bathroom while at the Aviary and never know it.)  However, they make cocktails come alive there.  First off the ambiance is amazing, warm, cozy comfortable, dark and you can actually hear the people you are talking to!!  Novel, right?  We were seated at a comfortable table and there seemed to be only about 25 other people there (if even.)  Second, our waiter was amazing.  He was kind, nice, pleasant and genuinely ready to make sure we had a great time.  This is the only place you can go and tell your waiter, ""I've got a taste for something light, not super tart and made with gin"" and like McGyver he will return with some concoction you've never heard of in your LIFE that knocks it out of the park.  Granted you pay out the nose for this but whoa it's cool.  Finally, cocktails are crazy-A expensive.  $20 per pop is more than I'm normally willing to drop on a spirti indulgence but it's a cool environment, experience and the food there is also mighty tasty.  So if you're a baller, then you're going here once a week and have a standing reservation and table.  This is your Cheers.  But if you're like me (I do admit to drinking the champagne of beers and loving it from time to time) then this is a great novel experience to have once in a blue moon for after dinner drinks. But the average Joe will go broke trying to get a buzz here."
"Coming to The Office makes me feel fwancy. The chairs are plush and super comfy. The lights are low and romantic. And the drinks are strong. I love the artwork that fills the walls, and the leather bound rustic menu that lists their many premium spirits. I've been to The Office twice now. Both times were fabulous. If you're in a small party and lucky, you'll get seated with fun new people.We'll be back again soon."
"A very cozy place! I would definitely go back! This is a place to hang out with a friend or two ,enjoy the best drinks money can buy,and feel as if you are hidden away from all the hustle and bustle if the big city."
"If you're looking at this Yelp listing, chances are you've already heard about the Office and are looking to go here. You might also wonder how it compares to The Aviary. Well, truth be told they're quite different. The upstairs Aviary is very modern and trendy with a sleek vibe. You'll see a mixture of businessmen, people on dates, and girls on a night out at The Aviary.The Office is a different vibe altogether. It's the kind of place where you could imagine Churchill and his friends discussing strategy. Chill, cozy, and classic. The elegance here is not tacky or stuffy in the slightest and the small (up to 14 person) atmosphere is sublime. I've been here on a date and with a group of my housemates... both times the ambiance worked well. Now, for the drinks. Upstairs the drinks involve super intense liquid nitrogen and rotovap stunts with exotic fruit syrups. Novel, but nothing marvelous. The drinks at the Office, however, are spectacular. I waited until my second visit to write this review just to gauge consistency. Conclusion: best cocktails in the city, perhaps rivaling the best cocktails in NYC.Why? They're very classic: you'll see bourbon, tequila, brandy, etc. as the main drink base and they will be enhanced by infusing notes like pepper, radish, apple, and cigar smoke. The liquors they use in the well drinks easily rival top shelf products elsewhere, and they are very strong. Hand carved ice-balls add an additional element of style and novelty to the refined classic experience inside. All cocktails are $20, but given the quality of the ingredients and the novelty it's easily worth it. Their beer and straight liquor list is also spectacular, but come here for the cocktails. Trust me, they're amazing.The level of service also demands recognition. If none of the drinks on the cocktail menu interest you, the bartender will whip something custom up for you. In fact, it won't necessarily be more expensive than the drinks themselves. Depending on how you got in (i.e. you were invited in from The Aviary vs. you have VIP reservation privileges) there are nice perks involved including being able to get a table on the spot upstairs if you'd like a change of scenery. Sometimes you can even get same day seating at Next (though it's getting harder nowadays).How do you get in? Being a repeat customer at Next or Alinea helps. Perhaps they notice you're a huge foodie when you talk about the drinks at The Aviary. You need an invitation."
"I feel lucky Oh so lucky It's so ducky how lucky I feel And so lucky I can hardly believe The Office is real. La La La La La La La La La Laaaaaa! But it is real. So real, in fact, that I was able to sip, savor and see it with my very own eyes. And you know what? Mama like. As if NEXT and Aviary weren't already fashionably elite enough, we now have another Fulton Market spot to beg and plead our way into. Bring it on, I ain't too proud to beg, nah! Whether you find it in the slight air of exclusivity you can't help but envelop yourself with when entering the Office's secret door, or the hushed but vibrant tones once inside, or perhaps the secret key you'll use to slip in and out at your leisure... there's no doubt you're somewhere quite special. Cloaked in darkness, leather and wall-to-wall art, this is most definitely Aviary's grown up, sophisticated, smoking jacket-wearing Uncle. While Aviary clearly focuses on progressive, futuristic cocktails, The Office throws back with simple ingredients and far less flash. Think: wheat whiskey, kirsch, cognac and rye as your platform. Go ahead and give the Gin and Honeydew cocktail a try for something perfectly refreshing and effervescent this Summer. For your empty belly pleasure, they also feature signature tastes in the form of pure decadence. Expect to see Osetra Caviar, Oysters, Foie Gras and the build-your-own Ice Cream Sundae for 2 on this menu. Awww, cute. A uniquely distinctive experience in its own right, The Office proves why yet again (and again) IloveGrantAchatzandNickKokonasmorethananythinginth­eworld. Amen."
"I too will continue to sing the praises of the cocktail program at the office. The drink I had was smoky and the ice infused with flavor. You definitely feel like a member of an elite secret society when you're partaking in libations in The Office. I'd love to go back over and over again but I might need to win the lottery first so that I can comfortably spend $25/drink and not think about it. Next time I go back (after winning the lottery of course), I'll have to order some food to try it!"
"I forgot about the existence of this place for months until a friend mentioned she had been looking for the number. Luckily, another friend had it and since it was a Tuesday night -- we were able to finish our dinner and walk over, with a table reserved, within 15 minutes. This place is ""exclusive"" but obviously the number circulates -- as we entered, a girl and her companion tried to push their way in but were promptly told they needed to leave by the man who opened the door. I had a bit of a laugh at that. Cocktails are all 20 dollars, then there are lists of beers and other liquors. I had a cocktail made with apple brandy which was strong and quite tasty. After that I tried a strange homemade milk liqueur made with rum and whiskey and burnt milk -- it was actually pretty amazing.Bar snacks are on the more expensive side, but that is to be expected here. This is the perfect place to go after dinner to feel special, get a fancy drink, or impress someone on a first date."
"Came here after getting a few crazy drinks and some little bites at Aviary.  I don't know how you normally get in here, since it's absolutely hidden and super tiny, but we got invited down because I think they needed our table at Aviary for someone else.  This place is AWESOME.  Feels like a little secret speakeasy.  Like everyone else says in their reviews, the cocktails are obscenely good.  The bartender/mixologist/whatever he calls himself is a meticulous crafter of delicious beverages.  I didn't want any of the drinks on the menu, so he asked me what foods I like and don't like and made me a custom cocktail.  Fantastic!We also had some of the iberico ham which comes on a ceramic heated volcano thing, with marcona almonds and some cheese, which was so so good.  Like everyone says, it's not cheaper, but the experience and the quality of food/drink is totally worth it."
"HOLY SHIT. This place is amazing. I never felt classier in my life than at the Office. I had been looking for the phone number for months and finally got it through a friend. I texted the number asking if they had a table available for tonight and they did. We got to the bar and were led through the downstairs into a secret locked room with a couple leather couches and tables.  It only fits about 14 people, so it's extremely exclusive.This is a cozy little speakeasy hidden in the basement of the  Aviary bar. I would imagine Al Capone and some of his friends coming here to discuss things and smoke cigars. I felt like I should have been smoking a cigar and discussing leather bound books by the fire. Another reviewer said you feel like you're in Ron Burgandy's basement. That's exactly true. It's expensive so be prepared to spend some money. They write your bill in calligraphy though. It's amazing. Service was great. They even had cabs waiting for us after we were done. I will be back."
"Have been to the office multiple times for drinks.  Amazing place, great for a small group of friends.  We love to sit at the bar and have conversations with the bartender. I also love picking an alcohol, and having the bartender do something with it!  The staff is amazing, super friendly and accommodating.  Would recommend to anyone who can get an invitation!"
"After getting stuffed up at Next, we got two seats at the bar down in the office.  This was our second time here.  First time, this was one of the most awesome experiences, this time, probably the worst you could have aside from having drinks spilled all over you.  If you are going to ask people to not take pictures, fine.  But if you don't have the decency to tell the table of 6 making noise like they are at a Cubs game, GET A SACK!  Great drinks but awful experience.  I had love this place and to have it ruined ultimately by a bunch of CLOWNS even after asking a few times to have them quiet down.  No staff ever said anything to them.  Save your money for the drinks upstairs at Aviary or any other place."
"I love the whole speakeasy thing. Some of my favorite bars in the world are places where they have a very small set of customers, there are a few folks working, they know their liquor inside out, and they most importantly, make phenomenal drinks.We're lucky to slip in here the following night after having had a great time up at the Aviary the night before. Unlike it's bigger sibling, with it's progressive techniques and modern interpretations of cocktails, the Office brings well crafted old fashioned ones. Classic Amaro, Scotch and Bourbon drinks were to be had, and their fare is known only by the spirit. No fancy names. The space is adorned in very vintage furnishings and art. We took over the far corner area with some large charis and comfy couches, to just lounge in. Michaela took really good care of us the whole night and she made some excellent recommendations. If you can score an invite, definitely make your way down, and have a leisurely,  relaxed imbibing evening."
