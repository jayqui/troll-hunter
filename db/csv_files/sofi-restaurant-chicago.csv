Sofi Restaurant
"Some of the loveliest pasta I've had outside Rome.  Get the cacio e pepe with spaghetti (even better than in Italy -- is that possible?) and don't miss the bolognese.  I don't like meat, but that bolognese is out of this world.Perfect amount of gelato in the affogato (in the US restaurants tend to put way too much).  Warm, intelligent, friendly service and excellent cocktails, too.  A really lovely evening in a darling neighborhood spot."
"Lovely atmosphere and nice staff. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. At the recommendation of the waiter I chose the zuppa Livornese. It was a terrible disappointment.The soup itself was flavorless and uninspired. There was one prawn and one scallop (a 20#), a handful of mussels, a few small clams, and a single portion of baby octopus. I'm not sure why the soup was so bland other than it was woefully underseasoned.  It was an abyssmal disappointment. Maybe another selection would have been a better choice. I would try Sofi again at some point to give them a second choice.Chris"
"Sofi was a beautiful dining experience. Tastefully decorated and very intimate. They could use some soft background music bc at times it was too quiet but none the less, this would be a great date spot or a place to take clients for a nice meal. I ordered the Garganelli pasta special with peas and prosciutto in a cream sauce. Added the summer truffles bc...why not!!?! So good!!!  The bread and olive oil was a delirious start to the meal and kudos to the bartender for a delicious dirty martini with blue cheese olives. I'll be back!"
"I'm always on the lookout for places that offer a decent Cacio e Pepe dish and wanted to cross this place off the list.  We took my brother here for dinner during his last visit a month ago.  I was 40 weeks pregnant and a few days past my due date.  Made reservations and were seated promptly.  It was pretty busy, crowded, and loud.  It took a while for the server to greet us and take our drink orders.  He was pretty no nonsense, skip the small talk kinda guy.  I ordered the Cavatelli Cacio e Pepe while Hubby had a lobster spaghetti dish, and brother tried the Orecchiette with broccoli rapa and sweet and spicy sausage.  The entire meal was so disappointing!  The pasta was overcooked, the lobster meat didn't taste fresh, and the cacio e pepe was the most disappointing of all.  There was barely any flavor or sauce (very little at the bottom of the dish) and too much pasta that wasn't tossed in what sauce was there.  I was thrown off by the pasta since cacio e pepe is usually made with a thin spaghetti.  I felt so bad that we took my brother here.Not sure how this place has an average 4.5 star Yelp rating."
Perfect night for al fresco dining. Terrific roasted beet salad in endive.  My fresh pappardelle with duck ragu was outstanding! Cavateli was light and delicious. Fabulous grilled veges. Professional staff. Reasonable prices.
"I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening (~8pm).  The restaurant wasn't too packed so we were seated immediately (note: I did make reservations as well).Atmosphere: nice and cozy place, good for dates (maybe dessert only?-at least desserts looked tasty).Food - NOT impressed at all!  AppetizersTegamino Polpettine ($10) - veal meatballs in a zesty tomato sauce.  The meatballs tasted ok, but nothing amazing.  I have tried better from potlucks that I have attended.Trofie Genovese ($16)- fresh pasta with pesto and diced potatoes.  The entree was very flavorless so if you like bland food go for it.  It tasted likecooked pasta mixed with watered down pesto sauce..not impressed nor will i pay $16 for pasta like this again.. :/Aragosta Porcini Risotti ($24) - lobster chucks and mushrooms in light fish broth.  I would stay away from ordering this unless you really like the smell of raw fish or something very stinky!! I felt like I was going to gag from the smell and after trying it....ek...I couldn't taste the lobster because something in this entree really smelled horrible!! I am pretty sure that 99% of the people I know will NOT enjoy this.. so this is just a warning...definitely not worth $24!!Ravioli Vitello Pasticciati ($18) - cream sauce and bolognese ragout (this is like meat sauce).  I would say this was the better tasting items of the night...how can you go wrong with meat sauce and ravioli?  It wasn't anything to die for though.  The price was a little overpriced here as well.Customer service - it was ok, we did end up waiting awhile to order and then waiting awhile to get our checks.  The waiter was friendly though.Parking - street parking right across the street (pay at meter), or better idea is the red line (Harrison stop)I don't think I'll be back here... unless maybe it was for dessert or the lobster bisque that I have yet to try.."
"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Space wise its kind of cramp but I wasn't bothered in our small corner. Our server was so sweet, patient, and gave great recommendations. I wish I could remember his name but he had great locks! My only regret is that I was sick so I couldn't taste how good it was, it was good, but imagine if I was not sick! Though the spicy pasta was not spicy at all.... but it was still great.Only thing is that it was Pricey, and my pasta bowl was so small.. but high quality. Also my friend got the tropical salad and she couldn't stop staying how great it was."
This is a great spot for authentic Italian food.  We came in and was seated immediately.  The entire staff was very friendly and attentive.  Food arrived quick and was over the top delicious.  Strongly recommend this place if your visiting Chicago and looking for great Italian food at an amazing price.
"We started with the veal meatballs -the sauce was very tasty, but not too rich.  My husband ordered the Tagliatana - Beef Tenderloin.  The portion size was a good-sized meal for him and he was very happy with his choice.  I had the Paccheri Focaccia with double smoked bacon/sage/garlic/ and creamy touch of tomatoes.  It was a nice sized portion.  I chose the lemon sorbet for dessert- the flavor was quite strong, but it was a good way to end a wonderful meal."
"On our last night of our mini-vakay to Chicago, we wanted a good Italian restaurant. Not one of those that piles huge portions of overcooked pasta on your plate, but something *good*. Sooo glad we made reservations Sofi! The first 15 minutes of our dining experience were marred by the group of six drunk and very loud people sitting right next to us. If I'd been the maitre'd, I would have seated a couple like us in a different section of the small restaurant to begin with, but they did offer to move us a couple times. The group was just finishing their dessert so we opted to stay put. After they left, the rest of the night was perfection. I found the service to be excellent but not overly attentive. The fried artichoke & mozarella appetizer was good, but the lobster linguini with Imperial sauce was to die for. Perfectly al dente pasta, half a Maine lobster and enough sauce to make each mouthful a heavenly experience.We were stuffed by the time our wonderful waiter thrust dessert menus in our hands, so we only ordered the hazelnut gelato to share. But the waiter surprised us with a complimentary order of creme brulee, saying ""Happy anniversary!"" (It was really our honeymoon, but I can see his confusion because we're firmly middle-aged. LOL) My husband happily gobbled the gelato all by himself while I dug into a surprisingly big creme brulee. It was way too much food but you can bet I scraped out every single bit. They were lucky I didn't lick each and every plate!"
"I really enjoy the food here, it's just a bit pricey. I've had pasta dishes both times and been really pleased, especially with the tagliatelle bolognese.  Delicious."
"My dinner was awesome. Staff was great. This is right by the Hotel Blake - you can walk there. The doorman from the hotel, Showtime, recommended I check this place out. I had the duck ragut pappardelle (great flavor); fingerling potatoes (loved the rosemary, garlic and bacon!) and the chocolate soufflé (like a molten lava cake). All that with a glass of wine really warmed me up on a freezing cold night and I slept so well. Dinner for one was about $60. Great spot for a good Italian dinner."
"A quaint, romantic Italian option in the South Loop. I'm not local, so I don't have much to compare it with, yet I can say that the food was on point and service was top shelf.The tuna carpaccio was delicious!"
"Lovely friendly staff, food was good but not great. Nice atmosphere and decor, would be noisy if full to capacity."
The restaurant looks  nice but I've had much better Italian food! I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will not be coming back. I thought because it was highly rated that it would be good but me and my friend were disappointed. And I told my waiter that my food my food wasn't good and he laughed and said he wasn't the chef.
"I want to love this restaurant. It's in my neighborhood, and I enjoy a nice Italian meal. I've been here twice now, and each time I've felt like the food was good but nothing special and the service was curt and unfriendly. The first time we went, I ordered the Ravioli Aragosta (lobster ravioli), which was good but not great. We went again last night because I wanted to give the place another try. I ordered something different-- the Tagliatelle Bolognese, which again was good but didn't blow me away. My fiancé felt the same about his order of the Penne Filanti. What disappoints me most about this restaurant, though, is the service. Each time we've gone, we've had a different waiter, and both acted in the same rushed, curt manner. Meanwhile, however, we noticed that other patrons were treated in a more friendly manner. It seems that most of the clientele here are older. My fiancé and I are in our late 20's, and we can't help but feel like there's some sort of age discrimination going on with us being ignored while meanwhile the waiters joke around and chat with the older patrons. I understand that these people may be regulars, but the staff should recognize that other patrons (such as ourselves) have the potential to become regulars too--if we receive good service.All in all, it's not a bad restaurant, but between the just ok food, unfriendly service, and fairly high prices for pasta, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon, despite the fact that it's nearby."
"This was a pleasant surprise. A friend of mine met me after a rough day at work. We wanted to go somewhere that was nice and sit down. And Sofi was perfect!We had some of their wine selection and while mine was good, her's wasn't, oh well. But we still enjoyed our full glasses. The food we got was the Scallops, which are possibly the softest and the most well cooked ones I've had so far. It was delicious and made sure to eat it slowly to take it in. For the Main she ordered the Risotto and I had the lamb chops. The chops were cooked perfectly, and cut right through with the knife no problem. The Risotto was also done really well and was really filling. I guess the thing I enjoy about Sofi is that they are good at what they do and it's the consistency that I enjoyed. I feel confident in going there again and expecting nothing less that great food."
"I went to Sofi during a business trip, out of the 4.5 stars in Yelp reviews, and I was there without any specific expectations.The menu options were considerably large and all seemed very appealing. It was a hard choice, bur I ended up ordering a chef special: linguine with half a lobster and imperial sauce. Dish presentation was good and amount was just what I wished for. The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, and the sauce was great, creamy with just the right amount of spiciness. The lobster was also quite good, but it didn't feel it was fresh because the meat was somewhat stuck to the shell. However, that was a really minor issue and didn't stop me from greatly enjoying the dish.I took the ricotta cheesecake for dessert. Ii was happy it wasn't one of those excessively sweet cheesecakes. It came lightly warmed, which helped me appreciate the slight saltiness of the cheese mixed with sweetness that makes it a cake. Just my type!The ambience is old style wooden tables and dimmed light, which makes it perfect for a romantic night out. Also, not excessively pricey considering the quality.Overall, I highly recommend Sofi."
"Had a really nice relaxing meal.  Wait staff were friendly. Meal portions were a good size and not overly done. Food was very good, filling and tasty!"
"My wife and I had a lovely time here. I requested a booth on my reservation, but they do not have any. We were seated in a corner which was perfectly acceptable as a substitute. I had a glass of the chianti classico and my wife had the pinot grigio. We both enjoyed then immensely. We ordered the calamari and artichoke appetizers which were both very good. I had the penne filanti and she had the lobster ravioli. Both tasted very fresh and she even said that this was probably one of her new favorite lobster raviolis. Our waitress was very authentic, greeting us in Italian. I broke out the few Italian words I knew and for a moment it was like I was back in Rome. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Our wine glasses were never empty. This place really does capture the spirit of Italy pretty well. The decor, the seating structure, etc. Everything was great and I would be happy to go back."
"We stopped at Sofi after spending the day exploring the lakefront, Grant Park, and the Museum complex.  We were seated promptly with our reservation, although it was not needed as we were very early - 5 pm.  By 6 pm, the place was full.Our meal was all very well prepared and tasty.  The roasted artichoke hearts in a light cheese sauce with a little truffle and oil drizzled over the top was very good. Our favorite of the appetizers was the focaccia with a very mellow cheese melted and topped with prosciutto and baby arugula.  The focaccia was wonderfully thin and crispy on the edges.  It all served to set off the peppery, young, and tender arugula.  We loved it.For our salads, we returned to the arugula, lightly dressed and topped with shaved parmesan.  It must be spring because the arugula was the best ever!My wife enjoyed her Penne Filante, which was creamy and lightly seasoned with fresh basil. I went for the Osso buco with risotto.  The shank was a bit tough, but very tasty.  The sauce has a rich savory beef flavor which paired with the risotto amazingly well. This made the risotto the star of the plate and well worth it.Believe it or not, after this meal, due to our many miles of walking, we were still ready for dessert.  The tiramisu was tasty and not too sweet.  My wife ordered the chocolate soufflé, which took almost 20 mins.  We should have ordered it ahead, but the extra time gave us opportunity for more conversation and anticipation. The soufflé was very good and spilled out a nice dark chocolate ganache, that was not too sweet.Though not as flawless as some reviews suggest, we enjoyed our first visit and will not hesitate to visit again."
"My friend took me here to introduce me to the neighborhood and I was blown away! Absolutely wonderful food at a reasonable price, with great service to boot.I'll definitely be back here often."
"I had the linguine jumbo prawns with imperial sauce last night and it was to die for. Staff was very friendly too, highly recommend coming here."
"Host was very nice. Outside patio was nice initially, but then I kept getting dripped on by some unknown water source. It was not raining. I think the building above had some condensation from something. Waiter was super slow. Quail and octopus were not very good. Server removed food from final bill, so that was appreciated. Won't be back. Disappointed."
"We gad a wonderful time at Sofi, again. Service was great and food very good. Corkage  fee is $18 for byob  which can still save you money and they do half portions of almost all entrees.  So my husband and I had apps, entree, wine and dessert, with great service for $77. We left happy."
"Hubby and I stopped in for an early dinner and ended up staying more than 2 hours. Service was one of the best we ever had - waiter was attentive but not obtrusive. Food was delicious: calamari & shrimp appetizer was crisp and satisfying, lobster roster ravioli was deliciously rich and creamy, and creme brûlée was light enough to be enjoyed after such a big meal. We would certainly return if we were in the south loop for dinner.Side note: on the night we were there, the tasting menu was not offered. Didn't bother me, as I had my eye on other things, but a table next to us was disappointed. Perhaps call ahead if you're looking forward to the tasting."
"While I will agree that Sofi is the perfect romantic one-on-one date spot, a bunch of co-workers and I were looking to have a celebration dinner together on a Wednesday night and they were able to seat 9 of us immediately. The atmosphere was great for an amazing dinner and great conversation. Our server was super attentive and super Italian, which made it really authentic! He also graciously split the bill into separate checks for all of us.The food was simply delicious. I ordered the Ravioli Aragosta (Lobster Ravioli, and I might have misspelled that...) and it was phenomenal. Smaller portions than what I'm used to but the perfect amount. It also allowed me to save up for some gelato! SERIOUSLY, DON'T FORGET DESSERT. Their dessert menu was mouth-watering. I wanted everything on it.A bit pricey, but not too bad for this kind of restaurant. It was honestly all worth it - we had a great time!"
"We had an awesome meal tonight. Everything was great except for the Cornish Hen. It didn't have the flavor I was looking for. Kinda bland. Had to put on pepper and balsamic to have it jump out. But, the pasta, clams, soup, grilled veggies, and the service was wonderful."
"Authentic Italian! Wine is great, the food is better. Our waiter Roberto made the experience even better. Thumbs up. Next time I come back to Chicago its a definite must go."
"What a total gem in the south loop area! We were craving Italian food and Sofi restaurant came up with high reviews, made a same day reservation for 2 and here we come.What we ordered: -Baby arugula salad with chopped parmesan(Surprisingly plain but really refreshing)-Carciofi Fonduta. Artichoke with melted cheese and truffle flakes (amazing dish with wowing flavor, recommend to truffle lovers)- Penne with prawns in pink vodka sauce (generous prawn portions and excellent flavor of sauce with chewy penne, perfection)- zuppa livornese. Fish broth seafood mix bowl. Outstanding flavor, not too salty like the most I've ever tried, rich seafood flavor and you could really empty the whole thing.- panna cotta in caramello. The best panna cotta I've had ever, honestly I haven't tried many because they were usually soso, but this one made me tear up in joy. Rich flavor with silky texture and perfect choice of sauce and fruits. Good for: romantic date night. Sophisticated Italian tongue. Foodie. Cons but not really a down side: the portion is relatively small as opposed to your usual Italian family style size.  We will be back in 2 weeks! It's my favorite Italian restaurant now."
"The place is very romantic. The two of us had dinner here on Saturday night, I thought the food was excellent, started w the mussels & she had a grilled vegetable plate with balsamic vinergrate which she enjoyed. The mussels were excellent as well, loved the red sauce they came in. The bread was fresh but not warm. I had a pasta dish w broccoli & spinach in a white sauce with sausage chunks, yum. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the waitress. She is a young lady from Rome, the authenticity was nice but there was a little language barrier. We Asked about one wine, she suggested another & we said ok bring 2 glasses of that then she still brought what we had asked about prior. She also brought the wrong check. Little things but those make the difference between 4 stars & 5."
Service was exemplary thanks to manager David and server Renee. Food was top notch. Highly recommended. Would definitely eat here again. No question.
"Amazing food, perfectly attentive service. The atmosphere of Sophie's is exactly what one would expect from a Chicago Italian restaurant. Our trip to the city is a quick one, and our choice to dine here was a last minute one but it made the evening well worth it. Perfect portions. My husband had the penne and the fresh tomato flavor was obvious. I had the gnocchi. Typically gnocchi can be heavy and super rich but this was one of the best balanced gnocchi dishes I've had. The real star of our meal however was, hands down, the artichokes in Fontina fondue. AMAZING!!!!"
"Tucked away in the middle of a downtown block of urban filler, Sofi offers diners a new and cozy spot for Italian ambiance. Word has it that the menu is that of northern Italy. I don't know about that but I loved the dish I ordered. The 45-minute wait for it was downplayed by the excellent white wine we sipped and unique salad, Arugula with thinly sliced Parmesan so robust that a small shaving seemed like an entire mouthful. And I felt so healthy eating that salad!The entrees arrived and it was as though a Monet' had been set before me! A beautifully adorned Cornish game hen glowed with shades of amber and sienna! It was huge. I've cooked many a Cornish game hen using a Dutch oven with charcoal on top to brown it but this was strikingly awesome. And then I forked out a dose of what I would now call poultry heaven. It was succulent and savory with sage and sauce so special you couldn't read this sentence without drooling. And did I say it was huge? When I moved on from the dark meat to the breast I suddenly regained more appetite. It was perfect.Our waiter, Roberto, was a classic, looking like he might have done a bit part in the Godfather. And he was so likable I wanted to get his email address and friend him on FB!All in all, you need to do this place if you make it to downtown Chicago!"
I got the mediteranian seafood risotto - rise and clams cooked seperately coming thru as rise putting with clams.... Probably not core to their repertoire. It is a nice place - risotto not.
Authentic food. But not as good as I expected. Little bit Overpriced. Very good service.
"Kind of a small place, recommended as I was staying right up the street and I wanted good food and a glass of wine.  I got what I was looking for.My server was very attentive - maybe a little too much at first, but that's forgivable.  I'd rather it be this than to be ignored.  Food was also delicious.  I started with my soup and had some type of short rib (forgive me I can not find the site online to see the exact dish) which was so filling I had to take it home (it was delicious the following morning).  However, not so filling that I cold resist ordering tiramisu for dessert.I wish I had reason to come to back to Chicago soon as if I was in the area I would easily return to try something else from their menu."
"I was very impressed with the intimate atmosphere and attentive service at this restaurant. However, the food here was kind of average in my opinion. I ordered a mixed seafood pasta and sautéed spinach. The pasta itself was very flavorful while the seafood  didn't taste too fresh (But maybe it's because I'm from California and I have a high standard for fresh seafood). The sautéed spinach was too salty for me. I would give 3.5 stars if I can, I'll just round up for the nice service."
"Small, intimate restaurant with a family feel. Plenty of parking via the parking lot across the street or on the street, but the parking prices are ridiculous. I stopped in to enjoy a couple glasses of sangiovese, ravioli aragosta, asparagus, and I went there and ended everything with a slice of apple pie and a scoop of ice cream :)The food was absolutely delicious, the waiter (Francesco) was tentative and friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect for you and a date. Overall, I'd say it's a nice place to enjoy authentic italian."
"The food was delicious (I got the lobster ravioli and my SO got the lamb). You can tell they put a lot of love into their dishes. The waitress was friendly and attentive as well. I took off one star for the small size of the portions, but I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."
"Wonderful atmosphere, wait staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. Huge menu, everything was so delicious. Definitely plan on going back - it was a great treat."
Ok. Waiter was the bomb. Awesome food and excellent desserts. Drinks were spot on and service could not have been better timed. Thanks Robert for the excellent evening meal!!!! I am eating here next time I am in Chicago.
"What a gem! Great service, atmosphere & food. Took a short walk from the Palmer House Hotel on a rainy Saturday night at 7:30pm and was able to be seated immediately.  Shared a Cariofi Fonduta ($12) artichoke appetizer, then Cavatelli ($16) and a Risotto Aragosta Porcini ($24).  The risotto was the bomb with lots of tender lobster chunks.  The other two dishes were good but I'd have liked a stronger truffle flavor, since that was why we picked them.  For dessert: a scrumptious creme brulee ($8).  As noted in another review, the portions were appropriately sized so you can enjoy several courses and not be stuffed. Two glasses of Moscato ($10@) and Chardonnay ($9@) brought the total bill to $108 without tip-- pricey but this was the best meal of our 4-day stay in Chicago."
Our pasta came out very undercooked on 2/3 dishes... The sauce was very good though. Asked for a dessert for a birthday and it never came : ( waitress was very nice- unimpressed by management! Thumbs down wouldn't go back
I have to say the spinach tortellini was divine! The staff was super nice and attentive. They helped me pick a fabulous wine to accompany my dish.They had great ambiance with good music and it would have been romantic if I wasn't eating all alone! I will be back!
"This is the best restaurant in the South Loop, hands down. I was leaning towards 5 stars but the space is a bit cramped and maybe it's just a bit too pricey but this may be the best Northern Italian food in the city.Today there are few places in Chicago that can deliver this style of delicious and simple food. Dishes like rabbit stew with risotto and grilled vegetables with balsamic reduction, a great meat and fish selection, a large variety of reasonably priced pastas, and an excellent a selection of moderately priced wines.To me the city's standard bearers for great Northern Italian fare are places like Coco Pazzo and Piccolo Sogno.  I actually think that Sofi is delivering better food but the dining areas are a bit hit or miss depending on where you get seated.The service is top notch - very knowledgable about the food and wine and attentive in a polished and trained manner.  You may walk away thinking you have paid a bit much for a neighborhood Italian place, but in reality it is one of the best meals of this kind you can have in Chicago.If you live South Loop area and want an exceptional meal in an intimate space, pay up and enjoy what you won't find elsewhere in the city.  If you want to go out for a big date night - Coco Pazzo in winter and Piccolo Sogno in summer.  If you are in the Wicker Park area try Nando Milano Trattoria.Buona Sera!"
"This place is hit or miss.My dinner mates had the prix fixe. I had the Cavatelli Cacio e Pepe, which was extremely overcooked, mushy and didn't have much flavor.  My dining mates had the grilled lamb chops and sausage and broccoli rapa. He was very pleased with his meal. Also the desserts were excellent. My other companion had the short rib with polenta which was good and flavorful. The meatballs were ok, small but kind of tough.  I think the Tiramisu was the best thing about the restaurant experience. The service was nice and attentive and had a nice ambiance.   I was unimpressed and wish it was better. I had eaten here before and had a strong meal, but the pasta should be perfect and just was disappointing."
"Good food, great service, lovely, cozy environment!  Really enjoyed the pasta dishes that we had, topped with a yummy dessert. Really an overall great experience!"
"I've been to Sofi three times now and they've yet to disappoint! I always order the Penne Filanti which has been excellent every time. I have also tried the asparagus which was great as well, it tasted very fresh. Oh and the bread they bring you is SO good. Sofi has been an awesome addition to the barren wasteland of awful restaurants that is the South Loop (not all of them but the majority of them) and I would suggest everyone try this place!"
"Sofi is such a delight! Delicious food combined with excellent staff, it couldn't be better!"
"The best thing about this restaurant is its atmosphere; a lot of Italian places end up feeling kind of dark and stuffy, even the nice ones, but this one has a lot of natural light and is generally really pleasant; I would definitely come for an early date -- it looks upscale and the food is going to work for almost anyone (can't vouch for vegans, gluton, etc). I came with a large group, (~10 people), and got to try a lot of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts -- without overwhelming the details my short story food wise was that it was solid but not special. For the entrees especially I really enjoyed the first couple of bites for almost everything but then got bored after that."
"If you're looking for romance, this is the spot!   This place just has that warm, family feel, and by far the best service than any other restaurant.  Food is good and above average for its authenticity considering true authentic Italian food is simply hard to find anymore.   5 stars hands down!"
The sea bass with articulate was wonderful!  Waiter was helpful in suggesting menu items. . Quaint and relaxing!
"Mediocre food. Seafood didn't taste fresh and some of the bread was cold, while pasta with duck ragout was fine but not great. At least the service was good, as was the Montepulciano by the glass."
"Good food, great dessert!Came here on a Monday night. It had some people but was not packed. It seems like a pretty authentic restaurant. The décor of the place is nice and clean. Most people were dressed pretty casually. Tried the house wine, which was good. We had the prosciutto melon as an appetizer. It was really good, I would never have thought of combining those two. And for my meal I had the Ravioli Aragosta, which was pretty good. But if I were to go back I would order something else. I highly recommend the Tiramisu for dessert. The service was great, very friendly. Parking on a Monday night wasn't bad, we were able to get street parking. But I could see that area being difficult on busier nights like Friday or Saturday."
"Went here for a birthday dinner with a friend, and it wad delicious! The spinach ricotta ravioli was really good and the staff brought a free tiramisu because we mentioned it was my friend's birthday. The atmosphere is very cozy, and the owner made a point to come to our table and say hello, which was very sweet."
"The good news is that Sofi has improved immensely since their opening when it was a little rocky. There were four of us, and all our dishes were good or excellent. The two salads were pronounced ""excellent"" - one the greens with parmesan and the other a beautiful beet salad - only quibble here was that the endive was a bit brown around the edges. My lobster bisque was nice, not too heavy and with a fair amount on lobster bits, a companion had the lentil soup which also got a thumbs up. The entrees were a mixed bag, the risotto nero was found to be over salted, but the tripe was a big hit. Two of us had the pappardelle  with wild boar ragu. The sauce for delicious, but the pasta was overcooked, resulting in a gooey mass - tasty, but gooey. It tasted homemade, and that particular pasta cooks in what seems like seconds, requiring a deft hand. Someone missed the boat. Desserts, a ricotta cheesecake and the Panna Cotta both had good flavor and were attractively presented. The Panna Cotta had a fair amount too much gelatin, when done right  it should quiver and offer no resistance, this one was half way to jello. But, all in all we left happy and full.They lost a star for the service. Maybe it was an off night since others brag about it, but we found our waiter to be aloof and unattentive. Long gaps in the service, and never came around to ask if we were enjoying our meals. We went through our bottle of wine during the first courses and were thinking of ordering a second and probably would have if anyone had noticed and come by to ask, but no one did and so we just let it go - they lost the sale of a bottle of wine. Bottom line? A good option in an area without many such places, and this has a good shot at being a neighborhood joint. The menu is huge, and based on our experience of a few small issues with our dishes, perhaps too big, and fewer options might allow greater attention to everything served."
"Me and the misses were on a mission to find some good Italian food. All searches pointed here. Loved the ratings and the images got me even more excited. We parked across the street and walked in and was greeted by the hostess and quickly seated. The waiter arrived and helped explained many of the dishes. I inquired about a few dishes. I made it clear that neither one of us eat pork for personal reasons. I decided to order the veil and he quickly told me that the sauce was made with pork. I tried ordering a few more dishes from, chicken to beef and ravioli and all somehow had pork infused in the dish. This was very disheartening because I'm not the only one who doesn't eat pork, and many people would not know by just looking at the menu. I really appreciated the waiters honesty. So still on my mission for good Italian food I asked what he recommended for me that did not have pork. He informed me of a dish with duck and the other was a cheesy ravioli which was homemade and full of interesting flavors. Sad enough the dishes arrived and are very small on the portion sizes but we was hungry and I dug in. The duck had bits of flavor here and there but barely enough to make me want to keep going. I tried my wife's ravioli and it was even more bland. It was a really disappointing experience. Some might say it is because I didn't eat the pork but I still ordered and attempted to like the food. But in all honestly flavor was lacking for me. I called over the waiter and lied about something had come up and we had to leave. He bagged our food sensing their was something wrong but not sure. I tipped the waiter because he was honest and helpful but as far as the food it was too bland for me. I enjoy foods because of their different and unique flavors, having no flavor at all is just not for me."
"Sofi is a little neighborhood spot that delivers big!  The service is amazing, they make us feel like celebrities.  The food is always cooked perfectly.  We live nearby and bring friends and family, everyone loves it."
"So, a good addition to the neighborhood, but not an outstanding addition. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but couldn't quite justify 4 stars. Here's my breakdown, because it could easily move up, in my book:Appetizer (grilled baby octopus) - 4 starsServer (David) -- 4 starsMain Courses -- 3 starsValue for the money -- 3 starsAmbiance -- 2 stars (and the two tables with screeching children did not help....sound dampening features in ceiling tiles or curtains would help greatly)So...could potentially move up to 4 stars, but for now, not quite there. I will probably return, but will not become a regular."
"Get the bolognese. No really, do it. I'm not even a person who ever goes for bolognese... I've probably never ordered it in my life; it always just seemed so boring and.. meaty. But on a recommendation, our table ordered it, and it is out of this world. I've ordered it every time since. This place is so authentic and you feel like you're transported to Italy. I know I'm pushing the bolognese hard, but I've tried a number of dishes here and everything has been delicious. This place is a hidden gem in the South Loop. Not actually physically hidden, just feel like no one knows about it!"
"Everything was absolutely delicious! I didn't leave a morsel in my plate, including dessert!"
First try at using YELP and chose this restaurant. Great choice. 14 of us descended on this place with about 5 minutes notice. We sat outside as it was a beautiful night. The food was outstanding. I had the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. Not one complaint on the food from any of the 14. The service was excellent.  If you are going with a big group and want to sit inside I suggest reservations and being flexible to splitting the group up
Just finished dinner with my bride of 30 years and have to say it was excellent. Veal carpaccio and mussel apps were wonderful. Entrees of lobster ravioli and shorts ribs outstanding. Highly recommended.
"I'm surprised this place is getting great reviews. I've been there twice. First time was 1/2/14. The place was empty of course due to horrible weather and the date. Hadn't seen my friend in a long time and wanted to visit. The server was intrusive and rushed us. Um there was no one there. The server vehemently recommends the rabbit. I love rabbit. It was extremely salty. I should've sent it back but I was so busy visiting with my friend I didn't think of it. The split pea soup with grilled sausage was amazing though.The second time I go, I'm in a party of three. The place is empty. Maybe 8 tables are filled. No Host at the door, a server asks us if we have reservations. My party and I are like ""are you kidding me?"" They squeeze us in (sarcasm).Service is bad. We have to flag our server down for food and for drinks. Server was a very nice Italian man btw. He blames the kitchen. There are two servers managing the 8 tables. Seems doable from my perspective. The beet salad was really good and served artfully.I'll be back because I live on Printers Row. Although Sofi's takes itself way too seriously for the neighborhood. They'll have to make some changes to last."
"So despite not having a great experience the first time around, the hubs and I decided to give it another go because 1) we live right by there 2) yelpers seem to love it and 3) they were offering 10% off your bill for residents in my building for the month.Have to admit- much better this time around! I ordered bolognese and it was quite tasty. The pasta tasted homemade and the sauce had a ton of flavor. The hubs ordered tortellini. Not really my thing but he liked it. Also I did notice they replaced the powdered Parmesan with shredded. Definitely a step above the powdered stuff but I still feel like if you're going to set it out as part of the meal, you have to offer the fresh stuff.On the down side, it is a bit pricey for the blah ambiance and the service is kind of off putting. The guy was rather pushy about us not ordering any starters or desserts and then when we told him about the discount from our building, he seemed annoyed. This was validated when he came back with the corrected bill and slammed it in front of us and said something to the tune of ""there"". No thank you or anything. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouth since as I mentioned before it was really what got us to come there in the first place.  To sum it up, I think we'll be back but it will likely be out of convenience."
"Very underwhelmed with this place. Went there with my family and was expecting it to be good.There were four of us and we all got a different pasta dish to share and try.Two issues:The food was marginal, at best. We all agreed that of the four dishes, most were bland.Secondly, the portions sizes were ridiculously small on all the dishes.  Hard to believe that a restaurant that services the Chicagoland area will survive giving such small portions.  We all left hungry and unsatisfied.Do yourself a favor and go to a different Italian restaurant then Sofi."
"This place was sooo delicious! We ordered the mussels for starters and they were so flavorful and perfectly cooked! I would even go as far as to say they were the best mussels I've ever had. For our main courses, we ordered the Rigatoni  Contadina and Aragosta Porcini and both were really really well cooked! The restaurant was really small, so I'd suggest making reservations. The service was great and the ambiance with very homey and intimate. I have nothing but good things to say about the food and service."
"""Buonasera!"" This place is lovely! Everyone was so nice and the food is delicious! We had the ""Carciofi Fonduta--artichoke mold with fontina fondue and truffle carpaccio"" to start, and if you like artichokes you'll love this! For main courses, my Mom ordered the special 'Risotti' that had seafood - SO SO GOOD! My course was the ""Gamberi Capesante--sea scallops and prawns skewer, braised leeks"" I was a little disappointed in the size of the scallops...especially for $24. Honestly seemed more like an appetizer.For dessert, crepe with nutella, which of course was amazing. I would definitely go back for any of the 'Risotti' dishes or a 'Paste' dish. Definitely a great addition to Printer's Row!"
"Rigatoni was excellent as was the Branzino. Great wines, quiet atmosphere, very Tuscan."
"Everything was great.  We had the grilled octopus, and burrata.  The burrata was to die for!  We split the short ribs and a half order of the Bolognese.  Everything was fantastic including the service.  The wine was also very good."
"Had a great experience here. Made reservations, and arrived about 10 minutes early. While we waited for our table, we received complimentary glasses of wine. Our service was great and the food was excellent. Would recommend to others and I'll be going back for more."
"This small, local restaurant is amazing. I have been here several times with my two year old and the staff make it a point to accommodate her every time. She loves the bolognese with tagliatelle. The pappardelle with duck ragu is fantastic. They have a robust selection of wine, also."
"Great Italian food, great service.. All you need to order is Zuppa Livornese.. outstanding.. great flavor, good mix of seafood. This place needs to more respect as this one of the best Italian you had in a while."
"A perfect evening with foodie friends.  Our italian speaking server was spot on.  He was attentive and his timing was perfect throughout the evening.   The atmosphere was lively and intimate.  Most importantly our meals, veal shank, squash ravioli and veal chop were all perfectly done and delicious.  Sofi's has an interesting selection on it's regular menu and several daily specials, so plenty to chose from.I will definitely be going back many times over and bringing friends.  I perfect place."
"Great Italian food at a reasonable price. Yes, the portions are not as large as some other Italian restaurants, but I left feeling full and guilt free because I didn't have to box up an unfinished meal that I knew I would never touch again.$18 corkage fee could be lower."
"I am SO GLAD this is in Printer's Row. Sofi is by far your best choice in the neighborhood, but exceptional food, a charming atmosphere, and friendly staff make it worth the trip from anywhere in the city."
"Service was good, food on the average side, good olive oil expensive average tasting wine"
"We went with some friends last Saturday night.  We were there when it first opened and were not impressed with the food or service so we decided it was time to try it again.  Our server was very helpful with suggestions.  I had the beet salad for my appetizer.  The salad was very good but some of the endive that came with it had brown edges so quality control was lacking there.  I had the wild boar pasta for my main dish.  It was very good and I had the rest of it for lunch today and enjoyed it again.  The food was better, but service was lacking.  While our server was very nice he also liked to spend time by the bar checking his cellphone.  He probably didn't think we could see him do this from our table but we could.   He totally missed the chance to sell us another bottle of wine.  I would go back but I don't think it will make our regular restaurant list."
"Excellent food, and great service. If you are looking for true traditionnal italian food, this is THE place. Highly recommended"
