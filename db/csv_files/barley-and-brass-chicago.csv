Barley & Brass
"We had friends staying in the neighborhood and decided to check out Barley & Brass on Division - What a great find!The outdoor seating looks great but there wasn't space for our party of 6.  Still sitting indoors, with the front of the bar/restaurant completely open was very nice.  The atmosphere is pleasant with a bar/bistro feel.  No issue with noise when we were there on a Saturday night.The drinks menu is very creative and we sampled a wide variety of custom-crafted cocktails including ones with smoking herbs, added malic acid and spice.  We enjoyed a variety of appetizers including mussels, fried squash blossoms and the beer/cheese with pretzel sticks.  All good restaurant or bar food fare depending on your mood.The main courses were equally as good.  The burger, vegetarian pasta, risotto, bone marrow and fish (none together!) were enjoyed by all of us.  The side of fried giandinera was an awesome accompaniment to my burger.Our only disappointment was that there was only 1 dessert choice (albeit tasty) and no espresso drinks.  Perhaps it's more bar than restaurant but it wouldn't take too much to give diners a couple of options and add a caffeine machine for after dinner.Very good find and we can't wait to go back."
"Yes, I definitely need to come back! Originally, we had wanted to go to a divey bar, but then we thought, no, let's go classy! Well, Barley & Brass is classy yet casual.The patio seating is awesome. Although Division Street isn't the prettiest to look at during the night, it's definitely nice to sit outside in the night.I ordered the Lion Stout - so good. I like dark beers, and especially beers that taste more like coffee, so this was perfect. It tasted like coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Also, there were two beagles a few tables over. I love beagles. I got to pet both of them. Day was made. I hope the beagles go for a drink while you are there too, so you can also enjoy the beagles."
"Barles & Brass brings a sense of class back to Division street with well thought out cocktails, and a focused menu that was lost when SmallBar left the street.Despite a few TV's, this is not a sports bar.With a small, Chef Driven menu, B&B provides some pretty delicious options. With that said, they recently took the Nachos off the menu, which were probably the best Nachos I've ever had, anywhere.That head scratcher of a subtraction won't deter my presence at the bar, they have plenty of other terrific options. The service is wonderful, and the drinks follow suit. Barley & Brass will be welcomed with open arms by the neighborhood as an escape from debauchery down the street."
"A friend and I went here for Yelp Burger Week which allows you to check in and receive a $5 burger- totally worth it so check it out...and do it here. The service was excellent and they have a really cute outdoor seating area with great overhead lights and landscaping. Despite the fact that we were splitting one $5 burger for the two person table we were occupying, we were well treated, brought water frequently, and our bill was taken care of quickly.The food: The B&B burger was the Yelp Burger Week burger that was provided for $5 and it was delicious. The burger itself was probably lacking the most flavor out of anything, but the other ingredients made up for it. The bacon was perfectly cooked and added a sweetness. The truffle aioli was not too rich and was more of a mayonnaise. The bun was perfectly toasted. As a side we had the salad with their very unique curry dressing. This sounded gross to me at first but it was delicious, if you like peanut sauce you'll love this!Overall, great Summer spot, not the best burger I've ever had but for sure worth trying and great service!"
New menu and new chef! Small plates and charcuterie as well as some outstanding entrees.  As always the cocktail s are some of the best in the city.  We'll be back soon.
"A group of 5 of us were able to walk right in and get a table at 8 pm on a Saturday night, which is probably the biggest plus. We had tried Fatpour next door, but the line was out the door since Wisconsin was playing in the Final Four. We were seated quickly and immediately brought water, which we desperately needed because we were sort of between rounds of drinking. The place has a dark, old timey vibe to it, but it's still pretty upbeat. To drink: the guys ordered dirty vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives... And hated them. I can't really speak for them because martinis aren't my thing and I didn't try theirs, but their description of them didn't make me want to. I had the In the Air Tonight, which is a gin and blueberry concoction garnished with flaming rosemary. The drink wasn't very strong but it was tasty and the rosemary, though unnecessary, was a novel touch.To eat: I ordered the brussels salad with chicken. My friend got it with salmon; I was jealous and mad at myself for not doing the same. The salad was good and proof that brussels sprouts are also good cold and crunchy!Guys got jerk chicken sandwiches which weren't like any jerk chicken sandwich I've had. They weren't very spicy and it was more of a chicken salad sandwich, but it was okay. The sweet potato fries and poutine were spot on as well. Get a side of pickled veggies in a jar! Probably not worth 4 bucks, but still good.Service was great. Will definitely return."
"Unlike its' predecessors F.A.M.E. and Paradise Cantina, B&B is not a complete and utter failure. In fact, it's a solid, upscale bar that I hope has some staying power in a neighborhood full of crowded nightlife. The bar program is excellent! Since my experience at Tippling Hall, I've jumped on the draft cocktail bandwagon - B&B kills it. The Bitter Fizz and In the Air Tonight are two of the greatest craft cocktails I've ever had. Beer list is no slouch, either. During our last visit, we also sampled some food. The arancini balls are the friggin' bomb. Better than most Italian restaurants! Will definitely be back for these. The wings weren't too shabby, either. Unfortunately, the poutine fell flat on its' face. Not enough topping and WAY too small of a portion size. The bartenders are great - quick, efficient, friendly, and make the drink properly every time. And props on your ability to vaporize rosemary! The bus staff is still a bit giddy and inexperienced, as they cleared our food while we were at the bar ordering more drinks/taking shots before we were even close to finishing it. Evidently, a little too eager to be done with their shifts at 2 a.m. ... B&B is a welcome addition to the 2000 block of W. Division St.! Especially when the brotastic douchebags invade Fatpour at 10 p.m. on weekends."
"We finally visited Barley & Brass last night, which opened within the past few months. We were immediately greeted upon entering and our waiter gave us a pick of sitting anywhere. We insisted on sitting where was most convenient for them and we got placed in a booth table toward the back. The ambiance is really cozy, a little rustic hipster, and romantic. I'm a big fan of the candle at each table! I ordered the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries (you can choose between fries, sweet potato fries, or chips as a side with all sandwiches). The grilled cheese was really unique with seasoned roasted grapes, brie, basil, thyme, and apple wood smoked bacon. I had the bacon on the side because I don't (really) eat meat, but I did sneak a taste and it tasted like your everyday bacon. Of course, I'm no meat expert by any means! I was a fan of my grilled cheese and sweet potato fries; the flavors all worked really well together. My boyfriend got a beer flight ($12) and wasn't a big fan of any of the three beers. I thought the one infused with green tea was pretty unique and good, though. The only thing keeping this from a five-star review is that service was kind of slow. It wasn't very busy on a Sunday night and it took a while for our server to take note that our water jug was empty. At the end of our meal, it also took a long time for our cards to be processed. My friend paid by cash and our waitress never came back to give change, so she just left all her cash on the table. Many of the staff were chatting at the bar as we left and were very friendly in saying goodbye/come again. Overall, I would call the service very courteous and warm, but not particularly attentive.We will ABSOLUTELY be back because there's no way we can pass up sweet potato fries for $4 and a pretty darn rockin' late night menu. Welcome to Wicker Park/Uke Village, Barley & Brass! I'm personally really excited about this new lounge and I expect it to be successful in drawing people in with its great menu, drink menu, and ambiance.Random note: SUPER cool gender neutral bathroom sign that says ""whichever."" Love it!"
"Very pleasant surprise - not your average gastropub. Fantastic craft beer list (especially if you're into dark beer) and interesting cocktails (i.e. In the Air Tonight). Arancini are a must - great blend of Italian/Mexican flavors & if the filling wasn't already delicious, the sauces bring it up another levelBarley & Brass main - phenomenal! Hearty, flavorful, and love the risotto approach to barleyWild Salmon Reuben - skip. ""Seared and smoked"" sounds intriguing but it's just smoked salmon. Save the idea for making at home, the ingredients did not shine through.Housemade Pickled Veggies- skip, too much vinegar.Another plus: beer is offered in flights."
"Solid burgers, amazing craft drinks. The ambience is rugged and woodsy; the decor is awesome and makes you want a neat bourbon or scotch. The burger was melt in your mouth good. There will definitely be enough for you to take home. Service was great. If you can't grab a bite here, definitely go for drinks with friends or your significant others"
"I don't want to discredit the rest of this place by making first mention of the awesome music, but it's like they hacked into Spotify and stole my favorite setlists! If your taste in tunes is as good as this guy's then you'll be super happy. If not, it doesn't matter, you'll still love it anyways. The beverage program is up to Sea Bass satisfaction on the account of having a dedicated section of the menu to the Dumb and Dumber character's favorite drink. Even though only with one other person I was so tempted to quote ""Make it 4 Boilermakers"" when our waitress took our order. They also do keg cocktails and some special spins on old classics like their Gin and Tonic and the Ukrainian Smash. With house-made mixers they're super refreshing and definitely a different (but excellent) drinking experience. Fair warning that there's not much of a beer list, but at $4 a can you can't really complain since cocktails are kinda their bread and butter. The food is so solid with an eclectic mix of comfort bar bites. Try the chicken lollis, tacos, crab wontons, and kafta sliders, but the absolute don't misses are the arancini (basically fried risotto balls) and the best poutine I've had outside of Canada. There's also sandwiches and salads if you're not a sharer, but regardless of how you go you sure won't be sorry. Overall I wasn't surprised how much I loved this concept. What else would you expect from the guys behind 25 Degrees?"
"Good food, good booze, meticulously clean, superb service in a romantic comfy venue (with an edge from skull wallpaper) and a lighting that makes everyone look gorgeous.  The most organized service in a private party.  The only cocktail bar in Chicago that practices ""fresh plate"" (a fine dining feature).  La di daBASIL JALAPENO COBBLER -- the chili kick is felt at the back of throat that leaves your taste buds sipping for more.NOT A BASIC BITCH -- the lightest drink, fruity, like sangria.GIN FIZZ -- what a girlie drink.  Coral pink.NEW FASHIONED -- a wonderful twist to OLD FASHIONED.  A strong boozy drink.  Must like whiskey to appreciate it.  Best value for $$.FALL DARK & STORMY -- palette shutdown.  :-DCHIPS -- thinly sliced, perfectly fried, and nice presentation.CHICKEN WINGS -- delicious.  Hot and Spicy.  Easy to consume and enjoy.  Addictive.CRAB WONTON -- original.  Tasty."
The drinks were lovely - I had the New Fashioned which was quite strong but good!  The Gin Fiz - and while not a gin lover it was really good and a little earthy tasting but my favorite was the Not a Basic Bitch.  I really like the idea of the tap cocktails and the service was fantastic!  I honestly haven't had better service in quite some time at a bar.Didn't try the food but the menu looked interesting. It was a cold lightly snowy evening when I went and the bar was warm and inviting which led to my loving it even more!
"What a great upgrade! This place use to be the bar FAME. Walking in it has a really cosy feel. This is a great place to grab a drink with friends or would be a great date night place. I had the honors of attending a tasting event here last night and OMG food and drinks were delicious. I tried several drinks and my favorite was ""not a basic bitch"" it's white wine based with a hint of floral. Still not a beer drinker cause I didn't taste any I like, but my friend who is seen to enjoy the beer selections.As for the food...getting a burger is a MUST !They are grass fed, which seems to be the trend now a days, and delicious. I also have to note the teriyaki chicken was succulent and so was the aranchi (sp) it's like a risotto ball covered in sauce (see attached picture).I didn't check to see if they have a dessert menu, but if they do I will have to check it out based on the food. Such a kind staff and I love the energy in this area. I will be back!"
"Great bar, not so much restaurant. If I'm hanging out in wicker park, I would stop by for their delicious kegged cocktails: not a basic bitch (fruity, refreshing, somewhat like a sangria), gin fizz (light and refreshing, strong gin taste). The food is alright, definitely bar quality. The burger had Gouda cheese that was slimy and veery smoky. The meat needed more seasoning and to be cooked less. Crab wonton did not get any taste of crab maybe because the wonton was overpowering it, tasted like a ceviche with a bit of mayo. The chicken lollipops had great flavor but pretty dry. The arancini balls were my least favorite. These balls completely lacked any seasoning, the only taste I got was from the spicy sauce. I saw many arancini balls unfinished. Skip them. The place itself has a few standing tables and a bunch of sitting ones. The music is loud, so it's definitely a bar, this is NOT a date spot.. At least not for me. The service was impeccable. Very friendly and very excited about this new place. Bottom line definitely come here for drinks IF you're in wicker park. Not sure if it's worth the trek from the city."
This place was great! The ambiance is more romantic yet trendy (dim lights) and fun drinks but also a spot to go for some cocktails with friends. Great food menu and good quality with a great selection. The beer and drink menu is pretty extensive as well. And the waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating.
"Just went here with 3 of my friends last night, 2 from out of town. Noticed it was new and decided to try it out because it looked a lot quieter than Fatpour, or 50/50. Waiter was really nice and patient with us, checked on us a lot!I am not a big drinker, so I just asked the waiter to ask the bartender to make me a mocktail, and it was pretty good! Really nice pinkish cute color. :) The bartender came by just to see how everything was, which was really nice of him, and because they had just opened, it was his first time making a mocktail for someone. List of beers I didn't take a picture of, but everything my guy friends + husband ordered were really good. Good selection.The whole premise of the place is this kind of old-timey beer bar, the decor is really cozy and at least when we went there on a late Thursday night, it's much more chill so you can actually have a conversation!The only food we ordered was a plate of nachos, they pile each nacho with everything, so this was really unique. You can get this with either chicken or beef (this was also from the late night menu) Note: THIS Is not a big plate of nachos! Maybe 15 chips or so? No one pushed us out and we stayed until almost 12:30! Good place to try out."
"I wasn't expecting more than a shelter from the rain, so B&B pleasantly surprised me. The ""keg"" cocktails were great - the La Bamba was spicy, smoky, and strong. The bacon wrapped dates were soft and warm. The burger with truffle aioli was great. They had a fun atmosphere with a DJ on Saturday night with movies going, but still a quiet enough environment to talk. I would totally drop by again if it were in my neighborhood!"
"We stopped here last night for dinner on the patio before the Hawks game.  The food and drinks were fantastic and I really appreciate the quality food offerings (free range chicken etc.)  It's definitely a point of differentiation in terms of quality food coming from a more bar-esque establishment.  I will definitely come back, the space is nice for winter or summer, the patio is large."
From the owners coming to your table and making sure everything is ok to the waitress being on top of us for everything we needed. Drinks were amazing food was amazing atmosphere was amazing don't know what else to say about this place but I can't wait to come back and enjoy this again
"My wife and I dropped in for brunch today to use up a voucher and do a second run of this place now that it's been open for a while.  Mostly, this was a good visit.  The space is the biggest winner; where the owners' other establishment, 25 Degrees, is a bit darker in terms of decor, I like this space more and it will have a larger outdoor footprint when the patio opens this spring, which continues to make Division Street the only place to go when it comes to enjoying al fresco dining!We tried the egg sandwich, the steak and eggs, the side of bacon and the $12 bottle of champagne with a side of berry juice (they were out of the standard mango juice, per our server).  We thought the food all tasted good, with the hot sauce (don't know if that's made in house or not) being the major highlight...the egg sandwich was tasty but a bit light on egg in the sandwich, and the steak was more medium than the medium rare we ordered.  The roasted potatoes served with both entrees were great, but the applewood-smoked bacon was a little plain.But the dinner food here is so good that I want to come back to try that again before passing final judgment, and the cocktails made fresh behind the bar paired with anything from the ""From the Keg"" menu make Barley & Brass another strong Wicker Park entry...I don't know how to choose any more, there are so many great spots to eat, but once this place's patio opens to go along with Fatpour, Janik's and Takito, it's going to be tough to pick one each week that fits!"
"Definitely a great new spot for the south wicker/Ukrainian village neighborhood. I had the wings and the fried paella balls. Both were super good, the wings were spicy and sweet and had just enough crunch to be exactly what I wanted. I stuck to wine but my entire table, which was large, as I was there for a birthday dinner couldn't say enough good things about the drinks. Everything from the new manhattan to the tequila drink(can't remember the name) were superb from the comments.Even though, its a bit of a walk from the train it's definitely worth it.Only negative, is that they don't have dessert! I was like WHAT. Apparently, there has been many comments so the chef is working on a dessert menu."
"I like variety in places, but please, bring back the old menu! loved the nachos, huge disappointment that they are not on anymore as well as a few other items. Overall, a big fan of this place (décor is nice, staff are nice)...but, the recent menu change is not my taste.  Decent selection of wine and beer choices."
"My friend and I went here to celebrate that our internship was over. We decided to sit outside on the patio because it was a beautiful day and order drinks and appetizers. They bring us our drinks in plastic cups because they ""don't want anything to happen."" I'm assuming because division fest was going on? My friends drink only filled up less than half the plastic cup! It really killed the mood and we contemplated going somewhere else afterwards. We ordered food, the nachos and dates. It was the perfect amount and both were tasty. We decided to get another round of drinks but ask if they can come in real glasses- especially because my friend was ordering champagne. This time the server managed to bring us real glasses and everything was right again. I would recommend this place as long as they don't use plastic cups anymore, haha!"
"Came here last night for a Yelp event and this you must read: Very few things genuinely excite me but GOOD alcoholic beverages are one of them. It takes an ARTIST to craft cocktails that are impressive to the taste buds. And because of their skills, B&B took a prize last night - best cocktail I've had in a while. I'm a whiskey girl down to my core. A good old fashioned is pretty hard to come by but a NEW fashioned is a twist I needed to try. It was absolutely perfect. Strong (definitely did a number on me), just the right amount of sweet, and had a slight cherry undertone. A must order if you like whiskey. The gin fizz drink was delicious too. Although, I had about three new fashioned drinks at the point I switched over. I don't know if you can trust my instinct on this one. The food samples that were passed around are ranked like this, in my opinion:1. Chips; Delicious. But resembled Mariano's freshly made potato chips. 2. Chicken stuffed balls? with orange spicy sauce on top: so good. A must. 3. Sliders: mine was alright. Nothing out of this world but with cheese and more seasoning, I think I'd order these on a normal day. 4. Chicken wings: so spicy! Not a fan. Also not meaty at all; way too fatty. The point of Yelp events is to show locals new spots in hopes they will come back in the futureWell, I cannot wait to come back here to sip on that new fashioned. Perfect date spot too. You go B&B! I hope you thrive."
"This place is a gem surrounded by the shit piles that now dominate most of Division. It has great drink list, but could maybe use more wines. Food is great and hopefully the consistency and creativity will last and make an impression in the neighborhood.  Definitely a place to get in to for brunch, lunch or dinner."
"I went here with my roommate just two weeks after its opening.All the drinks were strong but unique and beautifully made.The Not a Basic Bitch was my fav. My roommate described it as ""a spa for your mouth."" The Risotto balls were excellent, the chicken wings were just the right amount of spicy and we couldn't get enough! I'm excited to come back here and also pay a visit to the owner's other spot, 25 Degrees. Good luck Barley & Brass!PS I forgot to mention the Bathroom door signage. The bathrooms had ""whichever"" signs with half a man, half a lady. I have never seen this before and thought it was a delightful design!"
"I wanted to provide an update since my last review. My previous experience wasn't as great as I'd expected so my review offered some constructive criticism. I received feedback from the Barley & Brass owner almost immediately following my post which was impressive as most restaurant owners won't take the time to ensure every one of their customers were satisfied. Mac, the owner, invited my girlfriend and I back and really took care of us. They had updated a few of their menu offerings since our first visit. We had drinks, appetizers and entrees and each of what we ordered were great!We really appreciate the restaurant going out of their way to ensure we left happy the second time around. We will definitely be going back for drinks/dinners in the near future!"
"For a place that just opened about 2 weeks ago, Barley & Brass has got it together.  We came in here Friday night to get a few drinks and some small bites to eat. Overall, it is good and has great potential. It has a very cool lounge-y vibe with a dark and class atmosphere.  It is an upgrade from your bigger sports bars on Division.  However, the tables are a little close together - in some spots too close so it is hard to get in and out.  (A table next to us had a water glass go down as a result). Service was good. Our waitress Kimberly was friendly and helpful with recommendations.  She checked in on us at a good frequency without making us feel rushed.   My husband ordered their Manhattan ($9).  He liked it but it was a little cinnamon forward with the apple bitters.  I had the ""Dark and Stormy"" ($10). The cocktail was good but with their spin on it with a little more sweetness.  However, it wasn't the Dark N Stormy I was expecting.  We ordered the tacos ($8) and poutine ($6) to snack on.  Both were well conceptualized and executed.  The tacos we did 2 fish and 2 steak.  The steak has a forward soy taste with some heat at the back end.  I liked the fish taco and thought the crema and salsa gave it a nice smoky heat.  My criticism is the filling to tortilla ratio.  There was too much tortilla and either need more filling or less tortilla.  The poutine was also nice with yummy cheese and sauce (but not too much which makes the fries soggy).  We're looking forward to checking this neighborhood joint out again soon."
"Thanks to Yelp we got the $5 burger deal, and had a great meal. The burger was pretty tasty, and the truffle aioli really kicked it off. I had the pickled vegetables which was super fresh and went well with the rich burger. I also stole some of my husband's fries because they were so good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and I liked the nice but casual vibe of the decor. We didn't have anything to drink, but the drink menu looked awesome and we will definitely be back to try a beverage and some of the other eats.  (Bacon-wrapped dates? Yes please!)"
"I went here for a Yelp event in December. A lot of the food was fried in some way. I think most reviews cover everything I was going to say so here's something fun:The jalapeno pomegranate syrup is good! Ask them to put it in sprite. I asked if they had a Kiddie Cocktail and they asked if the other was okay - it is nice! It's sweet then tastes like jalapeno, which without the spiciness is nice.I don't have much else to say, uh...oh, the music was a lot of what I listened to in high school and early in college...which...was kind of weird. Though it ""made sense"" with the atmosphere. I don't know!!! If you want a fancy-ish bar I guess this is a good place for that"
"Lucky enough to attend a Yelp event here last evening and had an opportunity to sample some of the best items here: Kegged cocktails - I had the Dark & Stormy and Gin Fizz. Both were strong & tasty. Burger - Incredible. They use grass-fed beef and it was obviously fresh and quite juicy. I was wow'ed by this one. Try this. Wings, wonton, risotto ball appetizers - all worthy of orderingThe service was great all night, and everyone I encountered was professional. Really hoping this place does well going forward."
"Drinks are a-ok and average priced for craft cocktails. The food menu seems fancy, but in the end a bit disappointing. The Arancini tasted like it was stuffed w/ buffalo chicken. The grilled brie cheese sandwich looked to be made w/ Texas toast w/o a lot of cheese and a lot of toast."
Affordable in the realm of cocktails and high quality food.  Quiet atmosphere.  It doesn't make up for the absence of Small Bar but it's a quieter bar than most on Division Street and deserves a second look for that reason.  Business was slow early on but I've seen business picking up in current weeks.  It's good to see Barley & Brass find success.
"Absolutely love this place! Our server Scott was one of the most fun and attentive servers I've ever had! My salmon sandwich was delish, though I may have dropped the ball on ordering it w/o cream cheese. The drinks were my favorite part. I started w/ La Bamba, it's like a way better version of a marg and the highlight of the night was my beer float!!! I love beer I love ice cream (who doesn't) can't wait to take advantage of their outdoor seating this summer."
"LOVE this place! If you're looking for great reasonable priced food, this is the place. I ordered the taco appetizer for my meal and got one chicken, one steak and one shrimp taco. Each taco was completely different from each other and tasted amazing. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more from their menu."
"I went to Barley & Brass on Friday night for dinner with a friend. Neither of us had been there before and we were seated almost immediately on the left side of the restaurant on the elevated section along the rail. The decor in this place is cool with a upscale yet rustic feel to it. The place was filled with a combination of overstuffed booths, high top tables, and lower tables, and if you sat anywhere other than a booth you were sitting on these cool metal chairs. The bar was massive and behind it was a giant chalk board with drink specials framed with shelving holding various bottles. Definitely pretty cool!Our server stopped by and took our drink order very quickly and we were left to peruse the food menu. The menu has a variety of interesting sounding options however I was surprised how limited it was. There were a few entree options, a few appetizers, a few salads, and a few sandwich options, etc. but not exactly a big list of options. Neither of us were terribly hungry anyway so we decided on the chicken nachos and the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. When our food arrived I was blown away how great the grilled cheese was. It was made with Brie cheese and had oven roasted grapes on it and the whole combination was incredible. Definitely one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had! As for the nachos, these things were spicy. There were no jalapenos on them however the chicken was buffalo chicken. If you enjoy a little heat you'll love these however I couldn't finish more than a few of them. Overall, the food was very good. I definitely would go back! The only negative thing about my experience was where we sat. Because our table was along the rail there was a high top table right next to us. Even with the music and noise from the dinner time crowd we could still hear every word of the couple next to us and I can only assume they heard every word of our conversation. 4 stars!"
"Feel:  Barley and Brass offers a breath of fresh air to busy Division.  It's comfortable, and not trying too hard feel is just cool enough *without* feeling stuffy.  Food: Not being a vegetarian, I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed their potato taco.  I mean I really really liked it.  The fish taco and burger were very good as well.  I tried a few of the ""from the keg drinks"" and my faves were the ""not a basic bitch"" and the ""new fashioned"".  The ""fall, dark and stormy"" went down pretty easily for how much booze I think was in it, so fair warning there.  I can't wait to try the full menu including the poutine, and their pretty original spins on some all time favorites.  I'll be going back for sure!Service: For just opening, I was quite surprised at how well the server knew the menu/drinks.  Everyone was quite nice and stress free.  One of the owners visited our table and recommended a few items and we enjoyed our experience."
"I was debating giving this place 4/5, but a four seemed too low. And, although I wouldn't say this was the most rocking night and/or experience I've ever had, Barley and Brass did everything right.Great cocktails on draft (I had the jalapeño one and my wife got the bitter fiz--both excellent), and great food. We spilt the Brussel sprout salad--which was AWESOME. She got the Turkey sandwich and I got the Steak Frites. Both very well done.No dessert? Oh well. Hopefully they get this at some point. Until then, it's not like there's a shortage of dessert places nearby.Hit it up. You'll probably like it."
"So I heard from some fellow Yelpers that this place had pad thai tacos. So of COURSE I needed to check this place out. The rumor was true. And it was delicious. I came in on a Sunday at like 2PM, which was a great time to get a spot at the bar and then a table to enjoy lunch. I also tried the Baja tacos because fish tacos are the bomb. Then I split the kafta sliders with my friend and they were not bad at all! The beer selection was legit. I'd be interested to go back for more pad thai tacos and try out some of their cocktails. It seems to be a great addition to the Division corridor and hasn't managed to attract too many douchebags yet! I hope it stays that way. Could be a good place to catch a football or hockey game."
