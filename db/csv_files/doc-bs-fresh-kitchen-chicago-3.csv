Doc B’s Fresh Kitchen
"I love this place!!!!! The food is super tasty, staff are super friendly, and the environment is quite and nice!! will definitely come back again. I started with Sparkling Rose, it has a great fruity aroma:) My friend was driving, so he got an alcohol-free beer. For the starter, we got house-made guacamole. The guacamole is really fresh, with lots of visible avocado chunks in it, which adds to the taste. it was served with sweet potato chip, which is much better than tortilla chips! The size is big too. we failed to finish it...I ordered california salad. It was the best Kale salad I've ever had!!! the roasted garlic dressing taste awesome!!! but next time, I might ask them to be light on dressing, b/c I like eating healthy, for me, the dressing was a lot...they have pistachio and wasabi peas in it! they blend well with the kale salad when they accidentally pomp in your mouth. The black shrimp salad looked good too. the shrimps are super juicy and fresh... but I didn't try other parts in the salad...definitely will come back again!!"
"A virgin journey of Doc B's presented average morsels and mundane service. Started with the Guacamole with Sweet Potato Chips. Non memorable. Non addictive. And alas, No bragging for the unseasoned Crispy Chicken sandwich or my table mates over sauced Carnitas sandwich selection. ( I did enjoy the heirloom cauliflower side which was nicely prepped al dente with a perfection of aromatics and tidbits of sweet. I could consume a bowlful of said delight without force.)The Sammie's were small to scale for price and altho accompanied with a side choice they just didn't hit the mark for satisfaction in flavor or balance. The cocktails were incredibly weak , and I am talking after two tails each, neither of us felt barely a tingle. That was a sadness that set us back 12 bucks a pop. The outside seating was uncomfortably cramped and altho our server Johnny was a delight he lacked sincerity but hey, ya gotta do what ya gotta do. We left him a nice tip. So yea , ummmmmm I say NO to Doc B's. a hundred dollar check plus tip....You can make a better choice then here. Move along."
"Can we get one of these in NYC?! Had the black tiger shrimp salad for dinner and it was delicious! Staff was friendly, prompt and courteous. Definitely recommend!"
"I come here often with my boyfriend and sometimes we bring the kids. We all really enjoy eating here. They have a lot of great healthy options and steps away from Michigan ave so you can look forward to getting some shopping in if you like or a nice walk down the magnificent mile! My favorite dish is the salmon wok bowl which you can customize with a few different options of protein,  carbs and sauce. I get mine with quinoa and teriyaki. Fav appetizer is the guac and chips. They use sweet potato chips made fresh in the kitchen, they really add a nice twist to the dish.I've tried a few other dishes here and I don't have any complaints. They have a great menu. Definitely a go to spot for fresh bite to eat."
"So, they now have a normal table service and ordering. Much better.The Kitchen salad is fantastic.  Margareta pizza is fine.  Service was good."
"I took my family here for lunch while they were visiting and staying at the Four Seasons. We wanted something quick and guilt-free. Doc B's totally delivered!  We had the best experience. My mom and sister had wine, and my dad and I stuck to iced teas. Husband had an Arnold Palmer. We were all pleased with our drinks.My dad and I both had the Brussels Sprouts salad--totally, undeniably delicious. My sister's boyfriend had a bowl with rice and meat--kind of a stir fry. Mom opted for a kale pizza that she raved about. My husband went for the veggie burger and loved it. Everyone was ooohing and aaahing and loved their meal. Can't attest to the price as my parents treated but there were no complaints directed at the bill.  Would definitely return with picky/healthy eaters looking for an excellent lunch after shopping in the area."
"I went to Doc B's my first night in Chicago as I was looking for a casual and close place to grab dinner.  Upon entering, we were seated right away.  It had a nice casual, but modern vibe.We started with the fire roasted artichoke appetizer which was delivered to our table hot out of the fire (seriously, it still had bits glowing from the flames).  Once all of the embers had died down, we discovered that the artichoke was cooked perfectly and paired deliciously with a dipping sauce.I ordered the corned beef sandwich.  It was no ordinary sandwich...served on a pretzel bun with coleslaw (which was tasty and I usually hate coleslaw), melted cheese, red onion and spicy brown mustard.  Amazing!I loved this restaurant!"
"I've been wanting to come back here ever since trying their location next to Nordstrom. When looking for a lunch spot between river north and old town I was pleasantly surprised to see they also have a location next to Bloomingdales. The perfect lunch spot before a shopping spree in 900 N Michigan. Sadly I didn't have any time to shop before or after lunch, but just a tasty long lunch is an indulgence itself.  I ordered one of the wok out bowls, which is exactly what I got when eating at the other location. It's so good that I'll want to get it again next time, but there are so many other amazing looking menu options. And the best thing I ordered was their sweet potato fries. I'll definitely get those again...and again. I'm thrilled they have 2 locations and hope to see more in the future; one in the North Shore would be super exciting. Hint hint doc."
"More like a 3.5When I walked in, the huge glowing menu and counter with registers was confusing. I took several minutes to stand there and read the menu to decide what I wanted when the person behind the counter finally spoke up and asked me if this was to dine in or take away. I told we I was dining in and she told me I could sit and order from the table. Um, ok. That would've been good information several minutes ago. So much for a ""host."" So I was seated with a menu and a server approached me for my drink order. She came back with my bevvie and took my lunch order. Craig's knuckle sandwich came about 7 minutes later. It was good, not great. It needed salt and was too liquid-y. However, the roll held up and was buttery with the right balance of soft and crisp. They guy that brought it (and cleared it) was way nicer and more memorable than my server, taking the time to tell me to ""enjoy Craig's knuckle sandwich"" while looking me in the eye and smiling. When she brought the check, she smiled at me. lol"
"I'm already craving my dinner again.Artichoke starter, split the California salad with tuna and the Salmon entree. Food was insanely delicious and service was super, super nice.We had some wines and didn't love them. But I'm going back for that salad. Maybe as soon as tomorrow. SO DELICIOUS!!!!"
"Great salads! Fresh, healthy, and delicious. I came here twice over the course of three days in Chicago, just because I was having some salad cravings and their salad with corn, edamame, sweet peppers, and grilled chicken fit the bill. Yummy."
"We stopped by Doc B's randomly after a tour of Chicago.  We just beat the lunch rush and glad we did as it was packed when we left.  They were very accommodating with our party size (two kids and three adults).  It's a casual spot with good food.  I got the backyard burger and it had great flavor.It reminded me of Houston's but a cheaper, more casual offering.  Great food in a cool spot."
"After hearing rave reviews about Doc B's for so long, I was really excited to have lunch here.  Unfortunately, there was nothing standout about Doc B's for me.  My husband and I ordered the margherita pizza to share which was good.  For our entrees, I ordered the Napa Burger which comes with swiss cheese, avocado, watercress and honey dijon. Though the burger was good, my bottom half of the bun was completely soggy from the grease and started to disintegrate when I picked it up.  It was so unappetizing that I ended up not eating it at all.  Also, the french fries were terrible.  They were overcooked, soggy and tasteless.  It was probably the first meal I have had where I completely abandoned my fries.  My husband ordered the turkey burger with avocado,  roasted red pepper & tortilla strips with avocado vinaigrette.  He enjoyed his burger and the sweet potato fries he chose.  He didn't seem to have any of the problems I did with my meal.The atmosphere is weird.  It almost gives off a fancy fast food vibe with the huge lighted up billboard like menu  right when you walk in.  IF you aren't paying close attention, you'd get the impression that you place your order before being seated.  However, if you're dining in, you are able to order with your server at the table.  My other complaint is that with Fresh Kitchen in the name, I expect FRESH ingredients.  I didn't get that impression from any of the things I ordered.  The food was good, but for the price,  and execution of dishes there are better options in the Gold Coast and surrounding areas."
Thus place was recommended by the concierge at the four seasons. Great call...fresh food and great service. The mexico city style corn with chipotle mayo was devine. The matzo ball soup was superb and the salad with fried breaded chicken was delish. Loved thus place.
"Service was excellent and I had the wok bowl with salmon and quinoa.  I inhaled it within 5 minutes.  The vegetables were so crunchy and fresh, the salmon was cooked just right, and the spicy thai sauce had the right amount of kick in it.  Only wish they could have the ingredients available on their menu somewhere for people with dietary restrictions.  I'm trying to avoid sugars so if someone at Doc B's could work on that...   The iced tea I ordered was delicious as well coming in a huge tall glass with crushed ice.  Am definitely bringing my family and friends for the next visit."
"Fantastic lunch. Delicious and tasteful food and gracefully served. Looooved the interior of the restaurant. Absolutely a Chicago experience, when shopping on Michigan Avenue."
"Good find thanks to the Yelp reviews! Just lunched here.. Nom nom nom!Sis and I ordered the seared tuna sandwich and veggie burger.. So good!The veggie burger is house made deliciousness, a delicate balance of quinoa, black beans, beets.. Served with a kale mix topping on a perfect multigrain bun...it's seriously good.  The seared tuna sandwich is delicious..a delicate balance of tuna, slivered scallions, sesame, with avocado and apple slices that brightens every bite. It's must try. The sweet potato fries are also fresh and tasty. My only negative was the cole slaw that was heavy, heavy on the mayo/aioli dressing they use..tasty but just heavier then i personally prefer.Definitely a revisit the next time I'm in this neighborhood."
"I stopped in here while traveling for work based partly on the name, partly on proximity, and partly on reviews. All three were accurate!I ordered the veggie burger (also based on reviews), and it was delicious! They make it with quinoa and black beans - among other things - and top it with a generous serving of greens that were quite fresh and tasty. It's probably one of the top handful of veggie burgers I've ever had. The wait staff was also helpful and went out of their way to provide a sample of an appetizer that I was undecided about ordering (I ended up not getting it, but it was more of a caloric decision, not a labour-based one)."
"Watch the Doc as he is going places. Maybe they only have 2-3 locations but this Chicago based New Yorker is methodically making a place in a tough food town. Fresh food with high quality service sells. Not rocket science. Burgers are awesome (Dragon Burger with sauce on the side to control the heat) is accompanied by the freshest sweet potato fries you can get. BIG salads that just scream freshness and creativity. Plenty of creative sandwich options and the Cubana is manly, meaty wich that is killer.If you are sick and ailing, get to a Doc B. Casual, high quality eats will heal your aches and pains."
"Everyone was more than satisfied with our meals at Doc B's. We got a mix of entrees including the pan roasted chicken, the veggie burger, and the wok bowls, all of which were excellent.Don't miss the oatmeal cookie with salted caramel ice cream sandwich for dessert! We had to order two"
"This place is soooo good! I had a wok bowl w/ tofu, spicy Thai, and lo mein; Lots of flavor, all veggies cooked to perfection, and tofu was grilled on point as well! This place has a nice interior design but the outdoor seating area is good too when the weather is nice outside."
"There's a possibility that Doc B might do California better than California does California. There aren't many things in the world I love more than kale and not enough restaurants in CA have it on their menu, in any capacity. The server we had was totally amazing. The menu is incredible; I got a wedge burger with no bun (like a good yuppie) and my mom got the kale/broccoli wok bowl with salmon. It was all so good. I wish they existed here!"
"Loved this place!The food was great and the service was top notch.Not quite what I was expecting when I walked in, but we had a wonderful time and I will def try it again when I back in Chicago!"
Was seated by the hostess and waiting 10-13 mins before leaving because nobody came to my table. Looked good though. Patrons were the millennial types that talk incessantly about the latest cardio trends and how their friends boyfriend was looking at some chicks ass. Glad I left.
I begged my friend to meet me here for lunch. I'm happy she agreed. I have been wanting to try it for some time. I will admit I was nervous after I sat down. I'm not sure why. It just seemed different than what I expected. We ended up ordering some drinks followed by wine. The wine list is small but pretty well thought out with some really nice selections! I wasn't terribly hungry. All of the food I saw looked great! I want to go back with a bigger appetite. I had the vegetable soup and my friend had a shrimp salad. Everything was really fresh and we enjoyed it. We also split the strawberry blondie for dessert. A blondie is a MUST here!! Strawberry gelato in between 2 sugar cookies. So good! The service was friendly and she always kept an eye on us! Another friend lives in the area so I'm sure I'll be back!
"I think it was a very overrated place, overall... and that makes me sad because we walked so very long in the cold to get here.The food was just ok, but literally nothing to write home about. I had the hot chicken, which in my case, turned out to be mostly fried chicken skin and very little meat. It was also covered in a sauce that was almost sweet&sour in origin, , like a very light version of mild sauce at Harold. s Chicken (a Chicago staple) for a place to serve ""healthy"" fare it felt like a lazy dish. I opted for the Brussels as a side (versus the cole slaw that comes with it) and at least that was tasty... but again, nothing amazing. The corn bread was super sweet which didnt flow well with the rest of the dish... just too much sweetness for a dish called ""Hot Chicken"" Its not a bad price for the amount of food you get though, so thats a definite plus.The service was... horrible. they didn't want to sit us in an empty booth because ""we to keep those available for larger parties"" but when I pointed out that the 3 adjoining booths were filled with only two party guests then ""I don't want to make anyone upset, I'll get the booth cleaned for you right away"" as if my observation were invalid or as if by being black and pointing out something like that was making me ""angry""Then I asked for a club sode with no ice and Lime and what I got was-ice water with lemon-club soda with ice and lemon-and THEN club soda with lemonso I pretty much just gave up on the Lime idea at that point. and my guest NEVER got his water, I just ended up giving him mine.Overall a ""meh"" experience indeed. Feels like another bland place with no standout energy or idea. I'd say skip it and get your healthy desires elsewhere"
"I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner with a couple of friends.  We didn't have a wait and were seated immediately.  Yay.  You do have the option to order first and then sit down if you would like...works well if the restaurant is packed.I really like the food options here... they provide somewhat healthier options...FoodKale slaw ($4) - kale slaw is an option with some of the entrees/meals, but if it isn't, you can still order it as a side.  I really enjoyed it. The portion for the side isn't decent, but definitely just a side and not a meal!Avocado Pizza ($13) - Avocado, pickled jalapeño, cotija & ""Frenched"" onions.  The ingredients worked well together; although, I thought the pizza overall was slightly salty..I would order this again though. Portion is defintely bigger than I anticipated -good for share if you want to try different menu items.*I would rather eat pizza here than at Eataly's pasta section/restaurantWok Out Bowl ($13-$19) - the price ranges depending on what choice you select (ex: tofu/meat/fish).  I would say the bowl will definitely fill you up..or for small eaters like me... you will go home with left overs... this kind of reminds me of the bibimbap concept -rice/noodles with sauce & choice of main ingredient.  Tasty although it may be a little bit on the saltier side as well.Veggie Burger ($14) - Quinoa & black bean blend topped with kale slaw & Umami Glaze and comes with a choice of sweet potato fries, cole slaw or quinoa salad..YUM! I like the mixture of ingredients--would rather eat this than a veggie patty of some sort.Sweet potato fries were big and good.. but if you like crispy.. they weren't per se crispy...Portions - are big and your stomach will leave contentCustomer service - I wish I remembered/got the name of my waiter because he was amazing... best restaurant service that I've had in awhile!! Great job!!  Such great service like that makes me want to come back to try the other food items.Atmosphere - casual and spacious...good for hanging out and just eating..Parking - there is street parking, but it is costly..I would highly recommend taking public transportation (lasalle/clark & division red line) or taking a bus..Yes i would come here again!"
As I mentioned the salads are wonderful here as are the cheeseburgers. I would also try their appetizers especially the chicken wings which come in a Asian fusion sauce and it's delicious
We we're told this was a good place to go from the receptionist from at our hotel.  Our server was great and very upbeat and had great knowledge of the menu. We shared the wing appetizer and they were amazing . We also had the artichoke appetizer and it brought back memories of how my grandma made them . My ribs were some of the best I have ever had and I eat out very often. All in all a great meal and atmosphere with outside seating I cannot wait to go again.
"This place is great on a sunny day. They've got outdoor sidewalk seating, and the they've got a huge hydraulic window that they open up so you that even if you're inside you can still get a nice breeze. I'm glad this place has moved into downtown where we need more reasonably-priced, delicious food options.What's good: Craig's Knuckle sandwich - it's their lobster roll. Loved every bite and was very fresh.Cajun Chicken club - also really good.The #1 Tuna sandwich - they mention that their tuna is flown in daily from Hawaii. Really enjoyed this one.Wok out bowls - it's a good amount of food, leaves you satisfied. And you feel healthy afterwards (if you get it with brown rice)The Gelato sandwiches - especially the strawberry/sugar cookie combo. It sounds like it would be too sweet but it isn't.What to skip:All the burgers. They're nothing special. And even our server didn't think they were worth mentioning when we asked her what was good on the menu. The Filet Mignon Sandwich - it was ok, but hard to eat; you really have to rip off each piece with your teeth to get a bite. The meat portion was also fairly small. The Crunchy cheesecake is literally just a plain cheesecake with crumbs on top. Wasn't even very fresh. Skip!Enjoy!"
"I came in here late on a Saturday (8:30ish), and while there were a number people there it wasn't too crowded and we were seated immediately.  The decor is modern and it is interesting to see the elevated kitchen in the back.My friends and I ordered the kale side as an appetizer, the avocado pizza, a tofu wok out bowl and the veggie burger.  Now, I wasn't very hungry when I got there, and I am very wary of ordering salads when I eat out, so I thought eating the veggie burger without the bun would be a nice lighter alternative.  Sad (or happy?) to say the burger bun was delightfully buttered and griddled to crunchy perfection to the point that I could not resist eating most of the bun too.  Apparently I can't resist buttered and toasted buns, and I mean that completely literally with no euphemism there whatsoever - just to be clear.Anywho, the avocado pizza is as good as everyone says it is.  They use perfectly ripe avocados and whatever else the put on it creates magic in your mouth.  They have a really interesting dough too, different from any other pizza I've had and it helps add to the deliciousness.  The Wok Out bowl was also very good, they definitely know how to use the fresh ingredients and great flavors to make a well-rounded and tasty dish.What set this place apart was the service, our server was very friendly and interactive, very knowledgeable about the menu, and interactive with our table.  It's what makes this place 5 stars!  I am looking forward to coming back again, maybe next time for dessert too (apparently they have pies from Bang Bang Pie Shop, cheesecake and ice cream)."
"I had the number six sandwich; the fried chicken on the sandwich was phenomenal. We also tried the wok out bowl with the spicy thai sauce and the lo mein noodles were the perfect texture. The interior is clean and simple decor, but it lets the food be the star of the show. Food was timely and Nevin, our server, was very hospitable and attentive. I'd definitely come back!"
I thought it was very good and would come back.  It's a great lunch spot with healthy options and nonhealthy!  My wife's salmon with kale slaw looked great and the plate was more or less empty.  I had a cajun chicken club and it was great.  Service was fast and friendly.  Overall it had a lunch crowd vibe and wasn't touristy except for us ;)One of the downside was cramped quarters but it wasn't that big of a deal.  I also don't like the open kitchen in the back which lets all smells and sounds into the dining area.
Pretty decent place. Pros: decent food. Not amazing but fresh and good. Ambiance is nice. Small but good decor and build out makes it feel nice. Good location. Nice staff. Cons: no wheelchair or stroller access! Not sure how they got past the ADA requirements. Also to the manager or staff who literally came and took 10 packets of sugar out of my baby's hand which was keeping my toddler busy so my wife and I could eat.....IT WAS 50 cents WORTH of SUGAR PACKETS!! Not cool!
"Absolutely hooked! Had my first take with the wok bowl; shrimp, spicy Thai Shanghai Lomein, chicken salad and of course the infamous sweet potato fries. All three were perfectly delicious and to top it off, healthy! This will definitely be my go to lunch spot from now!"
"Ok, Saturday plans did run off the rails, but it did begin her at Doc B's. Well, after we pulled into the wrong spothero parking garage and had to back out. You know, the Doc B concept is great, the room is hip and energy good. We were in a rush because traffic had set us back, so the counter ordering was fast. In our group of 8, I think we had 5 burgers and 3 seafood entrees. The burgers were OK, not awesome, or a value, because they were small. The fish was fresh, but, it seems a little too fast foodie. The service was OK, but for some reason, even with 3 different waitstaff involved, they just could not get that diet coke to the table until dinner was almost over. If you are in the neighborhood and in a hurry, do stop here. Don't make a special trip though."
"Good (fairly healthful) food, good service, fun atmosphere and reasonable prices.Hubby had the veggie burger. The highlight was definitely the sweet potato fries served on the side. Seasoned beautifully and huge!I had the wok bowl. The kale had a great flavor and the overall dish was decent. Wish there would have been a bit more steak. Our server was excellent, and the experience was a good one."
Great eatery with accommodating staff! The shrimp pizza with arugula was amazing. The starter guacamole and sweet potato chips were fresh and light. Wonderful lunch spot to have a girls'-day-out!
"Came here during the work week rush hour and it was pretty packed, but I was able to get a seat at the bar. I had the #1 tuna salad and it was damn good and also the most expensive salad I've ever purchased, lol. The hawaiian ahi tuna  was delicious and was a decent portion. I usually don't really like fruits in my salad, but the mango and apple slices worked perfectly with the avocado and ginger dressing. I ate every last piece of the salad along with the pickled ginger. It was that tasty. I can't say I was totally full afterwards."
"Very quick (orders ready in 10 minutes), delicious food, highly recommend the Number 6 with sweet potato fries."
"To give you a sense of the scene, I should start by saying that when I went with a friend who manages a dept in a large retail establishment across the street that rhymes with Shloomingdale's, she had to sit away from the door so that all of her customers wouldn't stop and say hi....it's a place for ladies who shop and then lunch in their Lulu - which isn't a bad thing - this area needs more tasty, casual options for noshing status-post working up a sweat wrestling in and out of size 00s in the shops across the street at 900 N. Michigan - so I'm not throwing shade, it's just, this is the vibe you're working with - nice looking blondes with good blow outs and strapping young men from nearby office buildings in decent oxfords. You can do full service, order to go, or do an order/beeper/get your own food thing - we were feeling lux so we went with a waiter - and our arrival at 11:55a couldn't have been better - by 12:30p the place was mobbed and the din had reached a feverish pitch. Started with a charred artichoke, which arrived still smoking - and walked that perfect line btwn deliciously crispy and carcinogen-in-a-food. Would recommend, though make sure you ask for addtl lemon slices and add some salt for a flavor boost.Then had Alexis' Kitchen salad - quinoa, marcona almonds, mint, radish, fried leeks + my addition of tofu (which, regrettably was fried....weak) - it was actually pretty tasty - there were enough quinoa and almonds that I truly didn't need the tofu for extra heft - and for $12, it was well worth it. Sampled the ""#1 tuna salad"" too - seared tuna, a gingery dressing, and a mess of spring greens, mango, avocado, and cuc - it was quite nice, though the mango needed a bit more ripening before its inclusion. Starters are $8-13. Salads are $12-19 (and are large enough that the price is warranted). Per my date, the burgers are killer, ranging from $11-15, including a veggie option. Sandos are deli classics with appropriate nods to the housewives that keep their lights on and are not on their ""splurge"" days - corned beef, lobster rolls, and...grilled chicken, etc - they'll run you $13-23.Do yourself a huge favor and order a gelato sandwich for dessert. Seriously unreal. Gelato was light and decadent. Cookie wasn't overly sweet, had just the right amnt of chew. For $4, it's a little bit of Heaven.Service is unobtrusive and friendly. My water was kept refilled, which is basically all I need to be happy. Worth a trip if you're in the hood."
"Tasty food at a good price. We went for lunch on a Saturday - the server seated us immediately. We ordered ""the plate"" and ""wok"". Both were vegetarian and very healthy and tasty. Server was very courteous and service was quick. He got us food the way we wanted (less oil). Overall, I was pretty happy with the experience. Price was around $15/ person without tip"
"After a weekend full of Thanksgiving bingeing, it was time for me to eat something healthy.  I found Doc B's and ordered ""The Plate"" which I asked for vegan and it was chock full of vegetable healthiness ... just what I was looking for.  The plate came with kale, quinoa, artichoke, brussel sprouts, and wilted spinach.  I loved it all with the exception of the wilted spinach, which is not something I like anyway.  I will definitely be back."
Definitely a be-back place. Very good service & food. What's not to like?
Service was fast and food was very tasty. My boyfriend and I asked if we could split a wok out bowl and the Cajun fish sandwich. The waiter said of course (points!!). The sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. A must try. The only thing about the bowl is the spicy Thai isn't spicy. Other than that it's good :)
"the place...It's the winter time and we got seated near the door (although not right next to it). The draft/chill was so strong we all ended up wearing jackets throughout dinner. I'm not that particular, but there were open tables in the back, but by the time we got a chance to ask to move they were being filled. The place does have some draft protection covering the door, not sure what more they could have done but did make for an uncomfortable dinner - they were apologetic.what i ordered...This was my main issue. I ordered a burger ($14). I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was the worst burger I've ever had. Patty was small for the amount of the bun/toppings and it was basically cardboard. On top of this patty was a pile of cheddar cheese (bigger than the patty) that was ice cold - as in just taken out of fridge. I don't mind paying the premium for eating downtown, but at least have serviceable food. The only reason this isn't a 1 star is because some of the food the people I went with seemed pretty good (crispy chicken, tuna sandwhich)."
"Love this place!Great atmosphere and great food! Extensive menu options and superb quality. The atmosphere is lovely and modern.The service is what makes me coming back to this place. They are always professional, quick and attentive!"
"Place is outstanding. Very attentive service, hip atmosphere and great selection of food. From the Hit Chicken to the amazing burgers and the best humus I've ever had."
"Doc B's in the Gold Coast has great space, friendly service, a menu that is way too large but very accommodating for both residents and tourists, and prices that are a little high but reasonable for the neighborhood.I tried the Dragon burger for dinner tonight; for $13, this was an interesting proposition.  Incredible, fresh ingredients and toppings, but the burger is pretty small--4-5 oz. cooked, and with a small order of fries on the side.  With a beer, this was a good meal, maybe even a great meal, for a smaller person or a person that can somehow trick themselves that this is enough food.  But I left hungry, so I went to Sprinkles down the street for dessert!"
The goat cheese and kale pizza was amazing. It was also convient to order the food to go.
"Doc B'S, you are my new obsession!! The first time I came I was worried it would be really crowded and overpriced due to the location however I was pleasantly surprised with reasonable prices and no wait time. The ambiance is casual and t hey even have some outdoor seating. The noise level is pretty good, however I was able to hear the conversations around me both times. The food! - The knife and fork salad is amazing!! i am nOT one to be obsessed with salads but this salad has changed that!! - The guacamole appetizer is REALLY big! There is so much guacamole and if you eat all the chips, they offer to bring more. - The burgers are so good and flavorful! - The sweet potato fries are the best sweet potato fries! I always sweet potato fires and these are on the way top of my list! SO GOOD!!  I really want to try the desserts because they sound really amazing but I have been so full each time I could not fit in another bite."
"My husband and I stumbled in here tonight looking for a new casual dining experience in the loop. I can say this without hesitation--this is one of my favorite new dining establishments in the loop (and especially one of my faves near the Mag Mile).Doc B's somehow meshes this feeling of being very laid back and casual, while maintaining a sense of hip/trendy/cool. I would even go so far as to say, these are FANCY (Iggy-style) burgers, with totally divine fries.I got the cajun fish sandwich with fries and my husband got the plain Jane burger with fries. Super solid presentation, extremely tasty, and definite delivery on classic flavors. The chips and guac are PHENOM. A beautifully large heap of crisp chips with a super fresh and so green green mound of guac.What I love most about Doc B's is this: the service is absolutely impeccable. Even though the ordering can be done both at the counter OR at the table, there is full-service waitering with spot-on delivery. They bring refills as you're drinking your last sip. They stop in casually to ask how things are going. They make you feel at home but attended to. It's a legion of service staff that just can't be beat.I'm a huge fan of this new hiptastic kitchen, and I'll definitely be back regularly. LOVE that it's close to home. :)"
"Went there twice and both times - great experience!Filet sandwich way to go.The wok out bowl with brown rice and salmon was delicious! Everything very reasonably priced. We will be back (we are from Germany, so this means something)!"
"Good healthy food.  Not the BEST food I've had, but a great option for the neighborhood, and the atmosphere is nice.  I really like that there is a healthy place to eat on the Gold Coast so I gave it an extra star for that.  Service was good, everyone was nice."
"Everything is delicious and healthy! Awesome salads and cocktails. Nobody I've been with (several friends, my parents, and friends' parents) has disliked what they ordered.And if you go on a Saturday, do yourself a favor and GET THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP."
"Absolutely impressed! Nice ambience, great food! Try the knuckle sandwich! The house salad is more than just a salad!"
"I got the Plate and Friday's soup - corn chowder - as a pick up order on a cold jet-lagged night.Hadn't eaten my vegetables today, so figured I should just go all the way. The plate had a tasty kale slaw, truly perfectly done brussels sprouts, charred artichoke - mine was kind of weirdly salty, but with a nice char for sure - wilted spinach (also rather salty) and a quinoa/chick pea concoction that was refreshing. Corn chowder was delicious. Not sure where those fresh corn kernels were coming from in January, in Chicago, but it was a little bite of summer in a cosy but not too heavy chowder. Here's the thing. I ate all of this without the benefit of utensils (actually I did find some ice tongs in the hotel room, that helped a little). So a couple of cautions to those who might order online. You might be offered the choice of a side, don't get too attached! I selected sweet potato fries, but when I showed up to get my food, the friendly gals at the front said that was a mistake and I'd need to pay extra for a side. And, when I came back to the room, I found not a spoon nor fork nor napkin in sight. I did manage to eat my food with my mad improvisational skills. This place would've been four stars, but they didn't quite have their take out act together. Despite this there were several other take out orders in the works when I was picking mine up. Next time, when I'm more well-rested, I'll do what most do and dine in. Those people looked like they were having a fine time."
"Great service, amazing staff & good food. Can't go wrong with the Knife and Fork Cobb Salad if you're starving & want to stay semi-healthy! Very fun atmosphere and don't get confused about how to get in. The door isn't directly under the sign. Overall a really great place to grab a bite and enjoy great conversation!"
"I'm very happy to have visited today.  My friend and I stopped in for lunch, the decor is modern but comfortable, wine list is on point and the food was excellent.  I had seared tuna to start, steak frites for my entree and a glass of Pinot Gris.  My server was consistent with refills and the food was fairly priced - I recommend you swing by -"
"Food was really good, as was service. Only hang up for me was the unpublished beer price was $10 a piece. I would've cared to know that detail."
"Went here for lunch. Had the tuna ahi sandwich with Apple slices avocado and seared ahi with a seasoned seaweed was the most amazing sandwich I've had. I could eat these everyday and feel super healthy. Hands down the best thing on the menu. They had a modern look, with modern layout (order at the counter, things will be brought to you)- tip optional after you get served (good idea but no pens at the table to write in your amount).Bathrooms were modestly concealed and modernly done. Ambiance was casual. Good lighting but loud echoing acoustics."
"The entire menu--salads, burgers, and sandwiches--is tantalizing, but you cannot do better than the Wok Out Bowl.  My choice was tofu with sesame teriyaki sauce over brown rice.  Wow, talk about a fresh, flavorful, filling, clean-tasting meal.  Outstanding.  All healthy food should be this amazing.And how about gelato/cookie sandwiches for dessert?Throw in an efficient and pleasant staff and some outstanding Gold Cost people-watching, and this is a real gem.  Doc B, please open a kitchen further north.  Pretty please?"
"Stopped into the restaurant mainly because I saw that Wed. night is gumbo night. Certainly was tempting on a cold winters night!  I was immediately greeted by the hostess, a waitress, and the bartender.  Very pleasant staff!   I had a cocktail while I waited for my dinner:  gumbo and the bbq Chx pizza.   Both were excellent!   Very delicious and not too pricey at all.   The place has a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere once you get inside.  Top notch in my book!   Thanks for a pleasant dining experience!   To the manager: the staff I interacted with made me want to return.  It's not often you encounter a very friendly staff!"
"I randomly passed this place while trying to find a dinner spot since the spot I had planned to go to had a private event.  Looked really nice inside, we were able to sit inside but by the open windows, which felt like outdoors.  The sweet patatoe fries were amazing!! They were thick and very well seasoned. The veggie burger was also very yummy, probably the 2nd best veggie burger I've had... only thing is we got the shrimp salad and the plate was huge but there were only three small shrimps in it - it was an entree."
"Best veggie burger in town...I like it so much I could eat it every day...it goes well with sweet potato fries..My hubby loves their hot chicken.Although I feel like their service level goes down. Every time I visit I am not happy with either waiter service, waiting time ( so I even order in advance via phone), etc."
"Loved. I really loved it. Amazing ambiance, great service, fabulous food...couldn't ask for anything more! I just have to say..I had the most difficult time choosing what to order. I could have chosen upwards of 10 things when the waitress came for our orders. I asked for a suggestion between a couple options, and she recommended the avocado pizza. What a FANTASTIC choice that was. First of all it was huge (easily two full meals) and secondly is was amazingly delicious. The crazy thing is normally I'm a meat lover, but I was totally fine with avocado, onions, and cheese!My friend and I both ordered The Natural cocktail, which was pretty good. I absolutely want to go back to this restaurant in the near near future :)"
Swordfish was excellent. Service was very good. Young staff. Black bean soup was OK. Salad was very good. Everything was very fresh.
"Doc B's is a fantastic option for relatively healthy, reasonably priced, and fast dining off North Michigan Ave. A few weeks ago I stopped in for lunch and had a delicious salad that was on special- the California: a kale caesar with dried cranberries, pistachios, crunchy tortilla strips, roasted sweet potato, avocado, and some seeds of some kind. It seriously blew me away- I am typically not a salad fanatic, but this salad was so delicious that I even took a picture of it so I could remember all the ingredients, and attempt to make it at home! I think it was probably the best salad I've ever had.The service was good, especially given how busy the place was. I think a bunch of people who work in offices nearby frequent this place on weekdays. The atmosphere was a tad crowded and hectic when we arrived, but cleared out after 1:30 in the afternoon."
"The only thing I ever have here is the Wok Bowl - no starch (although the brown rice is delicious), tiger shrimp, spicy thai, and extra veggies.  It is probably one of my favorite things ever.  It feels like comfort food, but you don't feel bad about eating it.  I go here just to get that :)I have also tried the quinoa salad, which is delicious, the sweet potato fries, which are good, and the veggie burger, which  I can't say I enjoyed.With how much I enjoy the Wok Bowl, I don't need to try anything else, although maybe I will, eventually!Side note - I do prefer this location over the River North location...."
"This place is amazing! Love the location, the look, the service and the food.. Everything was on point! I found out  that  the same person who designed Roka Akor is the one who designed this place... so no wonder I loved the look of it! Came here on Saturday, and it wasn't too crowded.. we got to sit right by the window and people watch. I ordered the guacamole and chips and the napa burger and everything tasted so fresh! The guacamole and chip came with sweet potato chips which were light and a great touch to the guac - very addicting. The napa burger had avocado, arugula, and honey dijon - perfect combination... one of the best tasting burgers I've had! I didn't feel gross after eating it, and it was the perfect size burger. Everything was very fresh and flavorful and just seemed much healthier than your every day burger.Perfect place to grab a bite after a work out (there's a gym right across the street)."
"Stopped in for a bite on Sunday.  Comfortable atmosphere, attentive waitstaff.  Ordered the turkey chili and a traditional burger.  The chili exceeded my expectations.  I've never had anything like it.  Ground turkey and not overloaded with beans.  Just a little red onion and cheddar add another layer of flavor.  Ordered the burger medium rare.  Excellent sear and perfectly cooked.  Crisp, cool toppings to contrast and a heavenly sesame seed bun.  The fries made it all better.  Go in on a Sunday (turkey chili day) and see for yourself.  You'll be glad you did."
Absolutely the best!!! The Internal Affair drink at the bar with all the sweet and hot spices from  jalapeños combined to make this woman's lunch/dinner~ Happy Hour wishing it would continue!
"Doc B's Kitchen is a good food option if you're wandering downtown Chicago and want something quick that isn't a happy meal. The food is pretty good and a lot of options from pizzas to salads, sandwiches and even wok bowls. Plenty of seating which is seat yourself style. You order at the front and then find a table and they bring out your order when it's ready. With a pretty decent bar as well, which totes some great beer options, you can even enjoy a little adult beverage while you wait. Service is fast, the space is very modern and clean, and the food pretty good so, all in all, Doc B's Kitchen is a great lunch option in downtown Chicago. One thing to note, if you order a salad get the dressing on the side otherwise your salad will be swimming in it, making a delicious entree almost not edible."
"Awesome place. Super fast, great food (burger) and friendly service. Couldn't recommend more."
"Great variety of food on their menu. Quick carry out and sit down as well. All of their food tastes fresh and exactly the same each time you order it. Some of my fave- knife and fork Cobb salad (chicken comes out crispy and the salad fresh), grilled chicken salad (portion size is huge and the Asian theme with edamame is a nice touch- amazing dressing), Number Six (spicy chicken sandwich- crunchy chicken with a nice kick- habanero bbq sauce paired with simple sliced pickles) nice southern charm. Favorite app- house Guac with thinly sliced and lightly fried sweet potato chips instead of tortilla chips. I give it four stars only because the price of their food is a little high for casual American dining- Would love to eat there everyday!"
"Great Atmosphere, Great Food, Friendly Service!You'll enjoy everything on the menu. You'll go back for the sweet potato fries, and perfect salads.My fav... the Carnitas Sandwich. Pulled pork with cole slaw and a thick, crispy onion ring.We've been there 5+ times. Each meal was so satisfying that we've never even ordered dessert... maybe next time ;-)"
"Really this place is great! We went back and noticed they changed some stuff in their menu which only means they use seasonal and fresh products! They take real good care of the plates they put on your table; clean, organize, colorful! Customer service is great. It's our ""place to go"" when we head downtown."
Ain't no lie but the place is straight nice!!! Nice service and nice food. I would give six stars if I could... Definitely worth to come! I'm addicted to its Wok Out Bowl btw.
"Literally some of the WORST overpriced food I've ever had in the city. I don't even know where to begin. Their ""breakfast sandwiches"" are just air, their tuna salad is old and smelly, the pizzas are flat and flavorless, the burgers are soggy and falling apart. Not to mention, when you walk in, you can tell that the employees hate being there. Not sure if it's bad hiring or bad management that makes them really hate their lives. Also noticed that other ""bad"" reviews were removed by the business. Don't waste your time here."
"This place is pretty awesome.  I stopped in for a mid-shopping lunch break.  Since it was just me, I sat at the bar and was able to avoid the long-looking wait for a table.  The menu is great - a variety of stuff from salads and sandwiches to rice bowls with an Asian flare.  I'm always looking for ""real food"" with quality ingredients, especially for lunch, so I loved that the rice bowl I opted for came with TONS of vibrant, fresh veggies and brown sticky rice.  I do think the prices are pretty high, but to be fair, my rice bowl leftovers were enough for breakfast for two the next day (with an egg on top, of course!)."
"We really enjoyed this place. Comfortable booths, excellent service, and really patient and well informed servers. My girlfriend is Vegan, and i don't eat meat or dairy, so often we find it hard to find places we can both eat while traveling, but Doc B's has a great menu, and the menu is easy to swap and change a little. The tofu noodle salad is to die for, and their veggie burger is honestly the best veggie burger i have EVER had, especially when accompanied by their sweet potato fries! The Quinoa salad was also excellent, so good that my girlfriend had it two nights in a row! So i don't normally give anything 5 stars, but this place is well deserving.....!"
"tipping the scales is what Doc B's seems to be all about! This was our first time even hearing about Doc B's and we just happened to stumble upon it while out on a Michigan Ave shopping day.  We had been turned away by an italian restaurant that couldn't feasibly do much for a vegan but they pointed us to the Rush Street area.  We walked in Doc B's after not seeing a menu outside and was pleasantly surprised.DB's is one of those places where you walk up to the counter, order your goodies and take a seat.  They give you a GPS-based sensor and you pick your own table.  Once we sat down our amazing server came by and checked on us.From start to finish the crew here was amazing.  So helpful, knowledgable and on-top-of-it.  I had the build your own bowl and am looking forward to trying the highly rated veggie burger next time.  Portions are big so the price point is really good once you know that.  We cannot wait to come back and try the menu.  We've recommended DB's to our friends and I'll take my family here, too."
This place is delicious! Probably one of the most delicious artichoke appetizers I have ever had! Also the chicken with quinoa salad was out of this world. Highly recommend this place for a place with great tasting food without breaking the bank.
"Good service - prompt waitress that was helpful and friendlyGreat atmosphere - not pretentious, not overwhelming, laid back Great food - my friend got the steak with chimichurri sauce and I got the baby back ribs; both excellent - steak was made very well at a medium, sauce can get a bit overwhelming but not bad at all, baby back ribs literally fell off the bone! Not too overdone and not too bbq-y - i polished off the entire thing! A bit pricier for the two entrees and two beers, but overall not too bad."
"We were treated to this fine establishment the first day of my vacation to Chicago. The food was excellent. Had a bit of a wait despite having reservations for 8:30p. Servings were very generous, I could not finish mine. A short walk from the Hotel we were staying (Thompson Hotel)."
Dropped in close to closing but service was still great. Food was good but pricey for a burger.
"Literally no complaints about Doc B's! What a welcome addition to that area. Doc B's has a beautiful interior, it's a very well-decorated space. The restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and then find a seat. Although the restaurant was crowded, we had no trouble getting a table for four. Shortly after we were seated, our waitress came by with our food.My dining companions all ordered salads and loved all the components in them. Mostly. they were impressed with the dressings that Doc B's makes themselves. The Gold Coast vinaigrette and garlic/kale vinaigrette were especially flavorful. The salads were large in portion and filled with fresh ingredients. For lunch, I ordered the Wok Out bowl with salmon. It was so delicious! The bowl was filled with perfectly cooked vegetables like kale, red pepper, mushrooms and others. The piece of salmon on top was well cooked and well-portioned. I had the spicy Thai sauce which wasn't too spicy, but very flavorful. Throughout our lunch, we saw other meals going by and everything looked awesome. Doc B's has a huge menu and I can't wait to go back to try more. It's a little pricey there, but completely typical for the area and I feel you get your money's worth because the portions are large. Overall, great experience and I will definitely be back!"
"My girlfriend and I went to Doc B's on a Thursday night at 6:30 PM. We were seated right away. The atmosphere is comfortable & casual, but also sleek - it was very conducive for an evening of good conversation and catching up!We started with the kale salad and guac & chips. Both were very good. The guac comes with sweet potato chips, so it's a healthier alternative. Plenty of chips and guac for two. For my main meal I ordered the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was prepared perfectly and the salad was very fresh. The portion size was more than enough to feel stuffed (granted, we had apps too).There are many healthier items on the menu, and the prices are affordable. Service was good too. Not sure how crowded it gets on weekends, but the place was filled when we left.I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Worth trying out if you are looking for a new dining spot!"
Best burgers and sandwiches around.  Quick food with great waiters and waitresses.  There's something for everyone and it's so delicious.
"Had a great late lunch here complete with prosecco and a white wine blend (Equilibrium). The guacamole was delicious, served with sweet potato chips (these were supposed to be served warm, but were not... Still delicious though!) I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. So sinful and amazing. My husband had a chicken bowl with lo mein which was very tasty, but he felt as though it lacked enough chicken. The service was superb and the atmosphere was very welcoming. Will definitely be back the next time I'm on the Gold Coast!"
"Delicious, fresh and decent sized portions. I got the #1 Ahi Tuna sandwich with kale slaw and loved every bite!"
"I'll preface this by saying the experience was a solid 3.5 stars, not 3 stars. The model is an interesting one because you walk in, order like you would at a fast food type of place, and then you sit down to wait for your food, but you are also assigned a waiter/waitress in a casual upscale type of environment. It's not often you see that and it's interesting to say the least because it breaks the paradigm up a little bit. I'm not sure what percentage of people will be using the waitstaff after ordering from a fast food type of counter, but I'm sure some will.The food was solid and I was actually pleasantly surprised by my quinoa salad and burger - both had a lot of great flavor. The decor of the place is casual upscale, yet you have some conflicting feelings due to the ordering system, the wait staff placed upon you after ordering and not from them, and the fact that the staff seemed to be wearing under armour and not anything nicer.I kind of felt as if someone wanted to open up a place in Wrigleyville, then got enough money to open up near Michigan Avenue. It just feels too much like someone in Wrigleyville's attempt at being more upscale without realizing that wearing attire like Under Armour for the staff is nowhere near upscale and cheapens the place when the decor is kind of the opposite.  The food was good, but I'm not sure 100% what this place is trying to be. I think it's closer to being casual upscale, but they missed a few details in the process."
Wow I am sooooo disappointed! I ordered to go and my food looked horrible. I got the tuna app and it was 90 percent kale! I will never eat here again!! My club sandwich looked like I got it from McDonald's and the cornbeef was dry as hell. Def skip!
I was here for a few minutes to watch the blackhawks game and try out a new place on Saturday.I had a bbq hamburger which was awesome. There was about 7 other people there...the prices are on par with an upscale restaurant in these parts. I am not so sure it is upscale like the way The allium at the four seasons is upscale but you could see that they are trying.I had the side of sweet potato fries. They were made with a side or bordelaise sauce which had a garlic flavor. I'm under no impression that it would have been healthier than regular fries but it was awesome...I would go just for the sweet potato fries. I plan to go again in the near future to check it out some more and nut just for the hamburger.
"Service was slow.  The hubbers ordered the Tennessee  hot chicken,  which unexpectedly came out to be fried. The menu did not mention it being breaded or fried. I ordered the ribs which was a bit dry.  Both entrées came out super salty."
"I came here for lunch on a whim and am so glad that I did! We had plans to go elsewhere, but with -5 degree windchill we hopped into Doc B's. This place is so yummy! They have a counter where you can order for pick-up, or you can dine in in the back. The restaurant has a nice modern decor, clean and fresh. Our waiter was fantastic from start to finish. Very informative, laid-back, and friendly.We tried to spicy chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken salad. We also tried their specialty beer from Belgium and one of the ciders. Both entrees were SO GOOD. The salad was extremely flavorful, fresh and had so many fun and exciting toppings. Definitely one of my favorite lunch salad, which was a great surprise. My date loved his spicy chicken sandwich, and the quinoa salad that came with it was also a winner.Menu here has so many items that sound delicious for lunch. I definitely can't wait to come back, and am so glad I stumbled in!"
My boyfriend and I came here on a whim for lunch on  my birthday and boy...what a way to kick off my 30th!! I wasn't too hungry so just had their #1 tuna app and let me just say it was very very mouth watering just by the looks of it. It had a ginger dressing and it had an amazing taste! It was just the right portion too! Enough to hit the spot. My bf had the number six and he enjoyed his sandwich just as much! Great atmosphere and their mimosas were strong but tasty! Highly recommend :)
"Stumbled upon this little gem while showing some out of towners the Hancock building. We went based on the ratings that appeared on yelp so far and they presented a pretty accurate picture of the restaurant. Here is my experience. First of all, you order before you sit. It was a bit awkward at first and we all felt pressured to pick our order quickly so as not to hold up the line. That is why there is one less star.Secondly, holy cow everyone that works there was extremely helpful and pleasant. Multiple people checked in on our experience to ensure everything was up to par. Gold star on service.Now to the food and drink. The water bar really excited my guests as they enjoyed sparkling water for no extra charge. All of us ordered something different and nobody was disappointed. One person got the pork chop and sweet potato fries. The pork chop was well seasoned and the sweet potato fries were some of the best my friend had claimed to have in months. Another guest got the Tennessee hot chicken which was sweet, spicy and amazing. I personally ordered a wok out bowl with fresh veggies, chicken, brown rice and spicy Thai sauce. Overall, it was delicious balance of sauce with veggies and tender chicken pieces. There was something crunchy in the bowl that tasted like rice that hasn't been cooked enough but the table determined that the rice was in fact done. Don't know what it was but it did make me not enjoy my dish as much.Overall, this is a place I would go to again. The atmosphere is relaxed yet sophisticated. There is a good variety in eating options. To top it off the people that work there actually act like they want to be there serving a good meal. This place is a gem worth visiting."
"Awesome food. Burgers are great and so is the beer choice. All the food is of high quality. The pizza was delicious (shrimp) and so were my Danish, fall off the bone, ribs. just a great place to grab a bite down town."
"Great food, reasonable prices, friendly staff! My first 3 thoughts after having lunch during the week. I even received a coupon for a free dinner item on my next visit.I love that the lemons are in individual plastic containers. I am not a big germ fan and the thought of people putting their hands into a container of lemons grosses me out!!Definitively give this place a try if you are in the Gold Coast!"
"I'm already doing an update, and it's mostly good things! I'll start with the bad though. They stopped serving breakfast!! I was so sad when I went in this week and tried to order Bow Truss coffee, and the chef came out and said they stopped doing it, even though the breakfast menu was still up... The coffee was so good!The food that I've eaten so far has been so tasty! The best thing is the side of Kale slaw. It has fresh mint chopped up in there with a light dressing, and I could eat it for days. I also had the quinoa side and it was okay. I got the Tangled Noodle salad as well, with mango, avocado, mint, and tasty pieces of steak. It was such a surprise how good it was! I would definitely get it again. I'm excited to try the veggie burger next!"
Great service and impeccable food. Tried the wok out Hawaiian salmon with Thai sauce and shanghai lo mein. Best lo mein I ever had. So far has been the best food I have tried in Chicago. Will come back for sure.
"You know how you sometimes find yourself in or near the Magnificent Mile, in search of a tasty dinner that's a step above fast food but isn't a super elaborate or super expensive affair?  Doc B's Fresh Kitchen was made for you.  They do sandwiches and salads and a few entree plates, with simple fresh sides (I like the kale slaw).  They have good wine and beer.  And to my great surprise, they happen to mix an awesome jalapeno-basil-tequila cocktail.  The cocktail alone would have made this place worth Yelping about, and with the complete package -- it's one of those restaurants you'll be glad you bookmarked."
"A very cool place.  Wonderful atmosphere and staff.  Don't miss out on the seared Tuna and homemade guacamole.  The Dragon Burger and Veggie Burger were great.  Good beer selection.  The Evil Apple Cocktail was true to its name, the Brandy and mescal and cinnamon was a homerun.    Look forward to returning."
The food was just average. The chicken sandwich left a lot to be desired. You have to try the coleslaw though!
"Fresh ingredients, expertly prepared with excellent service. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago!The grilled California artichokes were sensational, and the gelato sandwiches were a perfect finish to the meal."
"Doc Bs. I LOVE YOU.I'm really obsessed with this place. I have a bad habit of getting the same thing at a restaurant over and over and here, it's the California Salad. This is what salad dreams are made of. The dressing on this stuff is like liquid (garlic) gold. Sometimes I even try and save half of it to take home and put on my own salads. Sometimes my friends encourage me to branch out here. So, I've tried the Tangled Noodle Salad (delicious, the avocado/mango/mint combo is heavenly) and Alexis Kitchen Salad (a close runner-up to California Salad). Heard good things about the wok bowls, too. My only gripe with this place is the music. Every time I've been here- lunch, dinner, weekday, weekend-- they are playing bumpin' techno music. It's really weird and seems off for this place."
Visited this place while exploring Chicago last week and so glad we did. Avocado pizza =amazing. Very cool atmosphere and super friendly staff! :)
"My husband & I weren't all that impressed but I think we would need to try this place again. My husband had pizza, I had a salad with quinoa. Both were not all that flavorful. We will probably visit again but not all that soon."
"Food gets 4 or 5 stars but service and kitchen timing were off; we received our app at the same time as entrees.Quinoa salad and corned beef sandwich were wonderful! Number six sandwich was yummy but chicken was small for bun, etc."
Great little place with fresh food everyone can enjoy. Pizza crust might be some of the best I've had and the soup seemed very fresh. Wait staff was nice and outside seating area is also a plus.
"We were on the Mag Mile and hungry, so while my wife shopped for leggings, I hopped on Yelp and found this place. I like the fast casual approach but with some upscale touches (real silver, real plates, full bar, etc...). Wife had veggie burger. All good. I had number 6 chix sando. Very good. Give it a try."
"This place was perfect. We were looking for a nice casual lunch in between our shopping and it was exactly what we wanted. I had the Wok out bowl and my brother had the chicken sandwich. Great spot for a quick bite or stay and chill for a while. We got a nice outdoor spot on a gorgeous day. The food was very fresh and tasted lovely. We ordered at the front then someone brought our food to us. Great service, great prices. I wish I knew this place existed when I've travelled to Chicago before!"
This place was awesome! The server was prompt and super friendly. She made recommendations based on what we were in the mood for- meat! We ended up with the rack of ribs and the filet sandwich. They  were both amazing. The ribs were falling off the bone and the filet sandwich was about the best thing I've ever eaten. And the sweet potato fries were delicious. Good beer selection and a great casual and comfortable ambiance. Definitely recommend!
"Incredible eclectic menu! Start with the Crazy Beautiful martini and go from there! I went there twice a week for 4 weeks when I first discovered the place! Salmon and kale slaw impeccable! Last night had avocado jalepino pizza, more than enough for two people and to die for! Burgers terrific! Service impeccable , prices more than fare for Gold Coast location! And have The Prisoner for mere $17 a glass, $20 at Frog Bar! But many Pinot Noirs much less! Sports TV at bar. What can I say? Love the place!"
"Doc B's, you confused and then you delighted. We found you unplanned at 9:30 on a Saturday night, in need of a light bite...and clad in workout clothes. So, your ""fast casual"" billing seemed right up our alley. We were ready to order at counter, scarf and move on. Instead, you were all yoga-pants tolerant cute bar area, table service and drinks!!  Your staff was super patient as our table lingered well past closing time. Everything's all fresh, healthy, quinoa & kale these days, but this place manages to nail kale slaw while also doing a tasty BBQ Chicken pizza. I think the housemade dressings are the secret sauce, and I wish to taste them all."
Pretty damn good. Super customer service. Backyard burger is awesome! Guac n sweet tater chips.
Amazing menu. Hands down The best sweet potatoes fries. Brussels sprouts are so delicious and the kale goat cheese pizza was very tasty. Can't wait to go back!
"Went to Doc B's for a working lunch but it would be great for a social lunch too. Very friendly staff, quick service and good ambiance. I had the #1 Tuna Salad. It was AMAZING! I definitely would go back."
We all ordered wok out bowls and they were awesome! I did chicken with spicy Thai sauce and brown rice! Husband did the filet with teriyaki and brown rice and it was really good too! Would highly recommend this place! Atmosphere is fun and casual! Food and service were fabulous! Will definitely return!
Great experience. Attentive service. Good variety of food choices and very reasonable prices. I'd come back again without question.
Clean atmosphere. Friendly helpful staff. Good food. Great atmosphere! I had a craving for guacamole and went to the Cheesecake Factory to discover very poor or I should say No service. Extremely disappointed I wandered hungrily craving guac and stumbled into Doc B's. I'm stuffed and happy! ^_^ I will definitely return with friends!! Other than being slightly chilly it was the best!
"Stylish place. Great service. Great ""new American"" food. My tip: the tuna sandwich is to die for."
"Love love love this place! Food is super fresh.  The wok out bowl with salmon, spicy Thai and brown rice is my favorite!"
Very well made drinks .... With love - great service..... Love the open/inside window seating & music ..... Good summertime vibe
"Outstanding food, very attentive service . My husband is a very picker eater and he said his meal was one of the best he's had!  The menu options would appease anybody - from the meat lover to the strict vegan. I loved the vegetable soup, quinoa salad, and turkey burger ."
"Really good.Feels like a little brother to a Bandera of Houstons. Oh wait, a former Houstons manager founded it.Service and food are top notch.It could easily be my go to spot."
Great fresh food made to order - their burger was yummy and great service too.Tried also the chicken entree with thai sauce and veggies and it was delicious
"Obsessed with this place. It is exactly what I need -- casual, healthy, yummy food that I can pick up on a busy week night or stop by for lunch. I pretty much want to try every item on the menu but for now my favorites are the grilled artichoke, california kale salad and Alexis salad. My fam says the ahi tuna salad is amazing and I already know that once it's cold out I'll be having the wok bowl way too often. Welcome to the neighborhood Doc B's. Don't ever leave me."
"This place was awesome, food was excellent inothing on the menu I was not excellent. I had the wok  bowl, salted caramel and pecan pie which were awesome family had avocado pizza and Gardenburger which were also excellent"
Great food - great vegetarian options!
"I avoided this place for close to a year, basically because I was pissed at all the noise we had to endure while the restaurant was under construction.  The pounding and noise from power tools until 9:00 PM didn't score any points with Doc B's neighbors.  I still have friends who refuse to go into the joint.  Nevertheless, I broke down and went in.  Reluctantly.  I was hungry and too lazy to venture off the street.  I have to admit, the food I've had thus far is pretty tasty.  Still not pleased with management for being disrespectful during construction, but at least they have a decent menu."
"Greasy, overly rich, unhealthy food pawned off as being fresh and healthy because there is quinoa and kale on the menu.  Think of a greasy burger, a kale salad, and a few drinks for two of us for lunch setting us back over $120.  I also ordered from there once from grubhub and specified no mayo or butter on either sandwich.  They disregarded the instructions and we promptly threw them out and ordered from somewhere else.  Doc B's does seem to be a good distraction for people who are from out of town.  If enough tourists eat there, the rest of us can get into decent places with less of a wait."
I was looking for some place new to try for dinner.  Doc B's did not disappoint.  Our dinners were wonderful.  Plan on going back for our next downtown visit!
"Love the vibe! Went for lunch and the place was jamming. We sat at the bar and ordered gluten free beers, grilled artichokes, and oven roasted chicken wings. Delicious! Super friendly staff and the menu is healthy friendly. They even have gluten free pizza crust!"
"Great little place! Good food great staff and reasonable prices. Tables are tight, get one away from the restrooms. Pizza is good for 2 , and who would of thought the guacamole  and sweet potato chips in Chicago would be a highlight on the menu!"
"Amazing. I did not want my meal to end! Healthy, fresh and delicious....you cannot pass this place up."
"Loved this place - went there for the second time for my birthday.Nice and skilled staff.Good atmosphere (although the music is a little loud).Most of all, tasty food - the California artichokes are without a doubt the best I have ever had.  I also recommend their guac (bc of the sweet potato chips, amazing), as well as any dish with the #1 Tuna."
The food and service were wonderful.  Very friendly staff that understood the menu and could assist with menu selection.  Will return very soon
"LOVE everything about Doc B's! The inside decor and outside tables are both lovely. My boyfriend and I ate outside-- everything about our meal was wonderful. We had a very friendly waitress, fast service, and loved our salad and hamburger. Will def be back again soon!"
"I really like the Doc B's concept. The menu is super appealing. The food was delicious. The staff couldn't have been more friendly/attentive. I just wish they'd chosen a different location. The interior feels a little dark/claustrophobic. If Doc B's were more windowy, it'd be my favorite new upscale casual spot. Still, I plan to go back - often. It's a good little find."
"OB-SESSED. I tell everyone about this place. I have eaten here maybe 5 times and every time is great. I have had multiple salads, fish, artichoke, sweet potato fries, and filet mignon - everything is amazing. The staff and bartenders are always friendly too, and I love the atmosphere and open-air atmosphere in the summer."
"Instantly liked this place for a quick casual meal. Friendly staff, a few good beers on draft, healthy, tasty food. Reasonable prices for the quality, too. Excellent veggie burger.Definitely coming back."
"I really enjoyed the veggie burger and sweet potato fries.   I originally ordered take out, but the place is pretty casual so I ate at the bar. The service was nice, the bartender was cool.It didn't take long for the food to come either. I'd go back"
"Here on a Friday when soup of the day is Corn Chowder.  It was fantastic. It was fresh and flavorful. So many other chowders at other places taste like butter and cream. The corned beef sandwich was good, the sweet potatoe fries were excellent.  Nice decor and atmosphere. A nice place to grab lunch during our day on Michigan Avenue."
Loved it! The green hummus appetizer was amazing. Loved my veggie burger (not even a vegetarian). The salted Carmel ice cream sandwich was great as well! Def will be going back!
"This place is amazing.  I ended up eating here every day during a recent trip to Chicago because the food was so stellar.  Their veggie burger is one of the most unique I've ever had, and the pizzas are fantastic and very filling.  There seemed to be a lot of people in training, but everyone was friendly, genuine, and on point.  During one group lunch, we had an issue with the temperature that was addressed and fixed right away.  I wish this place existed in NYC, and will make it a non-negotiable destination next time I'm in Chicago."
"I will say that the food was decent.  But the ""fast food"" + sit down concept had us confused.  The prices were way over priced for the experience we had.  I would not go here again."
"Came here for a quick bite and glad we did.  Ordered the fork and knife cobb on server's advice and it was great - ingredients tasted fresh, crisp and light.  Also had the teriyaki steak bowl with sauce on the side and was equally impressed.  Would definitely go back."
Nice open air layout.  The food we had (turkey chili and BBQ Chkn Pizza) was just okay.  The server was excellent though.
"This place is super clean & has great, healthy food.  You walk in and place your order then find an empty table. Moments later they bring you your food. Atmosphere is so inviting and they have extremely friendly servers.  People serve you but you already paid?! Guess tips could be left on the table bc there is no place on your receipt to leave it either...Now up- the veggie burger!!! It's so good, you have to believe me. Most veggie burgers taste like saw dust and fall apart. Not this quinoa, oat, beet, bean one with a mouth watering kale slaw on top a multi grain bun with cheese. Heavenly. Will maybe go again tomorrow!! Love it that much."
"My family and I were shopping on Michigan ave. last weekend and decided to stop here for lunch. The place was crowded but we were able to get a seat fairly quick without a reservation. Our table had two different types of chicken sandwiches, a pizza, and a carnitas sandwich. Everyone loved their meal. The food was fresh, hot, and the ingredients all blended well together. The service was good too for how busy it was that afternoon. Overall I think this is a great place in the area that has a more laid back vibe."
"Great food but spotty service! The manager and other servers were GREAT, very attentive and helpful. But they were also picking up the slack of our waiter. I think my roommate and I conversed more with the other servers than our own. The manager even let us test a few of their beers, the hibiscus and the guava (which they had on draft.) But our server assigned to us was a huge disappointment. Maybe she was having an off day? Other than that, amazing food and atmosphere. Cocktails were way overpriced. The mojito I got cost as much my entree."
Stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries. The veggie burger was a red quinoa base and topped with a kale salad--very fresh and filling! The sweet potato fries are totally legit. They were more like wedges and tasted fantastic. I loved the concept and the food came out fast. The service was beyond great and everyone is super friendly. I will definitely be back!
Very fresh food. Vegetable soup definitely low on the salt which I appreciate.  Turkey burger was good. Nice to eat outside.
"Mixed feelings about Doc B's after maybe 10 visits, including a couple for take-out.  It may be a matter of expectations--the items sound better on the menu than they taste. The food is better than average, but below average value, IMO.   At Doc B's price point, the items should be better.  On the plus side, the food is fresh.  The salads are quite good.  I've had a very good Fresh and Simple Salad (with salmon), a #1 Tuna Salad, and Alexis' Kitchen (probably the best value of the 3).   No complaints here. And the Wok Out Bowl option offers a lot of flexibility, and I was generally satisfied with the Spicy Thai/Chicken/Lo Mein configuration.  Have tried two burger options--the first being a Veggie Burger, which came with a sticky, gooey, over-sweet teriyaki glaze on it.  My older sister tried to warn me off this choice, but I wouldn't listen.  I think the burger would be acceptable without the glaze.  Second try was better--a Traditional Burger.  But again, the kitchen weirded this out by: 1) glazing the bun with ketchup and 2) bringing mayonaise.  Exactly when did mustard stop being the default condiment for burgers?  Fortunately, the servers are very accommodating, and they brought mustard for the burger as well as sriracha for the sweet potato fries.  Doc B's does sweet potato fries quite well.  (And massive points for being generous with the sriracha.)  To be safe, ask specifically how the burgers and buns are served, and if you prefer a more traditional Traditional Burger, ask for the condiments on the side.  They seem willing to accommodate.Some odd limitations on an otherwise diverse menu:1) They have one soup of the day which varies by day of the week.  The gumbo is good, but is available only on Wednesdays. Other options, such as Black Bean Soup were kind of meh. Along with the Soup of the Day, they also offer a Hearty Vegetable soup, which I have found neither hearty nor particularly tasty.  Also, they only offer cup-sized servings. 2) Kind of limited dessert offerings.  They offer ice-cream sandwiches with cookies, and 3-4 types of pie from an outside vendor.  I think they could stand to expand this part of the menu. 3) They don't have espresso-based drinks.  One flavor of brewed coffee, and frankly, it's been kind of weak.  It's 2015, get an espresso machine already. 4) If you decide not to eat in, Pick Up service is much better than Delivery, which is handled by one of those odious 3rd-party delivery intermediaries (not worth the hassle, in my experience.)Overall, Doc B's is an okay place.  Nice venue, though kind of loud and a bit frantic in the evenings.  Mid-afternoon is quieter.  Nice service/servers, who will go out of their way to be accommodating.   Generally good food, but somewhat out of alignment in terms of price to quality, in my opinion.  For that reason, Doc B's won't be my go-to casual restaurant, or even part of my regular rotation.   But if I end up here because of someone else's choice, I won't complain, knowing that i'll be able to find something satisfying on the menu."
"Right off Michigan Ave, Doc B's has a friendly atmosphere and a knowledgeable staff. The menu is amazing and has a lot of delicious options other than the typical burger and fries. The beauty is you order from a cashier and wait staff delivers your food and drinks.  I sat on the patio and was able to people watch, which is definitely 5 star worthy. Coming back for sure!"
"Super friendly servers! Guac with sweet potato chips was a nice start. We got to sample the beer before committing. Extremely kid friendly. Our 7 yr old finally had something to choose other than Mac n cheese and she was actually happy! I got the tuna sandwich and there were enough pieces of tuna to share with my 2 yr old. My 5 yr old and 7 yr old both got the noodles. They loved them, but ate everything and wanted more. A side of fruit or something might have been nice. My husband got the wok and was happy and satisfied. Overall great experience. We'd go back if in the area again!"
"Don't miss it. We stopped in for lunch yesterday and were pleasantly surprised. With a large menu, you're sure to find something for everyone. The salmon salad was cooked perfectly and very good. My boyfriend had the Wok It Bowl and was very satisfied. Yes, the ordering is a bit odd, but don't let that stop you from having a delicious, reasonably priced meal."
Loved the Butternut soup- they added sweet pepper purée which gave the soup a sweet but tangy taste. Very good. The restaurant is trendy and a sneaky spot away from all the tourists off Michigan av. I will definitely be visiting again :)
