Outdoor Grill
"Excellent value ($5-$10) and portions.  The only local open for lunch in the Pulaski/Milwaukee intersection.  A counter service with impeccable manners and service.3-PC CHICKEN LEG ($7.45) -- serves 2+.  Served with rice/fries, garlic bread and abundant salad.  Greek style chicken or BBQ?  Great flavor on chicken.  Greek style is default preparation, BBQ sauce added.VENUE -- counter service.  Plentiful of spacious seating.  Clean. Organize.OUTDOOR SEATING -- Comrade Yelp Elite Peter M reminded me that there is NO outdoor seating as the name implies.  SERVICE -- you are encouraged to dine with plates and utensils.  I got a to-go foam because of leftovers.  They still asked if I wanted a plate.  Such thoughtfulness and kindness are rare these days.  You are all appreciated.  Thank you!"
"I tried my first gyro sandwich about 2 months ago, and now they are one of my favorite foods.  I feel like I've wasted 24 gyro-less years of my life.  I crave them all the time now, and I have about one or two a week. But, I like to try a different place each time - in search of the best gyro. Outdoor Grill is the first place I KNOW I'll be visiting again. It's partly because it's one of the closer places to Logan Square, and also because they have plenty of parking. I had just left the gym, and was looking for a good way to gain back the calories I burned, so I yelped ""gyro"" and found Outdoor Grill. On the drive over, I was hoping that it wouldn't be a pain to find street parking. When I saw the nice private lot they had, it was a relief. But most importantly, the gyro sandwich was awesome. I like to crumble feta cheese on my gyro, so I got a side of feta from their menu and added it on. So good!"
"This place is great.  They treat each person like they care about us coming here. This is hard to find nowadays. The food is fresh off the grill always and the fries are the freshest I have seen, straight from the fryer to you basket or bag."
"Outdoor Grill is a step up from the neighborhood fast food joint (hot dogs, burgers, gyros and fries) with healthier options like salads, deli sandwiches, wraps and grilled chicken.  There is sizable seating area inside the diner.  When I went for a late lunch, there was no line and food took about 10 minutes to be ready.  The grilled chicken plate came with two sides, of which I went with salad and fries, but there is the option of rice and pita/garlic bread.  Chicken can be easily overcooked and this was well-done; tender and well-seasoned with salt and pepper.  The meal was enjoyable, but when I go out to eat, I prefer to eat things that can't be easily made at home, and this was simple enough to do so.  However, Outdoor Grill is a good choice to curb the cravings for a quick, greasy meal or just as easily, for a healthy one."
Unbelievable Italian Beefs! Great Gyros! Great friendly service! Definitely a must go in Chicago!
"Came here based on the Yelp reviews and I was going to be in the area. I had super high expectations for a great gyros place. I came in with a group of 4 and I ordered a #1 and a cream of chicken rice soup. The guy at the counter (presumably the owner) was very welcoming and friendly. He took all our orders swiftly and promised my soup immediately--which didn't exactly happen. We got our orders fairly quickly (3 #1s, an outdoor grill platter, the soup, breaded mushrooms and mac n cheese bites). And he still forgot my soup...eventually he brought it ): The owner noticed that all the seats in the restaurant only seated 4, so he told us we could grab a small table to extend the booth. After we had a few minutes to indulge, the owner stopped by and asked us what brought us here today. Since I'm usually the one in the group that looks at Yelp reviews, I told him it was my idea to come here and he said that many people had come in that day because of Yelp. And was happy to serve us. He seemed to take a liking toward my friend and his jokes, so the owner offered him a sample of a milkshake he had just made. Uhmm, okay? What about the rest of us?My gyro was decent; nothing to brag about. I tried some of the other things my friends got and again, not spectacular. I'm not usually in this area so I wouldn't drive this far for a gyro. I must admit that the menu is quite extensive and would cater to one's cravings!"
"Great milkshake, good fries. Really enjoyed by Philly Cheese Steak"
I live in the area and i ABSOLUTELY love this restaurant. They are always perfect with my order. Normally you call in an order and you go and either your food is ready and waiting or  they are still making it.  Not this place . Its being placed in containers as soon as i walk in. I love their gyro and steak and rice. OmG im hungry right now.. work needs to hurry up so i can come here !!
"Tried this for the first time because of the yelp reviews. The best thing about this place was the parking lot. It's private and has a lot of space.  The good was ok, not bad but nothing special. I got the chicken soup and it wasn't great, I wouldn't recommend it. I also got the gyro meal. That was ok, not the best gyro but it was decent. If you like big proportions then this is the spot for you. I couldn't finish the gyro meal. It wasn't expensive either, I got everything for about $11 which isn't bad. I probably won't be coming back based of the quality of the food I ordered, but if you are looking for a decent gyro at a great price, it's worth a try."
"This place has a lot to choose from and my boyfriend and I have tried many many things.  He just mentioned today that he has been craving the there fish sandwich.  Things we love....Greek Chicken, Philly Sand, Chicken Philly, Spinach Pie, Gyros, the salads, The combo Platter, the cheese burger, the root beer float, best of all the price is right. I usually sprinkle either greek seasoning or cajun seasoning on the food when I bring it home for more flavor so thats why they get 4 stars instead of 5. Oh and the SOUPS ARE SO GOOD"
What an amazing place i am currwntly eating a number 5   this place is amazing i came with my dad and little brother just passing by we live in the neighborhood but never been here first time is a charm everyone was so nice an attentive the cooks  and the owner im guessing (guy with glasses ) he cane around the tables asking what we needed and if everything was fine he gave all of my family refills and when i asked for hot sauce he gave me many different types amazing definitely coming back and also i recommended
Awesome gyro. Meat was tender and not burnt like so many other places. Sauce had a good texture. Ample parking. Its in a small strip mall. Great service and a decent amount of seating. Nice little ice cream section for the kids.
"This spot is on point! I recently moved down the street, pulled this spot up on Yelp, boy am I not disappointed. This place has many food options, but I got a burger... the Milwaukee Massacre & it was incredible. Kumas, over priced, over rated. Move over, because I got a new burger joint I'm definitely hitting up again!"
"This is my go to hot dog place, plus it's close to home. I originally ate their hot dogs but something just never tasted right. I wanted a burger and thought maybe I'll try outdoor grill again and I'm happy I did. I will only get the burger and I get random cravings for it. So it's good."
I have lived in the area for years and I love this place! The menu has a little bit of everything for everyone from burgers to a variety of tasty dinner plates. Everything I have tried has been great including their milkshakes!
"Stellar service! Great shakes!!!! GreatBurgers. The first time I tried their food I was picking up and running extremely late. Rather than let my food just sit there and get cold. Once I got there they made me a whole new fresh order!!! Exceptional..... Since then I have ordered delivery always quick, fresh and hot."
Great selection of food that the family can get whatever they want to eat at the time. The gyro is great and steak sandwich is good.
"Decided to grab some dinner while waiting for the ever-elusive 56 bus. So glad I did. The workers were amazingly nice and even helped me decide what to get ( went with a beef and sausage, as I'd never had one). Food was great. Large portions for very cheap. Will definitely be back."
"Wow! Their Burgers & Shakes are Awesome. Yes the Belly Busters, but just the Basic Burgers too! I had the Avenue Triple Cheese with their Chocolate Milk Shake! One word: Perfect. Must try: Gyro Plate, Outdoor Platter, Burgers, and Shakes!"
"Whenever I crave a Gyros plate, I go no where else but here.  Their Greek chicken is above and beyond delicious.  The service is friendly and prompt which makes it all the while a great experience. Prices are reasonable and you get what you pay for.  The place is not fancy nor does it need to be because the service and food supersedes many of the places I've visited in Chicago.  I am definitely stopping by before heading back to California."
Love this place. The guys that run this place are hilarious and are always quick with a playful jab or joke.  Food is pretty standard greasy Chicago fare and they do a pretty good job of all of it.  I'm particularly partial to the Chicken philly and double cheeseburger.
"good food. Very cheap! I love their burgers, chicken tenders and their mint choc chip shake is to die for!!!"
Looooove their grilled Chicken Sandwich. I love it. Their gyro is sooo good to.
"This place is awesome! I live really close to here and I default to this place I don't know where else to go. The people that work their are nice, it's inexpensive and the portions are generous.  I love their gyros and milkshakes. The gyro is so good. I have a ritual when I eat my gyro. It's giant and overflowing I can barely pick it up and take a bite out of it. I start off eating some of the meat with a fork then I can pick it up. Next up are the milkshakes. They are made with real ice cream and hand spun. I remember working for an ice cream shop way back in they day. I scooped ice cream, poured milk and then put it in the spinner/mixer thing and voila a delicious milkshake.This place also has burgers, hot dogs and various dinner plates. I can't stray away from the gyro and should try different things but I always change my mind last minute. There's always people in there when I'm there and lots of regulars. I notice that the guys there spit out orders before the customer can say what they want. I think that's awesome."
"I tried this place out based on the reviews and it definitely holds up. Great food, great service, the place was clean, and the prices were decent. We had gyros w onion rings, a cheeseburger w fries and cheese on the side, and a skirt steak dinner w rice pilaf.  The place wasn't crowded but they were consistently busy.  My family enjoyed our first experience here."
"The service here is Amazing! the owner is very friendly and takes the time to learn his customers by name. The food is very good. I am a fan of the gyros, hot dogs, and hamburgers. The resturaunt is always clean when i have gone there."
"Whe then Outdoor Grill came to our neighborhood, we were ecstatic. The owner and his son are awesome, friendly, and hilarious. They always have a joke for you when you come in, and they always greet you with a smile. Their menu is so extensive. There is something for EVERYONE. Lately, however, something's been bothering me about them. I've become a vegetarian in recent months, so I needed to find something else to eat (my usual used to be a gyro). On their online menu, there is a cheese and veggie sandwich. I thought it was perfect. Until my mom called to place the order. They gave her a hard time about it. Told her there was no such thing. We pointed out that it's on the menu. Since then, I've ordered it twice. The second time the ordering was fine. The last time I ordered it they acted pretty rudely about it. The owner was like ""WHAT kind of sandwich? I don't even know what you're talking about!"". It made me feel kind of stupid. My family loves it there, I even usually love it there. But people, get to know you town menu! I promise if you go to their site, you'll see a cheese and veggie sub!"
"Ok, I have to give outdoor grill a 5 star review for their customer service. Their food is great! Almost everything on their menu is delicious!! Fast, Cheap and friendly staff!"
"French fries made to order have a delightful crispy outer layer with just the right amount of hot creamy potato interior, yum!  I've ordered from here a few times and tried the gyros meal, gyros burger, and italian beef sandwich - satisfying Greek diner fare.  The service is always friendly and fast.  Oh yes, and there is a parking lot if you opt to drive there."
Decent
"I really needed a cheeseburger after my hellacious day, and I would be damned if I was going anywhere I had to interact with a human being (civilly) or walk in 30 degrees.Highlights:-Owner made me laugh while I was placing my order-I got fried zucchini instead of french fries and they were amazeballs-Ordered a salad for lunch the next day (you know, to counteract the double cheeseburger topped with bacon and a giant onion ring I just inhaled)-My delicious meal got delivered in less than 10 minutes-Prices were 100% reasonableDid I mention they DELIVERED a cheeseburger to my door? Yeah.Outdoor Grill you are the shit."
"This place is a small hidden joint, is usually run by the father and son. Closed on Sunday, but open every other day. You can see how they cook your food, and how they prepare it. It's always clean and the service is always great. Their Greek rice is delicious, French fries are nice and crispy. They have tons of lunch and dinner specials most of them come with salad. The Gyro is great and always fresh. I highly recommend this joint!"
"I love Greek food and gyros especially, but the grease and fattiness (is this a word) doesn't sit well in my stomach.  I decided to test this place since I had a craving.  The service was great and the food came out quick.  I took my gyro plate dinner home and I have to agree with previous posters.  It was great.  I will definitely go again.  The meat was perfect and the pita bread was tasty.  I wish there had been more bread since I was given so much meat.  Either way it was delicious."
"There are some places u go to, on a whim/by chance, and you just know it's gonna kill it.Ladies and gentleman of the jury, I bring you Exhibit A:  Outdoor Grill.From the outside it's your standard Greekish diner w seemingly endless variation and offerings. With one massive exception...the menu section dedicated to what they affectionately call ""Belly Busters""...which I did not order but will get to in a mo.In a bit of a rush I went w their special of the day, BLT w. soup and fries.  The guys at the counter were flat out hilarious and congenial but strictly professional all the same...clearly love their job.  A BLT, fairly standard right?  Well they manage to pull off what I'd say might just be the best BLT on the planet.  It's good and really really so.A quick mention of the chicken noodle soup, again not something wow-worthy but this was outstanding.  Egg noodles about in a delicious broth w diced carrot and celery.Ok, the Belly Busters:  check it...(one and done, though there are roughly 5 in this category).  The Milwaukee Massacre:  Double cheeseburger, mayo, ketchup, tomato, pickles, grilled onions topped with mozzarella sticks!! and a fried egg.  Effing hell, that's just beyont.  There's also a burger w gyro meat on it, which is totes necessary, obvi.Anyway the place is stellar so do yourself a favor and check it out if in the area."
"Funny owner, great little neighborhood cheeseburger, hot dog, gyro joint. Really great chicken sandwich, good dog. Owner was really nice and funny. Only thing I might suggest is that the fries were a little less generic."
"To me, the key to a good gyros is the sauce, and these guys have it down, just like the stuff I got at George's in Albany Park as a kid.  If that weren't enough, their burgers are pretty killer.  If you're spoiling for a good artery-clogger, try the Milwaukee Massacre.  It's a bit of a messy affair, what with the mozzarella sticks and the fried egg, but it's so, so delicious.My company orders a party tray of gyros from this place fairly often, and they're always prompt, polite and professional.  Above all, they're friendly, which is what'll likely keep me coming back even if I wind up moving away from this neighborhood."
"Super friendly, clean and there food is always good.!"
"Good food, parking space available, good prices, very clean place and amazing customer service."
"What I find great about this place is the above average menu selections. Not just your typical beef and burger joint, rather an emphasis on dinners. I recently discovered their dinner portion of the menu that comes with salad, fries or rice and pita bread or garlic. The serving size is more then generous so come hungry and bring a friend. I can easily tear into their gyros plate however try their Milanesa plate or Steak Fajitas.Everyday they have a cream of chicken rice soup with a lemon egg flavor. Its my favorite and will warm up the appetite.I suggest if you order a cheeseburger ask for the ""Angelo Special"". A toasted bun, grilled onions and cheese that will melt right into the burger itself! I'm getting hungry just writing this review."
"This place is a typical greasy grill full of tasty food. I got the grilled chicken and it was moist and tender and flavorful, plus the sides are tasty and filling. I have also gotten gyros here which were tasty but the side of fries was a bit on the mushy side.The employees are super friendly and you get your food fast. Solid 4"
