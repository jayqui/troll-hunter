Chicago Pizza Tours
"Too much meat?  You have Meat Sweats.  Too much pizza?  PIZZA SWEATS ARE REAL YO.  Ahhh soooo sorry that I am writing this just now!  My trip to Chi-town was back in Fall 2014.  Oh boy, they showed me a good ole' time!  The meeting spot was at Pizano's pizza, where I thought I was going to miss the whole thing because I woke up late.  We ended going to Pequod's Pizzeria, Coalfire Pizza, then Pizzeria Serio.  My favorite was definitely the deep dish pizza at Pequod's.  I still think about it to this day when I eat a basic pizza.  :( I was very impressed by the tour guide's knowledge but every thing started to become a blur around the third stop due to pizza overload.   For real, do not eat anything in the morning but maybe some green tea to prep you up.  I ended up walking around Millennium Park for at least 1.5 hour and relentlessly took tourist pictures.  Again, pizza sweats are real.  Hey don't forget to tip the driver, c'mon now they are already giving you both food AND city tour!   If I visit Chicago again, I would gladly book a tour again!  Sincerely,Recovering Pizza-holic"
"This is one awesome tour.I loved this tour, the guide was the man wish I remembered his name being born and rasied in a Chicago suburb he had such a wealth of knowledge of not only the history and facts about pizza but also Chicago as a whole. He made the tour a 5 star event.We stopped and ate pizza at four different places.Pizano's Pizza & Pasta - LoopFlo & Santo's - South LoopPequod's - Lincoln ParkPizzeria SerioWe got pizzas at every place we were lucky having a small group of only four and my girlfriend and I friends with everyone on it and had a such a fantastic time. There is also a tour that had booze included but I believe that one was sold out but that didn't stop us from getting a drink at every stop but did cost extra $$.If you ever go to Chicago and enjoy pizza definitely should go on this tour."
"My wife and I were visiting Chicago on a ""babymoon"". The goal was to live life to the fullest before the birth of our little one steals all of our youth. She is 7 months pregnant so I looked for tours that were not heavy on walking. There are not very many that are highly rated. When I asked her if she wanted to do a pizza tour, her smile while rubbing her belly that told me everything I needed to know. I had a slight mishap when booking which was 100% my fault. A quick email to Jonathan fixed it all up, and we were set to stuff our faces. Directions were very clear to the meeting spot. We sat down with our group of 20 other pizza lovers and were served piping hot slices of goodness. Jonathan is personable, funny, and down to earth. He is the type of guy that will do whatever it takes within his power to make a customer satisfied with their experience. That sort of customer service is hard to find these days. The bus picked us up after eating and shuttled us to the next location. During the ride, Jonathan talked about Chicago history, pointed out locations, and took questions. The tour met around 11AM and concluded around 2:30ish. The pizza was great at all the locations we went to. During a ride between locations he explained how they pick their stops. They do the hard job of ""researching"" different spots and try several different types of pizza before they put them on the list. They analyze the sauce, crust, and cheese and categorize them into different styles so the tour is diverse. If they have smaller groups mid-week, they are able to stop at smaller joints that are a little off the beaten path. Weekends are a mixture of which places can accommodate the larger groups. This makes perfect sense to me and also tells me you could take this tour more than once and get a different experience both times. I would recommend doing this tour early in your trip if possible. This will allow you to go back to places you saw or ate at that you liked. We also asked Jonathan on some advice on things to do while we were there and he delivered some good suggestions. We had a great time and want to thank Chicago Pizza Tours for the great service. I will be recommending it to anyone that is planning a visit."
"So much fun and so much pizza!! The tour guide Jon was amazing... He was really knowledgeable and knows how to keep it fun.  The pizza was awesome! We stopped at 4 places all having different styles of pizza, no chains or franchises.... That means  no Giordano's...which was fine by me. I would highly recommend Chicago Pizza Tours!"
"What a fun night! 4 pizza places on our tour. 4 slices, 4 cocktails. Great info on the city. The pizza was amazing. Highly recommend."
"Best tour I've been on in any city, not just Chicago! The pizza was obviously awesome, and the portions are great. You definitely get what you pay for. Our tour guide was Danny, and he knew everything there was to know about the city and its pizza, which made for a lot of entertainment and will definitely help me in my trivia down the road! Thanks Chicago Pizza Tours, you guys are the bomb"
"I learned about this tour through Yelp and whenever I see a 5 star rating, I'm intrigued. This tour was the perfect combination of great local food and interesting information about Chicago which we appreciated since we are from out of the area. While the pizza was the main attraction, John, our guide, was the best part of the tour. It was a great way to taste Chicago's pizza and learn about this beautiful city. Would definitely recommend to both visitors and locals."
"I booked this tour at home in San Diego when I should have been on my lunch break. Hence the food tour. I knew that Chicago was known for their pizzas and I wanted a taste of the best! This gives you exactly that. (Actually a little bit more than a taste) Great variety- not all deep dish! Jon, our tour guide, was great. He not only gave history about pizza in Chicago, but he gave us little tidbits of facts as we toured the city. You get a little tour of Chicago and then pit stops to eat! If we came back, I'd do this again. As long as the stops change (which they do) but Coalfire can always stay! You guys should add more tours! Like a neighborhood tour and the stop could be the best known food for that area. The sky's the limit!"
I am a huge foodie and this tour was like heaven. Chicago has the best pizza (2ND to NYC  sorry!)  I definitely recommend this by our if you're a foodie like myself.
"What a great idea!! This was such a fun event and Kevin, our tour guru, was a blast! Such good food, all different kinds of Chicago pizza and any drink you'd like for free!! Definitely come here and signup for a fun weekend excision!"
"I'd give this 4.5 stars!I was initially all about just visiting the staples that friends had suggested: Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Giordano's... but I am really happy that my travel buddy urged me to do this as the tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable about Chicago and the history of pizza. I also would not have known that 70% of the pizza consumed in Chicago is actually Tavern style (think Round Table). Deep Dish was first created in Chicago and I believe that's the reason for it's popularity. Anyway, I've always known I wasn't a deep dish girl. So going to a few places where we had 4 different types of pizza: Tavern, Stuffed, Deep Dish, and (NY Style?) was on point. I was a little worried that I wouldn't enjoy the tours choice of pizzaria's but they're all about 4 stars with a decent amount of reviews on yelp. You're just left with not being able to choose the type of pizza. But they do a pretty good job of catering to the customers and ask what certain ppl detest and what they're in favor for. The places we stopped at were Bongiorno's, Serio, Flo & Santos, and Pequods. HUGE fan of Flo and Santos (Tavern Style). It's a little far from downtown relative to other places but CTA accessible and worth it in my opinion compared to others. I enjoyed it better than GIno's (shhhh). My friend and I did the Cocktails and Pizza tour. They buy a drink for you along with a couple slices of pizza at each location. A little pricey at the $80/pp you pay but if you really think about it, their margins are small. Don't forget to tip! Glad I did it and would recommend it to anyone willing to try something outside of the Chicago famed deep dish pizzas as well as a great way to meet other people!"
"Sis planned the tour for her hubby, myself & herself as we all love pizza. The magical pizza journey began at Pizano's with three additional unique adventures into pizza greatness. Be sure to arrive with an appetite as there with be plenty of pizza served. Each stop offers a different type of pizza with a history lesson along the way. Water is served at each stop with the opportunity to purchase soft drinks or alcohol. It was a nice way to enjoy the sights of the city along the way while being provided a historical background. Being originally a Chicago area native I knew something was amiss when the tour guide gave his information regarding the lions to the entrance to The Art Institute of Chicago. Hopefully, he was having an off day & will look into their significance. Overall, he did an excellent job & we would recommend the tour to everyone!"
Had a great time! I would recommend this 5 restaurant tour without any reservation. Our favorite pizza was Coal Fired Pizza. Excellent!
"Overall, my party loved our Chicago Pizza (and drink) Tour experience.5 Stars for the Concept and the Crew4 Stars for Execution3 Stars for the Mix of Pizza JointsThe host and driver were awesome, and did a fantastic time bringing in history behind the city, the pizza shops and their owners.  There's definitely no othet way to try so many varieties of Chicago pies in such a short amount of time.From an execution perspective, I would of liked to see a little better planning relative to ordering and placement of the pizzas.  On a few occasions, a highly covered pie was crunshed by a large family on our tour before even even made it our way (leaving us with the less unique options).  Relative to the mix of stops...  There's no guarantee what places you'll visit (they announce it when you arrive).  Our tour went to two rocksrar pie shops (one I had never even heard of), but it also went to two completely misses (deep dish and stuffed).  In both the latter occasions, the food and the staff were complete misses.  No knowledge of their food/drink menus and, perhaps the pizza is normally good, but I felt they had perhaps been out waiting for our group a little too long.Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this tour to anyone.  I would just like to see a little better execution and selection of joints to give it the 5 star nod."
"I loved the tour. The host was funny and knowledgeable and always had a funny fact or statistic about pizza to share. We hit some nice places (Pizano's, Flo&Santo's, Pequods Pizza, Pizzeria Serio) and could try a variety of pizzas (tavern style thin crust, deep-dish, neapolitan thin crust) with different toppings (sauerkraut, sausage, giardiniera, mushroom). I think the tour is a great way to explore the city a little differently than usual and to try more than one pizza. Since Chicago is not only famous for its deep-dish, it is nice to have the possibility to try it all without having to buy a whole pizza every time. Plus, when trying the pizzas in such a short time, one can really see, feel and taste the differences.Also, I enjoyed the company of all the nice people in the group. I was the only one that came alone on the tour, plus the only foreign person, everyone else was from the Chicago area (more or less). So, this was even more interesting and I really liked socializing with the people in the group. They made me feel at ease even though I was the only lonely traveller. I never felt left out!Well, to finish off. I simply loved the tour and do think it is worth the money. Got to go to some places I would probably not have tested if I were to decide alone where to eat my Chicago pizza (because the places we went to are not the most marketed ones)Enjoyed the overall experience a lot and would recommend it to everyone.Fun fact: It was pure luck that I stumbled across this tour on Yelp while looking for restaurants to eat my deep-dish pizza at. Glad this happened!"
"My husband and I had seriously the best time ever on the pizza tour. Our tour guide, Danny, was very knowledgable about both pizza and the city. Every stop we made was delicious.We had pizza at pizano's (oprah's favorite), flo and santos (Italian and polish fusion), pequods (Adam richman's favorite), and piece (new haven style pizza.) Every pizza was downright delicious. My favorite was the flo's polish which was topped with kielbasa, sauerkraut, and applewood smoked bacon. YUM!!We also got a great tour of Chicago along with our pizza offerings. Danny knows the city really well so we got lots of great information on the bus.If you are going to take a tour of Chicago, this is the one to take. We ate the most incredible pizzas, saw an awesome city, learned new things, and had a great time. J can't recommend it enough."
"Absolute must do for everyone. If your a visitor to Chicago there is no better way to get an interesting tour of the city and get initiated in the origins of Chicago Pizza. I assure you, you will not be able to eat all the pizza available to you on this tour. For vegetarians, they accommodated me at each location, all the pizza was very different  and yet all were very good. Would do this again. I might do it tomorrow."
"Took this tour on my first trip to Chicago and it was great! We got to try a mix of deep dish and thin crust pizzas (there's only so much deep dish you can eat in a 3-4 hour span). I thought that I knew a lot about pizza until we met our guide, Jon. Well worth it if you're in Chicago and love pizza."
"We went on the afternoon tour as part of a bachelorette party, and had a blast! The tour owner I'm pretty sure knows EVERYTHING there is to know about pizza and pizza in Chicago, which I like geeking out about and learning. On the tour, you get to visit 4 places, which all had different styles of pizza to enjoy- coal fired, deep dish, thin crust, stuffed... you get one to two slices per place which is filling, but still allows you to keep on going at the next place!You get education during the bus ride, and get to see different ovens at some of the places. It's a nice chance to see some of the neighborhoods in the city too. I would highly recommend this to anyone- tourist or local!"
"Second time taking this tour - it was nice to see the owner Jon but was bummed when he said he would not be doing the tour but his associate Jonathon was heading up the days adventure.Happy for Jon as business is going well and Jonathon (Jon) did a great Job!!  Hit 4 solid spots, learned more about the History of Chicago, Pizza in Chicago and had a great experience.  Truly worth every dollar in addition to TIPS for Will the driver and Jon the tour guide.This is an absolute MUST DO in Chicago for Locals and people visiting.  Up there with a sporting event, The Bean, Sue, The Observation Decks.  YES - there are the nay sayers who have lived in Chicago for 11 years etc... etc... like the nice gentleman who was with his family at the Bean.  After showing him the itinerary I had just completed he responded ""I have never heard of those places before...""  So enough said - Book the Tour and Enjoy!!!!!   Just tell them John from CA sent ya, HA!"
"It was the first visit to Chicago for myself, the bf and a gf so I knew that we had to indulge in deep dish pizza.  My only previous exposure was at the chain UNOS pizzeria in my hometown and that was just not very good.So we bought tickets online for the pizza tour that promised spots at four different locations with transportation via tour bus.  At the starting location, we met with the owner and the very knowledgeable pizza tour guide.  He was personable and used to be tour guide for the city so he happily divulge non-pizza related facts about the city.Surprisingly the tour was very filling considering we only went to four locations.  Our tour consisted of two slices of deep dish pizza and 4 slices of tavern style pizza.  The tour ran a bit longer than stated, about an hour later.  I wasn't complaining though since I found the tour and guide very entertaining.  But for though who make any time sensitive plans, be aware.I'm glad we went on this tour.  It ended up being my favorite part of the Chicago visit..But then again, I really really like pizza."
"A must if you are in town for the first time.We did the night time Pizza & Cocktails tour.Our tour guide was Kevin, the owner's brother.  He was a real cool guy, funny, and informative about not just pizza but the town itself.The pizza stops were well thought out, adding a bit of every kind of Chicago pizza.The group for the night time tour was relaxed and cool, as I would imagine most groups for the evening tour are there for a good time.  I wish we had done the tour earlier in the trip because we made some friends along the way.You will be stuffed and it will be money well spent."
"A truly great experience. I've lived in Chicago for over 8 years and I've now gone on this tour twice. The first time, I went reluctantly when my suburb friends booked the trip. Ended up having a blast and learning things about Chicago I never knew. The second time I took my niece and we had a great time touring around the city and sampling some of Chicago's best pizza. One of the best parts of this tour is that Jon and ""Soap"" (the driver) take you out of downtown and into the neighborhoods where real Chicagoans eat.  This tour is a really fun thing to do in Chicago and I would highly recommend going."
"Wow!This is the best tour you could possibly take while in Chicago. We met our tour guide Danny at our first stop and he introduced himself and made a point to learn everyones name and what they ate. It was great having him as our guide; he was cool, knowledgeable, and funny, and made sure to send extra slices my way. Our tour began with deep dish and thin crust at Pizanos, which were excellent. Leaned about how the history and owners of Pizanos and their relationship with the history of deep dish pizza in Chicago, really cool stuff!From there we went to 3 other joints in 3 different neighborhoods for 3 very different pizza styles and all of them were excellent. I particularly enjoyed our stop at Flo and Santos, where we had a chance to eat 3 different pizzas, topped with ingredients ranging from Italian beef to Polish sausage. Along the way you get to learn about different pizza factoids, various tidbits about the history of the city and its diverse neighborhoods, all while stuffing your face with great food!We had a great group of people, representing Calgary, Toronto, Philly, Utah, Houston, even 2 native Chicago citizens who were doing the tour for the first time. Could have easily been a 5 star review if it was just a little less expensive, as it cost $126 for my wife and I before tipping our guide and buying a soda at one joint (only water included). If you fancy yourself a true foodie however, you should spoil yourself, pack your Pepto (you WILL be full), and get ready to have a great day...just don't make dinner reservations that night."
We did the pizza and cocktails tour. It was a blast. Our guide was fun and energetic.  There was plenty of pizza to eat and our choice of cocktails at each stop. We were happily stuffed by the end of the tour. Everyone had a great time whether from Chicago or out of town.
"This was an AWESOME pizza tour. John, our tour guide, was funny, knowledgeable, and friendly. He remembered all our names, and where we were from, and even that it was my husband and I's 1-year anniversary (what better way to celebrate than with pizza glory?!?!)...a surprising feat since I can't even remember my mother's birthday date. Anyway, I digress. As a NYer, I was pretty skeptical since we have awesome pizza. I was proven wrong.We met at Pizano's in the Loop (just a few blocks from ""the bean""...or, the real name, Cloud Gate). Don't worry, I will not be giving away any of the super fun secrets John has about the places. But I will have to say, you get a TON TON TON of appreciation of each of the pizza places after understanding the ingredients, recipe, and how the pizzeria got started. Pizano's was my favorite. We tried a deep dish and thin-crust tastings. Pepperoni thin-crust!We then went to: Coalfire pizza, Pequod's, and Pizzeria Da Nella Cucina Napolentana. All were VERY different pizzas, which my hubby and I appreciated because eating 4 deep-dishes in a row would probably become painful and even monotonous. Coalfire was a crisper thin crust (since it uses coal for the heat), Pequod's was your standard deep dish glory, and Nella's was a wood-fire pizza (thin crust but had the consistency of naan bread since the moisture from the wood.). Nella's pizza is awesome. My 2nd favorite pie, and my hubby's 1st favorite.So seriously folks, go on the pizza tour. It is about 3-hours and simply so much fun. John is awesome and a true foodie enthusiast. He will teach you all about the pizzas, as well as some fun Chi-town information as the bus drives you from one location to the next. Be prepared to be ridiculously full afterwards. My husband and I went to one of the beaches right afterwards and felt shameful with our food baby bellies."
"This is my first time in the city and with 2200 pizzerias in Chicago there was no way for me to know which one to go to. My friend found out about the pizza and cocktail tour and we saw it was a good deal. I definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in finding out more about the pizza culture here, or anyone who just loves pizza, good drinks, and nice, exciting people!! Also, I was surprised to see that there were many Chicago natives on this tour as well!! Oh yeah, the pizza is delicious and the tour guide, Kevin, was nice!! If you are going to the night tour save your appetite. It's a lot of food!!"
"I really enjoyed the ""best pizzas"" that we tried in the city.  They really hit the taste buds and was a delightful food experience.  We went to 4 places total.  Some were okay in my opinion and others were mouth-watering good.  The good thing about doing a tour like this is that you get a mini-tour of the city as well.  We learned a few ins and outs of Chicago.  The fellow patrons were just awesome as well.  I really had a great time other than trying to digest all the pizza I ate. :)  Recommended if you like pizza and want an intro to the city."
"So much fun and so much pizza!! The tour guide was awesome... Very knowledgeable and knows how to crack a joke or two.  The pizza was amazing!! Stop at 4 places all having different styles of pizza, no chains or franchises.... Meaning no Giordano's...which was ok to me. I would highly recommend the Chicago Pizza Tour!! Take it twice!!"
"I booked this tour hoping to get good food and an idea of the lay of the land since it was my first trip to Chicago. It easily blew my expectations out of the water! Kevin was our tour guide and he was friendly, funny and knowledgeable. The pizzas got better and better as we went along and the drinks were included, which was lovely. I even got a double shot at one stop for no extra charge. The group was a mix of tourists and locals, all friendly and happy to be there. Would definitely recommend it, especially if you're new to Chicago."
"The early morning rain didn't put a damper on the spirits of the food lovers who gathered for the pizza tour. Having been on food tours that offered small samples and limited information about what we were eating, I was hoping for better from Chicago Pizza Tours. Our guide, John (not the owner) made the experience totally worth the price. He began by telling us the history of pizza in Chicago and he tied it into the history of Pizano's, the first stop on the tour.Starting at Pizano's, we had the option to sample the deep dish sausage or basil, tomato and garlic. The pizza was good but the crushed tomatoes in place of traditional pizza sauce didn't add enough flavor to the finished product. The thin crust pepperoni wasn't memorable. After leaving Pizano's, we hopped on the bus and went to Coalfire for a unique thin crust pizza with spreadable salami on top. The texture of the meat was soft and the consistency didn't work too well for me. It kinda tasted like a buffalo chicken wing and it had the grease go with it. That was not my idea of a great pizza.  The nice thing about that stop however, was that we were able to see how they make the pizzas in the coal fire oven in only 90 seconds! The best pizza of the day was from Pequod on Clybourn Ave. The sauce was thick enough to stand up to the cheese, which was perfectly melted on top of the pizza and it created a crispy, almost burnt crust that was crunchy and tasty. We finished the four hour tour at Flo & Santo's, a place that I had been to previously. We tried the thin crust, tavern style polish/italian fusion pizza with sauerkraut, kielbasa and bacon as well as the italian beef with giardiniers, tomatoes and onions. Food tours offer an opportunity to gain culinary knowledge, to hear about the city's history, to meet a group of like-minded people from around the city or the country and to try incredible food while doing so. Chicago Pizza tours got most of this right.  Perhaps offering the margherita pizza at Coal Fire and calling ahead so that the pizzas were ready upon our arrival could have made for a better experience.  But, overall, this pizza tour did not disappoint."
"This was the second best city tour I've ever been on.  Only second to a cocktail tour in my hometown New Orleans.  Booze always wins.  All of the delicious pizzas made it impossible for me to eat pizza at home ever again.  I still dream about that Italian beef pizza (drool).  For 60 dollars I got seven slices of pizza (with the option for seconds), a ride all over the city, and history of Chicago.  It was like taking a food and city tour all in one.  The tour maxes out at 16 so its very intimate.  We met two local couples who gave recommendations of where else to go in the city.  My mom recently moved to Chicago and I can't wait to go back so I can go on this tour again."
"Pizza+Cocktails+A Little History+ A Lotta Laughs = Awesome!(Review is for the Pizza & Cocktail Tour)Husband & I spent the last night of a 4 day whirlwind trip to Chicago with our tour guide Kevin & a party bus full of about 18 (total) fun tour mates!  We had Boston, Chicago, Ohio, Florida, New Jersey & Indianapolis represented. Visited 4 restaurants (Flo & Santos, Bella Bacinos, Pizano's and Pequod's)  and experienced: Thin Crust, Stuffed, Deep Dish and Pan Pizza. We were able to order whatever beer/cocktail we wanted at each stop as well. I'm still dreaming about the Deep Dish Cookie Sundae dessert that we also had at Pizano's!   I would go back to any of the four restaurants in a heartbeat.   (Hope to make it back to visit Chicago sooner rather than later...loved it!)You will Laugh (a LOT); learn a little Chicago history that you probably don't get on other tours, and experience some down right DELICIOUS Pizza! Kevin, our tour guide, and ""Q"" our driver were both great, funny and laid back.    It was well worth the price for the evening considering we got:   Party Bus, Personal Tour Guide, Great Driver, As much Pizza as we wanted  (We definitely tried to pace ourselves at each stop knowing we had more to come.); any type of cocktail/beer/wine that we wanted at each stop and some great entertainment learning about the history of pizza and some cool things about Chicago and places we passed on the way.   It also helped that we ended up with an awesome, funny group of people.You will leave STUFFED and Happy....guaranteed!   I would definitely do it again!"
"this tour is a 'must' thing to do in Chicago - the owner, John, is like a walking Encyclopedia of Chicago and pizza.  And the pizza places were out of this world yummy."
"BEST PIZZA TOUR EVER! Jonathan was great setting up and meeting all my demands. Kevin, our tour guide and Q, our driver were awesome. Very good sense of humor and very knowledgeable. I had a group of out of state friends and they all enjoyed it plus, got a mini tour of the city. This demanding Bridezilla highly recommends it, you won't be sorry!"
"Pizza tour was a lot of fun. Our guide, John was very knowledgable on both pizza and history of Chicago!"
"After reading all of the glowing reviews and given the almost unimaginable perfect five star rating on over fifty reviews, I went into the pizza tour with very high expectations. More times than not it seems that high expectations going in lead to let down, but my experience with the Chicago Pizza Tour far exceeded anything I had imagined. Jon, the proprietor and today's guide, did an amazing job. He involved everyone and made people feel as though they were a group on an adventure and not just a pack of strangers being chauffeured from one location to the next for food.  Another thing I really enjoyed was the fact that though the tour centered around pizza, it wasn't just about the pizza. Jon did a great job of sharing history about Chicago and pointing out points of significance along our route. As for the tour itself, we made four stops at some of Chicago's more prominent, highly acclaimed and unique pizza establishments. We had two types of deep dish pizzas, both unique from each other, one thin crust pizza from a stone oven and one that was grilled. At two of the stops we actually had the opportunity to go in the kitchen and see the pizzas being prepared. Jon really knows his pizza and did a phenomenal job of explaining the history of Chicago pizza in general, the history of each of the establishments we visited and the different types and cooking styles of the pizzas. All in all, the tour was a very unique, fun and entertaining experience.  I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. Jon was a great tour guide and I will definitely be rooting for his continued entrepreneurial success."
"For our first time in Chicago, me and my partner decided to go on the pizza and cocktails tour. It was the best decision we could have made! Kevin, our pizza guide, was spectacular. He was easy to talk to, down to earth, and just an all around fun guy. While traveling from one pizza place to the other, he gave fun facts about the buildings and sites we were passing. We had 4 different types of pizzas, which were all phenomenal. I didn't even know there were so many varieties that Chicago specializes in, which is why we went on this tour! It was a great experience, everyone on the tour was super friendly. I will recommend this tour to friends and family. Thumbs up!"
"We both loved the tour! The four restaurants we went to all had different styles of pizza and all were really good! Our guide Jonathan was awesome, funny and seemed to know a lot about the history of the city and of pizza. Highly recommend doing this."
"Mike our tour guide took us on a fun and tasty 3 hour journey through pizzerias across Chicago. Each place had their own take on this yummy staple.We enjoyed, deep dish, coal fired, grilled and thin crust pizzas. All unique and no two alike. This was a fun tour, Mike did a great job pointing out sights in the city and a little info at the places we visited. We visited : Pizanos, Coalfire, Redflame and Pequods."
"Chicago Pizza Tours is the best pizza tour in Chicago.  There is a list of potential pizza places that may be visited, and on our tour we hit 4 places- Rudy Malnati, Jr.'s Pizano's for both deep dish and Chicago style thin crust, Flo and Santo's for Chicago style thin crust, Pizzeria da Nella Cucina Napoletana for wood fired Neapolitan pizza, and Pequod's for Chicago style deep dish with their own unique twist.  All of the above mentioned restaurants served wonderful pizza, with Pizano's being the official starting point on every tour.       But what really made the whole experience worthwhile and worth every dime was the owner of Chicago Pizza Tours- Jon.  Jon is funny and entertaining on all levels, and his knowledge of the Chicago pizza scene and the history of pizza in Chicago is unmatched by anyone else in the tourism business.  Jon also has extensive knowledge of all the various neighborhoods visited, and is very accommodating to any individual needs you or your party may require.       At the beginning of the tour, Jon will know each one of your names, and you will feel like you've known him for a long time, even though the beginning of the tour will mark the first time you have ever even talked to the guy.  And if you're visiting Chicago for the first time, and you're looking for other authentic Chicago foods from Italian beef to hot dogs to Italian subs, then Jon is the right person to ask.  He lives and breathes his tour business, and he takes a lot of pride in making sure you and your group have only the best of times while here in Chicago.       You WILL walk away very satisfied and very happy that you chose Chicago Pizza Tours over the other lesser/less qualified options.  Excellent experience all the way around, and worth every dime of your hard earned money.  And most importantly, you will have fun- Jon and the rest of his tour guides will see to that."
Jonathon did a great tour for us.  It started off a little rocky when the Pizano's deep dish pizzas weren't done correctly.  How did they overcome?  We went on the tour and ended back at Pizanos where the owner of the tour took care of the issues and got us the deep dish done correctly.  Overall this was a great tour - I learned a lot about the history of Chicago and ate some great pizza.  I learned a lot about pizza too - I would definitely recommend this as a great tour.
A really great tour with no preferential treatment to one particular destination.  Learned  a lot about the city of Chicago along they way.
"Little is known about Crustaleous, the Greek god of pizza. In the early 1800s, a decayed scroll was found buried in an Athenian tomb, describing this joyful diety, ruling from a thousand degree coal/wood/grill/brick oven on Olympus.This scroll contained within it a prophesy - One day, Crustaleous will send a son to preach the word of pizza to the mortals down below.If that mortal isn't Jon from Chicago Pizza tours, I don't know who is. It takes a special kind of crazy to abandon one's job, buy a tour bus, hire a mad(awesome) driver, and take people on 3-hour pizza tours.The tour consists of 4 spots(which apparently rotate often), plenty of pizza knowledge and more pizza than one human can reasonably consume. I left it with a greater understanding of pizza and what differentiates one preparation technique from the next. He makes special efforts to insure a variety of pizza styles on your tour.Don't let the price scare you. Jon gets you right into popular locations and shuttles you all around town(with a nice sprinkle of Chicago tour sites/trivia). If you attempted this yourself, you'd blow a lot of time and money waiting in lines and transporting yourself around."
"My wife and I had previously taken our preteen nephews on a bus tour a couple of years ago.  We had some friends in town from Baltimore and thought that this would be a perfect opportunity to check out the new tour offered by Jon and Chicago Pizza Tours.  This tour started off at the same pizza place as the last time, Pizano's, but we experienced a different type of pizza.  The Mark's Special, a deep dish pizza with fresh tomatoes, basil and garlic was very good.  Pizano's has a nice microbrew selection and our beers paired well with the pizza.  After that we had a nice walk around downtown Chicago to burn off those calories before we headed to Bacino's and finally over to Macy's for a hot chocolate.  I would definitely do this again."
"Great tour-totally worth the price. Went here with my fiance and future sis in law and we all enjoyed ourselves.  The pizza definitely hit the spot-over and over again. Mike, our guide, was great and the tour bus was clutch in the cold weather! I wouldn't change anything, except maybe our fellow tour mates but hey we can't always get what we want."
"My California-based company hosted a pizza tour during a healthcare IT conference in Chicago for current and potential clients. As the company's only Chicago-based consultant at the time, I was invited to join. Little did they know that they were bringing a Chicago pizza fanatic on board. The guides were wonderful. The pizza from Pequod's and Pizano's was awesome, as usual. When I heard that we'd be going to Gino's East, I was disappointed, but not surprised. Their pizza is tasteless crap, but they're an institution and I get why CPT feels they have to go there. At the end, everyone left with good memories and bellies full of mostly great pizza. I would definitely recommend going on a Chicago Pizza Tour with out-of-towners."
"I booked this for a corporate dinner for 17 people who were in town for a meeting.  Typically we book a private table at a restaurant but wanted to do something different and fun this time around.Everyone had an absolute blast and even now, over a year later, people are still talking about it.  In fact, it has become the gold standard for group dinners."
"My boyfriend went on this tour this past fall and it was absolutely amazing.  We are both locals in the Chicago scene and with a serious pension for pizza so we were ready to kind of just lag back and not really pay attention but that was not the case!Our tour guide was super engaging and knowledgeable not just about the pizza but also about the city and where these pizzerias were located.  He even turned us on to our new favorite pizza place, The Boiler Room.We are definitely coming back when the weather is nicer!"
"Our 18 year old niece was in town from out of state so we thought ""what teenager doesn't like pizza?""   So we booked the Chicago Pizza Tours based on all the wonderful Yelp reviews.We had a great time.  We visited : Pizanos, Coalfire, Redflame and Pequods.  Very different pizza at each stop.  Mike was our tour guide and did a great job.This is a nice tour for both locals and visitors.  As a matter of fact, I think there were more people from the Chicago area on this tour than there were people from out of town.Pros:  Great food, nice guide and bus driver, restaurants were very accommodating.  Bus was air conditioned and pizza was all amazing.Cons: There were some last minute people added to our tour and it was PACKED.  I mean, the bus was very uncomfortable for a few people who had to squish an extra 2 people in.  Not good on a 97 degree, humid day.  And it was mentioned to the whole group a couple of times that these two people were from out of the country and could only make it that day, which made them seem a little embarrassed.Another big con for me was the fact that some of our fellow group members don't know basic sanitation practices and kind of grossed us out at times.  I will be emailing Jon to let him know that maybe CPT should coach/educate people to not touch things in the kitchens we tour, or play with their long, curly, black hair while literally standing over the crust that will be our pizza within minutes.  I thought the tour guide should have said something to her and the guy leaning on the prep table.Otherwise, a highly recommended tour.  Thanks, CPT!!"
"DO IT!!!I've been on the tour 2 times now and it gets better and better every time. This most recent time i was lucky enough to go when they were having a trial run for their upcoming Christmas themed tour. Not only did i learn more about Chicago this time, but at every wake and turn it tied into Christmas. Jonathan, our tour guide was THE BEST HANDS DOWN!!! I've never had a tour guide take the time to talk to everyone individually, remember all of your names and keep everyone laughing. I would suggest this tour to anyone and everyone. It's a great way to see some of the city you would of otherwise walked right by. GET YOUR TICKETS PEOPLE!!!"
"Yummy and Fun All Rolled Into One!The tour started with a high five from Jon and ended on a very full stomach.  We hit four very different pizza joints in in the city and not one was less than stellar.  Jon's enthusiasm, history tidbits and friendliness made for a supremely fun addition to the excellent food.  Any trip to Chicago should include this tour!"
"Jon is awesome, I will definitely recommend this tour to anyone that is visiting Chicago. Also I loved how he didn't just talk about pizza the whole time, he would also tell us some touristy stuff that had nothing to do with pizzas so it was a great 3 hours spent!Oh and our driver was pretty crazy, he cut off a bunch of people and got honked and yelled at. Glad we all made it safely to our stops! haha"
"Get ready to eat your face off! Seriously, this is a great tour. We just moved here a few months ago and have hit all of the touristy pizza spots so far. Thankfully we decided to take the pizza tour to see what else was out there. The owner, Jon, is the most knowledgable person I have ever met or read about in regards to pizza. This guy knows a ridiculous amount of information about everything from the history of Chicago pizza to cheese, crust, and sauce. He knows all the great spots in town that are not the typical tourist traps. On the tour you will hit 4 different pizza restaurants and sample different flavors and styles. When you are done, you will be so full that you will not eat dinner that night. If you are visiting Chi or you live here, this tour is absolutely worth it. Thanks Jon!"
"WONDERFUL TOUR-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!We booked this tour for a company team outing. From the beginning, all my questions I had and email to Jon, the owner, were answered in a very timely manner. The booking process was super easy. As we are a group from Chicago, I figured we'd just have a good time going to a few places and eating pizza. It was SO much more than that. Jonathan, our tour guide, was fantastic!! Extremely informative and the amount of information he gave us was terrific! I also had no idea that we would also get a full tour of the city and all the neighborhoods we went to. There was a different man driving the bus so Jonathan was able to give us a full tour of all the history of buildings, etc... as we drove by. I cannot say enough good things about Jon, Jonathan and the Chicago Pizza Tour."
"We went on the Pizza Tour this weekend as a Christmas gift from my awesome brother who knows how much husband and I love food.  It was delicious and informative and filling and delicious...Reading all of the reviews, I am so sad we didn't have Jon as our guide.  Jon's cousin did the tour and (while knowledgeable) was still pretty green.  I'm sure he'll be great eventually, he just seemed a bit nervous and awkward while learning the ropes.As for the tour itself and the pizza, we made four stops at Pizano's, Coalfire, Red Flame and ending with Pequods.  We got thin crust and deep dish at Pizano's, a coal fired Neopolitan style pizza (obviously) at Coalfire, two grilled pizzas at Red Flame and the burnt cheese deep dish at Pequods.  Overall, an awesome variety of Chicago pizza joints and definitely filling.Our driver Jim was really awesome too, we all decided we want his job."
"Really, a fantastic tour. How else do you get to learn about Chicago and how pizza evolved in the city while getting to nosh on some slices at the same time? I guess you could watch a documentary on PBS about Chicago while eating a Jack's frozen pizza but you'd be doing yourself a disservice - and seriously, a Jack's pizza? Are you 12 years old? Are you at a junior high lock in? Come on, even the 99% can afford a better pizza than that. The places that were picked were all very different from each other giving the people on the tour a chance to really taste and see the difference of pizza. As a local I got to try pizza I've never had the opportunity to try and I also got to eat some pizza from my favorite haunts. In a city where pizza places are all over - more than 2,000+ in Chicagoland alone (Thanks Jon for the info), it can tough for anyone to eat at and try them all - and most of them are gross. Jon is a great guide - lots of information on not only the pizza places themselves but also the pizza being served, the history and stories behind the places and the food and great overall knowledge of Chicago history. Definitely one of the most fun tours a person can do in the city and you get fed! The opportunity to see another side of a great city like Chicago and it's deep food history is definitely worth the price of admission. Also, the ride in the pizza bus is always interesting especially since it's driven by possibly the best driver in Chicago. He really knows his way around a bus horn.A must do."
Awesome tour.....great way to experience Chicago style deep dish and thin crust!! Much better way to go then tasting the usuals ( ginos...unos and girodianos). If you have the time book this tour!!
"My wife booked seats for the two of us and my parents on the tour for my birthday. Hands down, it was the best experience! Jon is a fantastic guide - friendly, funny and amazingly knowledgeable about Chicago, and how pizza is entwined in the city's culture, economy and history. He is clearly very passionate about what he does, and it shows. There was a great mix of restaurants, with stops across the city. I've lived in Chicago all of my life, and this was my first visit at each of the stops along the tour. I was particularly impressed with the diversity of pizza - each place had a unique approach to sauce, crust, cheese, etc. Plus, the group got to tour the kitchens at some of the stops - it was really cool to see the creative baking methods, and how this translates into the flavor and texture of the pizza we sampled. Also, my wife and I are vegetarians, which we've found can sometimes make group dining a challenge. We had absolutely no problems arranging for veggie pizza options at each stop, and they were all delicious!Since we took a night tour, beer was plentiful at all of our stops. How can you beat that? ;-)You cannot go wrong with this tour!"
"Our first time in Chicago and I convinced my friends to take this tour and it was awesome!! I would say it was one of the highlights of our trip! If you are a pizza lover, and you are in Chicago, definitely take this tour!  Jon was so informative, and knew so much about pizza and the city of Chicago in general!  We almost got run off the road by a crazy guy in a Tahoe that flipped us off!  All in the name of good pizza, and good times!  My favorite pizza was Ginos, although my friends said their favorite pizza was from Pizanos...but every place was delicious!Now I know what I'm missing and dream of the day I can travel back to Chicago and have a taste of Ginos pizza again...Mmmmm...cheeeese....."
"Jon was a great host/guide.. Extremely knowledgeable about pizza and had some obscure and interesting tidbits about Chicago on the way to each pizza place. Started with the thin crust & deep dish from Pizano's, then to Flo and Santo's for unique thin crusts (italian beef pizza & kielbasa w/ sauerkraut), third to Pizzeria Da Nella Cucina Napoletana for a great magherita (neapolitan style) , and last to Pequod's for a unique deep dish.I appreciate the efforts to accommodate us with the rain coming down and a full tour. It sure beats spending for 4 whole pizzas. Worth going for some education on the basis of a good pizza along with experiencing  the diversity that Chicago has to offer when it comes to pizza - it's not just about deep dish!"
"Absolute must do when in Chicago!!!From the time we met Jon of Chicago Pizza Tours at Pizanos to the time we were dropped off, it was a truly first class experience one cannot miss when in Chicago!  The tour lasted a little under three hours tasting at four different pizza parlors all of which are rated in the top twenty (out of over 2000) in Chicago.  However, the experience isn't JUST about tasting pizza as you learn about the intricacies of pizza from its history to dough making to the various types of ovens/cooking styles, so on and so forth.  At the same time, you're learning about the history of Chicago plus having tons of laughs as the tour guide is hilarious!!!  Although you would think a full day of eating pizza is enough, you're actually left wanting more since the restaurants are amazing and the tour makes you appreciate the food you're eating even more.We did many other tours while in town (Wrigley, river/lake Architectural, etc.), but this was the highlight of the trip by far.  Thanks Chicago Pizza Tours!!!"
"We *just* did the pizza tour today. A rare Friday tour, our group was small, which afforded us to really get to know our guide, Jon, and to see some of the smaller pizza stops we may not have otherwise seen (like the home of the Obama family's favorite pie)! The good reviews are all true. Jon is a wealth of knowledge about the art of pizza and the city, and the bus driver is a hoot. We had at least one slice at every stop and were well taken care of by waitstaff and/or the owners. Every time I ate a new slice of pizza, I thought that one was my favorite. And even though I tallied six slices, the three-hour tour was the perfect amount of time to spread the dining over; I didn't end up stuffed (though I nearly did nap afterwards!). Each place was different enough from the others that I'm not certain I could pick a favorite. This is a well-designed tour by a great, enthusiastic crew. The hubs and I have been to Chicago many times, and it's a shame we've only just discovered this tour! It was an outing we both really enjoyed, and should definitely be a must-do on your list - whether you're in from out of town or local.Thanks so much, Jon et al!"
"my friend found this activity through yelp and suggested that we do it because of its 5-star rating. it was a great way to sample chicago's variety of pizzas and learn about the city.the price seemed steep at first but then i realized i am paying to eat at four pizzerias, jon (the tour guide), the driver, and the fact that i don't have to worry about transportation and waiting to be seated. my favorite was the deep dish pizza from pizano's because the cheese tasted so fresh! apart was awesome because i actually prepared the pizza (and it turned out fine!) giordano's east lived up to the hype. coalfire had that burnt-crust taste but the ingredients itself were wonderful. jon is an excellent tour guide--he is extremely knowledgeable about anything pizza related and the city of chicago. you can tell he is passionate about his job/business and goes out of the way to make everyone feel at ease on the tour. and he accommodates vegetarians! oh, and the driver is a hoot!four pizzas in 3 1/2 hours? totally doable."
"This tour is no less than FANTASTIC! Just got back from the tour and couldn't be happier, after 5 slices (could of had more..) of delicious pizza. Jon is a wonderful tour guide with loads of knowledge he shared about pizza and Chicago, the group was super fun, the driver was cool and the pizza.. I may die in my hotel from pizza poisoning but at least I'll die a happy man!Noam, Israel"
"A must do in the Chicago area!  Jon is amazing... Friendly, funny and knows his shit when it comes to pizza :)  This tour is not just about eating awesome Chicago style pizza but you get to hear the history, facts and even some jokes in there about pizza.  And you dont only get deep dish (like the hubby and I thought) you get thin crust pizza as well.  The variety in the pizza is uncanny..who knew that you could do so much to a pizza...even the deep dish pizza's we had were different from one another.  BTW..my favorite on the tour was the deep dish from Pizanos...definitely going back there :) My only complaint, and this really isn't that big of a deal but there was no AC on the bus and it was about 95 degrees outside. Eh, oh well..there was AC in the pizza joints and the tour was completely worth it :)"
"Where to start....Joe, the pizza addict/tour guide, takes you to 4 places that will ensure you leave the tour stuffed.  The food is great, but this tour brings more to the table than just great pizza.  Get ready for some pizza knowledge, history, and fun.  If you can only do one tour while in Chicago, do yourself a favor and do this one!!FYI - Joe will tempt you with a dessert at Pizano's...it worked on us and we were there the very next day to eat the pizza and the dessert!!!   Recommended this tour to friends headed to Chicago in September and will continue to recommend this tour to all family/friends.Viva la Pizza!!!!"
We just finished the pizza tour and it was great! John was extremely personable and informative. The tour is worth every penny. We are full to the brim of pizza. Good job guys keep it up.
"Well...I guess we should have made sure that we had Jon as a tour guide. We had a much less knowledgable guy who played with his hair, picked inside his ears, and wiped his nose on his hands...without once washing his hands (believe me, lots of us had our eyes on this:( Additionally, two of the four pizzerias we went to made us wait 15+ minutes before delivering two small pizzas (for a group of 14). I feel that the pizzas could have been more efficiently made and in a larger quantity. Overall, I would not recommend this tour."
Enjoy....history of Chicago....
This is the only way to try different types of pizza in Chicago. Jon the owner and tour guide was very nice. Knowledgeable and helpful. The Italian fiesta pizza was the best for thin crust. They say its president Obama's favorite pizza joints and I know why. I would recommend everyone to try this tour if not do your own thing. They take you to 5 different pizza places and introduce you to 5 different kinds of pizzas. the guide was very knowledgable and it was very fun.
"So glad I found this through LivingSocial! My mom came in town and I wanted to do some kind of tour, and thought what better than eating great pizza along the way! The other great thing is that, unlike other Chicago tours, this tour takes you through the different neighborhoods, not just downtown. John runs this single-handedly! And does an awesome job. He knows a ton of cool facts about the city and neighborhoods. The pizza at each place was sooo good (we went to 4 places).The ONLY downside (which knocked it down the star) I thought was the bus. It is comfortable, but really hard to see things out of. I know it is mostly about the pizza, and I have seen the city since I live here, but I wished my mom had been able to see what John was pointing out a little better. But I highly recommend this tour! It is so great!"
Jon was an excellent guide to both the pizza locations as well as Chicago information which made the tour outstanding.  Jon's ability and knowledge to describ Chicago pizza made the tour extra special.  We were given the tour as a Father's Day gift ---- priceless !!!!We will certainly do the tour again.
"How could I give this less than 5 stars?Jon meets you at a pizza restaurant, gives you the intro, feeds you and then takes you on a bus to 3 other places to eat more pizza without having to wait in line for a table.  He gets you back in the kitchen (for some places, some places are so secretive!), introduces you to the owners and staff and shows you how they do it!  All the while you can enjoy a glass of wine or beer, get to know a few other people and have a great time eating pizza. There is even pizza music on the tour bus. We've recommended this tour to our family and friends who are planning on traveling out to Chicago. Thanks and keep up the good work with Dough Force One!"
"Awesome, awesome, awesome!! If you are a pizza lover, this is the one to do."
"I live in Chicago and recently had a couple visitors to town, saw this tour advertised and thought it was a perfect addition to our other plans.   I couldn't have been more impressed!   I feel terrible for remembering the tour guides name because he remembered all of our names, but he was terrific!  He is a Chicagoland native and  not only was he knowledgeable about the pizza in Chicago (and many other cities), but he gave us some wonderful information about Chicago in general.  We went to four completely different pizzerias (tour guide informed us he always starts at Pizanos and ends at Ginos East) in four completely different areas of the city in a very comfortable handivan type vehicle.  We were part of the pizza topping choosings, and vegetarians or picky eaters were taken into consideration.  It is a 12 person tour so it seems very personable and the guide is quite approachable.    The experience was definitely planned out because our tables and pizzas were ready when we arrived and each establishment went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.    It also never felt hurried in any way. I highly recommend this tour!"
"I loved this tour!  Jon was our guide and we went to 4 different restaurants.  1st: Pizanos, 2nd: Flo and Santos, 3rd: Apart, 4th: Pequods.  It was really nice to go to some places we otherwise wouldn't have known about.  The group favorite for our tour was Flo and Santos in the south loop, delicious tavern style pizza.  Jon did a nice job explaining what went into the pizzas, recommending menu choices and giving us a good variety.  What wasn't expected was the tour of Chicago we got while driving to the different restaurants and neighborhoods.  It was definitely an added bonus.  I think this tour is great for locals and visitors and I can't wait to try one of the evening tours with pizza and cocktails!"
"Highly recommend! Great food, great service, great times! Absolutely loved this tour and would recommend it to tourists or Chicago residents alike."
wow liked this a lot i would never have thought of this idea its great . the food is great at them .
