Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club
Great place!    Everything about it.The space itself is peppered with rustic yet well executed decór. Very cozy and warm. I would consider this a hidden gem because I never really worry about waiting in a line. Front of the house is courteous and efficient.The gentlemen in the back of the house really know what they're doing. There's always something new on the menu. I admire the way these guys pair and juxtapose unique and interesting flavors to create something delicious. And their creations are as picturesque as they are tasty. I don't know where they get their fruit/ produce but it's the freshest stuff around.Every time I have the bread pudding I feel like I have to go to a confessional and repent. Sinful. But I can't resist. Sometimes the bread pudding haunts me in my dreams.
"If you like good food and horrible service or willing to deal with the bad service, then come give this spot a try. The food was nonetheless really good. A lot of people recommend the skirt steak skillet and it did not disappoint. Every bite was delicious. The pico de gallo really suit well with the skillet. There were even avocado underneath. Yum!But the service was really bad. We were really patient group but the food took so long to come out and when my friend asked about our order, she told my friend be patient child. And we clearly saw her babbling to her coworker about us. Then when the food came, she told us how we should have been patient. Then when we were waiting on the bill, the machine rebooted. I can understand that it is out of their control but by that time we were clearly already prepare to leave because of how horrible the service was."
"Love this place for a breakfast on the weekends. It's a blend of classics and new ideas. I've been here a couple of times and highly recommend the skillets and the omelettes. Both are fabulous, especially the caprese omelette.The service is fast, the coffee is good, and it really is a local business through and through. Lovely to be able to support such an amazing place!!One tiny recommendation: I think the sausage, with how many amazing breakfast sausages are available, should really be reconsidered. It's ok, but nothing special at all."
"Wow. It's been a while since I've found a really good, chilled out brunch place with immense food. The staff were incredibly friendly and the place has this wonderful chilled out vibe where everyone is welcome. No one trying to be hip or trendy just a good mix of different people. The food literally speaks for itself, safe to say that I'm definitely coming back to try out the rest of the menu!"
Had the mango blueberry pancakes and they're better than m henry mango cakes. It's a compote for the mangos and they are stained blue from the blueberry but still good. The mascarpone filling and contrast with the fluffy pancakes and crunchy granola is delish. Hubby has the skirt steak skillet and was happy.  We had no issues with service.
"Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is a misnomer; they serve lunch, too. My friend Linda and I wanted to try something new, and I told her how well-reviewed this place was on Yelp. She agreed to try it, based on the Yelp reviews, and we are glad we did. We had absolutely delicious, very filling breakfasts with good service in a cute place.The restaurant is on the corner of Bryn Mawr and Kimball Avenues. Writing in April 2015, I'll warn you that Bryn Mawr is undergoing construction, and is a great big mess. We came up Kimball and parked on the street, just north of the intersection. Until construction is completed, you may encounter traffic delays and parking challenges. Bryn Mawn Breakfast Club is good enough, though, that you should consider those challenges as testing your appetite. Pass the tests with patience and diligence, and you will be rewarded with good food.There is a standard menu given to everyone, and a list of specials written on a chalkboard in the front area, just north of the kitchen. The kitchen/cooking area is located in the middle of the restaurant, along the west wall, so you can clearly see the cooks at work. This is good for those customers who are nervous about food preparation. The food is cooked where everyone can see, so you can be confident that food is prepared properly. The coffee is listed as coming from some place in Michigan. It tastes just fine. The Michigan provenance doesn't mean much to me. Maybe it will to you.I ordered an omelette with leeks, asparagus, mushroom, and gruyere cheese. It typically comes with spinach, too, but I hate cooked spinach, and the staff was absolutely willing to forego that ingredient for me. It came with fried potatoes and a choice of bread; I took the sourdough, based on the server's recommendation. Wow! That was a fabulous omelette, and very filling. I ate the whole thing, and, no lie, I had no appetite until the evening, when I had an apple. I probably (probably???) overate, but it was so good, I just kept shoving the fork in my face.Linda had the panjo pancake with scrambled eggs. This is a Korean-style item. She thought it was made with rice. It had loads of scallions, and some kim chee in it. I took a bite of it and didn't care for it, but that's just me -- I really don't care for the flavors of Korean food, and this was Korean food. Linda, on the other hand, likes Korean food, and she ate her breakfast with as much alacrity as I did. At one point, I got up to use the washroom, and Linda was saying she'd probably take half of her breakfast home with her. When I returned -- and I wasn't gone very long at all -- she'd finished all her food. The next day, she called me and said she'd been full until dinnertime, too. It was that good.The only odd element was an elderly man who was wandering down the street in front of the restaurant. He'd stop, look in at us and stare, and then pace back and forth again. At one point, he came in as far as the entry, and just stood there for a moment, looking around. He didn't appear to be homeless or lost, and the servers just ignored him. All he did was stare and hang out, but still, it was kind of weird. This is nothing to do with the restaurant itself, of course, but it was part of the experience we had. For that reason, I include it here.Prices are pretty standard breakfast prices. When we were driving back to our homes afterward, we drove east on Montrose and passed a couple old-Chicago style places that advertised a full breakfast for $6.95. That's not what you'll get or pay at Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club. Our entrees cost either $9.75 or $9.95. We got a lot of food for that money. Bottom line: we loved Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club and will come again."
"I visited Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club the Monday after Independence Day. I originally wanted to go to Lula Cafe, but it was unfortunately closed! Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club did not disappoint and was probably just as good as Lula Cafe. I noticed that a previous reviewer described the ambiance as ""urban rustic."" I definitely agree. The restaurant almost looked like a modern barn.I ordered the bread pudding French toast. It was the perfect serving size. It was on top of delicious orange syrup that was probably the highlight of the dish. The French toast was covered in fresh berries and powdered sugar. I think the flavor itself was sweet...but not overpowering. My boyfriend ordered the sourdough French toast. It is a must if you are into savory breakfast dishes. It came with potatoes.The staff was very attentive. They kept giving us coffee refills and asking us if we needed anything.The only downside of Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is that it was busy, so it took us a while to get our food. But I really didn't mind the wait at all!"
"If you are in the mood for breakfast and you happen to be in the Kimball/Bryn Mawr vicinity, Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club should do just fine for your appetite. Be forewarned that the portions are substantial.Mini hotcakes with berries. Chorizo skillet.The hotcakes are so moist that you may think they are not cooked fully. And not only are they moist, but they are so fluffy. The chorizo skillet is indeed a heavy dish. Either you tackle it on a completely empty stomach, very slowly, or in part with some to take home.There are no complaints about the services, given the time I went was not overrun with patrons. There isn't anything fancy about the breakfast offerings, so don't expect chi-chi dishes coming to the table. Noticing how breakfast spots tend to pack fast in Chicago's, I recommend going early to avoid standing outside or right at the door if the restaurant gets too crowded for immediate seating. The restaurant seems to be accommodating so far since it's relatively new. But once words get out, there will be a wait in the near future."
"cozy atmosphere, great chairs and decor. we were promptly seated even though the place was pretty full for a Monday. the service was good, the food was pretty standard breakfast fare. the house potatoes are seasoned perfectly but the gravy (for biscuits and gravy) was nothing to write home about. would definitely return but probably order differently next time!"
"My cinnamon banana walnut waffle was one of the best waffles I have ever had. This place totally hit the spot. Great variety of food, quick service, and they really know how to deal with the crowd. They gave me a coffee while I was waiting. Definitely will dine here again."
"Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Each of the dishes I have tried has never disappointed me.  The steak skillet is one of my favorites as well as the bread pudding french toast.   The chef specials are written on a chalkboard and unless you know to look there you will miss out on some great dishes.  On one of our visits I tried their Rancheros Borrachos special. It was a crispy tostada with chorizo, avocado and topped off with a poached egg, spicy salsa, crema and queso añejo, a side of rice and plaintains.  Layer upon layer of savory deliciousness!  It should be included on their regular menu.  Their service is always great and even when a mistake is made, they quickly rectify it.   Do yourselves a favor, go check this place out if you haven't already and make sure to check out the chalkboard with the chef's daily specials."
"Another breakfast cafe that I enjoyed. Husband and I came down the North Park/ Northeastern University location to try this little gem.  My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy which he loved. Came with a side of potatoes and sausage. He was in heaven. Ok, ok you got me, I tried it and was happy to mooch off my husband's plate. i could go for a more peppery gravy but my husband loved it. I ordered the mango and berry pancakes with marscapone cream. Delicious.  I really want to try some of their other breakfast items in the future as everything on the menu sounded delicious.  We really scored this memorial day weekend trying out new breakfast spots that were win/win. Where do I go next?  :-)"
"My girlfriend found this place on Yelp as we on occasional Sunday mornings enjoy venturing out to new breakfast places in the city and burbs. Walking in right away I felt unimpressed but kept an open mind. The waiter who was polite approached us and immediately gave us menus.Reading through the menu I knew right away this was not my sort of breakfast place. I am an old school guy who grew up in the city who appreciates great Greek owned establishments. This place to me is for the transplant hipsters. Located in the North Park neighborhood the customers were a nice mix of young and neighborhood locals.After not caring for much on the menu I settled for the breakfast torta. This seemed more like a lunch item being that it was mainly chorizo but it was after 12 pm and I was up for it. My girlfriend ordered the Sourdough stuffed French toast which basically is a breakfast sandwich. It consisted of Canadian bacon, eggs, asiago cheese and arugula?The service was very slow. We waited a long time not only for our waiter to come back to take our orders but for our food as well. We were getting a bit upset watching people that came in after us getting their food before us.When our food arrived my sandwich was very flavorful but understandably greasy. The bread was grilled the way I like it but had very little cheese which was a bit disappointing. The side potatoes were ""home fries"" seasoned in paprika and cooked with white and green onions. I typically dislike these sort of potatoes because they to me are dry and some restaurants use frozen and overuse paprika to give some sort of flavor but these were better in flavor due to the onions. I ate a little but gave the rest to my girlfriend who loved them. My girlfriend's sandwich had great appearance. She asked me to try a bite of it which I did. I did not like it at all. French toast mixed with arugula, egg and cheese did not seem to fuse together well with me. If I'm eating French toast I want syrup I do not want to sandwich it with egg, cheese and greenery.If the sourdough was not battered and simply grilled I think this would be a better sandwich (leave off the arugula though). My girlfriend agrees, no French toast and wishes she ordered it this way.The restaurant's website presents this place as ""modern American eats"" which I feel is a perfect way to describe this place. As I looked around other people's meals they seemed foo foo presentational but didn't look appealing. If you're open to this sort of food fusion / creation then I have no doubt you will like this. If you're more of a traditional old-schooler like myself I would not recommend.After we left we asked each other if we would come back here again and we both said no. Partially due to slow service. For me mainly it was these ""modern dishes"" that did not appeal to me."
"I live close by and didn't know about this place. Tried it out today and was pretty satisfied with my make your own skillet option. It was pretty packed and we had to wait a little, but once we sat down our waiter was super nice and friendly. Well worth the wait and would come back again to try some of their unique specials"
"We decided to come here when we were nearby getting a car wash. We had no reservations on a Sunday, but we only had to wait 25 minutes. It was a nice day, so we didn't mind we had to wait outside. The hostess and server were friendly and the place was casual but with a nice touch of lots of natural woods--very welcoming.I had the chorizo skillet, and she had the Asian pancake. Both entrees came out pretty quick considering they were busy, and they were so much food! My skillet was cheesy, slightly spicy, and very delicious. Good flavor to the chorizo, fresh avocado hidden underneath a nicely cooked egg. Her dish had this amazing side of brussel sprouts with pork belly that wasn't too fatty. Her dish was savory, sweet, and also tons of food. We had the sweet plantains as a side. The whole meal was amazingly fresh and flavorful. I can't wait to go back and try some other entrees. The price is good compared to other brunch places, with each entree coming in around $10. I highly recommend this place if you are into brunching."
"Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is off to a fantastic start. Definitely off the beaten path, the boyfriend and I were incredibly pleased with our experience. The menu is much more unique than the average brunch restaurant and we couldn't wait to try it out. There was no wait on a Sunday morning and our waiter came over right away to give us menus. After much deliberation, I went with the skirt steak skillet and the boyfriend had the pajun pancake. We were both incredibly pleased with our dishes, mine was a large portion of skirt steak over a very flavorful potato hash. The eggs, pico de gallo, avocado, and salsa rounded the dish out perfectly. Definitely order this is you're feeling hungry, I had no shot of finishing it. The other dish, the panjun pancake, was pretty phenomenal. The scallion pancake was cooked perfectly and provided a great base for the eggs and pork belly. Additionally, the brussel sprouts that came on the side rocked. They were in a soy/garlic sauce that added tons of flavor and made for a great pairing with the rest of the dish. If you're looking for something other than the typical breakfast fare, panjun pancake is the way to go.At the time that we visited Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club, it was cash only which is important to know. Prices are normal, maybe even a little below average with each dish coming in around $10.50. I anticipate that word will spread about this new spot and there will surely be a wait on a Sunday morning! Overall, I highly recommend brunch at Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club!"
"Wow, I actually went here about two months ago with my husband and I'm still occasionally thinking about what a delightful place to enjoy a brunch at on any given day. We both ordered specials and they were pretty good! I'd go back again, sooner than later.The service was pretty good too and everyone we met there was pretty friendly...I loved their coffee so much. I'm craving one right now, too!!!!!"
"**They now accept credit cards**Originally, Rosa J had an intention to get her full ""beauty sleep"" in before her epic shift began (in retail jargon: Super Saturday weekend, known as the weekend before the advent of Christmas, when clueless Americans are scrabbling to get their shopping done before this big day arrives).  Unfortunately, hubby's co-worker disrespected his privacy by calling his personal cellular device at 0900 hour, sharp!  Well, I chose to treat it as a blessing in disguise and have some nice breakfast at somewhere new.  And you, co-worker (as you shall remain anonymous): we will have a serious conversation with you very soon...Let's shift the topic on the Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club.  This place is fairly new and located at the northwest corner of Kimball/Bryn Mawr.  The items on the menu are pretty reasonably-priced; the most expensive item I saw was $11.50, which was on the special menu written on the chalk board.  The server promptly offered coffee and water.  I could not remember his name (sorry, I'm usually good at remembering names, but today I was tripping), yet he was super friendly and genuinely introduced the special menu items for the day.  Out of the special menu, I ordered the Ranchero burrachos (might have mis-spelled this, but this is yelp, not the spelling bee competition).  It's like a Mexican-style Benedict: the top layer was over-easy egg, covering the avocado and ground chorizo, supporting with fried tortilla chips on the bottom.  It came with rice and beans on the side, along with two (2) tiny pieces of sugar-coated plantain.  On the other hand, hubby ordered the veggie skillet out of the regular menu.  I highly recommend the ranchero burrachos.  It was creative, unique, flavorful, and well-constructed.  To be honest, I wasn't sure what this was, but there's a virtue for being adventurous with food, and today I surely proved that point.  Hubby also enjoyed his veggie skillet.  The server(s) continued to top off the coffee the entire time while we were dining.  Hey hey, I had no complaint! The total after tax came to approximately $26.  I thought it was fair, for the quality of food we happily consumed and service we received.  We now have another option for breakfast/brunch other than the Kronor on Foster in the North Park neighborhood.  You will see me at BMBC one of these days in the near future."
"I ordered Pajeon Pancake-I feel as though they were quite heavy handed when it came to the amount of soy sauce the pork belly was swimming in. Also, I feel they could have added an element of sweetness to the plate. To make it completely balanced. My daughter had the kids ""plate."" She enjoyed the fluffiness of the pancake. All in all a very good breakfast. I will definitely return to try their, ""Killer Grill Cheese."" Caught my eye after I had already ordered. It was on the wall as the Chef's special menu.They should definitely print out there ""chef's menu"" on paper so customers don't miss it."
"Table wasn't as sticky the second time - but the food was horrible...had a squash bowl filled with some sort of vinegar mix...it looked amazing...but when I tried it...WAY too much vinegar and not enough of anything else. Try it only if you really, really love vinegar."
"Went to BMBC for my birthday brunch and was not disappointed. My friend and I split the blueberry hot cakes and chorizo skillet.The hot cakes were delish and loved the blueberry jam on top; however, was a bit denser than expected. I bet it's because they're made with wheat flour. I love blueberries, but if you don't LOVE them, if recommend getting the blueberry jam that typically comes on top to be put on the side for dipping.The chorizo skillet was like a dream come true. Home fries on the bottom allowed for the potatoes to absorb all that chorizo grease. Then topped with black beans, chorizo, onions, cheese avocado, eggs and salsa. Serious nom noms!!!Good service was appreciated. Everyone seems to work together well, so people are sat & fed quickly. Can't wait to go back!"
"I tried the crab benedict eggs and they were just amazing. Love the place, service and location. Tumbs up!"
Delicious! Excellent service and friendly faces. We brunched at the bar so we got first look at everything coming out of the kitchen. The combinations of flavors worked so well together. Manny (the owner) was on the floor helping out and making sure everyone was pleased. We got super lucky because of the rain and didn't have to wait. Usually there's a line out the door and now I know why! We will definitely be returning.
"Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is one of the few breakfast/brunch places in North Chicago that deserves its hype.  Unlike those baffingly well-rated Uptown/Edgewater/Andersonville establishments  (who shall not be named) where you wait and wait and then end up with a $40 bill for something that just wasn't even that great---UNLIKE those disappointments, Bryn Mawr BC is awesome.The food is excellent.  I almost always opt for the chilaquiles because 1.) I'm a vegetarian and 2.) in addition to an ample serving of crispy, homemade chips covered in a well-spiced verdes sauce, the dish comes with two eggs, potatoes, plantains, rice and beans and toast.  Its a massive amount of food for a little under $10.  My partner--a carnivore--jumps all over the menu, and as far as I know has never been disappointed.  We usually share a plate of the cinnamon hotcakes as an appetizer--the kitchen cooks them until they're nice and caramelized on top, and yet it isn't tooth-achingly sweet.Like any restaurants, there are days the food is better than others.  As fans who visit once or twice a week-day-morning (gotta beat the crowds), we are naturally attenuated to changes in the cooking.  But honestly, this restaurant clearly makes a huge effort to serve high quality food.  They switched coffees briefly to something I was NOT a fan of, and two weeks later they had realized the error and found something new.  That kind of responsiveness and care is what keeps us coming back."
"Ever since I saw the food from this place on my friend's Instagram, I've been wanting to go so bad! Then finding out, the chef/owner(?) was from mHenry (love that place), and how close it was to my house, eureka! Unfortunately, a couple things really annoyed my enjoyment of the place. Firstly, our server was very blah this Sunday morning. It's really not that early, the weather is blah, don't be blah man! It kind of started our experience a bit meh.  Secondly, please wipe down the juice cup before bringing it to the table so I don't get sticky fingers when grabbing it! Thirdly, specials were not mentioned and I missed a couple really great dishes that I would have considered for sure! I noticed it on the chalkboard after we had ordered, but being in the corner, couldn't really read it well. Oh Boo :(We ordered the scallion pajun pancakes and the bread pudding French toast. After we got the entrees, my husband asks me, ""weren't you supposed to get toast with the pajun entree?"" I wasn't sure, so we asked the busser to get our server, (as he was a bit MIA). He came by and we asked if we were supposed to get toast. He said no, it doesn't come with that. We checked the menu, toast sure does come with it! I think by this point we were annoyed so this really didn't help. The dish was delicious though, so tiny bit of kudos for that. The French toast could have been delicious, but the temperature was so tepid it was just okay.  The menu intrigues me and I will be back to try the other dishes. I hope next time, we get a different server. Hopefully I'll be able to update my review with happier more glowing remarks!"
"On the corner of Bryn Mawr and Kimball, you'llfind Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club. A restaurant that delivers service, flavor, and plating that's up to par with any downtown brunch experience. Usually the line is out the door. However, we were seated as soon we got there, lucky timing, but the wait would have definitely been worth it!"
"First time here and I don't know why. Delicious, plain and simple. We had one of the specials (killer grilled cheese -- several cheeses, bacon, apples, walnut pesto) and the pajun pancake (scallion pancake, two eggs, Brussels sprouts and pork belly). Both amazing. They now take credit."
"I seem to be attracted to omelets that contain Gruyere cheese, and this one had asparagus, leeks, mushrooms and spinach.Lucky for me the specials board above my head reminded me that the apple cranberry French toast topped with granola and toasted almonds was calling my name. Omelet or French toast? If only every day had this dilemma."
"Great place, no complaints! Food portion is huge and prices are fair. Staff is wonderful and food was delicious. Would definitely come again! Cute place."
"This is such a great find!  My friend and I came here for breakfast on a sunny Saturday morning. We had the lemon crab eggs Benedict and the raspberry/ rhubarb French toast. Both equally delectable. There was a short wait to be seated and only a few chairs, so be prepared to stand on the sidewalk out front. I can't wait to bring my husband back to try it out. Great addition to the neighborhood!"
"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Finally, a delicious breakfast spot right around the corner from me.  I definitely intend on coming back again.I ordered the bread pudding french toast.  It was delicious and comforting!  I'd give it 5 stars, but the side of bacon I ordered was slightly overcooked."
"Can't believe we just found this place! This hidden gem doesn't look like much from the outside but once you step inside it is quaint, cozy and filled with amazing servers. You know it's a great place when the servers know their customers by name and they say, ""I'll have the usual"" We came here for my daughter's birthday with my in laws, so the wait for our party was a little long, but it was well worth it. Everything we ordered tasted wonderful! We ordered the crab cake egged Benedict special, sourdough stuffed french toast, Oreo pancakes, smoked salmon lox plate, multigrain blueberry pancakes and one more special but I can't remember the name. Anyways, we were all busy sampling each other's food because it was so delicious. Can't go wrong with what you order! I think we found our new favorite breakfast place :)"
"As a brunch aficionado, I am thrilled about this new opening. Excellent food and great atmosphere.Friends and I ordered chorizo skillet, bread pudding french toast, and biscuits with gravy. We loved everything - generous portions, delicious combination of flavors, and beautiful composition. Have been urging all my friends to stop here. Will definitely be returning!"
I'm so glad this place has opened!! The food is delicious and reasonably priced. There is usually a wait on weekends but the funky host with curly hair is so sweet and brings out coffee.
"Just to clarify, they now accept credit cards. The food was fantastic! The portion size was generous. The quality of the food was great as well as their service. The waiter was very helpful, kind and knowledgable about the foods. If there was something you didn't agree with he offers a substitute.For all the veggie heads, they offer many options for you to choose from. They even offer veggie sausages!Overall pleasant first experience! The decor is a plus! Must try brunch spot!"
This place quickly became one of my favorites after one bite of my Panjun Pancake. When dipped in the soy sauce the flavors merged together quite perfectly. The pork belly and brussel sprouts were in equal competition as to what tasted best on my plate. I will definitely be returning soon!
"Read that the Chef was originally from MHenry. I was really looking forward to trying the food.My husband and I came on a Monday at 10am. There was no line. Fairly busy. It took 40 minutes to get our food! Not to mention it was a hot day outside and sitting by the sunny window in a place where there is no AC was not fun!The waiter was nice, pleasant and apologetic but the service was SLOWwww! The food was ok. Definitely did not meet my expectations. I ordered the Chorizo Skillet & my husband a plain order French Toast with berries & cream. The taste did not blow us away. I may give it another try just to rule out a possible bad day? Or a case of the Mondays? I will order something different too. But I must say, the menu was also not that exciting. It reminded me of an Ihop menu. All in all, it is a good local breakfast place but to me it's no OverEasy or MHenry. And no matter where you go, it should not take 40minutes to get some egg mixture and french toast. I would say get more than one waiter, some ceiling fans if no AC and extend that menu!"
The chilaquiles verdes here is DELICIOUS and the coffee is fantastic. Our server was very nice and attentive. Loved the overall vibe of this place. Can't wait to go back!
"Cozy little place with a perfectly sized menu. Not too overwhelming. Selection was ~1/4 Mexican with some unique takes on popular dishes. 10 minute wait at noon for three people on a Saturday wasn't too bad. I had the steak skillet. It was muy delicioso!--fresh avocado, topped with two eggs, poco de gallo and a quality steak. Other two had an egg white omelette and the pajun pancake with sourdough toast. The omelette was ""the best omelette [she had] ever had"" and the pancake was supposedly incredible. Unlimited coffee was well worth the $2-3 price tag. Great customer service. Affordable prices. Friendly staff. Only complaints would be the lack of air conditioning in the restaurant, and the table was a little sticky. Would definitely come back again."
Nice quaint breakfast place that offers one unique item that's a Korean pancake. I have had that which was pretty good though the pork belly was chopped up and had this sweet glaze to it that isn't very Korean. But the brussel sprouts were tasty. It was still good. I've also has to customize a skillet with bacon to get it and that was pretty good as well. Nothing stands out and prices are a bit high. Overall not bad.
"I am neglectful in writing this review.  I was here about the third week BMBC was open, I am sure they have only gotten more fabu in the meantime.  I was lucky enough to order the Steak Skillet. Nothing makes me happier than a delicious breakfast and this, this set the bar for skillets.  The bar now resides in the stratosphere.The steak was tender, flavorful, bursting with goodness.  The pico de gallo was a great compliment, the whole package filled me for the day.The coffee?  Exceptional for a regular cup.  I was shocked and pleased.  I was with a great group of old school friends, we all had extraordinary meals. I was so pleased, there was no temptation to trade! Well Done BMBC!  Looking Forward to seeing you soon!"
"I kind of obsess over savory breakfast dishes that also include a sweet element. Most places you have to decide one or the other--never the twain shall meet unless you order sides. BMBC has a dish that encompasses both and is definitely one of the top 3 brunch meals I've ever had. Stuffed French Toast.Now most stuffed French toasts are filled with bananas or nutella or Willy Wonka's dreams. This one isn't. It's more like a breakfast sandwich with the French Toast as the bread and egg, Canadian bacon and arugula as the filling. So. Effing. Good. My friend's meal was equally delicious, but I was too distracted with mine to really pay that much attention. Our server was a peach, the hostess was a lamb and the interior was super cute. I've been reccing this place to everyone since we were there. Gotta go back!"
"What can I say this place is a gem. The tomato bisque soup was amazing. Fresh squeezed juice and the bread pudding French toast was both appealing visually and the tasty was to die for. This is a small diner in the North Park area, but he Chef does amazing work. I hope someday they are able to expand without losing their identity or warm feel."
"I went here with my mom the other day - me for my first time, my mom for her third. Our waiter (possibly the owner?) remembered her right away, which was nice. I ordered the breakfast burrito and some coffee, while my mom ordered an omelet. The service was speedy but friendly. My burrito included chorizo, corn, and generous portions of avocado, among other ingredients, artfully put together into in a snug little burrito.  The waiter told me that it would be ""the best d*** burrito I ever had, pardon my French"". And he was absolutely right. It was DELICIOUS. The coffee I had was also above average. My only complaint is that the seating is a little cramped, especially some of the two-person seating. My mom and I sat at one of those tables by the wall opposite the door, and I kept feeling that the person sitting at the table behind me was invading my personal bubble. Overall, I really enjoyed Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club and I can't wait to come again. :-)"
"great breakfast / brunch spot. creative menu, tasty dishes. we will be going back"
I loved this place! Albany park truly needed a go to breakfast place! Food was delicious. Well flavored and portions were well sized for the price. They are currently cash only but I hope they start taking credit.
"I am so happy to see this place in our neighborhood. The food was quite good and nicely plated. Christopher had one of the specials which was waffles with spiced banana, toasted pecan, caramel sauce and mascarpone cheese. I know there was other things I am forgetting, but it was pretty amazing.I had the lox plate because I am not big on sweets for breakfast. It was pretty standard, complete with capers, onions, tomato slices and cuke slices and of course cream cheese. I had leftovers of everything except the bagel, so we ordered an extra bagel to go. It was $2.50 for one plain bagel. I thought that was a tad high, but oh well, it was all good.We will absolutely be back. There are a lot of interesting options to explore on the menu."
"Was good. Service staff was attentive, portions were large (not so large that it was overwhelming), the wait was short, and the food was pretty decent. The rice was slightly undercooked but other than that it was nice."
"I went here with a friend looking for a place near NEIU. From the outside of it, it wasn't TOO appealing, but don't let that fear you. The name of this place catches my attention because The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies. Anyways, we ordered the banana bread pudding french toast, skirt steak skillet, and the silver dollar panaceas ( kid's menu :) ) The wait wasn't too bad because we went around 9:15am. Let me just say the food was PHENOMENAL. The french toast was really decadent but not too sweet, the skirt steak was filling, and the pancakes were perfect. Everything had good flavors and I didn't feel like I would not get my money's worth. I highly recommend this place. I think this will be go-to brunch place. I'm so glad I found this place. GO HERE."
"A classic little breakfast place in the North Park area. It shares the intersection with a couple different discount beauty salons, some no-contract cell phone dealers, and a 7-11, but there is plenty of street parking in the neighborhood all around the old brick building that they occupy and they are definitely a nice business than their immediate neighbors project the area might host. We were there late on a Saturday morning and had less than a 10 minute wait. There isn't really any room to stand around inside if there is a wait, but they will put your name on a list and they were even willing to bring out some coffees to the sidewalk. The inside has a decent number of tables without feeling like it is too crowded. There are also enough windows that it feels like a bright atmosphere. The décor is kind of an artsy western mix, but the different sculptures of animal heads on the walls are a little weird. The menu isn't super long, but it certainly has something for everybody. This is the kind of place that you want to come to if you prefer branch out from just the normal breakfast diner options. Their handful of sweet options were all over-the-top breakfast concoctions that should probably be reserved to a dessert menu, but they were loaded up with toppings and all looked delicious. Their more hearty offerings resembled the standard favorites, but all had a nice twist. There is definitely a southwestern flare to a lot of their choices. I had the breakfast burrito which was stuffed with chorizo, roasted peppers, corn, avocado, Chihuahua cheese, adobo sauce, and sour cream. The ingredients were all good except I would have expected a little more flavor from the chorizo and it definitely needed more of their delicious adobo sauce. The potatoes that it comes with were very good. Their Chilaquiles dish was a new one for me, and while it's not something I would go back for as a breakfast item since tortilla chips doesn't seem to cross into that category for me, it was really good. The other dish ordered at our table was the Chorizo Skillet, which was similar to my burrito, but just all piled up into a big skillet dish. All of those offerings were right around the $10 mark. Along with those, they had a chalkboard of specials that aren't on the menu all of the time. One of those was an omelet that I wasn't brave enough to try that morning. If none of those sound good, they also have the full list of all of the classic breakfast items you will find anywhere. All of the orders had plenty of food to either take home leftovers or be so full you won't eat again until dinner, so come hungryOur server was great and got us everything we needed while also keeping up with a bunch of other tables. There was never any concern of a coffee cup getting low and they were constantly topping everyone off. Kind of a no-frills type service, but that's what I prefer. I'm fairly certain it is BYOB since a table by us had a couple bottles of champagne, I'm assuming for mimosas, but I didn't actually see a sign so maybe double check with them before hand.I'd definitely go back here if I was in the neighborhood and looking, but I think I have a few other brunch places in the general area that I would choose over this if I was going to go out of my way somewhere."
A very cozy restaurant! The place to be for delicious breakfast/brunch in this area. Excellent service!! ..Did I mention delicious food! Their plain sausage that comes with eggs under kitchen classics was to die for!! The decor is very nice! Place is clean and definitely will come again!
"Excellent food, great atmosphere, decent prices and strong fresh coffee ! Love the location and ample seating"
"Wow. Wow. Super creative and tasty breakfast and lunch menu! I've been 3x now and I've had to take away half of my meal each time for tasty leftovers. The portions are HUGE. Lovely light-filled space, pleasant service. Street parking. A little hidden gem that I imagine won't stay hidden for long."
"I was there on day 3, a Friday morning before school with my kids. Let me put it this way: my girls didn't bother putting syrup on the hot cakes or French toast. So unbelievably good! And the oatmeal is spectacular. Oatmeal! Spectacular! I had the breakfast burrito- possibly the best breakfast burrito ever (I lived in the Southwest, and I care about these things!). Chorizo, avocado, too many other good things to name. Too big to eat in one sitting, so I had the rest for lunch. They're still new, so it's cash only for now"
"Best brunch I've had in a long time.  I ordered the Pajun Pancake.  I can't say I've seen anything like it anywhere.  All the stuff on the plate went together so well.  The pancake was loaded with scallions and jalapenos, and I doused it with a soy sauce that came with the dish.  Along with that I got sauteed brussel sprouts, pork belly, eggs, and potatoes.  The eggs pretty much fell by the wayside as I attacked the rest of the dish and ran out of room as I tried to finish them.The service couldn't have been better.  My iced tea never waited for a refill.  We barely beat the crowd just before noon, and we ate at the counter overlooking the kitchen, as there were no tables available when we arrived.  My wife really enjoyed watching them make the dishes.  Just looking at that menu, there appear to be a ton of equally worthy options available.  I can't wait to try more of them."
"This is an excellent breakfast place.   The food is very creative and tasty.   The coffee is even nice.   You have to spend a little more than usual for a breakfast, but it is worth it."
"yup yup, their potatoes are tasty. Been there a few times and have not been disappointed yet."
"Went there today for brunch. OMG so good!!! We only had to wait about 10 15 minutes which was not bad at all. The hostess and the waiters were really nice. I ordered chorizo skillet and my friend ordered skirt steak skillet. We also ordered the French Toast with berries and cream to share. I didn't try my friend's skillet but all I know is mine was super good. here I wish someone would make it for me for breakfast everyday. You also get a lot of food for 9.50. I didn't get finish it. And then I had the French Toast, which is also extremely yum to my. I love their cream too; it's really nice and thick. Definitely recommend this place! Gonna tell my friends to come to eat as well. If I lived close, I want to go there tomorrow morning too lol"
"We went on a humid Sat morning and I think it was about 80 degrees inside the place-we were sweating. Aside from this, everything was dee-lish!! Skirt steak skillet, sourdough bread sandwich, kids breakfast, kids pancakes...all FAB! Our server, Kevin, was also delightful, making our first visit perfect."
"First off, all the staff are super-friendly. I love the restaurant just for that. We live in Albany Park, and live in walking distance, so we've been excited about a new breakfast place. The service is great and they're very accommodating for parties of all size, with kids, strollers, etc. The ambiance is great. I've been here three times with my husband and my parents and it's always great. The problem is that the savory dishes are too salty and the sweet dishes are too sweet. Between me and my parents and my husband we've ordered most of the items from the menu and about half-way through our meal we have to stop. Our hearts/blood pressure/stomachs make us stop. The flavor is great, but there is a heavy hand on the salt and sugar in the kitchen. This a problem that I encounter occasionally throughout Chicago. I want to come back, but our heart muscles won't let us. If they could ease up, I would make this a regular weekend stop."
"Great place! The decor is so adorable and the menu is pretty diverse. The hardest part of the trip was figuring out what I wanted to order. The food was delicious, steak and eggs was my choice with a side of french toast. The portions are large and are worth the price. Wonderful place for breakfast or brunch. Would've given 5 stars but the waiters weren't the best, not bad just not the best."
"This place is Awesome!!! I order a Chorizo Skillet and it was delicious , my husband order chilaquiles and they were good too. The serves is great also, and I love how they have it decorated. I will go back again."
"This place haz got to be one of Chicago'z BEST kept secretz. But I have a feeling they won't be for much longer.Definitely not your typical run-of-the-mill breakfast/lunch spot. So if you're a fan of Denny's or Ihop... you probably won't appreciate BBC'z uniqueness. And should prolly stay eating at thoze corporate chain spotz instead.From the sculpturez/paintingz on the wall, the table topz, the bar stoolz, the wood flooring, kinda remindz ya of a contemporary/country/farm like setting dead smack in the city. The bathroomz are as clean as the restaurant itself, and the serverz are pretty cool people (especially once you get to know them). Oh, and the lightning iz AWESOME. Very natural, plus vibrant, so you can never take a bad food pic. The place iz kinda small, but givez you that warm, comfy and cozy feeling. (Kinda like home)But yeah, the menu iz extremely unique. They've got something for everybody. I've already tried over half their menu entreez and have never been served a meal I haven't enjoyed. Very ""gourmetish,"" so be open-minded and adventurous and you'll enjoy your food that much more. All fresh ingredientz and all cooked & served to perfection.I found this place by accident. But SO glad I did. From the atmosphere, service, menu selection, food quality and deliciousness... it'z been a MAJOR game changer and one I can say haz seriously changed my life. I alwayz look forward to coming back again, again, again and again. So if you've never been to Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club... what the hell are you waiting for?? GO!!! (And thank me later) What more can I say? I LOVE THIS PLACE! And hopefully you will too. #laterz"
"I don't know what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. Best brunch spot on the northwest side in my opinion. I dine here so frequently that the weekend hostess knows me by name, but my shame can't keep me away! Over time, I've had the skirt steak skillet (amazing), peach and cherry french toast (to die for), Mayan bendecit (OMG!), crab cake benedict (#yas!), the Carribbean omelet (delicious), and the burger (sriracha mayo and pork belly? Yes, please). Every time my meal has been smack-your-mama- delicious. I was lucky enough to attend a special evening event here last month and was able to get a sneak peek (or taste, rather) of an experimental dinner menu. All I can say is that I hope and pray that they decide to open for dinner eventually. If so, we will all be in for a treat! There is nothing not to love about this place- excellent food, adorable decor, friendly staff, BYOB, and locally owned and operated by a fantastic chef. Definitely check this place out for your brunchy cravings!"
Yummiest breakfast ever.  Too many amazing things to mention.  You just gotta keep coming back to try everything.  You will not be disappointed.
"Food probably deserves 2.5 or 3 stars, but due to the poor service, I had to bump this down to 2. Let me explain myself, as I don't like to give negative reviews, unless something really stands out. The menu looked really promising and the salmon plate stood out as I wasn't craving eggs this morning. The salmon plate was also supposed to come with a side of potatoes and toast, at least that's what the menu said. When I ordered, I specified to the server I'd like white toast, to which he said, ""Oh the toast shouldn't be on there, it's a typo!"" So I said, ""No worries, I can do without toast!"" When the food arrives, I ask where my side of potatoes are, to which the waiter again said, ""oh, that's also a typo, this dish doesn't come with potatoes either, we need to update our menu."" Ummm really? If your menu is not correctly printed you have a few options that should make any client perfectly satisfied:A) honor the menu as written, until it's fixedB) have the server clearly explain the discrepancies before orders are locked inC) take a pen and manually cross out what you seem to not want to serve your customersI find it ridiculous that a new place has such poor customer service. Please either train the servers or print out correct menus. It's so annoying to order something and only have an explanation once the food is served to the table as to why what you expected won't be served to you.I wish I would have asked the server to honor the original menu, but when he didn't even seem phased to want to make the customer happy I didn't even bother as I wouldn't have likely gotten anywhere w/o feeling like I'm making a scene. Very disappointing that a new place doesn't even seem to want to try in it's first few months of opening."
"My favorite breakfast place so far! This area needed one badly, although this was an old ""trucker"" diner before this new place blows it out of the water! I had the steak an eggs and the plain French toast ( with berries and cream a must!) complete with a generous helping of a friendly staff. Great place- don't give it a try on Sundays because I want to be able to  find a table when I go there in the mornings. Also the hipsters come to this place, not sure if this will scare them away now that I called them out??"
"We can't get enough of Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club!I love the reclaimed wood on the walls, the community table, colored mason jars with flowers on every table. The restaurant is on the smaller side and so cozy! Their coffee is fantastic (oh and they serve you coffee while you wait for a table). The breakfast menu is really exciting, the Pajun pancake was such a pleasant surprise. It's a must try! The chilaquiles are served with perfectly cooked perfectly delicious plaintains. Their potatoes are the best thing ever. In the 5 times I've been so far, we've never ordered something that wasn't truly delicious. Looking forward to trying that sourdough stuffed french toast. Mmm. - Highly, highly recommended!"
The food and service was phenomenal!!!! Who knew that skirt steak skillet with gorgonzola cheese was that awesome! Definitely coming back
"It was pretty good... the coffee was from one of my favorite coffee roasters in Saugatuck, MI.  Will most likely come back again."
"My husband and I were looking for a good place to get some brunch, but without having to wait in line forever.We drove by Over Easy...yep, line outside...moving on.I found BMBC on yelp and convinced him to give it a try, it wasn't in a location I would expect for a hip brunch place....but it was indeed a hip brunch place.I was very happy with the experience.  We were able to get a table immediately (with all these great reviews I'm guessing this won't be the case for long).  Our server was very friendly and was willing to honestly give his opinion when I was trying to make a decision between two items.I think I had a banana waffle, or banana french toast or something.  Its been a few weeks since we were there.  But whatever it was tasted like banana bread made into a (waffle or french toast...I think it was a waffle).My husband was pleased with his food, I think he got a skillet type item.  He liked my food and I liked his.  We ordered some veggie sausage, and they were short one link so they gave them to us for free! Awesome. Who doesn't like free.The place is cute and parking was easy."
"I started coming here a few months ago after seeing the recommendations on a neighborhood Facebook page.  It's a very good choice with a surprising variety of breakfast dishes, all served by a friendly staff.  My personal favorites are the basic French toast and pancake dishes; the bread pudding French toast is outstanding and very filling.  I've also tried the scrambled eggs-skillet potatoes-whole wheat toast and the oatmeal.  The omelette dishes are enormous, though I haven't tried them yet.  I've already recommended the BMBC to neighbors."
"This place rules! Seriously the leek omelette was one of the best I have had in a long time. It was fluffy, not greasy and chock full of veggies and cheese. My wife had the special quiche, which also was just great. It is so great to have a go to breakfast joint in the hood. Do not waste another minute and give it a shot."
"Aww, I remember when this space was a horrible diner called Open 24 Hours with mean-lookin' old guys guarding the door to the video poker room in the back. The Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club could not be more different from that former tenant in this space, and that's very good news.Been here a couple of times so far, got the chorizo skillet the first time. This made every other ""chorizo skillet"" I've ever had taste like a pale shadow. It's fantastic. Second time I got the Rancheros Burrachos, a non-menu special, and it was even better. Perfectly fried sweet plantains on the side, a nice portion of red rice and black beans. Excellent. The regular menu looks great, but definitely check out the chalkboard specials when you drop in. There's some incredible stuff on there.Can't wait to go back and take more people. Highly, highly recommended."
You don't know breakfast until you've eaten here! Best chilaquiles I've ever had! French toast putting was like having heavenly dessert for breakfast. Potatoes and eggs more like foodgasm!
"My neighbors came over and asked if I had been here yet. They were very excited- the kind of excited that happens when you get to share something new and delicious. Off to brunch! The menu is small but spans a broad range of traditional to sweet to savory. I ordered the blackberry French toast- pillowy, warm, thick eggy slices with all the saucy jam you could ever want! Yes, the chef makes the layers of jam (blackberry and kiwi) and it is bliss. I could only eat half and boyfriend devoured the rest. My friend's five year old ordered the berries and cream French toast (from the grown up menu) and nothing was left- this is most impressive for a five year old. Boyfriend ordered decadent biscuits and gravy with sausage, poached eggs, hash and that order was the size of a platter for a family. My friend had the chorizo skillet- mostly potatoes but filled with black beans, egg, avocado, sour cream and cheese. My friend's husband ordered the savory pain pancakes were packed with veggies- crispy Brussel sprouts, scallions, leeks, onion, garlic, pork belly and it was so rich and golden with egg yolk it glowed. No leftovers. None. Juice, coffee, colas in a decor reminiscent of a Wisconsin Grandma's warm, clean, homey kitchen.  Cash only. A 7-11 across the street in case you need to run to the ATM. Really sweet staff makes this unexpected, inexpensive- you MUST go and try the blackberry French toast. Don't hesitate. It'll get crazy when everyone finds out how delicious the brunch is, with something for everyone. Oh and this street is under construction which right now keeps the wait down but will explode soon when driving and parking becomes easier."
"Stopped in again, this time for lunch.  Great food, nice people. Still highly recommended."
"A very much needed quality restaurant in Hollywood Park!  Quality ingredients and presentation.  The diced potatoes are my favorite.  In general, all our food was delicious. The staff is great as well.  Very friendly. Even the bus boys kept stopping by to check on the accuracy of our order that was delivered and making sure we had sufficient coffee throughout our visit. The place is very clean and overall a great experience.General comments:- The pancake was a little dense for my liking.  I like pancakes that are bit more fluffier and airy. - The dish rack placed as you enter the kitchen area is a bit annoying.  The dishes and silverware are thrown in the plastics bins in a hurry. The place is small and they make a loud noise. I'm sure they don't realize it, but when you are in the middle of a conversation they drown you out. - Even though we went during a peak period, we noticed the high tables were not used. Seems that space would be better utilized if they were regular tables placed there?  (just an observation).This place is star of the many food joints in the area.  It's nice to know we have a place we can walk to on a Sunday morning and not have to drive to Lincoln Square or Anderson Ville.  Great menu. Can not wait to try some of the other dishes."
Really love the food but each time I come they don't have enough staff to provide adequate service to their customers. We have come on two separate occasions and have had the same experience. The staff tries hard to manage the orders so it's not a reflection on them just the managements poor planning.
"I'm writing my first review in more than two years because this place is so amazing. Yes, amazing is a big word, especially considering I've only eaten here once, but no one ever accused Yelpers of subtlety. If everything else sucked, I would still give BMBC 4 stars on the strength of its sweet pea vegetable soup. Rich, complex, sweetness from the peas, a mix of veggies that included zucchini and cauliflower, this soup was a meal in itself, and it was only a side. Lunches come with a choice of fries, sweet potato fries, soup, salad, and a few other things. The soup wasn't a measly cup, but a big ol' honkin' bowl. Oh my.Yes, I did have lunch, a cheeseburger club, which is a cheeseburger topped with pulled pork. Yes, you read that correctly. Pulled pork. It wasn't the sloppy mess you'd imagine; the pork was more of a condiment than a big glop. I didn't even think until after the fact that the waiter never asked how I wanted my burger cooked. You know why? Cause the chef knows what he's doing, and how you're burger should be cooked! It was very good.Pop in cans, cash only.For years, this corner has been one disappointment after another. I teach at Northeastern, up the street, and I see a LOT of meals here in the future. 4 stars cause I've only been here once. I'm coming back in three days."
"I'm conflicted about writing this review because I don't really want it to be popular, but they are such a sweet, homegrown business, who am I to hold them back, and in a neighborhood that needs a better sort of breakfast experience. The savory dishes are particularly tasty but my son loved the fruit infused french toast. Great  food, great coffee, great ambiance, great service--the whole deal."
"Love this place! Delicious food, friendly people, good prices! One of my all-time favorite brunch places. I hope they stay around forever and don't fall victim to the craziness of Northeastern. Support this local business, please!"
"Cant wait to try again, when i'm in that neighborhood- Great Chiliquiles!,.Nice friendly staff, and Clean bright interior."
Please keep in mind this review is being written by a breakfast connoisseur....Possibly the best breakfast place in the city. It is my favorite by far and they are priced reasonably.If this place was in a posh trendy neighborhood they could charge double and the local yuppies would love it.Do yourself a favor and try this gem. Service food atmosphere all 5 star.
Awesome place!!! First time coming here and already in love!! great food & great service!!! Bread pudding french toast is the best!!! Try this place if you are looking for a great breakfast place great cozy place just around the corner of my house!!!
Best veggie burger I have ever had!!! Will definitely be back to try more.
"Love being offered a cup of coffee as I wait for a table. It somehow softens the blow of waiting... which was only a few minutes. I was surprised at how busy they were for a ""soft"" opening. The super-cool staff suggested the ""Spicy waffles."" After getting past the beautiful presentation & a garnish of powdered sugar-dusted graham crackers, strawberries & mint leaves, I dug in. The overall ""spicy"" was from cinnamon ... not jalapeño or cayenne, as one would think (though would kinda be a delicious twist). The waffles were light & crisp (did I taste coconut oil?) which cradled the bananas, blueberries & mascarpone beautifully. There were so many other dishes I want to try. I'm looking forward to my next visit."
"From the outside the place looked kind of non descript.  Most likely I would have driven by had I not been meeting someone there.Oh Santa!  Thank you for the early Christmas gift!We were quickly greeted and seated.  The place is small, somewhat cramped.  arrive early to be seated quickly.  Menus and coffee arrived.Decisions, decisions.  Their dishes are best described as innovative.Unusual French Toast, Waffles, Omelets, Helloooooo, Gravy and biscuits!  There is also a specials board.I ordered one of the omelets.  It had basil sauce, tomatoes, pancetta, cheese (I think) ..well lots of stuff!  It is hard to describe it other than quite tasty.  The eggs in it were somehow different.  Soft?  Can't find the words for them.  Definitely not wet.  Maybe a fluffiness?  My friend tasted them and she liked them also.  I nixed the hash browns and was offered sliced tomatoes instead.My friend ordered some chorizo dish with beans.  I passed it over on the menu.  It would be too spicy for me.  Well, I tried it.  Oh my!  Why oh why did I pass it over?  It had just the right spiciness. This is a great spot.  I definitely will return."
"I love everything about this place. The chef makes the bread for the French toast in house, soooooo it's amazing. Staff is great. Potatoes are great!"
"This place is just too perfect and cute. Their dishes are on POINT  especially their skirt steak skillet. If you get really hungry in the morning and you think you can devour steak, WHY NOT?! And the environment of the restaurant is very chill and relaxing, not to mention the food is DEF instagram worthy.... :D"
"This the best breakfast spot in my neighborhood. The service was great. Kevin took care of us and made sure we had enough to eat and drink. And even offered to help us finish our food lol. He was awesome. The food was delish. If you like french toast, the banana rumba french toast is perfect. We'll be making this part of our weekend routine."
"good food, good service, good pricing, generous helpings, we came here becauseTre Kronor, the Swedish restaurant rejected us as patrons - No Starbucks is allowed to be brought into our restaurant !  No problem at the BMBC !  We are happy customers of the Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club !"
Stuffed French Toast was so great and packed full of flavor ! Didn't expect to have such great food that was so full of flavor when I found out the location as I remember a different establishment but I was not disappointed one bit! The combination of flavors and creativity of the dishes were great! I always have left overs and with this dish I left my plate clean! Will be back for sure :)
"Delicious, healthy, home cooked  Mexican and American style breakfasts and lunches served daily. First day ordered the chorizo skillet which was an amazing combo of favors! It was SO good the next day we went back and I tried the multigrain blueberry pancakes with berries. Both breakfasts were so good, both days my only dilemma will be which one to order next time!?"
"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  Was expecting a looong wait but to our surprise, we were seated within minutes.  The place has a rustic diner vibe which I love.  The recylced and reclaimed wood made into tables and chairs are awesome.  Food presentation is fabulous and flavor is even better.  We tried the chilaquiles and sourdough french toast - both delicious.  Oh and bottomless coffee!!!"
"I have proclaimed this restaurant as my new ""go to"" breakfast place...all within walking distance to the house and my son's school.  I had the steak skillet and I say that this was the best steak skillet I have ever had!  I can't wait to make time for lunch!"
"This place is great - a hipster place but unpretentious and inviting, this restaurant is such a great addition to the neighborhood which needed a breath of fresh air when it comes to the food options in the area.I had the chilaquiles verde and my husband had the pajun pancake with pork belly - both were delicious and the portion amount was great, especially for the price point. We watched an array of different types of groups come in: families, couples, old, young... it was a great eclectic mix that you normally find in the wicker park area. Can't wait to come back with the kids and try everything else on the menu."
Excellent... Can't wait to go back. I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the food was!!
Food and service were great!! I had the Pajun Pancake which was amazing!! Unlike anything I have ever had for breakfast. Delicious! My fiancée had the blueberry pancakes which were also great. Will def return!
"I love this place - it's my new favorite brunch spot! The food is always stellar, the staff are friendly and attentive, and the portions are generous. They offer plenty of vegetarian options which is wonderful. I can't recommend them enough!"
"First time coming here! Will be back. Delicious food, we shared the chorizo skillet, and the peach&  sour cherry pancakes!  Yumm!  Comfortable seats and nice decor. Very good service.. I forgot  the name of our server,(my apologies) but he was friendly, knowledge able and good, he had a beard! Coffee was good no bitterness.. This is type of place you want to come back again and again."
"I regret to say that I changed my mind about this place after discovering three times that they won't turn on their A/C, no matter how hot and humid the weather is. WTF?!"
"We ate at the BMBC for the first time on Saturday after our daughter's baseball game.  There were 5 of us.  We arrived around 9:30 and the restaurant was full.  We gave our name for party of 5.  We were told we'd have to wait because they didn't have larger tables and they needed to put two together.  We were okay with that - for a while.  We watched as other parties were seated ahead of us at tables that could have accommodated 5 but the hostess wouldn't put a chair on the end of the table.  So, we waited and waited (with a very hungry 6 year old that just played ball).  After 20 minutes, I asked how much longer we were going to wait and the response was ""not that long.""  When I specifically asked to be quoted a time she refused.  I explained that if it's 5 minutes we'll wait but if it's 15 additional minutes we would go.  The hostess then stated ""it's probably somewhere in there, maybe."" (I am not making this up.)  When I said that she keeps qualifying her statement she just gave me a look and a smirk and tried to ignore me.  I was completely annoyed.  Just quote me a time and keep the nonsense.When the table was finally ready - in two minutes from when we had the conversation above - we sat down.  The service was friendly, the options were creative and interesting and we were all hungry.  Our daughter ordered the silver dollar hot cakes and gobbled them right up.  I had the omelet with leaks, gruyere cheese and asparagus that was delicious.  Other items ordered were the berry kiwi French toast, fresh squeezed oj and the pajeon pancake.  Everything was fresh, hot and delivered with a smile.  Would give it 5 stars except for the ridiculousness at the hostess stand.  I wouldn't recommend for larger groups/families due to the lack of larger tables.  I'd go back again but maybe with just 4 or fewer of us."
"Lovely food, lovely service, lovely decor...this place is excellent! They were crowded and folks were waiting but were seated pretty quickly, ranging from parties of 2-7. The server made excellent recommendations when I asked him to help me narrow down my choices. I got the veggie omelet (the one with leeks/asparagus/mushrooms/spinach/gruyere) and a side of french toast. The french toast was especially amazing! Can't wait to go back."
"Wow. Had an amazing breakfast here today. Banana waffles with a great cinnamon syrup, some fresh whipped cream,  fresh pear and mint for a garnish along with some blueberries and topped with powdered sugar. So refreshing. Not heavy at all. Also had two fried eggs with their excellent potato hash and perfectly crisp bacon on the side. Everything was fresh and presented perfectly. Great interior very warm and cozy. Great staff too. Will definitely come back, maybe it will even be the usual joint."
"When I saw the high reviews for this place, I decided to try it myself. I realized these people realy do some things little different here. If you are a real fooide like me, not someone who just tries new place for fun but actually knows what he is doing, I am sure you can see the small details here.I ordered 3 dishes, steak skillet, leeks omlette and a side of pancake.The skillet was better than any other place I tried. It was not a mushy greasy and over loaded with cubic potatoes, which is normally what you get at other places. Everything was very proportionate and well organized. Slice of fruit, a piece of cilantro, choppes onions on top, avacado hidden under the nicely cut steak pieces. I was impressed. The order of the ingridients were really good. The omlette was good. and the pancake was ok.Now the cons: It is little pricey, you pay the amount that you would pay in a hip area. Yes the food is good, but for this price I would expect the sides to be better or the omlettes served with hash browns or pancakes.The second thing is the price of the pancake. Guys come on! you are not the first diner who served pancake with little bit of  blue berries and two chopped pieces of strawberry on the side. Nice touch but 3$ for one single small pancake is way too much! A really small kid portion size pancake not a huge fluffy one like you would get in golden nugget or somewhere.I think a price adjustment or offering a little more for the price will help this place."
When I ordered the breakfast burrito I was told that I'd be getting the 'best damn burrito' I've ever tasted.Absolutely true.Go there.  Now.
"Good quality food. Clean. Very friendly staff. Portions are good but I'd prefer leftovers for the price. Everything is about 10$chilaquiles: great! next time i will sub the rice for fries though-- they're really good! mahi tacos: awesome!  i will definitely order this again. everything else i saw looked great, can't wait to try more :)"
"Beautiful decor, and clean place! Food was just alright, nothing amazing. I ordered well done beef, and it came out very raw and cold. Giving them 3 stars cause we waited over an hr for food, and they weren't even that busy. Owner was very nice, and didn't charge us for one dish. I'm going to give them another chance, and come back one more time to see if there's any  improvement.  .."
"The food was good, but there definitely better places out there. It was still pretty good. The inside of the resturant is pretty cute, it has that homey feeling. The food was pretty good, I enjoyed my friend's egg Benedict. I had the French Toast and it was pretty sweet for my liking. Overall it's a good place to eat at!"
"After reading the good reviews I decided to try it out today, 10/13 around 11 AM.  Breakfast: Bacon & eggs, potatoes, fruit, toast and coffee. Great food, cooked well and tasty.  Toast (rye) was small. Crowded, but not over crowded.  Families with kids were there.  Used a cable lock for my bike, to the garbage can on the sidewalk.Maybe a little pricey.  It set me back about $14.50, including tip.  I'm not sure how often I'd return but I would go back again.  Maybe for lunch, I did look over their lunch menu."
"Love the Caribbean omelet and the coffee was good. But uncomfortable bar seats, no back on them."
I'll keep this short and sweet. The bread pudding french toast is INSANE. Just get it already. Even if you're a savory brunch person (as I am) you need to experience this french toast. My only complaint about this place is that the coffee was on the weak side.
"I've driven past this place constantly, and it was rare when I didn't see a long of people waiting to get it. On a whim, my family and I tried it, and it was amazing! Granted we only had only gone once, but the food was good enough to convince us we need to go back on our next free day (work/school schedules are in the way).  I cannot remember what my husband had, but my daughter ate the pancakes while I had the Jamaican omelette ...t'was yummy! Can't forget the service, it was very nice too."
"I came here for my birthday a couple months ago, and sadly, I wasn't so impressed with the food. I ordered the Mexican Benedict which was suggested from fellow yelpers. Sadly, my poached eggs were cold. I am not able to eat eggs unless it's hot in temperature. Also my side of potatoes were hard, cold and not fresh. This was a downer to me because I was looking forward to devouring some delicious foods per my fellow yelpers...I was disappointed.  My friends ordered the lemon curd french toast which was tasty but not the best that I've had. The customer service was very good here though! Everyone was very friendly and the decor here is so cute. Beware...it's very small!"
beyond phenomenal!  orgasmic!  everything is  extraordinary!owner is the chef and is a culinary genius!  tips: bring cash & come early or around noon. sunday is breakfast only. no alcohol.
"LOVED IT.  The NEIU neighborhood needed a place like this!  The menu is so great looking, I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to order.  There were several vegetarian options that all looked amazing.  Ultimately, I chose the chilaquiles verdes, and they were delish.  I am definitely going back ASAP.  There's nothing not to like here, it is just GREAT."
Not sure if they had the 4 deuces here but sure they would have made it if asked...got the French toast and it was great! Meters are free on Sunday-big plus!
"I hesitate to even write a review -- it was great to walk in today and not wait for a table. If more people discover this place... It is an exceptional brunch joint and a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Today we had the breakfast torta (on the regular menu) and the Mayan eggs Benedict (a special) -- both were great. I can't wait to come back and sample some of the sweet offerings, like the bread pudding French toast. The coffee was good and plentiful, and there was lots of attentive service. There is also a nice kids menu and they have high chairs and boosters. The laid back atmosphere is ideal for families, singles, couples, groups of friends, anyone."
"Loved the food, the place and the service. Had the Chorizo Skillet and decaf coffee...great coffee!!! Thank you Edgar for serving us today. We'll be back with the whole family"
