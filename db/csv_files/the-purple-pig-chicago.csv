The Purple Pig
"PURPLE PIG - Stars: I found this place on yelp! and suggested it for dinner because of the reviews. One friend had been here and said, ""great place!"".  After my experience, I concur - and I plan to come again.We arrived about 6:30pm on a Friday evening and felt the good energy and vibe. Was told it would be a 90 minute wait... then quickly told they had immediate seating for four in the corner of the terrace. Of course we took it. Our table was next to the busy doorway to the kitchen, but wasn't bad at all. Sure beat a long wait - and we got smiles and nods from the staff coming and going all evening. The staff accommodated our request to rotate the large fan so it wasn't blowing directly on us.Our server was great, answering questions about the menu and suggesting items. We were told two items per person was about the right amount to order -- we would have been satisfied with 7 small plates between 4 of us, but 8 was a bonus and nothing went to waste. The dishes were spaced out and arrived at perfect intervals so each item could be properly enjoyed. The bacon dish was so awesome we ordered a second. If you don't have an aversion to meat or pork, I highly recommend it! The chicken skewer with cucumber dill yogurt was great, as was the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.My only ""complaint"" is that Sangria is not offered by the pitcher. That would have been a nice touch for our party of four. THE BOTTOM LINE: For the downtown tourist area, this is a great spot and not over-priced. Make a reservation or factor in some wait time during busy dinner hours, but don't let a long wait cause you to miss out on this tapas experience."
"The Purple Pig is a great example of exceptional cuisine in Chicago.  It is almost always packed as it is right on Michigan Avenue and has great seating both inside, at the bar, and outside with both shade and open sun.  There were a variety of different groups and people there although both the atmosphere, crowd, and prices incline me to not recommend bringing children there.  Very few details are overlooked here including the attention to customers.  I believe the manger was working behind the bar and constantly looking at everyone and their dishes and checking on how they were liking it and if they needed anything.  Not in an overbearing way, it was quite busy and he was being diligent.Note for vegetarians, this really isn't the best place, however the vegetarian options they do offer are quite exceptional.  I ordered off the ""Smears"" section of the menu which are served with toast.  I chose the eggplant caponata with goat cheese.  This dish had a ton of amazing surprises in the choice of ingredients and it was really delicious.  My friend ordered the prosciutto stuffed calamari with ink sauce (although I can't seem to find it on the menu right now...)  The sauce was phenomenal and she enjoyed the texture and taste of the seafood.Price is a bit steep but for Michigan Avenue it is understandable especially when you take into account the location and the seating options.In essence, the chef is really diving into the beauty and flavorings of these dishes and creating a profound and haute menu in a city that is defined by hotdog recipes.  Keep up the great cooking!"
"We got lucky - it was raining which kept people away so we arrived at 5:30 p.m. and sat right down on the enclosed patio.We ordered the crispy pig ear salad (amazingly light and flavorful), fried olives which were a bit too salty, eggplant caponata (very tasty with raisins and pine nurs) with grilled bread (5 honking large pieces) and goat cheese and the duo of pork belly and pork loin.We also ordered a Sicilian wine - a Passopisciaro which we had enjoyed in Sicily. We look forward to returning."
"Disappointing. The Purple Pig has been on my list of places to go in Chicago and every dish that came out (except the dessert) was lacking. My roommates and I were told there would only be a 45 minute wait. We were finally seated after about 1.5 hours of waiting. The hostess told us they would call our cell phone once our table was ready. After 45 minutes, we went to check on our seating and they had marked us as seated although we never received the call. We were finally seated, and I ordered the beets (picture below with goat cheese and pistachio) and the endives (terrible to say the least). I tried to save the order with a greek yogurt smear. This had a unique and better flavor, but not sure if it was really worth it.Now the dessert options here are fantastic. We got the Sicilian iris, Loukoumades, and Greek cheesecake. I LOVED the Sicilian Iris.. I mean how could you not loved a filled donut? They slightly redeemed themselves with the dessert, but overall I will not be returning to this restaurant. Wanted to note that my two roommates ate the meat dishes and they were mixed on their review. They ordered the bone marrow (3 stars), pig ear (3 stars), pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (5 stars) and the razor clams (4 stars).They're doing something right because the wait is always long. Just not right for me."
"My favourite tapas resto in Chicago! This place is always poppin with people. I went here on a Friday night and they sat my boyfriend and I immediately despite it was busy. The service was fast! We ordered the pigs ear with crispy kale, the broccoli with breadcrumbs, their amazing bone Marrow,  and they pork shoulder in mash potatoes milk. Everything exceeded my expectations! The broccoli was crisp and the parmeasean breadcrumbs complemented the sauce. The bone Marrow was my fave!!! So buttery and the salad that was on top was the best, it really cut the fatty after taste.The pork shoulder was sooo tender it just melted in my mouth. And last but not least the pigs ear and Krispy kale with egg on top was out of this world!!! That's def. a must try! This place has been recommended to me by 4 different people and they ratings were really high. If you ever get the chance to visit purple pig then you will not be dissapointed! And remember this is a TAPAS resto, something to share with a glass of wine."
"I FINALLY made it and I did not have a wait. I know. I get it. I was just as shocked as you probably are right now. The potential waiting time has discouraged me time after time. Because while I heard nothing but great things, I struggled to bring myself to make the trek and potentially wait to eat in a city with good restaurants every 40 feet. But I packed my patience and did not need it. The tell all sign of a great meal is a uncomfortably full belly. We came. We ate and left full enough to pop. Two people, five items  and a doggie bag later, we were glad we ventured over.We ordered the broccoli dish, the roasted beets with goat cheese, fried manchego, pork shoulder and the chicken kebab thighs. Loved it all.  It was very filling. The plates are small plates intended for sharing but 2-3 per person is plenty. Anything more is going to be left behind or taken to go. There's little chance you can eat much more than that. Trust me, I tried. It's practically impossible. I would definitely return if downtown and would be inclined to order all of the same items with the exception of the pork shoulder and beets. They were good but both are items you could order at many other establishments with trendy selections."
"Excellent service...the place was packed and they went out of the way to accommodate our party of 10 on a Saturday night!Since the wait was 2 hours, we ordered drinks and appetizers out front by a spectacular and cute waiter who was insanely chill despite the tornado of customers around him. We consumed our drinks and apps on a bartop counter in the back before being seated to a real table. I got the 3 Amigos drink ( with pork and rosemary in it!) which was delicious and tasted like caramel sherry. For food I ordered the panini with bacon jam and green tomato jam, which was a super satisfying combo of savory and sweet flavors. I finished off with a lemon cotta dessert which was very creamy and fruit forward...super balanced!My only issue was that they had issues splitting the check 4 ways and our table waitress seemed pretty sour, but it was late on a Sat night by the time we got seated."
"Two Words: Razor Clams! I have been dreaming of them ever since vacationing in Spain some years ago. These clams were fantastic (ok they might have been a touch overcooked) and brought me back to Barcelona. We ordered a number of other signature dishes, including fried pig's ears, pork neck bone gravy with ricotta, milk braised pork shoulder, and a few others. Everything had great flavors but this food was very rich and heavy - best to start with just two and build from there. I was a little disappointed by the pig's ears. I enjoyed cured pig's ears when I was little. Unfortunately this dish managed to completely remove any taste of ""pig"" imo. All I tasted were fried crumbs. They could have been fried shoelaces for all I know. I loved both their red and white sangrias. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. All in all, we had a wonderful meal in a nice, relaxed atmosphere to start our weekend evening, thanks to the Purple Pig."
"Came on a Sunday for an early dinner.  No wait.  Seated outside (but both were available).  Ordered sharing style.  Broccoli.  Nice acidity & seasoned very well! Burrata.  An innovative foam land crispy.  Very Tasty & light!  Cauliflower.  Green & purple.  Flavorful.   Shimp Saganaki.  Red sauce.  Tasty but the least innovative item of all we ordered.  Served w toast.  Beets w whipped goat cheese. Creamy bite sized perfection.  Pork shoulder.  Very tender.  Served on creamy mashed potatoes.  Flavor is ""fat boy good"" (per the hubs).  Nutella Crepe. Get it.  Perfect for two For us, this place is eye to eye with Girl & the goat.  American small plates.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Innovative.  Casual.  Friendly & attentive service.  Truly loved everything we ate.  BUT did not love the Bloody Mary.  Couldn't get past the first 2 sips.  They responded properly and inquired why to improve their product....then got me another drink. That's a plus :) Hubs said the men's room is nothing special.  But that's it's private and that's good.  No reservations so gotta be strategic with your timing or be ready to wait!"
"Great food, especially if you can avoid the wait // LOCATION // Conveniently located at the beginning of Magnificant Mile// WAIT // None at 2 pm on a weekday. Sit on the patio to try to avoid a longer wait // FOOD // Food is meant to be shared and is tapas style      + Octopus: Fresh and super tender! Great flavor and was my fave dish      + Pig ear: Topped with egg because everything is better with an egg. Savory and crunchy"
"The Purple Pig is a great place to go with a ton of people so you can share all of the Mediterranean styled tapas/small plates. I went with my husband today and wish we had a few extra mouths with us so we could order the whole menu. Got the roasted beets with cheese, bone marrow, grilled octopus and the pig ears and for dessert, salted caramel soft serve. Everything we are was delic! The servers do pace your courses out and don't submit your orders to the kitchen till you're ready or they think your ready. This was a slight problem since we had to wait 40 minutes between courses 2 and 3. I would still go back but be aware that when it gets busy, servers may forget to pop your orders in on a timely manner."
"I was somewhat torn between giving The Purple Pig four versus five stars, but I decided to round up in the end. When we arrived at 8PM on a Friday night, we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours. Fortunately, they have this system where you put your cellphone number down and they call you when your table is ready.We were lucky and the wait turned out to be only 50 minutes! We explored a nearby candy store while we were waiting.The restaurant is actually somewhat small considering its popularity, although they do have a few outdoor tables as well. The interior is on the darker side, but is fairly modern with some of the lanterns covered with the restaurant's menu. It also gets pretty noisy indoors.Service was not bad during our visit. Our waiter was attentive enough, although different people sometimes brought out our dishes or refilled our water.As for the food, it's tapas style and the portion sizes of various plates can vary considerably. We ended up sharing six dishes between the three of us. All of them were pretty darn delicious, and attention was paid to presentation as well. See all of my photos for details!It IS a little pricey, but you are definitely paying for quality food that is carefully executed. I definitely think it's a great restaurant to come to celebrate a special occasion!"
"I have looked forward to dining at the Purple Pig since I moved to Chicago a year ago. Two days ago, I finally had the chance to go with my roommates and we were sorrily disappointed. The food was just okay, leaving us unsatisfied and without a desire to return.With only a 45 minute wait, we were ecstatic that our spontaneous trip to PP was actually happening. My vegetarian roommate ordered the beets (which came with a creamy goat cheese and cruncy pistachio complement) and the endives (our waiter highly recommended this). She had such a look of displeasure after tasting the endives. The robiola tasted terrible and she couldn't believe she had paid $11 for this dish. Because the endives were such a failure, she wanted to redeem her experience at PP by ordering the greek yogurt smear. This was pretty good and a unique taste. Was it worth $12? Questionable...I ordered the classics: bone marrow and pig ear. The flavors of the pig ear were good, but in the end, I felt like I was just eating unidentified crunchy fried bits. There was also too much cherry pepper for my liking. I've only had bone marrow one other time, but something was off about the gelatinous texture of the bone marrow here. I wanted to love it, but I just felt greasy and discontented. My other roommate ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the razor clams and loved them both! Glad at least one of us enjoyed their meal.Three hungry girls went in and came out of the dinner portion still craving soooo we ordered three desserts: the Sicilian Iris, the Loukoumades, and the greek cheesecake. My personal favorite was the cheesecake.. so creamy and flavorful! My roommates loved the sicilian iris, a chocolate-filled brioche, which was absolutely sinful!Overall service was fine. We went in checking our our table and they had crossed our name off the list because apparently they had called and received no answer. I guess there was service issues, but thankfully, we still seated shortly. Our server didn't check in too often, but all in all, the Purple Pig didn't live up to our high, high expectations. Don't think we will come back soon, but obviously there are many fans of the place so good for them!"
"WOW, this place blew me away. Got seated right away on a Tuesday afternoon, and the servers were very friendly and great at explaining the menu.My bf and I ordered the crispy pig ears, bone marrow, and octopus. The crispy pig ears were my favorite. They were super crispy, mixed with crispy kale and an egg on top. The pickled peppers added a great kick to the dish. The octopus was my second favorite. It was tender and not chewy at all. The salsa verde was a great sauce with it as well as the fingerling potatoes. The bone marrow came with some grilled bread, and was just okay to me. For dessert, we got the sicilian iris, which was recommended by our server. It's like a big donut stuffed with chocolate and ricotta.  We were pretty full, but all the items on the menu sounded amazing! I wish we came with more people because this spot is great for sharing."
"When is it ever an off-peak time to dine at the Purple Pig?  We were quoted a 30-40 min wait time at 1pm on a summer Friday.  What better way to rev up an appetite than to run back to PP from Do-Rite Donuts after receiving a phone call that your table is ready (not that we had any experience with that or anything)?Choose your dishes carefully.  I found the offerings to be hit or miss on this latest visit.  We didn't order the bone marrow, but I was eyeing our neighbors' dish, and it looked delicious.Hits: the jowl with duck egg, foie gras and pork tenderloin pateMisses: Greek cornbread (ordinary; plus no piggy!), housemade meatballs (they were fine, but we were expecting more elevated flavors)Huge miss: pork blade steak.  It'll look like a bargain quantity-wise for $17, but that is one low grade cut of meat.  It was chewy and rubbery, and we wished we had gotten the milk braised pork shoulder instead.Also be prepared for communal seating!"
Just in Chicago for the weekend and have been trying to eat at this place every day since we got here. Seems like Sunday morning/brunch time is prime as there was no wait. Woot woot! Cute and trendy atmosphere is good for a casual meal w a friend or date:)Things we ordered:- broccoli - not impressed and too salty- bone marrow - most people like it and it was good...but so oily i didn't feel very great eating it- pig ear - really good- pork shoulder with mashed potato - AMAZING and the reason why i gave this place 4 instead of 3 stars
"I am going back to this place again and again and again! Had the bone marrow, morcilla with lobster and my friend had the pork shoulder. Outstanding! Wait is long so go early or try Lunch instead of Dinner. Centrally located in the heart of Magnificent Mile's shoppin district, it is easily the best resto to hit up while shopping in the Chicago."
"Despite the name, this place is also a good choice for vegetarians. We had six courses, and aside from a little bacon in one of them, there was no pig or other meat involved. The highlights were the peas (because of the fresh mint mixed in) and the leeks. There is a great selection of both pasteurized and raw milk cheeses, which made a wonderful dessert plate for two.For me, though, the reason to go is the remarkable wine list, with hundreds of selections, all from countries bordering the Mediterranean. Nearly every selection is available by the glass, demi, half or full bottle, and they'll even open a bottle of any of the wines priced under $50 (which is nearly all of them) and pour you just half. So it's a great place to explore varieties and appellations you've never heard of.One word of warning: the atmosphere is vibrant (read that as LOUD) to say the least, so it's not a place for intimate conversation. It's somewhat better on the patio, but even there it's pretty boisterous."
"The Purple Pig is a tapas style bistro located in the heart of down town Chicago.  If you're patient enough to brave Michigan Avenue and venture to a restaurant that doesn't take reservations, you'll be rewarded with a tapas experience with some creative dishes.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Once you head up the steps off Michigan Avenue, you'll find a metal gate with the sign for The Purple Pig.  A few notes - it's busy.  If you don't want to wait try a late or early lunch on a weekday.  There is an enclosed patio that adds to the restaurant space.  Inside you'll find lots of high tables, but again tight spaces.  The outdoor patio (where we sat) is fully enclosed but you do still feel like you're outside.  It was a beautiful day in Chicago so I'm not sure if it's fully climate controlled during hot/cold days.   1/2 Stars.Service - Great!  This is a tapas (small plates) restaurants for adults, but we like to take our kids out to explore food with us and our serve was quick to point out dishes that were kid friendly.  She was also great with explaining the menu and concept, and answered any and all our questions.  She was really fantastic, even going an extra mile to get pens for the kids even when not requested.  But the best part was she carefully explained the popular dishes so that we could make our decisions.  1 Star. Food - The good thing about a tapas restaurant is that you get to order and try many things.  The bad thing is this can add up and you may not like everything.  We experienced this at The Purple Pig, but most dishes were very creative & delicious.  I'll start with the bone marrow - this rich, indulgent, and delicious dish was served with nice herbs (parsley or cilantro) and toasted bread.  This help cut the marrow quite a bit, but it was easily everyone's (including the kids) favorite dish.  The other stand out was the fried pig ears.  This was served on top of fried kale and topped with an egg.  Believe it or not, it was the kale that made this dish so tasty.  Our kids split the fried bologna sandwich (neither liked it).  We order everything from razor clams (good), pulled pork (ok), meat balls (ok), and even the cured meat/cheese plate (yum).  Bottom line - there are some outstanding items, but you'll find yourself finding it hard to choose and end up ordering as much as you can like we did.  1 Star.Will I Return? - Maybe.  The menu is outstanding, you just have to make sure you plan out your meal.  So many things are enticing it's hard to settle on one thing.  It's best to bring a large group of friends to share the plates and bill.  Avoid going solo for sure.   1/2 Star. My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
"Ain't gonna slog through 3,000+ reviews to make sure I don't repeat anything. I'll just say to my friends who are in the area that the PP should probably merit inclusion on your itinerary if you're in Chicago for more than three days. The prices are reasonable and the food is good, as long as you don't mind waiting a bit for a communal table.We enjoyed the burrata Pugliese, the Greek cornbread with feta soaked in honey, pillows of fried cheese and an artfully-arranged rabbit roulade. I also got to try a Rhône varietal I hadn't tried before, the Picpoul blanc."
"On a recent visit to Chicago, my bf and I joined my cousin and his wife for dinner at The Purple Pig, where we waited two hours for a table.  Well, it was worth the wait!I could barely keep my face out of the salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette at The Purple Pig. Ugh, they were awesome. And so was the cheese plate we ordered!In total, no lie I think we split 17 different small plates, and each one was more unique, intricate, and exciting than the next. One of my favorite dishes we ordered was the eggplant caponata with goat cheese. The cool, sweet, almost chili-like eggplant dip spread atop the goat cheese-smeared pieces of toast was absolutely breathtaking. Dining at The Purple Pig was a truly exciting culinary experience!"
"Just landed and straight to my hotel I go. Oh, how convenient was this restaurant? The restaurant was right across the street from my hotel. Score!My favorites of the night:- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.- Lobster and blood sausage- Fried Manchego CheeseI was a little disappointed about the dessert. Was actually looking forward to it, but I'm okay with that. Overall, I love the ambiance, the food, and definitely the friendly staffs. I hope you give this place a try. Cheers!"
"When you walk closer to The Purple Pig, the aroma already starts to bring up your taste bud's expectation. Looking at over 3300 reviews on Yelp, you know how popular this establishment is. Since they don't take reservations, a wait of an hour during meal time should be planned. Knowing that, I walked into the restaurant at 3pm and was able to sit at their communal table without any wait. The communal table is a perfect place to sit if you dine alone, as you can pretend to be part of a big family. And I was lucky enough to strike a conversation with a local couple next to me, definitely a plus to the dining experience. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is very nice, however the music is kind of loud if that concerns you.The Purple Pig serves Mediterranean cuisine that is designed for sharing. Since I was just by myself, the waitress Nikki recommended I could try 2 or 3 dishes. Everything on the menu looks very interesting and tempting, I really could not make up my mind. Nikki was nice enough to let me keep the menu and order just one by one. Well, I admit that I did some homework before coming here and knew for sure which one I want to try, that is, Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto. The dish came in with three pieces of squids as you can see in the picture. Boy, that was the BEST squid I have ever tasted in any restaurant. The tenderness of the squid is perfect, so that it is not chewy as usually it is. The flavor of charmoula  sauce blends impeccably with the squid. I am not too crazy about the stuffed prosciutto as I still love prosciutto in its original form. It is the texture rather the meat that I am too keen about. But this dish definitely is a reorder, and lives up to the restaurant's reputation. While enjoying the squid, I was checking on the menu too and my eyes settled on pig ears. This was the first time I ordered pig ears in a non-Chinese restaurant. The highlight of this dish in my opinion was the fried egg sitting on the top. Both pig ears and kale were fried to perfection with little breading. I like the fried kale even more in this dish as it was more flavorful. For some reason, I still like our own Chinese way of preparing the pig ears. The fried ones are nice to chew, however, it lost its original texture after being deep fried. Having to finish the entire bowl does not help either. At this point, I was a bit torn whether to order the third dish or not. My mind told me to do so while my stomach was begging for a stop. After much debating and discussing with Nikki, I landed on the Charred Cauliflower. This turned out to be another spectacular dish that lands on my reorder list. The theme of this dish is crunchy. The cauliflower was grilled into a perfectly crunchy texture with vinaigrette nicely sprinkled and flavored.  So, the sourness, the crunchiness paired so well that I finished this before I realized myself. All in all, I found the ingredients are all very interesting and the combination of spices are most intriguing. I would for sue come back here next time I am in town, preferably with three people in the group next time, and I already know what I am going to order."
"Come see Lee at the bar, and let Chad the manager know how blow away you are! Does that sound presumptuous? Well freaking tell me I'm wrong after eating in this unique place or out on its patio which has a view of some great Chicago architecture.  That is if you can look up from your sumptuous bone marrow or charred cauliflower. And cocktails cocktails cocktails! Let Lee set you straight, he's a good guy with more than his share of charm and cocktail knowledge. My only regret is I found out about the place on my last night in town. Otherwise I'd have been a regular.No joke, I want to sell my house and move in here. Holy $h!t what a gem. God bless Chicago and God bless The PURPLE Pig!"
"One of my favorite places in Chicago! The perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine, some tapas, and a good conversation. It can get a little loud, but it just adds to the ambiance. It was located across the street from my hotel and I was there at least 5 times (with different people) during my trip.Favorites:Sicilian Iris- OMG! AMAZING! You have to try this. It was so delicious!Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- A great combination to snack on with some of the heavier dishes.Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette- So yummy! JLT- Pork jowl is one of my favorite cuts, so this dish hit the spot.Remember... SAVE ROOM FOR THE SICILIAN IRIS! It can get crowded, but I never had to wait too long. It's definitely worth it!"
"Fun, small plate, great for sharing restaurant with long, communal tables.  Just when you think you can't stomach another place like this in Chicago, here it is and everyone loves it.  All the dishes were well prepared, especially the roasted cauliflower and the squid stuffed with prosciutto.  Restaurant plays it really safe with the dishes -- meaning every dish sounds more adventurous than it really is.  It caters well to tourists - there is an ingredient glossary hanging over each table.  Most disappointing dish was the pigs ears.  The ears were so thinly sliced it might as well been paper thin bacon.  A bit of a gimmick.  If you're gonna serve pigs ears, then serve pigs ears."
"Super impressed by the food, cocktails, and service. I had stuffed squid, poached lobster with blood sausage, turkey leg confit, and red sangria. Very well season, although I feel like it's a little too salty but I'm not gonna deduct a star just for that because everything else was spotless."
Honest review: saw this on check please and everybody was talking about this and seeing that the wait is 2 hours i thought this was gonna be amaizing Anti pasta:foie gras and pork tenderloin it comes with bread and is like a spread it was really delicious it came with bacon and fried capers that were really delicous. The problem was theres this really tart cherry sauce that tastes like medicine exactly like robitussin that sauce ruined the dish it was so off putting if u get the dish avoid the red sauce Smears: Roasted bone marrow omg this is the most bone marrow on a bone i have ever seen there was so much like u can literly scoop up the marrow with a normal spoon not that little one. It comes with a parsley salad with capers and a little onion. The salad did cut through the richness but isnt really a salad because its parsley. There was no wow factor to this dish like all the times i had bone marrow it had some type of bacon jam that made the dish over the top for example the best bone marrow i ever had was at au cheval it came with a beef cheek jam which was out of this world. I liked the addition of the salad though Fried items: fried pig ears this was amaizing make sure u break the yolk and u mix everything together really well. The pigs ear were supper crispy not alot of cartalidge like i thought it was gonna be it was like really crispy onion rings then the fried kale was to die for i never liked kale before but it was so good tasted like brocoli and theres chilis in the bottom so the spicyness really made the dish a knockout it was a little salt though A la plancha: turkey leg confit omg this was the best dish of the night it was so fucking good the skin was so cripsy it reminded me of carnitas. It was supper tender not dry at all or greasy. Then there was a lot of meat the flavour of the meat was to die for. Then the salad that went along with the dish was so good i never had a salad this good ever it went so well with the turkey really made the dish Whole salt roasted pork tenderloin: this takes a while to come to the table so be warned about that if ur really hungry. This was the most tenderest pork i have ever had in my life literly i didnt need a knife at all it was cooked perfectly. The crackers on the side i didnt really like they were really dry and didnt taste that good. The two sauces the horshradish one i didnt taste any horshradish just tasted like normal creme. The pepper sauce was tart so it cut through the richness of the pork. The dish was good but i wouldnt order again wasnt greatDesserts: nutella crepe the banana ice cream that came with this dish was so delicous was not overturned perfect texture not to sweet either. The nuts on this dish were perfect supper crunchy. The crepe was perfect not supper eggy and not to much flower not supper thing or thick either. The filling was good there was nutella. The problem was theres this really tart cherry sauce that tastes like medicine exactly like robitussin that sauce ruined the dish it was so off putting if u get the dish avoid the red sauce Sicilian iris: the texture of this dessert was heavenly supper crispy like picture like an upscale funnel cake. The inside though wasnt my favorite just was nothing special i took out the filling and just at the crispy parts of the dessertAmbiance: really hipster so really trendy not really nice and elegant kind of ugly to be honest its really tiny to like barely any space to walk and the bathrooms are both girl and guys so its awkward Service: i did not like our waiter at all he was really like like hi bye like he didnt explain anything at all he gave horrible recommendations if any at all he was no where to be found ever he would disappear for like 30 minutes the bus boy was amaizing i wish he was our waiter was supper nice and gave us our bone marrow bones to go for my dog he was so sweet Honestly i wouldnt go back i only liked two things it wasnt really worth it and wasnt really authentic tapas like just because everything has capers doesnt make it Mediterranean i dont think its worth the crazy wait either wish i went somewhere else
"Purple Pig doesn't take reservations but we were lucky to get a table during lunch time without waiting. We started off with some beers and cocktails. We ordered about ten different dishes. My favorite dishes: pig's ear, sformato (pork brain), and roasted bone marrow.Fried pigs ear served with kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg. Crispy and full of flavor. I wasn't too sure what the sformato dish was and found out that it was pork brain. I was a bit hesitant at first but decided to try it anyways. Sformato spread on the bread was AMAZING! No regrets and probably one of the best decisions that I made in my life! While everyone was enjoying the foie gras I was secretly inhaling the sformato. There were a few dishes that weren't spectacular and can be skipped: osso bucco and wagyu sirloin tips. Both dishes were marinated in sauce since it was lacking flavor. Typical dishes and nothing to die for.All our dishes came fairly quick with the exception of the sirloin tips. We talked to our waiter and came back a few minutes and apologized and told us that the chef probably forgot about it. He was friendly and continued to take care of us as we continued to order drinks.When the bill came we realized that our waiter comped half of our drinks which saved us about $100. Very unexpected but definitely appreciate the great service. Overall great experience here and will definitely be returning for the sformato!"
"I had bookmarked Purple Pig to try on my visit to Chicago. I'd read all about the ridiculous waits and no reservation policy but fortunately our hotel, The James, was merely a few blocks away. We put our name in(1.5 hr wait at 6pm on a Saturday) and went back to the hotel to relax and wait it out. We received a call promptly at 7:30 to let us know our table was ready. This hot spot was as expected -- dark, bustling and loud. I wouldn't recommend it for a date. We were seated at the communal high top table, sandwiched snugly. We decided on just four dishes to share since the ones we wanted to try seemed quite heavy --- bone marrow, octopus, pork shoulder and seafood saganaki. The bone marrow came out first and was one of the best and largest bone marrow dishes I've ever had. The accompanying bread was toasted just right -- with a smear of fatty marrow and a heap of salad -- the combination of textures and taste going on made for the perfect bite. The octopus was also quite good. The tentacles were as large as sausage links, tender and juicy. It was a tad salty however, just as the remaining dishes would be. The pork shoulder was as tender as I expected but overly salty, esp. with the gravy. We couldn't finish it. Same with the seafood saganaki, which was also nothing special. I found myself needing to down a glass of tap to counter the saltiness. Ah well.Decent meal.  The bone marrow was definitely the highlight. Was it an off night? Maybe my expectations were too high? Probably. Unfortunately, I won't be back in town anytime soon to give Purple Pig a second chance."
"The Purple Pig is an awesome break from shopping the Magnificent Mile.  Advertised as  small plates, the portions were actually quite sizable.My favorite by far and the motivation for my visit was the bone marrow.  It was served from the bone, seasoned well, and rendered to a congealed consistency that spread nicely on the crusty bread.  The herb salad was dressed heavily enough that it rested safely on the spread marrow.  A pinch of Sicilian sea salt seals the deal.  This would be a sizeable appetizer for three, decadent meal for me. The stuffed squid was just that.  Tasty pastrami and bread crumbs crammed into a whole squid, it was covered with and laid on a couple of nice sauces.  One appeared to be ink, and one was a little brighter.  Both were awesome.  Draft menu was mostly European.  We found that Estrella Damm, a pilsner from Barcelona, paired nicely with both entrees.Service was professional and not at all put off by our light meal."
"Loved the bustling atmosphere and fun menu! Definitely artisan foods, but they also have foods that are more approachable if you are not into that. We ordered a selection of 3 cheeses based on the review of the waitress. Each portion was pretty hearty- I was expecting a smaller piece. We also got a meat board with a selection of 6 meats. All very good. Tons of food for 2 people at lunch, we left stuffed of cheese and meats! Really large wine selection. We arrived at 1 and sat at 1:10 on a Monday in August. Loved that they call your cell when your table is ready."
I'm so hooked on the pigs ear and kale salad AND the bone marrow salad. Both are salads so I hope it counts for something. Oh - and a glass of Picpoul Pinet is also on the line up!It's always busy but since I'm doing the city solo I've snagged at seat at the bar. That's always a good bet. I need to come here with more folks tho...would love to do the food family style.
"Loved, loved loved the purple pig. Would normally give 4 stars (I save 5 for the best food I've ever had), but the service at the bar pushed it over the top!  If gluten sensitive talk to your waiter/bartender about it. Not everything is listed. Had the pork shoulder. It came with flour based gravy, but they took care of it with an amazing attitude. Food was fantastic! Beet salad with whipped goat cheese... Yeah, I at it all by myself...,"
"Purple Pig Pig Purple Piggy Purple Purply Pig Pig PigOkay. Enough with that. This place is amazing and definitely worth the wait: they don't take reservations. Plus, you can shop around Michigan Avenue while you wait for them to call you when your table is ready. My friends and I were in Topshop when they called, so we made our way back. We decided to order and share several dishes such as the razor clams, pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, chicken thigh kabobs with smashed potatoes and tzatziki, and fried petit basque cheese with membrillo. The chicken kabobs were perfectly cooked and paired well with the potatoes and tzatziki. The fried cheese were like a nice take on mozzarella sticks. The pork shoulder was a bit on the salty side, but still very well cooked and. The mashed potatoes were so smooth and creamy. The razor clams were a bit acidic and didn't come with much. I'd say this was the least successful dish of the night. The bill came out to be around $20 per person, but I can't say we were all incredibly full afterwards. Definitely stop by sometime to taste out the creative and flavorful dishes."
"This place is definitely worth the wait. It was one of the top experiences in my trip to Chicago. The place was crowded, but for good reason. The food was excellent, as well as our server and bussers. At one point they kept insisting to change out our plates (but we didn't mind), but they were so insistent that we finally gave in hah! Any foodie would enjoy this place."
"I really wanted to LOVE this place because its so hyped up by everyone, but it's just okay... I mean it's good, but nothing really blew my mind. It's also a bit too salty for me, and I felt this way for like every single dish that I ordered here. My boyfriend and I ordered the pig ear with crispy kale, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder smothered in mashed potatoes & gravy, and chorizo stuffed olives. Our favorite was the pig ear with crispy kale. It comes with an egg on top and you just mix everything up and eat it. As seafood lovers, we ordered the grilled octopus with green beans and potatoes in a salsa verde type of sauce, but it didn't stand out at all :( The food was just overall okay--not awesome, but not horrible. The ambiance was cute though; I would definitely come here for some wine and appetizers with friends if I was local."
"I wanted to try this restaurant two years ago when I visited Chicago, but there was a two hour wait and I was starving. So finally I got to try it last week during my trip in Chicago. I went with a friend that I haven't seen for a long time. We arrived around 12:30pm on a Friday and was told it would be a 45min wait. We sat outside for only about 20 min until our seats were available. We started with some moscato. Our waitress saw us checking the pictures on yelp and recommended bone marrow, pork shoulder, and pig ears. We started with the bone marrow- I'd say the portion is good for 6 people to share since it's so rich. Flavorwise the marrow was very tasty and went well with the bread. But I was super concerned about my heart health after eating it. LOLPig ear was very crunchy, and so was kale. Both were blended nicely with a sunny-side up egg. Although after a couple of bites, I found this dish too greasy. I'd say pork shoulder is my favorite- nicely cooked meat, extremely soft and tender, flavorful, and very comforting. I recommended this place to a couple of other folks and they all enjoyed the food here. As much as I liked the pork-oriented food here, I'd be interested in exploring less greasy options in my future visit."
"Breath easy, Pork Lovers.  Hog Heaven can be found in Chicago and it's glorious. ----The Food---Pig Platter ($29)- It would be sacrilegious not to order a sampling of this traditional, but outstanding charcuterie board.  The pig platter comes with 10-12 cured meats that heighten my appreciation for pork. The supplements of cheese, berry jam, and grilled bread only help with that. JLT ($13)-  What makes this dish is the pork jowl (pork cheeks) which is sufficiently fried, smothered with pesto and blanketed with a fried egg. It's crunchy, chewy, slightly charred and zestily finished with the aioli. SO GOOD. Also comes with diced tomato and arugula. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder  ($13)-  Fork-tender, but the generously marbled hunk of hog affected the taste, overall.  Comforting to some, but I felt it was a bit overwhelming and something I didn't care to taste more than twice.  My party all agreed.Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($14)-  Probably the juiciest and most flavorful chicken I've had in recent memory.  Not only does it look appealing in its plumpness, the color, presentation and even crispiness deserves applause.  The tzatziki sauce is aromatic in smell and flavor, amplifying the enjoyability of this dish.  You can choose to order fries, instead of potatoes and they give an ample amount when you do so.Roasted Bone Marrow with Hern Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt ($13)- I'm a lover of roasted bone marrow, but didn't enjoy Purple Pig's for a couple of reasons. 1) It doesn't look appealing to eat.  The gelatinous material wasn't roasted/baked long enough so the marrow wasn't caramelized well, making it gray in color.  2) Wasn't bold and flavorful as I hoped.  In short, Bestia and Animal in LA do the best job of this dish.  Pig's Ear  ($10)- An absolute standout of the evening. These fried salty pig ears are something I wish I could eat while watching football and drinking a sweet beer, all day!  Highly addictive, they're sliced thinly and placed on a bed of crispy kale, tangy cherry peppers, and covered with an egg. I was reluctant to share this one.  Turkey Leg Confit ($17)- Impressive in size, this turkey leg was packed with striking taste. Served with crispy lentils, cabbage, and a sweet/sour agrodolce.----Conclusion: The Purple Pig serves daring, delicious food that is meant to be shared.  One taste and you might revert to your selfish, animalistic self though.  With their creative, reasonably-priced menu, it's my favorite restaurant within the Magnificent Mile; A step better than the Girl & the Goat, in my opinion.  Extra Notes:-Accepts credit card-No reservations can be made-Impeccable service-Loud, fun environment -Beautiful modern decor, with wooden floors/tables. -Poor lighting when dining for dinner, hence no pictures-Clean restrooms"
"Finally I made it! No waiting time at 3pm on Saturday but still a lot of people! Ordered the popular dishes that people in yelp recommend: bone marrow, pig' ear and stuffs squids. All were good but I wish the pig's ears were not deep fried.."
"The Purple Pig is a marvelous restaurant and I recommend it all the time.  The food dishes are unique, tasty, flavorful, and fun.  The bone marrow with toast is a great way to start off your dinner. Its juicy, fatty, and delicious.  The wine list is very nice, with extremely affordable prices offering a diverse pairing with the food. The beet salad...WOW!  That's in my, ""Who'd a thunk?"" category!  It's creamy, smooth, unique taste that isn't overpowering. It's blended with a goat cheese and pistachios.  Great blend of flavors that all work well in your mouth.   The chorizo stuffed olives are very nice.  Chorizo is a difficult sausage with which to work because it is so strong.  It can often compete with whatever you're serving or cooking with it.  Here, they managed to pull it together very nicely. I have a rule of thumb, whenever there is fois-gras on the menu, I order it, no questions asked.  Here they did a credible job. It was very good, and if you're a fois-gras lover, you'll definitely like it.  Not the best I've had, but credible.  Their cheese and meat plates are exceptional.  No other restaurant does a better job at this seemingly simple task.  Meats and Cheeses are fresh, and they have a good mix. I like busy restaurants with some noise.  This place is too much.  It is just too compact and too loud.  If you can't eat on the patio, don't go.  You'll just be annoyed, or you'll have to double your dose of Adderall!  I recommend it.  But they better freshen up, it's becoming passé."
"The Purple Pig is a joint I stumbled into while wandering around downtown Chicago. It's very easy to miss and the sign by the sidewalk intrigued me enough to stop in and I'm glad I did. As soon as I entered I was greeted by the friendly staff. I can imagine the place being quite busy since the inside is quite small and intimate, but I was fortunate enough to not have to wait, sat at the bar, got a glass of Rosé and ordered right away. To start, I had the RoastedBoneMarrow spread. I'm already a big fan of bone marrow and I believe I found Mecca at ThePurplePig. The BoneMarrow is thick, dense, flooded with marrow and juices. When you dig into the marrow with your knife it holds up well and keeps its form until you spread it across your toast making it melt like butter. The bone also comes with a bed of cilantro salad with picked onions to top your bread with. It's pretty decadent. Next, I decided to try the PigEar with fried Kale and egg. The pig ear comes in thin, crispy strips, also fried. The amount of fried items in one bowl was bit overwhelming but the pickled peppers definitely helped to displace the fried taste. I don't think I'd order this again, but it was definitely great to try. Finally to wrap things up, I ordered the MeatballSliders to help offset the heaviness of the fried flavors with the heartiness of marinara. The meatballs were very structured yet soft to the cut with a fork. Perfectly cooked, tender not tough. The meatballs paired with the Parmesan, Marinara and Arugula was great combo to finish off my meal. I would definitely come back to ThePurplePig. The ambiance was great, the staff was friendly and most importantly, the food was on-point with lots of other items I'd still like to try."
"What a wonderful place. This is the Piggy version of Girl and the Goat.Everything I tried was excellent.Burrata pugliese with grapes, candied olives, saffron celery root and pink peppercorn syrup - awesome. The pink peppercorn syrup makes this dish.House made gyros and pita bread with pickled celery root and beets - very goodMilk fed suckling pork belly and leg with black eyed peas, cucumbers and pork marrow cream - deliciousPigs ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and a fried egg - excellent. This is now my favorite way to eat pigs ears. Fried with a light coating of something, they were just delicious.Homemade Morcilla (blood) sausage with poached lobster tail, dates and apples - deliciousSicilian iris - ricotta and chocolate chip filled fried brioche - very good, a doughnut with cannelloni filling.Hazelnut Verrine with espresso custard, creme fraiche and chocolate hazelnut syrup - very good"
"Great food. Really busy, long wait. Sat at chefs table and what a spectacular show. Some of the greatest little plates I have ever had. Affordable prices."
"LOVED IT!! The reviews and hype or all true! We stumbled upon this place on a Tuesday night. No wait (as I have heard there are long waits to get in here) and great service. It was somewhat cold when we came but there is a seating arrangement outdoors under a covered tent (I am sure they take this down during the summer) looking towards the river and Michigan Ave. Everything on the menu is wine, swine and cheese. Not the place for the touchy stomach :) We had a lamb curry type dish which was out of this world AMAZING!! The people sitting next to us also ordered it because it just looks soooo GOOD. We also ordered the grilled cheese which was still pretty good but that lamb.... The dishes are made to be shared and they provide a variety of pairings of sauces for some of the dishes.Honestly, this experience was better than all the hype because the atmosphere was still casual, fun and mystifying. The food is a little different and they have amazing choices of wine, swine and cheese :)! TRY IT (just maybe not on a Friday or Saturday night ) !"
"The only reason one could justify coming to Chicago in February, is eating here. Some items on the menu may sound familiar, but I doubt you've met. They do things differently here. Whether it's the fried deviled egg or the confit turkey leg, it's all beautifully balanced with the right amount of acidity and seasoning, so nothing feels ""heavy"". Some of my favorites here: crispy pig ear salad, octopus, turkey leg, brioche ricotta with chocolate and sweet potato / salted caramel ice cream. You must make this place a priority!"
"Yum. Just yum. Probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago because my roommate and I stumbled upon it on our very first day in the city when we were drunkenly exploring after brunch. Feeling like the complete gluttons that we are, we decided to check out Purple Pig and although it's been a year, I remember the decadent dishes as if it were yesterday. Now, this place doesn't need any more reviews, but I have to throw in my 2 cents because I wouldn't feel right if I left this spot out. The bone marrow disappeared before I could get a pic of it. No matter, there are only about 1200 other photos of Purple Pig's marrow on yelp, and for good reason. It's thebomb.com. The pig's tails braised in balsamic with grated egg and parsley is a close second for my favorite dish. You can't go wrong with a cheese plate. Cocktails are a bit expensive and you can find better in the city, but definitely try one. Watching the folks work in the kitchen is pretty fun too. This place is gonna be crowded pretty much any time of day, and they don't take reservations, but the wait is worth it! Just do like my friend and I did, and eat before you go, ha."
"Milk braised pork shoulder - tender and tasty, a safe choice, milky flavor obviously, might be salty for some.Crispy pork ear and kale - fried pork ear with fried kale accompanied with some peppers was better than expected, recommend. 4 starsSicilian money iris shot - ricotta and chocolate filled beignet that took 15 minutes to bake. It was so good I ordered 2. The bar applauded and my night was complete. 5 stars.Interior is fun, swinery with a great view, bar area is nice and cozy"
I love this place. I arrived at 230p on a Friday afternoon. It was pretty packed. Luckily i found a seat at the communal table. Yes there's a communal table where you sit next to other randoms. Super great service here. I ordered the pig ears. This was delicious. It has an egg on top and the chef recommended that we break the egg and mix it over the pig ears. 9/10 on this. It tasted like onion strings! Yum! Loved the idea. We also ordered the squid. Wow this was so delicious. 4 squid pieces (smaller than what I hoped for) but each squid was filled with delicious stuffing. 10/10Come here and give your mouth a happy surprise. Yum yum.
"From the atmosphere, to the service, to the excellent food, to the presentation of said food, this place is great. I only give it 4 stars because it's out of 5, but I'd give it a 9/10. Excellent food, truly skilled with their knowledge of the pig. Their pork tenderloin is to die for as well as the bone marrow and accompanying tapas-like dishes. Service is constant and quick, but not pushy or hovering. Open space with communal tables (always fun), and the overall atmosphere is very pleasant. This place is a definite must for pork and tapas lovers. I'll be back."
"Every tapas place is unique and I tend to find at least a few of my plates to be enjoyable. The Purple Pig lived up to the reviews, but I've had tapas that was just as good and unique in the 'burbs for less. Having said that, however, the location is half the fun + you get solid food delivered by knowledgeable waiters/waitresses!Regardless of the the time of day, I feel like the Purple Pig is always bustling! A very bar-like venue, you'll often have a fair amount of noise and long tables are typically shared with other patrons. I visited with two friends and we ordered about six plates between us.The chicken thigh kababs were our favorite and the prosciutto stuffed squid was...unique, but our meat & cheese platters were the best! Felt like a lot of money for such simple items, but this is where the high quality, unique components reside!Many of my friends visit Chicago and stay near Michigan Avenue, so the Purple Pig is always an option. My desire for a calmer venue, however, usually steers me clear of this location for something like BoHo."
"I've been trying to come to Purple Pig for literally years. In fact, I've tried to dine here on three separate occasions, but the wait was always much too long and inconvenient (1.5-3 hours waiting time--yikes). A friend decided to organize a group of five of us to come here for dinner the Sunday after Saint Patrick's Day parade weekend at 3 PM. There was basically no wait, which we weren't anticipating, so we didn't get there until ~3:45. We were seated immediately after our whole group was present. Service: The service was pretty disappointing overall. We had a total of THREE servers during our whole meal, none of which were attentive. I was annoyed that we were duped into ordering fancy San pellegrino water when our waiter asked if we wanted ""sparkling or tonic water""? I was disappointed to see that inflated price on our bill when it arrived. We were able to order our dishes sporadically, which was great, but we didn't see our servers for huge hunks of time. Food: We weren't famished, so my boyfriend and I ended up splitting three dishes from the appetizer menu. We started with the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. This was my favorite dish! The pistachios added the perfect flavor and crunch to the dish. I was surprised by how big the serving was because the bowl doesn't look huge. Next, we had the Greek cornbread. I was least impressed by this, although it wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything special. $6 seems like too much money for it. Next up was the cauliflower, which was great, but still cannot be compared to the Girl & the Goat cauliflower dish. There weren't very many gherkin pickles, which disappointed my boyfriend a bit. Atmosphere: It was very cramped. The dining space is quite small and I can tell they try to accommodate as many people as possible. They have communal tables, so it's not really an intimate environment. I wouldn't choose to celebrate a special occasion here. A our communal table, there were FOUR separate groups (five of us and three pairs). There weren't any hooks for purses or coats. I had to awkwardly drape my big purse over my chair and people kept bumping into it as they walked by.Overall, I'm only giving three stars because the food tasted good. Most other parts of our dining experience here were more on the side of two stars."
"Wasn't sure what to expect based on some of the reviews, but this place was trending among the staff at our hotel and also very close to where we were staying on our recent trip to Chicago.  They do not take reservations, but you can put your name in and they will text you once the table is ready.  On a recent Friday we put in our names around 6pm for our party of 8 and the table was ready around 830/9pm.  The seating situation is also very unique as it is communal, meaning you will be seated with people that are not in your party at their long tables.  The menu is very eclectic and absent of traditional dishes you'd find at other mainstream restaurants.  We tried the signature pig ear dish and it was mixed reviews amongst our group. The best way to describe it is thin fried strips that resemble pork rinds over a bed of kale and over easy egg that you mix together before eating.  I'm glad I was able to experience the hoopla surrounding this place, but the menu offerings and overall ambiance are just not that appealing to me personally."
"I can see this being trendy and all but I kinda dont believe the hype. I thought the bone marrow was delicious. Bone marrow, salt and salad goes together very well and creates different taste and texture.  The pig ear salad and the pork shoulder didn't wow me. The pork shoulder is a bit saltly and cheesy.  No new interesting twist to the dish. You can barely taste the pig ear in the salad. Kinda wish that the pig ear wasnt fried. . Maybe my expectation is too high.  Definitely get the bone marrow. Maybe try something else on the menu beside the pig ear and shoulder."
"One of the unexpected best restaurant that I got to try in Chitown. I came to Chicago around Memorial Day weekend and on the day of the holiday, not many restaurants were open. Me and my buddy was walking around looking for hot dogs and EVERYWHERE WAS CLOSED! Luckily Purple Pig was open and we got seated right away.Their Motto is CHEESE, WINE, AND SWINE. Sounds like we are a match made in heaven. It's hard to F*CK up on pig but they take it to another level. Their cheese is just sooooo heavenly as well. For example, I was a little hesitant to order their beets with goat cheese because I hate the strong aftertaste of goatcheese but on their dish, there was NONE. It was creamy and a very nice pairing with the pickled beets.We also ordered the Hot dog (Of course) and their squid stuffed with pork and a crepes dish. I dont wanna go into every little detail but dining here really gave me a flair for Chicago's style. Similarities to los angeles eats but they definetly have their own unique style!! If I ever come back to Chitown, this is the one place I will come back to!!"
"Wine and dine with the Purple Pig!  Their tapas are marvelous and I don't think you can go wrong with any one of them!I love the contemporary kitchen vibe dining that this place exudes and definitely dine outside if the weather permits!  It's wonderful with their outdoor patio.Do start with their Pork Smear or other delectable spreads that you find fancy!  The toasted buttery Ricotta with the thick smear of tender pork and swell tomato sauce was homely delicious!I love their Turkey Leg Confit! The crispy lentils, sauteed, smoothly textured treviso radicchio and nicely cooked turkey was meshed well together.  Add the finishing touch with the endive as a topping and the lightly sweet and vinegary sauce, then it is simply a polished entree.  As for their Scallop Spiedini with chickpea aioli, it was grilled perfectly and every bite of it, delighted my taste buds.There is a wait for this place, but the staff were accommodating and timely.  Waiters and waitresses were polite.  They kept refilling our glasses of water when it was barely half empty.I love this place and definitely will be back to try their other signature tapas!"
"I had such a wonderful evening here!  I came alone so I was lucky enough to get a spot at the bar overlooking the cooks. I had so much fun watching them, what a system!  Adam was such an amazingly attentive sever!  He recommended two wines that I LOVED and a fantastic steak. A great experience that absolutely exceeded my expectations!  Thank you!"
"My party of three arrived at about 7:00 PM on a Wednesday. It was packed, which is always a good sign. People are waiting for a reason, right? So, we were told it would be about 45 minutes. Cool. It was actually about 15 minutes and we were seated. The seating arrangement is a little different here than at most places. While they do have individual tables for one party, a lot of the seating is at community tables. I enjoyed it but it does get a little loud. The server was super friendly and explained everything well. So far, Purple Pig is checking off all my boxes. Great location, lively crowd, cool decor, friendly staff (every staff member that walked past us as we waited would at least offer a greeting or a smile, which was excellent), and they even sell Peroni. We're on a roll.Then the food came and everything was brought up a level. The pork fried almonds, calamari, and burrata got us started. Fresh, vibrant, beautiful, and delicious. Hands down, the best calamari I have ever had. The JLT (like a BLT but with pork jowl, frisee and a duck egg) was one of our two ""main"" courses. Outrageous flavor on this bad boy. I really appreciate how they maintained a crispy crostini and ripe tomato while still offering moist protein, and the pork was cooked to perfection. Next, milk braised pork shoulder and mash. I believe this was the most tender piece of pork I've ever eaten. It was perfection. And for dessert, the Iris and panino. Sweet, decadent, fried goodness.Not only will we be coming back, we will be back soon. Thank you, Purple Pig, for a wonderful meal and experience. You've all earned all the love coming your way on this site."
"So this place apparently does not take reservations and they don't need to because it's always busy. Get here early and bring your whole party because they don't seat you until everyone is there and this place is too small and crowded for you to wait for your friends comfortably. You will feel like you're in the way, standing around, and that's because you are. Wine selection is excellent as is the variety of small plates. We loved everything we tried, including the beets, fried cheese, and pork shoulder. But the star of the show was the dessert, which we regretted sharing. It was a chocolate hazelnut coffee custard concoction in a way too small glass. Get two. Service was friendly and helpful when making our menu selections, and the venue is cozy - maybe too cozy. I felt very much squeezed into the table we got and could have easily eaten off the table next to mine."
I liked this place better than Girl and the Goat since I dont like game much. I stopped by to ask about the wait for 6 people around 11:45 and we could have been seated immediately. Then again it was a Monday but I know that when we actually went at 12:15 then the wait was about 45 minutes. They get your number and call you and you have 10 minutes to get there. They legit tell you the exact time to the minute we had to be there but when we all arrived there was a line with the hostess so they arent that cray about it. We got outdoor seating which was nice since it seemed so New York esque. We split all of these with 6 people and it was a good amount. 1) Cornbread- This was yummy and soft. I would get it. 2) Broccoli- Basic but needed the greens.3) Squid- THIS WAS DELICIOUS. I couldnt believe it. The sauce was delicious and I saved it for other stuff but the squid was so flavorful and tender. I wish we had more. 4) Foie Gras- I am not really a fan of this kind of stuff but my friends enjoyed it.5) Pork Neck Bone Gravy Smear- This pretty much tasted like it would be in pasta ragu. It was good but it was nothing special so I wouldnt get it again. 6) Octopus- Pretty good but squid is better. 7) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder- This was smaller than I thought. It is a piece of meat that is tender and thrown in buttery mashed potatoes. I didnt think it was necessary8) Bone Marrow- I am not a fan of this in general but my friends LOVEEE this. 9) Lemon Panna Cotta- This was ok but I wouldnt get it again. 10) Sicilian Iris- Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche- everyone gets this dessert and it is like a donut filled with chocolate and other sauces. It is good to have a bite or so.
"I want to give Purple Pig four stars but I'm personally going to have to knock it down to three because the pig ears dish was just way too salty. It's almost as if they dumped the entire salt shaker into just one bowl and mixed in the rest of the ingredients like a salad. It was way too salty for me to eat and I ended up having to give it to my boyfriend to help me finish the majority of it. However, the bone marrow smear is definitely worth getting! Juicy and delectable, it's a great dish to order to expand your taste buds. A funny side note the table sitting next to us also ended up ordering this after seeing us eat it, and the man told the waiter that he was extremely disappointed in the portions. I don't think the portions were small but the poor waiter felt so bad that he got the chef to give him a ""bigger marrow"" to make up for it. So he basically got two dishes of bone marrow smear. Lucky guy. We didn't have a problem with the wait but there was definitely a line by 11:20AM on a Wednesday."
"For years my friends and I have contemplated going to the Purple Pig for dinner but were always discouraged by whole no reservations thing. This past Saturday was finally the day we were gonna execute our master plan: get to the city early enough, put our name down, then drink at a bar until we're pleasantly surprised with the call. It was Saturday dinner and we were prepared to wait 2-3 hours. By some crazy stroke of luck, we got the call after just 30 min. Ambiance: This place seemed to be foodie central. You would see random flashes of light from different parts of the room as people would be taking pictures of each dish that came out. Inside the restaurant it was super packed. We sat at one of the communal tables near the front and were pretty shoulder to shoulder with the parties next to us.   Food: The menu was tapas style and they suggested about 2 plates per person. Since we had a group of 5, we were able to order a ton of dishes and get a little taste of each.Pig ears w/ crispy kale - This dish was pretty simple: kale mixed with little strips of fried pig ears, topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg. The pig ears were super crunchy and the texture sort've reminded me of crispy onion strings. This one was just average for me though. All the individual components tasted good, but I didn't think they really married together to create something special.Turkey neck rillette smear - We honestly only ordered this because one of our friends only eats poultry and this was one of the few options he had...but DAMN this was surprisingly one of my favorite plates of the night. The texture was somewhere between pulled pork and pate spread, and the flavor was salty but still with a turkey taste. It also came with thick slices of fluffy bread and some sort of cranberry jam.   Wagyu sirloin - The meat was super tender and juicy and was a perfectly cooked medium rare. The beans kind of seemed out place with the steak and I would've preferred maybe a potato side instead. Not the most unique dish, but still very delicious.Pork belly rillons - According to our server this was one of the more popular items. It was basically a plate of only 5 cubes of fatty pork covered in this thick, sweet glaze. They had a slightly crisp outside with a super fatty center that just melted in your mouth. The glaze kind of gave it that candied bacon vibe. I loved this dish, but I wish it wasn't so small. I needed more!Chicken thigh kebabs - These were skewers of juicy pieces of chicken served over a mix of fried potatoes and some creamy tzatziki sauce. The best part was they left the skin on the chicken so it had a nice crispy outside. Roasted bone marrow - Barely a year ago I was a bone marrow rookie who's never tasted it before. Now it's pretty tough to pass it up when I see it on the menu. This was seriously a deep ass bone, and the marrow was everything I expected: slimy, rich, and flavorful. The salad it came with was a nice little touch. JLT - It was basically an open faced BLT sandwich with layers of pork jowl, tomato, and frisee, topped with a fried egg. The meat was insanely tender for how lean it was. The frisee was dressed with a great pesto aioli that gave it a caesar salad type taste. Overall a very solid dish.  Milk braised pork shoulder - At first glance it just looked like mound of comfort food: pork with mashed potatoes and gravy. This takes the prize for most tender meat consumed all night. All you had to do was lift the meat in the air, and gravity itself would break it up into pieces for you. Pork neck bone gravy - This honestly just tasted like regular marinara sauce mixed with some cheese. I actually combined this with some of the milk braised pork shoulder. As a standalone dish I thought it was pretty weak, but it turned out to be a great condiment to complement other dishes. Milk fed suckling pork belly - To me this dish felt like 3 different meats in one. You had super fatty pieces of pork belly, then an in between texture that looked like a piece of neck or something, then finally a more lean cut of meat. It was covered in a peppery, creamy sauce that reminded me of country gravy. Pork ossobuco - This was a massive veal shank. It was so tender that you can literally just pull the bones out clean. The polenta was nice and creamy, but the meat to polenta ratio was way off. I could've used a ton more polenta to pair with each bite of meat. Great dish for big eaters that want a ton of meat.Dessert:Sicilian Iris - It's a huge fried ball of dough filled with chocolate and creamy cheese. Don't question it, just get it.Hazelnut Verrine - It was like a parfait with different layers of cream and chocolate. The bottom layer is a thick custard that had a great espresso flavor.Overall, Purple Pig lived up to the hype in my head, and it was an awesome dinner experience. I ate pork in way more varieties than I could have ever thought of within a single meal. I would definitely come back."
"With over 3k of reviews I'm not sure what else I can add. However all I can say is that I greatly enjoyed my meal here. It helps that I lucked out and my tiny party of 2 was seated immediately with no wait. Granted I came for a weekday lunch, but the restaurant was constantly packed. Plus when I called the day before about wait times, I was told the wait would be at least 45 mins. Winning.The experienced staff had great menu suggestions. Highlighting what was popular and what would best suit our tastes. If you want to be indulgent, the bone marrow and confit turkey leg will fit the bill. My only minor complaint is the menu can be protein heavy. It'd be hard to eat light here but then again just go somewhere else if you want your kale salad not fried."
"This is one of my absolute favorite places in Chicago! And judging by how packed this place usually is, it's a lot of people's favorite as well. I would recommend coming here at off-peak hours on the weekends (grab a late lunch at 3 PM, or grab a late dinner at 10) or during the week if you don't want to wait for an hour or more. However, since it's right on the mag mile you can wander around while you wait, as they'll just give you a call when your table's ready. The seating is mostly communal although there are a few private tables, and I'd recommend giving the communal seating a chance if you're normally not a fan. It's roomy enough to be comfortable, and it's quiet enough so you don't have to yell at your friend sitting a few inches away from you. The ambiance is very fun and lively, but not overwhelmingly so.  The food comes out on an as-ready basis, and is always fresh and flavorful. My favorite antipasti is the olive oil poached tuna, which comes with poached quail egg, blue potatoes and really yummy roasted veggies. Their menu does change, but this has been a staple every time I've been. The charred cauliflower is also always on the menu, and is spectacular. The dish comes with little cornichons that compliment the smoky flavors. I would definitely recommend trying a couple of cheeses and cured meats (the duck prosciutto is awesome), if you're confused about what the cheeses are you can ask your server or check a lamp, which has a glossary attached. The Purple Pig always has an impressive selection, and I've never been disappointed with the charcuterie I 've ordered there.My only issue is that the entrees can have way, way too much salt. To the point that it's almost unpleasant to eat. I am admittedly exceptionally sensitive to salt, but honestly this seems to depend on the chef seasoning it and there's no way to tell in advance. However, the times where the dishes have been salted to my tastes, they have been exceptional. If it's still there when you go, try the wagyu sirloin dish or their octopus if you're not feeling steak that day. The steak is cooked to total perfection and is just a stellar cut of meat (and a generous portion too!), and while the octopus may be a little tough from grilling it is still extremely tasty. What I love about the octopus dish is that what it comes with (fingerling potatoes, green beans) are also incredibly flavorful, you won't leave anything behind on this plate!All in all, the Purple Pig is a place I would recommend to anyone in the Chicago area. It's in a great location, has fantastic food, great service and is guaranteed to be a good time."
"With a name like Purple Pig you know the meats are gonna be good here but honestly, what I walked away craving were the veggie dishes. Come to think of it, I don't think my friend and I got anything meat based the whole time we were there and I wasn't sad about it. I didn't even realize it until just now! What we tried: salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette (oh good God, these were fantastic), chorizo stuffed olives (maybe the only ""meat"" we had. Good but I'm not super big on olives. If you like them you'll likely love this plate), a tuna salad which was more like an antipasti salad (olive oil tossed hunks of tuna with chunks of marinated veggies and quail eggs), salt cured greek yogurt with various accompanying spreads, and a delicious fried cheese (the kind I cannot remember but trust me--it was good). For dessert? We split the lemon panna cotta and the Sicilian Iris (ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche--DANG). No regrets!Everything was amazing. I'm admittedly very into meat and I didn't miss it one bit. Vegetarians and pescatarians--do not be afraid! Join your friends at dine here. Oh! And because we got mostly the veg options our bill wasn't terribly high. Another bonus! A few other things of note: 1. The place is small. And even on a Monday night it was packed. No reservations so be prepared. Also maybe not the best place for catch up conversation with friends. Which leads me to #2....2. The servers are very prompt. Maybe almost too prompt. My friend and I hadn't seen in each other in a while and we were catching up while eating. Apparently we weren't scarfing fast enough for the server/bussers who were at our table every few minutes asking if we were finished with our dishes. NOPE. STILL WORKING ON IT. GIVE IT A REST. I mean, it's nice and I appreciate the attentiveness to a degree but this was bananas. It crossed the line from helpful to ""We want you to GTFO."" Towards the end my friend and I looked at each other and shared a look that read, ""I will destroy them if they ask me if I'm done with this bread one more time."" I want to take my time, y'all! However, that isn't enough to keep me from returning in the future. The lure of those beets ensures that."
My favorites were the deep fried manchego cheese and the deep fried pigs ears. Everything is good! JONASAPPROVED!
"This place is popular! Located on the Magnificent Mile, it's convenient for locals and tourists. I wanted to grab a quick pre-dinner bite here since my planned dinner wasn't til 9:30pm. Got here around 5:30 and the place was literally packed out the door! Luckily I was dining solo, so I was able to grab a seat at their communal bar table inside! For those in a group, you better make a reservation before heading over or else its going to be a long wait! I ordered the foie gras terrine which was decent. The flavors were nice and the toast was crunchy. Only thing is that the terrine wasn't as smooth as it could have been. Wasn't really able to spread the terrine on the toast but more like cutting a chunk off and hope that your hands are steady enough to not have the foie gras fall off the toast before it reaches your mouth. I also ordered the milk braised pork shoulder. The pork was tender and sat on top of a small bed of mashed potatoes. Since there was all this gravy lathered on the pork, I wished they gave me more mashed potatoes. The dish was a bit on the salty side with all the gravy and not enough potatoes. The place is busy so service was pretty good considering it was such a packed house. So enjoy the food and drinks and good company. I got to meet an interesting couple visiting from Florida while enjoying my meal!"
Love the food and a very fun vibe. Expect big crowds b/c it is popular. The Shmears are great and their wine list is unique. Actually can't say I've had a bad meal there yet. Time the crowd right and it is all good...
"Another one of Chicago's must eat at spots, with almost 3000 reviews, the The Purple Pig does deliver great must have food.  When this place gets packed, it's really hard to get a seat, and your best bet is to wait for a spot to open up at the bar.  On cold days, be weary of the seats at the bar next to the door as it get's really cold everytime the door opens and closes.  The wait is worth it once you finally get to sit down and try out all the food everyone's raving about.  Started off with the Crispy pig's ears with an egg on top.  This one was a favorite and was a great appetizer.  Was like eating breakfast for dinner with the egg and bacon'y flavor of the pig ears..Next, tried the HUGE portion of bone marrow.  Usually, this stuff is scarce, but at The Purple Pig, you get so much of it that you will probably get tired of it if just sharing between two people.  You definitely get your money's worth with this portion.Lastly, had the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  By the time this came out, we were already full.  Was really good, and the portion is not too intimidating.  Must go to spot for any local or tourist."
Fantastic. Truly one of the best in Chicago. Too bad is so small and is always crowded. You will have to wait a while before you are seated. They do not take reservations.
The only place I can think of off the top of my head that's worth the wait downtown!
"We came here on a Sunday night and was quoted a 45 minute wait but we only waited 30 so that was nice! If you come on a Sunday, shops nearby close pretty early though. We liked the communal seating, but the tables and walls are so close together that it seemed difficult for staff to move around. So..intimate, yes, but could become an awkward arrangement when food is being served and plates bussed. Foodwise, I would give a solid 4 stars. We ordered chorizo stuffed olives, grilled leeks, pigs ear, roasted bone marrow, prosciutto stuffed squid, and an affogato. The chorizo stuffed olives and sauce of the prosciutto stuffed squid had similar flavors and given the chance, I wouldn't order them together again. The squid was tender and its stuffing savory and interesting, definitely my favorite. Grilled leeks were unexpectedly served cold, but I would recommend! Pigs ear was tasty, but I love my salty foods. Someone with milder preferences would probably think it was too much. Also, neither of us could distinguish the taste of pigs ear from the crunchy kale. I think it would have benefitted from another fried egg on top to balance out the saltiness. Lastly, the bone marrow! The bone itself was huge and had more than enough marrow for the slices of bread. The quantity of food that we ordered was perfect (if not a little too much) for 2 people, with this plate making up the bulk of the meal. However, the bread was so disappointing :( I'm hoping we just got unlucky but our bread was very fried. Not toasted, but fried and oily, which didnt pair well with the richness of the bone marrow. The addition of the salad helped undercut the richness a little bit, but the acidic flavor of the salad and the heaviness of the bread completely drowned out the bone marrow. Overall, we had an enjoyable experience. If you are in the area, it's worth a visit!"
"Truly a best of Chicago experience! It's a must if you want to experience a culinary adventure!We were told by locals there would be a long wait if we didn't have a reservation. Sure enough, we got there to find a 2 hour wait list. The group of 3 left, furious. We opted to leave our number and continue shopping. They ended up calling us 45 min later which became problematic since we were a distance away.  They kept calling to make sure we were still coming, which didn't bode well with us.Once we got there, our server was great. He did make us believe the portions were large but we didn't think so. However, the quantity left us satisfied.We asked for the signature dishes and they pretty much listed everything on the menu which wasn't helpful.  But then again, everything we ordered from the recommended list was absolutely delicious.We got the bone marrow, pigs ear kale salad, meat platter and the half duck for the table of 2. Normally, we would never make this dish or order it. But since we felt adventurous and daring, we gave it a try. We were blown away. So aside from the bad first impression and exaggerated seating time by the hostesses, kudos to the chefs for keeping dishes unique and decadent!"
"Leaving this review in hopes that a nice couple who I met at dinner last night will read this. I was having dinner with a friend and struck up a conversation w/a couple from Virginia (? or WV?) who were in town because the gentleman had to come for a board recertification test. Anyway, we didn't get their names and don't know enough to find them. In case they get to read this--we would like to thank you SO MUCH for covering our dinner. It was a complete surprise, such a sweet gesture, and made our entire week!! Best of luck with everything and thanks again :)All of the food was also absolutely delicious!"
"Excellent and delicious. I sat at the bar on my own.Staff is knowledgable, and generally friendly, but smiles little and had a ""gotta do my work"" aroma. I feel like when I sit on my own at a bar the bartenders/backs are usually a bit more outgoing. Regardless everything was amazing and no one was rude by any means. I highly recommend the purple pig."
"Traveling during the winter time can be tough! but when you have good food? it just gets better! Party of 8 please-recommended by tons of friends that it is a must that we come to Purple Pig to eat. Service was impeccable, I do believe everyone should be treated with 1st class all the way. The restaurant itself is spacious but tight, either way it was memorable and they make it work.EATS: TAPAS STYLEFried Manchego Cheese w/membrillo-melts in your mouthPig's Ear with Cripsy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers, and Fried egg- great flavorsCharred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley-Different but deliciousShaved Brussels Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano-Perfect to the biteCalamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios-I wanted secondsCastelfranco, Sunchokes, Hazelnuts, Apple Cider Vinaigrette-FRESHFried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes-DelightfulPork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta-SucculentFoie Gras & Membrillo-SecondsMeatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula-I didn't care for thisMussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraîche & Marjoram-This was amazingMilk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes-Dense and braised right!Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli-very small portions/but I loved itWagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette-2 ordersNo dessert unfortunately we were all too full but a happy customer!!!!"
"Bookmarked this place for my recent Chicago trip, and would recommend anyone taking a week vaca there to go here at least 1 time.  It is a very convenient location if you are in the Magnificent Mile area, but can be missed easily. The wait staff and hostess were really nice, but definitely overwhelmed.All the food I had was phenomenal.  It is essentially a tapas menu, but the portion sizes are pretty decent.  My dining partner and I got 5 plates to share, but 4 would have definitely been enough.  We went big since we knew we may never come back here.  I cannot remember all of our dishes but the ones I do remember are the razor clams, bone marrow, and meatballs.  All very good with solid flavoring and consistency.  The bone marrow was almost like melted butter and spread on the bread really well.  The bill was big but we expected it, especially because we got a few alcoholic beverages also.  This place does NOT do reservations, so expect at least and hour and a half wait, even on none weekend nights.  They know they will fill the seats so that is why they don't take them.  We went into it planning on waiting that long, but we lucked out BIG TIME.  It was a very rainy Thursday night, and they had their outside seating covered.  Since those seats were less desirable, they gave us the option of waiting or siting right away.  We had no problem siting out there, especially because it would have been way too hot to sit inside their small inside area.  Don't let them trick you into buying sparkling water.  When they ask they only say bottle or sparkling, but they have tap trust me."
"Great place. Overall soul taste, strongly recommend turkey leg. It's huge and good for two people."
"Recently went back for the second time and it was as great as the first.  Had to get the bone marrow smear again and it was delicious.  Also got the roasted beets with goat cheese, had some doubts at first since I'm not a huge fan of beets, but we were pleasantly surprised!  Our third dish was roasted rabbit and that was delicious as well.  Rabbit is easily overcooked, but this was roasted to perfection and tender.I've heard all about the wait times here and have seen the line extend to Michigan Ave to get in before, but we went at 5:30 PM on a Thursday and the wait was only 20 minutes.  A waiter came out to take our drink order while we waited outside.  They called within the estimated time and we had a table ready for us.  Seating is community style with up to 8 at large tables so you'll be in close quarters with other parties.  Since we were a party of 2, we had our own table, but tables are still very close together in this small space.  Conversations with other parties are highly encouraged!  Especially checking out what others ordered (the braised pork shoulder looked good as well, next time!).An antipasti, two main plates, and two glasses of wine ran us in the $70s for a subtotal.  Great atmosphere, great food, and great service.  Definitely making more trips back!"
"If you can get a table at this super popular restaurant, it's worth it! My friends and I tried to come Saturday night, but were told the wait was two and half hours(!!!). This restaurant does not take reservations. We ended up going somewhere else but came back for Brunch on Sunday because this place came highly recommended. I ordered the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes in tzatziki sauce...it was absolutely delicious! However, one negative is that because this joint was so crowded, we were sat at a large table and shared the other side with another party...it was a little hard to move around because we were squeezed a bit tight. Overall, a great rating for the food."
My son treated me to the purple pig because he saw it advertised on Check Please.  He was totally disappointed.  I actually had a great time just enjoying the ambiance and the sweet bus boy.  The food had all the same flavors too much vinegar and everything had capers and parley.  Non of the food was unique.  It was like coming from an assembly line all in unison.  The restaurant is way over crowded with EXTRA worker and old looking  security guard.   The restaurant has not enough room to move around plus the rest rooms are unisex.  And you need to make a line just to get in to wash your hands.  The food can use LESS salt and less Vinegar!!!!!! my turkey leg was way too over done.  I feel bad because my son spent way too much money and the room is way too loud is not a disco
"One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Went in w/ some friends on a Thursday around 7 PM and was quoted a wait time of 2 hours. I left my phone number with the hostess and headed on over to Three Dots and a Dash to grab a drink and pass the time. I received a call around the 2 hour mark and was told that the party that was at our table was getting ready to pay and that they should be done in 15 minutes and that we should head on over. Major props for calling us and giving us a 15 minute heads up on when to come back, rather than calling us as the party is leaving - this is such a simple yet efficient technique that I wish more restaurants would employ!You know how when you go to a restaurant, there are a few dishes you could have done without? Well my friends and I loved every dish we ordered - Purple Pig is that good! Here's what we got:-Fried pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, & fried egg: if I could imagine what heaven in a dish tasted like, this would be it. Everything is fried to perfection, and not overly salty or greasy. A definite must-get if you go here.-Fried brussels sprouts with thyme, lemon, & chili flakes: these too were fried to perfection. A perfect amount of lemon and some chili for a small amount of heat.-Roasted bone marrow with herb salad & sicilian sea salt: the bone marrow servings here are huge (I'm definitely not complaining!). One of the better bone marrows I've had. I'm pretty sure one of my friends attacked me with her knife as I was going back for 2nds - yes, the bone marrow is so good that it makes friends fight each other over it.-Wagyu eye round cooked for 30 hrs, salt cured foie gras & sauce foyot: smooth and flavorful-Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: tender and delicious-Milk fed suckling pork belly & leg with black eyed peas, cucumbers & pork marrow crema: the pork was extremely juicy and flavorful. It had the perfect amount of saltiness and was balanced beautifully with the peas, cucumbers, and sauce.I have had dreams of The Purple Pig since dining there (seriously). The only thing I don't like is the fact that they don't take reservations, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. A must try spot!"
Phenomenal. I can not even put this experience into words. Favorites: Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy VinaigretteChorizo Stuffed OlivesMeatball Slider with Parmesan & ArugulaGoat cheese with strawberry rhubarb spreadAll of the desserts were amazing! Nutella crepes were my favorite! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself! Call ahead this place books up quick!! So worth it!
"2 years have gone by since my last review and I still adore the Purple Pig. I always, always bring people here (most recently family and they loved it too). There doesn't seem to be any bad plates and in fact each plate seems better than the last. By now, I've had a good majority of items on the menu so I can truly say that it's totally worth your dollars to stop by.A couple of other top plates in addition to my favorite roasted bone marrow and the milk braised pork shoulder are the pig's ears with crispy kale - to die for!! and weirdly enough, the Proschetta panini - a weird selection when you have so many other choices but this is one of the best paninis I've ever had and honestly does not cost much more than regular paninis you can get at cafes. It's huge too!"
"Disappointed. Wait staff indifferent- maybe they were ready to leave- heard it was poker night. Food not nearly as good as I expected. Tried fried olives, pig ears and marrow smear. No need to return."
"Loved this place! Incredible tapas and great service. We were notified of the potential 1.5hour wait and gave them our cell phone number. We were notified in less than an hour that group's spot for 5 was ready. Loved sitting outside of the actual restaurant in the ""outdoors area"" -- enclosed expansion of the restaurant that was perfectly heated on a winter night and actually more comfortable and less noisy than inside the restaurant. Favorite dishes include the roasted beets with goat cheese ( sooo refreshing and delicious even for the non-beet lovers in our group), foie was super tasting, pork brain was fun and interesting plus delicious and most of all the fried pig ear -- that is a must and I wish we had ordered more of it.All the dishes were hits though. Waygu, pork tenderloin, and pork shoulder were moist and well-prepared as well. It was my third time trying bone marrow and I don't think it's something up my alley though the other peeps in my group loved it.Such a perfect meal and evening here with friendly and attentive service. Love this place."
"Bone Marrow always makes me love a venue.  I mean... I'm such a sucker for it.  :)Classic gastropub with a tonne of attitude, well reviewed, and appropriately so, bravo!I'll save my verbiage for another establishment less well regaled!"
See Taste Love wants you to check out this place great tapas & wine!!! THIS IS A Must experience!
"This place is so amazing. We had lunch here on a Saturday and loved it. Didn't have reservations but came around 12:30 and waited 30 minutes to be seated at a communal style table outside. We ordered a bunch of things but my favorite was the pig ear and kale ""salad"" (it's fried...so salad might not be the best word to describe it). The chicken thighs were also amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."
"Delicious tapas and the BEST sangria I've ever had!!! Gets a little crowded, but even with a packed house, we got seated right away. If you like super energetic and lively places, you'll love the Purple Pig!"
"Hidden Jem!My wife found this place after reading a couple of reviews when we were in Chicago for the weekend and we decided to give it a try...Food - ExcellentAtmosphere - ExcellentWine- ExcellentI go back every time there, it's alway jam packed. The food is so diverse, so If you fancy something different and fun. This is your place."
"A very unique menu, a robust wine list, good service, and good food.  However, I came here with 2 others for Sunday brunch and seating was an issue.  If you're lucky, your party will be seated at a long table, German-style, with strangers.  That's fine for the biergarten, but a little annoying at Sunday brunch.  If you're not lucky, your party will be split up, so you can all sit separately with the aforementioned strangers.  My party was between the two brands of luck; three adjacent spots opened up inside.  We would've preferred to sit outside, but food and comradeship were the main objectives.  Lack of planning on our part?  Not this time.  TPP doesn't take reservations."
"If you're looking for mass confusion and awkwardness, by all means go eat here. All the others reviewers are drinking the kool aid or something because from reading them and there being SO many good ones, I was anticipating the best meal of my life.First of all, I called ahead of time to see if they took reservations (they don't-- so stupid.) The hostess told me to come put my name in and then go back to my hotel to get ready, so that's exactly what I did. When I went to put my name in, it was crawling with people and the hostess told me it would be 2 hours, maybe even 2 and a half. Well, not even 45 minutes later they are calling me saying the table was ready and I had 15 minutes to get there. Umm??? I told them my situation and they couldn't even accommodate after I had only been following their own advice from the get go. Once there, we were seated communal seating style which for the rush that was put on us getting there was just unacceptable. The server was nice but it was just complete mass confusion ordering. They have their house made vodka- very limited options. The chorizo stuffed olives were gross. The portions are pretty tiny and everyone in my party was still hungry when we left. I ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes that was very delicious. The pork was nice and tender but the mashed potatoes were about a tablespoon or two and watery. On top of that, ALL of our entrees came out at different times and by the time mine and another friends arrived, everyone else had already finished. Just so wrong. I would NOT go back based on the sole fact that everything leading up to actually eating was such a hassle. Good luck going to the  bathroom at this place when you are eating, as well. It was the complete opposite a relaxing dinner Overcrowded and overrated."
"What an incredible place! For so many reasons. I went by myself on a business trip and they really made me feel at home. After a shaky start with me getting lost multiple times on the way there and a pretty crazy wait for one person on a Wednesday night, they first pulled me back in by getting me an excellent $13 glass of wine. Folks, this is officially what I spend on a bottle at most, so this was really going out there for me. But the recommendation was great! Got seated and they took my order right away. First, fried brussel sprouts. Oh my goodness. Never have I thought about frying each individual leaf, but all of them were full of tasty goodness. Next, the octopus. WOW. I've never had such tender octopus in my life and it was deliciously seasoned as well. Lastly, the bone marrow. My waitress let me in on a secret, that I was allowed to order a half order since I was there by myself so I could try more things. Thank goodness she told me!! It's HUGE. And that was the half size!! But oh man, the melt in your mouth goodness. The herb salad added so perfectly. The only faint qualm I had was that the crust on the bread for the marrow was a bit toooo crusty, kind of made it hard to eat. But. Nonetheless. AMAZING.And I haven't even mentioned the service yet! They were super prompt with everything, remembered my name through the whole meal, and my water cup was never even halfway empty by the time they filled it up again. Also, they minimized as much as possible the awkwardness of eating by yourself. Major major props for that.Truly a five star experience, even with the wait."
"Come early if you want to snatch a table, this place is packed! The first time we came to the Purple Pig, we didn't get to eat because the wait was too long so we ended up going to a different place. The next day, we showed up for lunch right when they opened and just 20-30 mins later the whole restaurant was filled up.There's a reason why this place is always crowded; the food is delicious and explosive in all kinds of flavor! Despite the fact that they had a lot of customers to serve, our food came out pretty fast, which is a huge plus because I hate waiting for food. Servers were very friendly and nice. Prices were reasonable for the quality of food. I highly recommend this place."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!!There's a wait because they don't take reservations. We put in our name and number around 5:30pm on a Saturday. They finally called us at 7:30pm (2 hour wait). Worth it!!!! But I'm pretty sure if you just come earlier you can get seated earlier. It's right on the magnificent mile so you can walk around and shop while you're waiting. This area gets pretty packed on Saturdays so I think more restaurants have a wait. I've noticed chicago isn't really big on taking reservations. We got the following : (it's Tapas style so everyone shares)Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- I LOVE BONE MARROW and this was fantastic! There was three of us and they gave us two large sliced bone marrow- plenty to go around. It comes with this toasted flavorful bread (you can ask for more). Get a slice of the bread, smear some bone marrow, sprinkle some of the parsley, and add a pinch of salt. HEAVENLY!!!!!!! Purple Pig Platter (~29)- A charcuterie board with different selected cured meats! The platter was quite large, if you love cured meats with wine, get this!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! Small portion - just enough for 3-4 big bites. The last thing we got was the rabbit (it was a special). It was just a small piece and we divided it in three pieces so we each got one. REALLY MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. I've never had rabbit before but this was absolutely AMAZING!!!!I like that I wasn't too full from eating and that I got to try different things (it was around 30 a person). If I'm ever back in chicago I'd def come back and try the other dishes. It's super nice decor inside but not pretentious at all. Cozy place! When I was walking out I overheard the other table saying how much they loved this place as well.Service was great! They kept refilling my water anytime it was like almost half empty. Thought that was nice of them."
"Purple pig was amazing! We had the turkey leg, squid, Manchego cheese and pigs ear kale salad. Everything was so flavorful! We got the Sicilian iris for dessert even though we were pretty satisfied from dinner. All I can say is wow. It was so wonderful, definitely a must when you visit! The staff was super friendly and extremely attentive! We will definitely return next visit to Chicago!"
"Mediterranean tapas style food overlooking parts of downtown Chicago.Met a couple of friends at this interesting dining spot, and we sat in the (enclosed) outdoor patio area.  We shared a number of plates around the table.  All of the dishes were presented beautifully, but some lacked the flavors I was hoping for.  Here is a rundown:* Charred cauliflower - great start to our meal, pungent and aromatic with a slight tang to them (unfortunately it was the best dish of the meal)* Burrata Pugliese - very creamy and smooth flavor, paired very well with the micro greens served on the side* Roasted bone marrow - so many people seemed to go ga-ga over this dish, I found it to be lacking in flavor and overly greasy tasting* Chicken thigh kebabs - nice grilled char taste to them, accompanied by a creamy tzatziki sauce* Rabbit roulade - nice flavor, slightly underdone (to my taste)Overall ,this is a great spot for large groups who enjoy eating ""community style"" by sharing a bunch of dishes...will give you a great sampling of all they have to offer."
"The service was excellent. Very attentive and helped me decide what to order. I had the foie gras, which which was a little on the salty side due to the bacon bits. Overall, it had a nice flavor profile especially with the added in pomegranates.I also had the pigs you're with crispy kale. My only piece of advice would be to sub the fried egg for a poached egg. The server suggested to crack open the egg yolk and mix in with the rest of the ingredients. The poached egg would add more creamy texture of the egg whites and the yolk. The last course I had was the Sicilian Italy. It was a fun dessert and incredibly delicious."
"Great food, great service, great location. My friend and I went here and ordered the pig ear and kale dish, octopus and green beans as well as the bone marrow salad. This, on top of an entire bottle of wine (excellent selection, by the way), was perfect for sharing between two people. The communal tables outside, where we sat, are a great concept and encourages the true tapas style of ""sharing"" all while getting to meet new people! I'll definitely be back - there are so many other dishes I want to try."
"The Purple Pig is notorious for long wait times because sadly, they do not take reservations. We were quoted a 2-hour wait so we decided to walk the Magnificent Mile. After 45 minutes, we received a phone call that a table was waiting for us at the Purple Pig. Whoopie! :-)This is not a place for those that: 1) do not like to share seating space or 2) are claustrophobic. There are small tables surrounding the walls of the restaurant, two bars (one at the bar and the other at the kitchen) and a few long family style tables in the center. We squeezed into a family style table with a family of 4 and three other couples, so 12 people total. To our luck, the dad sitting next to us was very friendly and offered us some Salt and Vinegar Beef Tendon Chips as we waited. These were crispy and vinegary pork rinds, not really salty.They were a-okay!Our server was quick and to the point, which I liked but it also made me feel rushed to order. Overall, I wouldn't expect 5-star service at the Purple Pig but given the popularity factor, I understand the need to rush. To their defense, it helped because we didn't wait an absurd amount of time for our food. After reading other reviews, I made sure to scrutinize our check at the end of our meal. We were mistakenly charged for a Moscow Mule that I did not receive. Back story: I had in fact ordered one but they did not have ginger beer at the bar. I guess they didn't take it off the check. In any case, if the food wasn't as HEAVENLY as it was, I'm not sure that I would have been able to overlook the lack of attention to detail, impersonal service and stuffy accommodations.Now on to the food:Fried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon and Chili Flakes:  Crispy and lemony, this dish was simply seasoned enough to enjoy the strong Brussels sprout flavor yet still make an impact on your taste buds. Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta:  Rich and savory, this smear delivered in every way. Slow cooked pork in a tomato sauce with a lump of ricotta dumped in the center. Paired with toasted bread, this was my favorite item on the menu. A must have!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder:  Tender to the last drop and melt-in-your-mouth good. I would have liked a bit more mashed potatoes but really, it didn't matter because the pork shoulder was so delicious.Bombolones:  Raspberry and apricot preserve filled sugar doughnuts. These were yummy and light. A good end to a wonderful meal. However, I secretly wish we would have ordered the Sicilian Iris. Maybe next time!"
"ok, the long waits can now be justified...i've attempted to eat at purple pig 5 times and the 6th time was a charm.based on my last attempt (and the glass of wine i had at the bar), i would've only given this place half a star. my party of 6 was promised to be seated as soon as guest #6 arrived and when that happened 7 minutes later, we never got seated. in the meantime, we witnessed several other tables being seated including other 6 tops that arrived AFTER us. the host wasn't apologetic and didn't seem to care...so we left.hoping that that was a fluke, i waited to review and now bestow the pig with 5 stars. lots of veggie items -- but i highly recommend the cauliflower. so hearty that it could be a meal on its own. the beets are also delicious - i hate goat cheese but it was served ""whipped"" and light that i loved it. of course the wine list cannot be beat and love that they have 3 pour options -- in case you want to make your own flight. great service at the bar but the food came out super slow -- my friend's octopus came out 30 mins after everything else that it couldn't really be enjoyed because we were rushing out to see a show."
"I've been wanting to home here for years after an article I read in Food Network Magazine.My sister and I stopped by for lunch on a Thursday last month and the place was hopping.  A mix of young professionals and business people surrounded the restaurant.   We snagged a seat near one of the cooking stations, which was just awesome to watch!  The restaurant was a lot smaller than I had envisioned but it is part of the charm.  The waiter explained the menu and we ordered the almonds and manchego.  The drink menu was very extensive.  I ordered a white Italian wine and it was delicious.Next, we got our whipped feta with cucumbers.  It was so fresh and tasty.  The added dill and olive oil made it over the top.We finished with the pork shoulder and mashed potatoes.  The pork was so tender and melted in my mouth.  The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and were delicious.One thing I noticed is that the refills on water was amazing.  I had to go to the restroom twice in an hour!  Great service.  The amount of food for the price and service was stellar.  Can't wait to go back!"
"We attempted to eat here but they tried to squeeze 3 people into a place for 1 maybe 2 people. We were seated at a table with 2 other groups, across the table from one another, and we couldn't hear the other people in our group talk. After communicating via hand signals we decided to get out of this place. If you don't mind being crammed into a small space with no room to move than eat here. Otherwise avoid at all cost. I would not recommend this place and will not be visiting again. Sorry, but it doesn't matter if the food is good if you don't have room to eat, drink, and talk.Just terrible, that's all I can say about this place. I can't give this place enough of a negative review. I'm truly disgusted."
"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Purple Pig while visiting Chicago this past Sunday. As we expected a wait (with 3,000+ reviews on yelp duh!) we stopped by around 6pm to put our names on the list. We were told 45-60 minutes. We received a phone call in 30 minutes, came back as it started to rain and we got outside seating. Even though the tent isn't waterproof, it was fairly comfortable and we denied to move inside. The food is very good - we had a spread (can't remember the name), calamari with antipasti list, homemade gyro and chicken thighs kebabs. Everything was delicious and we had just enough space in tummies to eat desert. I loved the place and would recommend it to everyone. Tip: stop by an hour before you're ready to eat and then go shop around the area while waiting for a table :)"
"This is easily my favorite restaurant in the city. It doesn't even bother me that 90% of the patrons are tourists. You just have to know the times to go when there isn't a wait! Week day lunch right when they open, 4 pm-ish on a week day, after 10 pm on a weekend. Fun fact: the outdoor patio is open and serving food till at least 1 am on Friday & Saturday. It's the perfect place to grab a late night snack and a drink when you're just in the mood for conversation. The menu changes seasonally but stand outs with always be the bone marrow, the pork shoulder, the cold calamari dish, the butternut squash, and the eggplant caponata. I've come here with a vegan before and they were able to accommodate her! I'm no longer eating meat and this is still my fave place. Plenty of vegetarian options! Everything is so rich in flavor! I always get the same bottle of Gruner Vetliner, a crisp white wine that is very drinkable. I would recommend coming with one other person and trying to snag a seat at the bar. If you're trying to have dinner for four+ any night of the week, expect to wait a couple hours. If you are planning on waiting, surprisingly the bar at Michael Jordan Steakhouse has really good drinks or you could always walk down to sable!"
"I love the location of this place & once you enter, the ambiance is really quite great! I had some wine & delicious cheese platter. I ordered the pork shoulder & mashed potatoes, but it was so damn salty!! My friend ordered some steak & it was even more salty! I did love the meat balls. They were perfect!"
"Let's put things in perspective. Chicago is my third stop on my mini coast-to-coast holiday, and after something like twelve Michelin stars worth of meals in New York City, The Purple Pig still ranks as one of the highlights so far.After hemming and hawing about braving the rain and bitter, bitter cold (hey I'm from Singapore, our average temperature is ten times what it is here in Chicago right now), I decided that I couldn't live with myself if I just ate in the hotel (no offense Stetsons). Boy am I glad I took the walk. First off, the service is excellent. The staff went out of their way to make me feel welcomed, and the server whose name I unfortunately did not get spent plenty of time checking in on me and telling me about another place I needed to try.The food is also AMAZEBALLS. The octopus with fingerling potatoes is on point. One of the best grilled octopodes I've ever had. The house-cured charcuterie? Delish. Charred cauliflower? Perfect with some char, some acidity, and plenty of flavour. The deep fried pigs ears are a little oily, but I suspect that if shared amongst 3-4 people, it's perfect. Alas, I was dining alone.Quite simply, dinner at The Purple Pig was nothing short of perfect, and I'd highly recommend it to everyone in town. Five stars and deservedly so."
"Alright, so I've never been to Chicago, just in for a couple of days. My buddies and I were looking for a place to eat within walking distance from our hotel. The reviews for this place were good, not great though but we figured we'll try it out.After leaving, I cannot believe it has scored anything less than a perfect five star!I will go on record and say that this was without a doubt the best meal of my life. I will also say that I have been on a ""Low-Carb"" way of life for some time now so this place was heaven for me.I'm going to walk through everything I had because they were all stellar and if you're going, you should try:1.) Fois Gras with Pork Shoulder and Bacon     I mean, come on, how good does that sound? It has something sweet on there too to balance the salty bacon and the fois gras was some of the best I've had. Perfectly salty, fatty and rich.2.) Bone Marrow     I think this is what people come here for, and I can see why! Super rich and flavorful with the added sprinkles of sea salt that come with it.3.) ""JLT"" Pork Jowel      MY FAVORITE THING HERE! I've never had jowel before, but if Bacon and Butter somehow had a love child together, it would be pork jowel. With the perfectly cooked duck egg on top to add another dimension of richness, this bordered on a religious experience for me. 4.) Razor clams     Never had razor clams before, but there were outrageously good. Super briny and the brightness of the lemon helped to interject some needed ""palate cleansing"" after three courses of pure richness. Perfectly cooked too, not a bit over done. 5.) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder     Back to richness! This may have been my ""least"" favorite thing I had, but when I say that, I mean it was only a 9 out of 10 compared to the perfect score of everything else. Yes, it was rich, the milkiness definitely came through but I think it was just a tad under seasoned. A little more salt would have brought it up to a 10!6.) Octopus with Salsa Verda     Fantastic! I've never had octopus before, guess I was kind of a ""Pus"" but I did not regret trying it. It had great consistency and super flavorful with the salsa verda on top.7.) Wagyu Beef     This ties as my favorite next to the ""JLT"" for sure. Perfect crust on the outside and obviously very tender and perfectly cooked on the inside. Always wanted to try Wagyu beef and this did not disappoint. Well, that's what we had tonight. I'm sure everything else on the menu is equally fantastic or I just happened to stumble upon the most perfect of all the dishes they had but I seriously doubt that!TRY THIS PLACE - you won't regret it!"
"Tapas-style, inventive food. Super tasty! The standouts - the salt-cured Greek yogurt smear (basically little Greek yogurt balls in brine that you spread on bread and crackers) and the Wagyu steak dish. They were just so perfectly portioned and delicious. The razor clams were good, though pretty ordinary, and even for tapas, the quantity was a bit small. We also had a tripe dish that was more like a stew - texture was lost though it did taste good. Unfortunately we didn't get to try much else as one of our party wasn't feeling the vibe.Get there early! Or, is there even possible? We got there before 530PM on a weekday and was told that the wait would be 1.5 hours. We put our phone number down so that they would call us when a table was available. The phone rang at exactly 1.5 hours while we were out at a lounge elsewhere. There are so many other dishes to try! I would definitely come here again."
"Ok, so I have been here so many times I have forgotten how many. When I first came here I really loved it. Then they changed their menu and I grew distant and thought ""meh."" However, some of my foodie friends who share my taste profile said ""wait try it now"" so I did and I was shocked by the change from ""meh"" to ""wow.""I had their roasted broccoli that was Amaaazing - the taramasalata that was the best I ever had and I almost married a Greek girl after dating for 5 years, the four gras was simply light and fruity and earthy and spectacular,  the stripped bass was perfectly cooked and chicken thigh kabobs were great. While I didnt have it the pork shoulder and pigs ear were great. The service was great and the atmosphere upbeat and lively."
"Time to PIG out.On the last day of my recent Chicago trip, we made a firm decision to pig out for lunch at the Purple Pig.  Though it was last minute decision, it seems the odds were in our favor as it was quite near our hotel.  Actually much closer than we thought.  It was literally around the corner.  Since reservations are not accepted, we made sure to rush over after the restaurant opened at 1130.  Thankfully, it wasn't that crowded when we arrived and we were seated immediately.SETTING:  Seating available indoors or within the outdoor patio area.  We chose outdoors as it wasn't too crowded when arrived (though it was quite a full house when we left!).  There were heating lamps in use since the weather was on the cooler side that day.FOOD:  The menu boasts a myriad of selections ranging from antipasti, salads, smears, fried items, and so forth.  With so many choices, it was difficult to narrow down what dishes we wanted to share.  In the end we decided on:*Pig Platter:  Our server advised us that this platter wouldn't be more than we could handle.  However, it was quite intimidating when it was set before us.  Ten types of meats along with two pickled sides were laid out on a behemoth wooden tray.  At first we were stunned, but as we slowly sample the meats, we discovered they were so thinly sliced that we weren't getting too stuffed.  Sad to say I can't name all the meats to save my life, but they were all good choices, and the platter was bare when it left the table.*Roasted Bone Marrow:  Absolutely delicious.  A generous portion prepared well.  The addition of the parsley, onions, and capers blended well with the bone marrow produce a delectable dish.  *Fried PIg's ears:  I loved this dish!  Simply prepared with a bit of a crunch.  Served with crispy kale, fried egg, and pickled cherry peppers.  I'd order this dish again.*Pork neck bone rillette & mostarda:  This smear/dish was another favorite.  The portion served didn't seem much at first, but looks can be deceiving as we ran out of bread in no time.  The spread it self was very flavorful.  SERVICE:  Very good.  Seems like sheer coincidence that our server had lived on Maui for a few years before making the decision to reside in Chicago.  After discovering this Hawaii connection, he greeted us with a local Hawaii term, ""howzit.""  This of course had me chuckling a bit, and it seemed the meal was off to a good start.  Our server was clearly knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent suggestions about the food and drink.  The server and his helpers periodically checked on us throughout the meal, refilled waters, and cleared dishes in a timely manner.  Overall, excellent service during our visit.BOTTOM LINE:  It was great to PIG out at the Purple Pig."
Probably not well liked review but an honest review! SALT OVERLOAD!!!!!  Like Saltlick on steroids!Save your 2 hours of wait list and $200 and go somewhere else! You are paying for their rent on Michigan Avenue!2 stars - one for good service and another for good selection of wine!
"This place is amazing!!!Make sure you RSVP. Must try the pork belly, and deep fried pigs ear. The bar area is tight but no worries, there is a cocktail server walking around."
Visited Chicago for vacation last weekend. This place seemed to be so popular so I decided to give it a try. Service: horrible service. Our waiter did not know how to smile or greet his customers. He wasn't attentive either. That wasn't the worst part. I got so pissed when he just threw the dessert menu on the table and walked away without saying anything. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Just threw it on the table haha How effin rude is that?Food: since this place was so highly rated I guess my expectation was too high. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I would say it was pretty good but not enough to make me come back.
"Delicious food but I wish someone (mainly my server) would have told me that the main entree I was ordering was TINY! I ordered the rabbit, which was very tasty but seriously... For the dish to be almost $20 for 3 tiny medallions that are smaller than chicken nuggets (not even remotely exaggerating), I thought someone was playing a joke on me. My friend ordered the chicken kebabs which were also delicious, but triple the size of me entree. I came very hungry and ready to eat, but was sadly disappointed that I wasn't even warned. I'm not one to be cheap and I would have ordered more, but at that point it was late and we had already waited almost an hour for our food to come out. SO disappointing Purple Pig... It will be a LONG while before I come back and feel like spending $100 on appetizers."
"Velvety deliciousness.....the Pork Liver Pate ""Smear"" was perfect with a glass of Piedmont white from their surprisingly sizeable wine list!  The sign says ""Cheese, Swine & Wine"" ... so I had one of each!  Next up...Fried Manchego!   Other usual faves would be the almonds and olives: or build your own charcuterie plate.  Impossible to get in with more than 2 or 4.... but if you can: GO!  New patio seating helps...but the action is inside!  Insanely good: insanely delicious!"
"OK so this is my second time coming here, and I guess my first time wasn't as great. Every single dish that we had here was SO good!!! I'm so glad I came again to try something different. Maybe I just didn't order the right things the first time...MUST TRY:Pigs ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg. I love the crispy pig ears with the cherry peppers. The different crunchy textures with the fried egg are fabulous.Avocado hummus spread with Spanish anchovies on top. WOWOWOWOW. I absolutely loved this!!~ Who would have though that avocado goes so well with anchovies???JLT Pork Jowl, tomato, frisee & fried duck egg...I mean. Fried duck egg over pork jowl. Yummo.Also had the stuffed squid, which was pretty good. Butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, brown butter and salata...and then some other salad type dish that doesn't really stand out in my mind as much right now. I would skip these dishes if I only come with one other person or something. Next time, I'll have to try the octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. They ran out by the time we were ready to order."
"You know.. when I posted on Facebook that I was visiting Chicago, I got mass text messages from people saying ""PURPLE PIG!!!"". I wasn't really sure what the whole hype was about until I visited. You know, I'm not a big fan of ""tapas"" because I always feel like I leave ""still hungry""... but my wife convinced me that we must try this place before leaving Chicago. We had our last meal here before heading to the airport and I have to say that I am super glad that we were able to dine here! Braised pork shoulder was amazing. It just literally melts in your mouth -- it was served with mashed potatoes and left you wanting more. (Good for 3 people to sample). The chicken kabobs were also pretty bomb! They were served with fried potatoes with a tzatziki sauce; I'd say this was also good for 3 people to sample (portion wise). The calamari served on a salad base was so-so for my taste, but my wife absolutely loved it; she said it tasted very fresh and crisp, so if that's your thing, I'd say its worth a try -- served in a small bowl, maybe good for 2. Service was excellent and we would definitely come visit again. Make sure to be smart and visit when they aren't overloaded with people! We tried to go for dinner the night before, but got quoted a 3-hour wait time. We went for lunch on a weekday and got seated immediately."
Always love the food and vibe! The care and attention to create great food is off the charts..Go eat and understand why I love this place!
Heaven if you can get in. They do not take reservations but it is worth the two hour was it.
"Service wasn't that great. Food was!!! Very tapas style, different food! Worth checking out if you're looking for something unique and good! Just expect it to take a LONG time to get your meal!!! Maybe bring a snack...Our waiters even changed mid meal, and we had no idea because our previous waiter never told us!!!!"
It probably has the worst food I have ever tasted in my life. It's something I would only eat if I have nothing to eat and starving on the desert. But I was paying close to $50 for it so I had to eat it. I had company so I couldn't complain. :(
"Best pork belly we have ever tasted, hands down. Beets and goat cheese are perfect together. Great variety of vegetable and meat courses. Fairly attentive service. Nice tapas environment. Would like a few more wines available by the glass. Overall solid place!"
"So really.  The food is fantastic, and the prices are 100% reasonable for the quality.  But there are negatives:1. It takes a long time to get seated.  I showed up and was told that there was a 2-hour wait.  I was phoned after roughly 90 minutes.2. The place is noisy and cramped.  We were seated on the terrace, basically in a tent.  The heat lamps were on full blast; I was initially much too hot but was comfortable after I removed some of my garments.  That's until the rain started.  The tent is definitely not waterproof.  When it rains, there's a problem.The food and the drink: there were two of us and we had two beers (mine was a Belgian saison) and five small plates.  All of our choices were really good.  The best dish was probably the fried pig's ear with kale, but I need to give props to the suckling pig (daily special), the pork shoulder (very rich, saved for last), the fried sardines and the stuff octopus.  OK, I think that I've mentioned everything!  That's because all the dishes are very good.I'm a visitor from another planet (the SF Bay Area) and thought that the Purple Pig was an inspired choice.  If I lived in Chicago, I'd definitely come again.  And again.Now what's up with all the lawsuits?  After returning to my hotel room, I did a quick google search on ""Purple Pig"".  A typical hit is pattersonlawfirm.com/blo… .  Uh-oh."
"I can see why everybody comes here; it's got the good Chicago vibe and if you're a lover of  pork then I think this place will really make you squeal with delight.That's because when a pig walks by me, there's no reason for it to be nervous. A duck walks by, and I'm tempted to chase it down. So there are some aspects to The Purple Pig that others enjoy that are lost on me.I sat at the counter and made friends with folks on each side of me. The music was a mix of rap and I'm certain I heard Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch playing. With beer in hand, I scanned the menu - avoiding any porcine items - and chose the chicken liver pate, salt-roasted beets, and the razor clams. The chicken liver pate was extremely clove-y and sweet. I'm not keen on strong clove flavor--or sweet pate. I gave it a good effort though, and ate half of it with the charred bread. Strong flavors are a theme here. The salt-roasted beets are truly well-named as they are salty from the roasting but oooo they hold up to the natural sweet of the beet. The whipped goat cheese topping with pistachio was superb on top of the cubed beets--and the pate's bread. In hindsight, I should have just asked for a side of that to finish off my bread! The beet serving was so generous, and since my counter mates were eyeing it, I asked them to help me eat it, and they were too happy to oblige ;) And the razor clams are perfection. The mildly flavored razor clam, with its texture similar to a scallop, doesn't need a lot of fuss--and they keep it very simple here: oregano, lemon, and olive oil. First-rate.Don't relax too much, little piggies. I'm coming back with friends."
"I finally got to go to the Purple Pig!! Came on a Wednesday around 5:45 pm, and there was no wait for two people. However, my other person was not here and I was not allowed to put my name on the list. When I went back at around 6:20, we were told the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes, but we ended up being seated after about 10 minutes, so overall not bad. There is a little seating area outside where you could wait and traffic / people watch, and also grab a glass of wine. Now the food - was good. For two people, we tried a cheese dish, 5 meat dishes plus dessert. Our server told us to ""let go"" of one of our dishes because we were fatties, but we ate everything....sadly. Was it too much food? Yeah...but totally worth stuffing our faces. Three-cheese selection: our server picked three cheese for us. The plate came with a jam preserve as well as some cracker / crisps. We had an aged cheddar cheese with espresso powder on the outside (forgot the name), the Grayson (a softer cheese), and the Blue Bonnet (blue goat cheese). Grayson was our favorite. I probably would not do the cheese selection again, because for $19 we could have tried something more substantial. 3 stars. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: This was good, but people really hyped this one up for me, so I was somewhat disappointed. The kale and pig's ear were fried. I'm normally a huge fan of pig's ear, but having it super fried lost a lot of texture and even flavor that I usually like. Fried kale was decent, tasted like kale chips. 3 stars for the pig's ear, sorry. ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - Probably our favorite. First bite was really good and flavorful after we broke the egg yolk and drizzled it over the open-faced sandwich. The pork jowl bacon melted in our mouths, but there was not a lot of it, though we enjoyed a few really worthwhile bites bacon. Yum! 4.5 stars. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Bone marrow had great flavor, really tasty Texas toast came with the plate. The portion at Gilt Bar was so much bigger and we each got 2 bones of our own, but there was only one bone for both of us at The Purple Pig. I am curious because from the photos on Yelp, it looks like the plate should come with two. Maybe they were running low on bone marrow last night. Nevertheless flavor was amazing, and I would recommend to anyone. 4 stars. Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes - Cooked to medium, had an Asian-y, miso or soy flavor to it that we could not pin point. Good overall steak, but you probably didn't go to The Purple Pig for steak. I would skip next time. 3.5 stars.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - I heard that this could be on the saltier side, but we enjoyed it. The sauce was really tasty, pork was braised to perfection, and the mashed potatoes were flavorful. It was quite heavy though, but if you like creamy, this could be yummy. 4 stars. Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche} - We almost didn't get dessert because we were so full, but man am I glad that we did! :) This came out super hot, and when we cut it open, the ricotta and chocolate sauce just melted onto the plate. I loved loved loved it, it was super delicious. 5 stars. Our bill came out to be $115 (including a glass of wine), so pretty reasonably priced for how much we ate. Service was also very good. 5 stars for service. Overall, I really liked The Purple Pig, but I do have to say it's not worth an hour wait to come here. Coming before 6 pm definitely helps. The dishes were all good and I'm glad that I have tried the ""signature"" dishes, but honestly none that I would come back for specifically (other than maybe the Sicilian Iris)."
"This play is very creative in the way they offer their menu. The have choices of antipasto, smears, fried items, entrees, meats, cheeses, and desserts. All items are made for sharing, feel free to grab several items of these gourmet creations.The dishes we tried were the roasted broccoli which could make any one who hates veggies fall in love! The pork neckbone smear was a delicious pasta type sauce served with bread, very yummy. The flash fried buffalo wings were awesome and any wing fan should try. The milk braised pork shoulder was amazing, served with creamy mashed potatoes and a lil special sauce on top this tender dish packs a lot of flavor.The dessert menu is hard to choose from. I went with the mini fried donuts with blueberry jam in the middle. They went very fast since they were some of the best I've ever had. There are so many things to try here and you won't see many of the items at other places. The Purple Pig is one unique place that you can recreate new experiences here with each visit, love seeing places like this innovate and look forward to trying more!"
"This place was #1 on my restaurant list for my visit, but it's terribly over hyped. My friends and I came in around 9pm on Friday night and we were told the wait would be 90 minutes. We put our names on the list and walked off to another place to grab some snacks. Within 15-20 minutes of leaving The Pig, we got a call for our table because people kept dropping off the wait list. Gee, maybe you shouldn't overestimate the wait time by more than an hour?Now for the food and drinks. $6 for a bottle of sparkling water. (Really?!) Also, it's $1.50 extra to have your whiskey neat. We had the chorizo stuffed olives - can't taste the chorizo. Bone marrow dish with over-buttered bread. I could only taste the butter and not the marrow. Milk braised pork shoulder was overly salty. (I make a slow cooked kalua pork shoulder covered in Hawaiian sea salt that still isn't as salty as theirs.) Lastly, we had the tuna antipasta, which was the only acceptable dish of the bunch. Pretty disappointing meal overall."
"This is a great place to grab an afternoon bite. It can get a bit crowded in the evening and late at night. The outdoor seating area can get chilly during the winter, despite all of the heat lamps.My hands down favorite dish is the roasted bone marrow with herb smear. It's the best bone marrow I've ever had when you combine the thick Texas toast with the bone marrow, greens, and herbs. So savory. I also love the calamari salad, which is clean, refreshing, and tasty. The fried pig ears are another favorite, but sometimes they may be a bit salty. Unfortunately, the chorizo stuffed olives were not very impressive. I did love the ""jlt"" pork jowl and the pork shoulder."
This place is on a class it's own and worth it's weight in gold. The Bone Marrow Spread is heaven on a plate. I can strongly suggest this restaurant and well worth the wait.
"One of my favorite meals during my stint in Chicago. We had a party of 9, so our wait was a bit long. But they'll contact you via cell phone when your time has come. It's a cool little spot that's super bustling with energy and people. It's a perfect place to come with friends to drink and eat tapas.Because we had such a big party, I had an opportunity to taste an array of different plates (Sharing is caring!). The following are my highlights:+ Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: Delicious textures and the combination of ingredients seem weird, but work.+ Pork Liver Pate: I'm such a fan of pate and this was a great starter for the meal. If I could, I'd spread this on everything!This rating is strictly on the food. Our server had a bit of an attitude with us especially when asked questions around the menu (2.5 stars). Despite the lack of courteous service, I'd come back to try the rest of the assortment of dishes."
"What a gem!! As a business traveler who loves great food, the purple pig did NOT disappoint. Walked in around 8 on a Friday night to a restaurant bustling with people. Made my way to the bar and grabbed the first open stool (took 2 or 3 minutes). Once seated, the bartender was awesome at his job. Super knowledgeable, just the right amount of chatter, and fantastic about recommending food (specific choices and amounts of food for a solo diner). I tried a smear-- marinated greek yogurt with an apple jam. Out of this world. Such simple component that married SO well. Toasted bread with a tiny glass jar of marinated greek yogurt balls to spread on my toast and top with tart Apple jam. Not something I ever would have thought I needed to try in my life-- but so glad I did! For my main, I tried the JLT... Their spin on a BLT. Pork jowl, spinach, heirloom tomato, and maybe some cheese on an open faced sandwich and topped with a sunny side up duck egg. Oh em geeeeee. Guys. Salty creamy deliciousness that tastes like a summer afternoon at the lake (from my memories). Hoping to return again-- worth the rave reviews."
"We waited about 1.5 hours for a table. Its a long wait and they don't take reservations but since it's on Michigan Ave, you can shop around while you wait. We waited at Argo Tea across the street.I gotta say that I didn't have high expectations from this restaurant. Maybe it was the wine but it was delicious.We ordered:- Pig's ear with crispy kale: Delicious! I normally don't like pig's ear but you can't go wrong since it's fried. It's the first time I actually enjoyed kale, too. Highly recommended.- Roasted bone marrow with herbs: The bone marrow was made very well, and it's a smear you can eat with bread. We were trying to savor the marrow but at the end, realized how much there actually is! So much melt in your mouth goodness. Highly recommended.- Foie gras and membrillo: If you've had foie gras before, then I think you can pass on this. Not much special about it, and the portion is so small.- Milk braised pork shoulder: So yummy. The meat is so tender and the seasoning and pairing with the mashed potatoes go so well together. Highly recommended too!- Affogato: Normally, I wouldn't order this at a restaurant but my friend has never tried it before so we went for it. It is delicious but I'm sure this is delicious anywhere."
"This place was hopping but worth the wait. We managed to steal a spot at the bar. Everything we got was fantastic, including Greek-style cornbread with feta and honey, the burrata, the pig ears, and especially the bone marrow (which was sliced length-wise-- why don't more places do this??). It was a lively atmosphere and a memorable place to have a drink and snack on small plates."
"My biggest takeaway from The Purple Pig is SHARE! There are a lot of fun looking and strange things here and it's a shame to just have one thing. Expect a wait. It's a busy spot in a busy part of town. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but an annex seating area makes it reasonable. The staff clearly knows the menu draws questions, because the first thing they asked was whether they could explain and offer suggestions. Couple things I've tried (with a party of 4):*The Purple PIg Platter - a sampling of all the cured meats, perfect with a couple beers and hours of time to kill. The headcheese might put off some folks, with its rich flavor, but I found it well done.*Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - very tender, served in a little cast iron tray. My first reaction was that there was too much sauce, but the meat didn't have much flavor on its own.*Bone Marrow - I recommend Au Cheval on Randolf Street if you really want a bone marrow experience, compared, this bone marrow dish feels weak. Still tasty, but just not much food.*Stuffed Squid - nicely arranged, squid ink sauce doesn't have much flavor on its own so the chermoula was a good addition for both color and taste.*Pig's Ear - fried pig's ear is crunchy like a crisp fortune cookie, bland on its own but works well mixed with the egg and kale and pickled peppers. I'm generally not a fan of fried vegetables because without batter, it's easy to get very greasy dishes. Mixing the ingredients is more or less the way that is solved here.For a party of 4, I'd recommend 5-6 dishes to share.Remember the recommendation from Bizarre Foods - ""If it looks good, eat it."""
"This is our go to place when we have visitors, and no one has been disappointed.The food is consistently delicious and the small plates are perfect for sampling a variety of items.  My favorites tend to be the vegetarian dishes, such as the beets with goat cheese or the spring corn.  The menu changes with the seasons so there is always something new to try, yet they maintain some standard favorites.  It is busy, given its reputation and location on Michigan Avenue, but it's definitely worth the wait!"
I heard a lot of things about this place and finally had a chance to check it out. They don't take reservations so go in late afternoon if you don't want to wait. The wait during dinner time is 1-2 hours. Ambiance:Small place with mostly communal tables so be prepared to be cramped. There are too many chairs for the table. They stuck my husband at the end and people kept running into him because he was sitting in a walkway. I switched seats with him but then there was no place for him to out his legs because he was sitting in front of a post. They have more tables outside but who wants to freeze their butt off during their meal.Food:Tapas style so order 2 plates per person. Foie gras - smooth with good flavoring. Bone marrow - very bland. I've had better elsewhere. Pigs ears - highly recommended by the waitress but it was a big disappointment. It was the worst dish I've had in awhile. It was a bowl of fried oily food.  I stopped eating after 2 bites. Octopus with potatoes - my favorite dish. Love the texture of the octopus and the seasoning. Turkey leg - very tender. The meat fell off the bone. Also very flavorful. It's a very large and filling dish.
"Every dish we ordered - and that alone was challenging due to the unique and mouth watering options.. was amazing, delicious, and accompanied by impeccable service.  A must go if you are in downtown Chicago.We did not try the bone marrow though I hear its the prize winning dish --- ""Butter in a bone"" it was described as..don't tell your doctor..not a meat fan but if you are..our neighbors were licking the bone dry... lolentrance saysCheese Pig Wine... something like that..they provide what they promise"
"This came highly recommended to me by a wine and foodie friend who knows everything about Chi-town vs my minimal (but catching on quickly!) knowledge. Since they don't take reservations, we came prepared to wait and were extremely fortunate to land a table within 15 minutes. It was late afternoon on a rainy weekday, but the place was still packed. Everything we had over the next 3 hours was nothing short of spectacular! And it just continued to get better with every dish that was brought out. I think we probably ate and drank half the menu with no shame in our game whatsoever.The worst part of it was the annoying table next to us with a vegan girl asking way too many questions about things being altered and then being shocked when the answer was no. The place is called the Purple Pig...do you seriously think this is the best place for you, vegan girl? Stupid. I will say, however, the waiter was awesome with her and very patient. The service here is excellent! They really know a lot about what they are serving which always goes a long way with me. Especially when pairing wines and dropping a lot of money while doing so. Hey, I'm on vacation...entertain me! ;)Fabulous on all counts and will make this a staple when I'm in town."
"I won't lie, after looking at the menu I was afraid, very afraid of the options. Pork neck bone, bone marrow, pork tripe. Um, no thank you. I love pork like the next person, but can I just get some bacon?! Well, the Purple Pig is a culinary delight that forces diners to be more adventurous. This place delivers with each bite. The location can be a bit tricky if you are coming in from Michigan Ave. You walk through the building then you will find the entrance to the back of the restaurant. This place was packed on a Friday afternoon. We were starvin' like Marvin' so we chose to sit outside instead of wait for a table inside. Despite the low temperatures there were several people sitting outside in the enclosed patio area and there were several heat lamps, so we felt why not. Um, boy we were wrong. It was freaking cold. Halfway through lunch my thighs froze. As someone else mentioned, the tarp had several openings. Ugh! I'm telling you if it weren't for the food and the fact that we foolishly decided to sit outside, I would have marked this place down a star, but that food made up for it all. Next time, we will just wait for a table. Despite the cold, we had a wonderful dining experience. The staff was fantastic. Our waiter was helpful. They also came around to make sure out water glasses were never empty. Superb service! Now, the menu. This place is all about the swine, so you will find things that might immediately make your stomach churn such as tripe, but then you have traditional items such as braised pork. I dined with two friends so we decided to share half a bottle of Shiraz and the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta. Mind was slightly blown by this dish. First, the presentation was nice and the dish itself was perfection. The meat was tender served in a tomato base along with the warm ricotta and bread. We didn't want the dish to end. For our main course, my friend and I decided to get two different paninis to share. We split the slow roasted ham with scamorza cheese, and sundried tomatoes and the corned beef brisket. Sweet baby Jesus! Both panins were outstanding! The slow roasted ham inched forward as my favorite only because the brisket had dijonnaise which was a bit tangy, but none the less both panins made my day. I spent around $30 for my meal including tip. Pretty good deal for Chicago! If you are in the downtown area, please do yourself a favor and check out this place. Be open minded and prepared for your taste buds to be tantalized!"
Okay the wait is ridiculous because it's in touristy location and a hot spot. Parking non existent.  Food is decent small gourmet portions but expensive get ready to drop over $100 easy for 2. I would not be a regular maybe a special occasion once a year place for me for the value and portions is not appealing to me and I'm a foodie.
"This joint is epicurean goodness on a whole new level.  Get your ass in there and just see what they're making right behind the huge beautiful bar.  Try something off the winelist.  Be prepared to be amazed.  But, be prepared to wait for a while to get inside too.  Good thing they will serve you vino while you wait!"
"I'm not onboard with love of the Pig! I love me some swine but both the dishes and service fell short during my time at Purple Pig.Part of the experience is waiting for a table at The Purple Pig. They don't take reservations and you have to go in accepting that they don't and you will have to wait. On the positive side, there is seating outside while you wait and someone came around to take drink orders for us. Thanks to that the 90 minute wait was completely tolerable. Important to note though that they quoted us 45-60 minutes so the timing was way off.The seating situation isn't much fun either. If you are a party of two, you can hope to get seated at a two top table but there are a few large communal tables. Our party of five was sat at just a table and it was a bit of an awkward setup as I was then seated across from someone who was not in our party and had a hard time hearing the others in our party. That and it was pretty horrible trying to get in & out from the table as quarters were very, very close.Our server was friendly and I liked him however I ordered three small plates and he completely forgot one of mine. In the end, it never came but he was apologetic for forgetting to put it in but I was looking forward to that dish the most. Even with my two plates that I ordered though it was more than enough for me and I ended up taking more than half of each plate home.Now on to what I actually did get to try -Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg $9 - This is a dish I read everyone raving about and was determined to try. I was not a fan though! I found it to be salty and I didn't think the ingredients married quite well with each other. I do love a well cooked egg though and it was well done! It was okay but it's not something I would get again.Fried Smash Potatoes with Sheep Feta & Oregano $9 - This would be a big ol' skip on this dish for me. It was decent and edible but extremely salty. It was nothing overly exciting or fabulous and I wouldn't get it again, either.Purple Pig has a major over salting problem. I finished my glass of water to help the salt overload right away and sadly it was never refilled. Though I wasn't impressed with my first visit to Purple Pig, I'm completely open to going again and trying different dishes."
Terrible price you pay for little food that they make.   The food was tasty but to charge the price for food.....8.00 for a glorified hotdog.....13.00 for three small meatballs with flavor no better than a chain restraint such as Buca Deppo.  Personally the most money I have spent eating a lunch that yet I am still hungry.....Now maybe it is better at dinner time but if the menu is the same then all the reviewers that have this place 4 stars or better are on their payroll.Go elsewhere...across the street has wonderful huge salads for the price....
"A dear friend was in town, and The Purple Pig (TPP) is one of her favorite places on Michigan Ave. I hadn't yet been to TPP yet, because their slogan ""Cheese, wine, and swine"" had made me think it was a place to go for appetizers and drinks. We came to TPP for dinner, and it is a good place for dinner. In addition to appetizers, smears (various meat-based ""spreads"" served with crostini bread), cured meat and cheese selections, panini sandwiches, TPP has ""a la plancha"" or plates. My friends and I ordered two appetizers: (1) Charred cauliflower, toasted breadcrumbs,cornichons & parsley  and (2) Squid stuffed with prosciutto & bread crumbs, santorini fava puree & charmoula. The charred cauliflower reminded me of a roasted cauliflower soup I make, so it had a familiar taste, but the cauliflower was both salty and sour: the vinegar made it sour, the generous salting made it salty. Interesting flavor profile for cauliflower. The stuffed squid had a tough texture (squid), and the prosciutto was ground and stuffed inside the squid. The appetizer serving comes with 4 pieces, which is great for a party of four or just a dinner date. For plates, my party of four ordered 4 meats: veal, lamb, chicken, and turkey. I ordered the turkey leg, and the meat fell off the bone. So tender. Also, if the the thought of turkey leg reminded you of Disneyland, you're right. This leg was bigger than your standard chicken drumstick. In fact, another patron came over just to snap a picture of the turkey leg. A complete stranger took enough interest in my food that he wanted to visually document it. Wow. My friend's lamb blade steak was just as tender, and the chimichurri sauce was as parsley-esque as can be. If you don't like parsley, then skip this plate. The val was tougher, but unlike many veal plates Gordon Ramsay has tried on Kitchen Nightmares, this was well done. The chicken kabobs were tougher, but they were made from chicken thigh meat, which is different from standard chicken breast meat kabobs. Tzatiki sauce was on the watery-side, but a nice cool to the heat of the sauce that coated the kabobs. The plates don't come with sides, so order a vegetarian appetizer like the cauliflower to get your meals' worth of veggies. Overall, the food was good (Read the MEAT was as good as it gets). Don't read too much into the name: TPP has pork, lamb, turkey, chicken, and even cauliflower. I wouldn't recommend this place to a vegetarian, as a coworker erroneously did a few days back (oops!). But, if you like meat, and if you like wine or fine cocktails, come here. The ambience is very dark and dim-lit-my pictures with flash of the food look better than what my own eyes were able to capture last night. People are seated on the patio with warming heat lamps, and inside on high rise tables (seat larger parties/you'll be rubbing elbows with the party next to you) and low rise tables (seat 2-4/placed fairly close to one another). Not so good for intimate conversations, but if you're coming here, you should be eating and not talking anyway!"
Great food and portions that are designed for sharing and lovely service. but a cramped layout and they charge $2.75 for club soda?
"At 6:00 pm the place was packed. I was lucky to get a seat at the bar. I ordered the calamari and it was good. I also has the pork shoulder but it was very salty. Over all, the food was good but a bit pricey."
"Overwhwelmed.  Food was fatty and porky (which is probably a compliment to the chef).  But authentic, adventurous, great service and fun atmosphere. I definitely recommend it even though I doubt I'll return."
"All I can say is WOW!  The first night I tried to eat here the wait was 2 1/2 hours.. I tried the following day and got in a lot quicker at the bar.  What an incredible menu!! Everything I tried was AMAZING!   Awesome, adventurous, unusual selections -- so yummy! Great wine list, great service, cool environment .. I tried tastes of 12 different things on the menu - everything was UNREAL!!"
"Pig is never my choice of Protein but my experience at The Purple Pig might change that if different body parts of pigs can be that delicious!Came here for lunch when the restaurant opens so there was no line and we got seated right away.Service was just amazing! We ordered the following to share:Lindeman Pesche ($10) & Dupont Saison ($12)Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg ($9) - Must Order!Foie Gras & Membrillo ($15)Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs ($10)House Made Seafood Sausage ($17) Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche} ($7) - Must Order!Everything was well prepared and full of flavour!! Our waiter's recommendation were all spot on!Love everything about The Purple Pig and I will be back next time when I am in town to try out other items on the menu!"
"LOVE the milk braised pork shoulder, chicken thighs and the octopus. Great wine selection, especially the reds. Tried a dark chocolate goat cheese too but I have only seen this once in the menu. One of my favorite places for an early dinner meeting on a week night before the long wait for a table begins. Always busy here, no matter what night of the week. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered."
"My partner and I were in Chicago for a few days, we heard a lot of buzz about this restaurant. The Purple Pig was a very interesting restaurant with different and unique food options that I don't think you could get many other places. I liked it.We were worried about having to wait for a long time, so we went around 2:30 on Friday. We were surprised when it was very busy, and the woman told us that we would be seated around 20 to 30 minutes. So we just decide to get a drink at the bar, but before we received our drinks, we are already being called for seating. Sweet!Because we had heard such good things about this place, we wanted to try a lot of the different options. We went for broke trying to explore the menu. We started with the crispy pig ears. This dish was fine, but came with completely too many pickled peppers, and it kind of ruined it for me. The fried deviled egg was disappointing -- one egg that didn't have complex flavors for $8...  (Apparently, The Purple Pig really likes their pickled vegetables, because this dish was full of cornishes, which again ruin this dish for me. I'm fine with some pickling agent on a dish, but they over do it here.) The roasted beets and goat cheese foam was absolutely delicious, and one of my favorite dishes that we had.For entrée, the Italian sausage was perfect. It came with this ratatouille underneath which was outstanding, and I'm normally not the type to eat tomatoes.  I think the main reason why I give The Purple Pig 4 stars instead of 5 is because while some of the dishes were outstanding, some of them had unsuccessful components which didn't match the dish. Consistency is paramount, After all. Overall, I would definitely recommend going to The Purple Pig. Since this is a tapas place, three groups can have three completely different meals, and they could all be different. Just with my particular dishes, there wasn't consistency across the board. Still would go back, though!"
"This place was fabulous.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be quite good. Also a great atmosphere, and packed on a Sunday night."
Great service. Great food. We had broccoli as appetizer. Razor calm and octopus as dinner. Def try the fried pig ears. So good! Awesome environment too!
"They were very accommodating when we had something wrong with our dish.  I highly recommend getting the pig ears.  We also had the pork shoulder and wagu sirloin, but I didn't think the wagu was worth it.  The pork shoulder was good,  but I wouldn't say it's worth dying for."
"I've always wanted to try this place out. The lines are always long and the reviews were always amazing. I really really really wanted to like this place but unfortunately, it didn't pan out to be the showstopper that I hoped that it would be. It's probably my fault for getting my expectations worked up. Nothing was ""bad,"" but then again, nothing was ""great"" either. I would also have to say that the prices and portions don't really correlate well. Marinated olives: 3/5Pig's ear with crispy kale: 3/5Bone marrow: 5/5 (the one saving grace of the meal)Milk-braised pork shoulder: 3/5Prawn and chicken sweetbread sausage: 4/5Sicilian iris (ricotta and chocolate chip fried brioche): 5/5"
"So yes, everything that everyone else has said. Wine list is incredible, food is creative and has amazing presentation, very crowded and apparently, a Chicago staple. We sat at the bar. Service was perfect! I'll be back...during the week. At like 3pm. In winter."
"TAPAS TAPAS TAPAS!! This establisment is by far one of my favorite restaurant in Chicago.Conveniently located on Michigan avenue, expect a wait during prime time hours but easy to walk in and get a table on the patio or bar in the afternoon. I suggest if you are waiting for a table, keep a CLOSE eye for the bar. Its cooler & closer to the action.Food: Braised pork shoulderMusselsRazor clamsBone marrowPIGS EAR&& Charcuterie plate are all delicious.Two things I keep wanting for more are the Bone marrow & pigs ear. Everything in the menu looks & taste good. If you love tapas or a fan of any of the chef i'd definitely check this place out."
"Although it can get crowded at time, the unique food selection would be worth it. Highly recommend those that I've tried"
"This is my second visit to the Purple Pig and am still in love with the place! Fantastic selection of food served by some great people, you'll have a great night here.We chose of bottle of delicious Portuguese red (Tons) which was $32 and then proceeded to order way too much food. We had the beets and goats cheese which is fabulous followed by the yoghurt in oil (the best thing of the night!). Next, the razor clams (a bit meh), sliders (delicious but a bit salty), stuffed squid and milk braised pork shoulder (AMAZING) came out. We were both way too stuffed to order a dessert, but ok told the fried brioche is divine!"
"Tried again against my better judgement.   Out of owners, what else can I sayTBS,  food was mediocre at best , the wait intolerable, and the service beyond surly.Don't waste your time or money going to this fiasco.   If you want all the parts of an animal that people normally toss... Just go to a slaughter house,,, the experience will be the sameIf only Yelp had a zero or negative rating :("
"Back again. every time we are in town we head to the purple pig, it never disappoints.  an awesome meal, great wine selection. Love the communal tables, makes for great conversation."
"There seem to be an infinite amount of amazing restaurants in Chicago and The Purple Pig is one of them. I had the chance to go to this trendy bistro with two friends on a recent trip to the windy city and it was definitely a treat. It was after noon and we were luck to grab three chairs at the communal table, where we shared a variety of small plates. Notable selections:Salt-roasted beets: a wonderful take on roasted beets, this dish was served in a small bowl with whipped goat cheese and topped with pistachios. The creaminess of the cheese mixed with the soft, sweet, tender chunks of beets and the crunch of the nuts made it taste more like a desert - It was heavenly.Fried Brussels sprouts: I can't ever say no to Brussels sprouts...Wagyu Sirloin Tips: a bit on the salty side, but still fabulous.We also had a wonderful pork dish served with a chimichurri sauce.For desert, we had the Lemon Panna Cotta and the Tangerine Cake. The panna cotta was fresh and the flavor was spot on. The tangerine cake wasn't as good - dry and lacking any pronounced citrus flavor.Our server was very helpful, efficient, and a lot of fun.All in all, it was a wonderful meal with wonderful friends. I look forward to returning to The Purple Pig in the future..."
Ordered Chicken thigh kebabs and was blown away by the flavor. Perhaps it was an off day but the staff just wasn't that friendly. Hence the 4 out of 5.  Chill spot overall though and I look forward to going again.
"I took my boyfriend here this past weekend for a birthday lunch. Purple Pig has been on our list of restaurants to visit, and this was our first time here. We showed up around 11:30-12 on Saturday morning, and were promptly seated on the patio. Make sure you go early or during off hours as I've heard the wait can be quite long.We shared the Greek cornbread, fried pig's ear, prosciutto stuffed squid, octopus, milk-braised pork shoulder, housemade meatballs, and finished off the meal with the torta mandorla.My favorite dishes were the cornbread, octopus, and housemade meatballs. I thought that the cheese and honey paired very nicely with the cornbread, and the flavors worked well together. The octopus came with fingerling potatoes and green beans, and had a citrus finish that got stronger the more you ate it. The meatballs were also soft and well flavored.The pork shoulder was very tender, but I found the taste of the mashed potatoes a little overpowering. The fried pig's ear reminded me of overpriced French fry crisps, but the cherry peppers did give it a nice kick of tartness. I found the prosciutto stuffed squid and the torta mandorla a little bland.In general, Purple Pig seemed overhyped and didn't live up to its expectations. While all of the dishes were well prepared, I didn't feel that there was anything particularly special about any of them. The meal and service were great overall, but I would not feel compelled to return."
"What can I add to a place with 3000 reviews? Only this. Some of my closest friends work in places like this so I am a pretty good judge of them: small plates, expertly chosen wine list, communal tables, hip young staff, raucous atmosphere. Like the older Avec, that's Purple Pig in spades. I stopped in and sat at the bar. Noisy and clattered but everyone having a good time. The two dudes who waited on me could not have been nicer or more informed. They walked me through the wine and I had a Provence rose and a mind blowing peppery Croatian Babic...a grape that is a parent of Zin for you wine geeks. Had a foi gras with lentils starter and that amazing herbal octopus with potatoes and haricot verte. Just perfect. This place is embedded as a must-visit now for all time.And I got through this review without uttering the execrable word ""foodie."" Oh shit..."
"I wish we could have tried a lot more things here! I guess that will be for our next visit to Chicago. They don't take reservations so you have to give them your name and they give you an estimated time that you would have to wait. It was no problem for us because The Purple Pig is located in the Magnificent Mile, where there's a ton of stores and shops around you. We waited in the Nordstrom next door for about 30 minutes until they called us to say that our table was ready.What we ordered:Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - Not my favorite out of the food we ordered, tasted more like potato chips.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Expect a big plate of bone barrow. So delicious, flavorful and goes great with the bread provided.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - The best thing we got in my opinion! The pork shoulder was so tender and the mashed potatoes were incredibly smooth.Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche} - Amazing dessert and never had anything like this. We saved room for this because we heard it was a must while dining here.Try the cocktails here too. It sounds like most of them are delicious.I definitely want to go back to The Purple Pig and try their turkey leg....and maybe a few other things :)"
"We were told that the lines here are long. If you're crunched for time, make sure you arrive 10-15 minutes before they open! They have a huge selection of food. Takes a while to really sift thru the whole menu and deciding. Proportions are pretty big if your party is small, so it makes it a little difficult if you're wanting to try many many dishes. Out of all the dishes we ordered, some were hits and some were misses. By misses, I don't mean that they weren't good. I mean that the hype got the best of it, like expecting something so magnificent that I won't find anywhere else but it was almost just like average Joe."
"Solid 4 stars. We needed a light lunch on a Saturday afternoon and we were staying close by. Yelp never steers me wrong, so after reading great reviews we decided to give it a try. It was about 2pm and I was told it would be a 30 min wait, but fortunately we got the call that our table was ready after 5. We sat on the patio, it was a little hot at first but it eventually cooled off. Lots to choose from on the menu, but we found it easier asking people around us what they had because it all looked so good. Food came out super fast and they were generous portion sizes for small plates. We shared the beets, calamari, pork shoulder and a cheese panini with tasty bits of bacon on the side. All dishes were really good. My boyfriend was surprised the calamari wasn't fried, but he enjoyed it and thought it was a light and refreshing summer dish.Would definitely recommend this spot and we look forward to going back on a future trip!"
"I went here when my cousin was in town visiting & it was delicious!we ordered a few of the antipasti, salad, & fried items that the waiter recommended we try. the portions were just enough & the flavors were unique.next, we ordered the purple pig platter, a charcuterie board filled with an assortment of meats and cheeses. yes, please! so freaking good. we also shared the bone marrow. perfection. melts in your mouth, phenomenal. for my actual dinner I had the ""JLT"", again delicious, but at this point I was swined out & felt heavy. would I do it all over again? of course, but idk if I could make this a monthly thing. maybe 2 or 3 times a year.4 stars because of the difficult / lack of parking & cramped table arrangement. I don't like eating in an overcrowded restaurant with people I don't know at my table & the people waiting for a table hovering over my food."
"So I got the house lardo iberico on bread and some arugula. The pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg. Also got a cornbread with some cheese on top. The cornbread was pretty standard. The pig's ear was good but not something very memorable. I was a bit overwhelmed after ordering the lardo. I didn't think it'd be a generous portion so that's my fault. I was maybe on fried food/fatty food overload. It wasn't so pleasant. Next time I'll try the beets or the brussels sprouts because that sounded good! Tried the turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, treviso, endive which was very flavorful. The butternut squash was delectable with pumpkin seeds and brown butter. Very flavorful and tasty. We weren't rushed and overall, the food was pretty good. I may branch out with trying other pork products as opposed to getting anything fried since it wasn't so special. The atmosphere was really fun. Was loving the 80s-90s music though! Our waiter was helpful and super attentive."
"My all-time favourite restaurant.I went once years ago while travelling with my parents and instantly fell in love with The Purple Pig. On my next visit to Chicago with my boyfriend, we ate here every night - three nights in a row. Now whenever we go to any other restaurant we ask each other whether it was ""Purple Pig level."" We've yet to find anything better!"
"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so glad I was able to squeeze it in! They don't take reservations, and we were lucky enough to get a table for 5 right away around lunch time. Super cute place right by the river. Here are some must try on the menu!Pig's Ear-SOO DELICIOUS! Nice and crispy, with just enough flavor.Chorizo Stuffed Olives-I'm not a fan of olives, but they were surprisingly good, probably even better for olive lovers.Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes-MY FAVORITE! No words to describe how yummy this was...And make sure you leave room for dessert. Even if you're stuffed...just do it! We got the Affogato, perfect blend between the sweetness of the ice cream and the espresso. Also got the crepe with nutella, mmmm. Can't wait to go back!"
"Cannot believe the hype surrounding this place. The JLT(made of pork jowl, tomatoes and a ducks egg on top)  we ordered had egg shells on it. And when I have to eat crunchy white egg shells and they charge me the full amount for making me eat that this is what the review should be. (And yes I mentioned it to the server)We also got the pork ciccioli. Nothing special. Not worth the money I spent on both dishes.Not going back!"
"A welcome change to the standard midwestern food fare.  You'll find stuff here that you normally wouldn't find in restaurants, so it's great for people who're a little adventurous.  The food was on the saltier side, which the other reviews seem to corroborate.Pigs Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried eggSalty, but overall OK, but wish it was on the crispier side, even w/o the egg mushing it up.Purple Pig PlatterGood variety of pig meats, great if you're into charcuterie.Octopus w/ green beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verdeAgain, on the saltier side. but actually very surprised at how good it was.  They did a great job of not making it so chewy, which is what you're typically get w/ octopus."
"Amazing restaurant and so worth the wait! The food is delicious and servers are really nice. Started off with the olive oil poached tuna (very small dish FYI but tasty. I was worried it would be too much olive oil but not at all, wasn't overpowering), raw corn salad (really really really good, I wanted seconds), and a kale salad (the dressing it came with was phenomenal but the salad itself was very simple). For the heavier dishes we ordered the pork neck rillette smear, so so good! Also, ordered the razor clams (never had them before but wow this was amazing, a definite must order) and stuffed squid with breading and prosciutto (a bit too much breading and not enough prosciutto but still awesome dish). For a restaurant that is all about the pig, the seafood dishes and the vegetables are not forgotten. Even if you're a vegetarian, there are plenty of options that will knock your socks off. Do not miss this restaurant."
"This menu has a LOT to offer without being too overwhelming. The Purple Pig is pretty simple in that it focuses on swine, wine, and cheese. I somehow got through my visit here by skipping swine, wine, AND cheese and I didn't fully realize that until just now as I'm sitting down for this review. So, know that it's possible to eat other scrumptious items at Purple Pig! Apparently, pigs turn purple when they drink too much wine. It seems like an awful waste if wine to give it to pigs, but there you go. The impetus behind the name of this place is explained on the overhead light shade, which has definitions and explanations for everything on the menu. I found this incredibly helpful, like figuring our that there were gherkin pickles in the cauliflower dish. Even though office clips were used to hold this info, it still managed not to look tacky. Props, Purple Pig! We weren't especially hungry because we ate at 3:45, an off time that required no wait. That was awesome! However, due to not being particularly hungry, I didn't eat any signature items. My absolute favorite was the beets with goat cheese. I usually am not a beets fan, but it was incredible. I especially enjoyed he whipped goat cheese and pistachios. There we go: goat cheese. I did get to sample the cheese! In fact, I also sampled the fried cheese appetizer my friends got and it was also very yummy. I would definitely order it next time! My main complaints, really, were that it was very cramped and that our service was spotty, at best. I think coming at an off time comes at a price. We had several different waiters and weren't well-attended-to. I'm willing to sacrifice that for not having I wait, though!"
"The Purple Pig: Where we were ""swined and dined.""The food served here is meant to be shared, making this the perfect spot to dine at with a small group of adventurous eaters. Many of the dishes have interesting ingredient combinations that may not sound appetizing, but you just have to grow a pair and go for it. Greek Salad: This salad is outstanding, so much so that we ordered THREE plates and ate everything. No slice of cucumber or shred of lettuce was left behind. The best part about this salad were the sweet sundried tomatoes.Hazelnut Salad: I'm unsure of the exact name, but this has thin slices of butternut squash, zucchini, hazelnuts, shaved cheese, and blueberries that have a pickled flavor. Olive Oil-Poached Tuna: The green beans were crisp, and the tuna was delicious. Calamari: The calamari was soft and not chewy, and I enjoyed fergula. What I didn't like about this were the sliced radishes.Pig Platter: I can't remember all the pork products on our board, but the thin slices of tongue were my favorite. We almost ate the board clean, except for the brains. Buttery and oily, it's an acquired taste; though, I think it's palatable when spread on the thin crackers that accompany the platter. Sicilian Iris: This dessert is essentially a fried doughnut snowed upon by powdered sugar. Sliced in half, a hot mixture of ricotta cheese and chocolate chips oozes out. Delicious and heavy.Dessert #2: Too busy gorging, I don't recall the name of the fudgy peanut butter dessert served with two swirls of cream on either side, and topped with caramel popcorn, which I didn't care for. Service: Exceptional. The restaurant was a packed house when we were there, but our server and his team did an amazing job taking care of our table. Props to them!Other: Prepare to get a little cozy with other patrons at the communal dining table; although, there are other seats where you can eat at with just you and your group. I rarely give 5-stars to a place that I've only visited once, but this restaurant is absolutely deserving of that rating. Hands down, my friends and I agree that we had one of the best meals ever at The Purple Pig."
"The Purple Pig has a menu that is very pork-heavy. Surprise!I, however, don't much care for pork, unless it's bacon. With that being said, I have eaten here several times and enjoyed it! I recommend:Heirloom Carrot, Grapefruit, and Farro Salad: Fabulously delicious!Eggplant Parmesan Balls: Pretty tastyChicago Italian-Beef Style Pig Jowl(?) Sandwich: Surprisingly goodBurrata Pugliese w/House Bread:   Ah. Ma. Zing!Lemon Panna Cotta w/Candied Pistachios: Delish!Sicillian Iris: Warm, chocolatey brioche goodness.The quail was unremarkable, other than the pomegranate and its tiny size."
"Amazing food... Quality and detail to each dish is impeccable. The Chef/Owner has laser-beam focus, as you watch him expedite the orders in the open kitchen. It's entertaining to watch. The vibe here is energetic, fun, great music. It's a happening place and in no way low-key or boring. I've had the pleasure of experiencing many items on the menu and each surpassed my high expectations. Some of my favorites are: the milk braised pork shoulder, the blade steak, butternut squash, Greek cornbread and I love all of the salads. For dessert, don't miss the Nutella panini, the Sicilian Iris and any of the unique homemade soft-served ice cream. YUM! Something new on the menu that we ordered a second on is the gnudi pasta. It was mouth-watering good! Melted in your mouth and so flavorful. I haven't had pasta that good since I visited Italy! Definitely worth any wait that you may experience."
"This restaurant was recommended to us and I am glad we decided to go. It was very busy and the wait  was one hour and a half. We waited to get seats in the bar in front of the kitchen. Had fun looking at all the cooks so busy but enjoying themselves too. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I had ordered Octopus and they had temporarily ran out but the sous chef and waiter promised  I would get my Octopus and they delivered, I had the last order, Yeah!!!!. It was so tender and flavorful. Also ordered the Fried Manchego and a Crepe for dessert. If you are in town make some time to visit."
An ambitious menu with a great array of fun and eclectic dishes! Recommend taking time to work through the menu sampling the  delectable diversity that the Pig has to offer. Especially liked the foie gras and octopus. Decent craft beer offering on tap.
"I don't think you can go wrong with a wine and tapas bar ever, which might explain why this place was so damn crowded. Anyway, ventured here on a snowy Wednesday night while traveling for work in Chicago. The place was a mad house, but smelled amazing, and I decided it was definitely worth the hour + wait for 2. It's a really cute place, I can tell a lot of people were on dates or just looking for a fun time with a few friends. I felt like the median age was around 32. Every time a dish passed me while I waited at the bar, I wanted to knock someone off their bar stool and steal their food (and wine), everything looked so good! So we waited the hour plus for a table to open up and sat down around 8:15pm. The wine list is pretty extensive and they offer 1/2 of their menu in 5oz pours of half bottles. Most of the wine is from Spain or Italy. The sommelier let me try 3 samples, before we decided on a half bottle. We ordered 4 dishes between us:The food: Brussel sprouts salad: definitely different than what I expected, but really tasty. I felt like it was more of a summer dish, as it was very light and zesty. Shredded lettuce, apples, pecans and brussel sprouts in a light dressing.Eggplant caponata with goat cheese smear. 5 pieces of toasted bread with goat cheese smeared on it, then a dish with cut up pieces of eggplant, lima beans, and a variety of other vegetables in a tasty olive oil red sauce. Great starter.For main courses we shared the Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. This dish reminded me of being in Greece. I loved the tzatsiki and the chicken was nice and crispy. We finished off with seafood carbonara, which was pretty good, probably my least favorite dish though. The mussels and shrimp were tasty and fresh, and the sauce was a lightly spicy marinara sauce. It was okay. Now for the negatives...the staff there DROVE ME INSANE. They kept pouring water when I didn't need any, kept trying to take our dishes away when we weren't done, they kept hovering over our table like they wanted us to leave. LEAVE ME ALONE. AHHH!!! It wasn't our waiter either! It was the kitchen staff and they barely spoke any English. I said to them, don't take that dish away, and they did anyway. I said, I don't need water and they poured me more anyway. They legit took the fork out of my hand, what is that about?! It was extremely disruptive and annoying. I had to point that out because everything else was really good, but I just couldn't deal with the staff hovering over us like birds stalking their pray. When I'm done, I will put my dish to the side and leave my fork on it, so you know I'm done! ARG! They place itself is really loud too and if you're waiting, be prepared to have the ait staff push into you and ask you to move 100 times, which is pretty annoying."
If I could this place would get  6 stars. ( and I'm saying this for the first time!)The combination of flavors each plates has its AMAZING! !! I had the pigs ears and the fried mash potatoes.A selection of 3 cheeses and wine.Everything was Perfect! Our waiter was awesome and recommended the cheese and wine; taking into consideration what we usually like. And he nailed it!
"So this is my adventure to try the famous Purple Pig restaurant with my friend who was visiting from out of town. I spent the day studying the Starbucks two doors down from this place and walked over around 6 PM (on a Saturday) to put my name down for two people. They do take down your phone number so you can totally walk around and explore local spots or grab a drink nearby (John Hancock Tower and Magnificent Mile is nearby fyi for tourists). The hostess said it would be about 1.5 hour wait thus, the waiting commenced. This place has a huge quad area that allows you to sit, wait, and drink. My friend and just sat there and caught up during our wait so the time passed by quite fast.So once we got seated (communal seating btw) about 1.5 hours later, we quickly ordered our food because we were starving! We passed on the wine and only ordered small plates. Between two hungry girls, we got 4 dishes: calamari, milk braised pork shoulder, mussels, and octopus.Calamari: NOTE - this isn't fried squid but it's a salad. It was very citrusy and I did not really like it.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: this reminded me of my mom's thit kho (vietnamese dish). The meat was super soft and just melts in your mouth. Also, it was a bit on the salty end. I kept having to drink water to wash away the salty taste since there was no salad or rice to balance the saltiness.Octopus: This was probably my favorite dish of the night and it was a blend of salty and citrusy. The octopus was perfectly chewy and I really enjoyed it.Mussels: not salty or citrusy. It was creamy and came with two piece of toast. The meat was yummy, but it's honestly nothing special.Service was great. Total meal came out to about $35/person. Maybe it is because I didn't order the good plates but I honestly don't think it is worth the long wait for this place. And I don't really like the communal seating that they have."
"I came here for lunch with my husband. We arrived about 10 minutes before they opened but there were already several people waiting in line! Thankfully, we got seated right away as soon as they opened. We shared 3 dishes which was the perfect amount for the 2 of us:- PORK NECK BONE GRAVY WITH RICOTTA SMEAR: yummy!! So savory, rich, and flavorful! The crostini breads had a perfect toast to them too. I found myself using that last piece of bread to sop up all the last little bits of gravy goodness. Definitely recommend getting this! It's a great appetizer for sharing!- MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOES: This is their signature dish, but it was actually my least fave of the 3. First of all, the presentation wasn't very pleasant... it looked like plain cafeteria food. Yes, the pork shoulder was cooked very well and was very soft, but it pretty much reminded me of the texture of kalbi jjim (and if you're Korean, that stuff is NBD and something your taste buds are just used to). It wasn't that flavorful either. The mashed potatoes were very creamy but nothing special. Overall, this dish is pretty good but not amazing.- PIG'S EAR WITH CRISPY KALE, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPERS, & FRIED EGG: OMG this was soooo goood!! Truly has the WOW factor! This was my fave of the 3! I loved the texture of the light and crispy kale, with the crispy chewy pig's ear, and the acidity from the pickled peppers. The fried egg was like the perfect cherry on top. Although this dish is slightly on the oily, greasy side... it's still freakin amazing and you don't feel as guilty eating it because... it's kale! :PService was very friendly and nice but a little unorganized... they kept bringing us dishes we didn't order, that belonged to another table. Overall, this was definitely one of my favorite meals in Chicago! Also gotta love the location, right on Magnificent Mile. Perfect place to eat if you're already gonna be doing some shopping there anyway!"
So good! The food was amazing and the service was top notch. Totally recommend this spot to anyone going to Chicago!
"Ok, let's take a minute to bow our heads for this fantastic little spot.Food = DeliciousService = GoodSpace = Eh (this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)So let's start with the food.-Salt Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese, and Pistachio Vinaigrette - I love beets, so I really enjoyed this, however, no one else at the table liked beets.  It was a lot for one person.  I didn't finish it.  I think the whipped goat cheese is what made it a bit too much, but it was still very good.-Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki - YUM!  The chicken was very flavorful, the smashed potatoes were perfect for me, but honestly probably too salty for someone who doesn't like very salty food.-Some delicious corn bread and honey concoction whose name I do not recall.  This thing was the best of the night.  The only reason I didn't scarf down the entire thing by myself is because my sister ordered it.  Next time I'm there, I'm DEFINITELY ordering this.  We had a cheese plate which was good.  The wine selection was also good.  The space was a bit small.  My group and I had to share a long table with another group of strangers.  It was a bit uncomfortable.  There wasn't much space to squeeze between tables, so getting to the bathroom was a bit like playing human tetris.  The service was great.  Our server was very willing to share his thoughts on the best options for us based on what we like to eat.  I'll be back Mr. Pig.... I'll be back."
This is my 2nd visit to this place and the food and energy in this place is excellent. I sat at the chefs counter and the line cooks work in what looks like a chaotic environment but in the end it all comes out like a well organized machine. They are able to produce food at a very quick pace. This was on Fathers Day and so they were very  busy but that didn't phase them. The food was great. I had the bone marrow and the octopus. Both were really good. I would highly recommend.
"SO GOOD. Seriously one of the best tapas places I've ever been. Milk braised pork shoulder is so tender that it just melts in your mouth. Also, octopus is delicious, tender and juicy. I tried their famous bone marrow for the first time. You put bone marrow on top of a piece of bread with salt. So delicious! I first thought it would be brand-new and mind-blowing taste, but it tastes like 'Gomtang,' Korean traditional bone marrow soup. But still good lol. They also have a great wine list. Our server was really attentive, even though it was really busy."
"This is a great spot in Chicago. They serve mostly tapas style sharing plates - everything we ordered was delicious. We ordered the chorizo filled olives, the pig plate - comprised of cured meats and cheeses, the bone marrow, but the winner of the night was the duck. It was incredible."
"Would definitely come back. Fun and lively atmosphere with attentive and friendly service.Dinner for 2 included the famous pig ear and kale dish, razor clams, milk braised pork shoulder, broccoli dish and bone marrow smear. Only 2 of the 5 dishes stood out as items we would happily order again. Definitely some hits and misses but I'd love to come back to try some other dishes though.FOOD:Pig ear & Crispy kale with fried egg and pickled cherry peppers: surprisingly delicious! I was expecting a giant pigs ear but it was a fun and inventive way to introduce crispy pig ear to a dish. The pig ear was cut thinly and fried to bring salty, addictive crunches to this dish. The kale was crispy and well seasoned, adding a smoky green depth, along with the fried egg adding richness and the pickled peppers brightening the entire dish. The dish seems quite small at first but the flavours are so bold that you only need a little bit to go far. Overall, 4/5.Razor clams in lemon parsley sauce: SO GOOD. I ordered it twice. The razor clams were fresh and tender. The lemon and parsley sauce complemented the natural juice from the clam very well. If you like shellfish, you will love this dish. 5/5The milk braised pork shoulder, although very tender, was too salty  - it seems like it was left to marinate in a brine for too long as the saltiness permeated the meat (not just on the surface area as if too heavily seasoned). There was also a lack of texture with just the mashed potatoes and a gravy to complement. 1/5.The broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy dressing, again, was too salty with the seasonings overpowering the actual roasted broccoli taste. I absolutely love anchovies as a flavouring but this dish does not work. A veggie with a stronger flavour may have worked better to hold its own with the dressing and garlic..maybe asparagus, which is in season right now. 1/5.The roasted bone marrow with herbs dish was disappointing. Although it was a very large helping, the bread that came with it was charred too much which overpowered the bone marrow flavour. The bone marrow itself could have been roasted a bit more for a stronger flavour and better dining temperature (its slightly cold temp made it hard to smear compared the the buttery bone marrow I've had in the past). The parsley, lemon and caper side was refreshing with the heavy marrow and bread but, again, the base flavour of the marrow was lost compared to these stronger components. Overall, 1/5. Look to Bestellen in Toronto for great bone marrow if you're ever in the area.Overall, I enjoyed trying these new dishes and would like to come back to give the menu a more extensive taste."
"Although the restaurant was noisy and tightly arranged it created a fun atmosphere. The staff was great and attentive.The menu is pretty extensive and our server had great suggestions. We left feeling stuffed.Since its tapas the server suggested about 2 plates each. Probably would have been ok with 3 total since we shared. So full but so good!We shared: 3 cheese and 3 meat platter, foie gras, crispy kale with fried pigs ears (my dogs would be so jealous), fried stuffed olives, and an espresso pannacotta dessert. All super delish that I can't pic a fav!"
"We were visiting from Phoenix for a weekend and, based on Yelp reviewers, the purple pig was on our list of must-trys. We relied on our waiter for recommendations and he nailed it. Everything was amazing. Olive oil poached tuna with quail eggsA selection of cheeses Pork ossobuccoTurbot with white bean puréeSicilian irisA couple glasses of the Marietta and some coffee with baileys Seriously good food and despite the crowd and the wait we were thoroughly entertained and didn't mind!"
Pig + wine = !!!The fact that they keep the outdoor patio open in the winter is also super cool.
"Was staying in Chicago for the week and saw this place had over 3,000 reviews and was rated tip top... So went by Tuesday evening and got a seat at the bar. The bar tender was outstanding, prompt and knowledgeable without being pushy or missing a beat. Had the neck bone gravy with Ricotta, was not what I expecting as it had more or a tomato flavor to it, but would for sure order it again.  Followed by the pork brains... Which didn't taste like brains at all and had a light sweet pea mousse flavor. The dessert (sweet ricotta and chocolate chip filled brioche) was the absolute best!Can not wait to visit again!!!"
"Five stars for the food, one star for the poor service. We waited for more than 40 minutes for our turkey leg, while people who ordered long after us had finished their turkey before we had ours. During the whole time, no one took care of us. Yea, no one filled our water, no one brought our requested paper napkins, no one even looked at us!"
"This is a hipster joint, there is no denying that.But to be honest, the food held it's own pretty well.  I had that ""Greek cornbread"" for my first course.  That wasn't spectacular... it was just cornbread with honey and feta cheese.  However, the mild braised pork shoulder was worth the price of admission.  Very tender and flavorful.   $12 for a pint of saisson? Eh, it's a trendy place in Chicago.  The service was excellent.  All in all, worth a visit."
"The service is great, the wait time on a Sunday afternoon was only 30 minutes and they call you when tables are ready so you don't have to wait there.Appetizer worth getting: the fried pig's ear with egg and kale. Amazingly delicious. The Sicilian Iris dessert was also delicious, and warm, but unexpectedly only very mildly sweet. Should have been sweeter to be categorized as a dessert."
"My friend and I came here to hang out and have a few drinks at the bar before our dinner reservation somewhere else.  This was right across the street from our hotel, so very convenient.  The last time I was in Chicago, I tried coming here, but that day they had some issues in the kitchen and their equipment didn't work, so the menu was extremely limited.  That day we ended up going somewhere else.But I've been wanting to come back and I'm glad we did.We sat at the bar and while we were there on a Sunday, we didn't have to wait at all.  We snagged some chairs at the bar right away.  The bartender was extremely nice and helpful, making some great recommendations on wine.We also ended up getting the mixed charcuterie plate of meats and cheeses.  Everything we had there was so fantastic.Sadly, I can't judge their dinner, since we didn't stay for that, but from what I saw on other people's plates, I almost wanted to cancel our other reservation.  The total bill was a little steep for what we got, but I think it was well worth it, because not only was it delicious, it's a Chicago-must, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  I will definitely come back here if I end up in downtown Chicago again."
Yummmmmmmm. Try the whipped feta. To die for.Waiting for service and no ability to make reservations makes it tough. But the space is trendy and the food is fun.
"First of all, thank you Coleen our server. You were busy and still made time and were accommodating Food was a 3.5-  veal steak and lamb shoulder were a bit over sauces and saltyBest was the pork neck schemer and themilked pork shoulder We had manhattan a but thiers was too sweet. Stick with wines."
"We found Purple Pig on Yelp, they had great reviews so we figured we'd try it. It was so good that we had to go twice in one week. First time was on a Friday, and the wait was going to be at least 45 minutes for 2. After 15 mins of waiting, we lucked out, 2 seats opened up at the bar so we were able to get the open seating. We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, the Octopus, and the Milk braised pork shoulder. Everything was delicious! So good that we had to go back. The 2nd time, was on a Monday so we walked right in and got seated right away. We tried the Foie Gras & Pork tenderloin with bacon appetizer, the Pig's ear with crispy Kale and the Turkey leg. Once again, so good! I wanted the squid stuffed with prosciutto but they were out, so I had the Blue Prawn & Pork sweetbread sausage instead, which I thought was just OK. Probably my least favorite out of everything we tried. I would recommend everything I mentioned above, besides the sausage. They are also a tapas style restaurant, so don't expect big portions (besides the Turkey leg!). The only downside is that they don't accept reservations, so on the weekends wait times can be extremely long especially for big groups. Worth the wait though!tripadvisor.com/ShowUser…"
"Back up, vegetarians. The Purple Pig is for meat lovers.Loved:- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. If you didn't know better, you'd think you were eating really thin, curly, crispy fries.- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. So deliciously rich, and it really just melts in your mouth.- Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde. The octopus was chewy but tender, and it had a nice smokiness that I really enjoyed.- A pork belly special of the day. ""Soy"" was the only word I remember our server saying. Super savory and therefore, delicious.Liked:- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. First time eating bone marrow! It's got such a mild flavor that it was hard trying to come up with words to describe it. Even though it comes with bread, I preferred it without it because the buttered bread was a tad overpowering, though the salt and parsley we were instructed to top the bone marrow with complemented it better.- Foie Gras & Membrillo. Tasted good but I felt like there was too little foie for the size of the toasted bread they gave us.OK:- Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. They tasted like chicken teriyaki if I'm remembering correctly. Fine but not very interesting.- Burrata Pugliese, Grilled Kohlrabi, Apples, Mustard Greens, Crispy Speck & Beer Agrodolce. This was the blandest of the tapas, but then again, I've never been a fan of mozzarella.No Go:- Lobster Tail and Morcilla with Apples. What few chunks of the lobster tail they gave us were good, but I'm putting the morcilla specifically in the ""no"" pile. Everyone agreed it tasted like spice cake, and we later learned it's because the blood sausage was mixed with an apple pie spice mix or something similar that I can't remember. It was just weird.Overall, great service, good pacing between all our tapas, and delicious meat and seafood dishes. It's no wonder this place is so popular."
"So once again I don't eat pork/pig, however I would eat at the Purple Pig every day for the rest of my life if I had to. Started out with the charred cauliflower, followed by the octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes, let me just say delicious, tender, mouth watering are all understatements. Following up with the chicken thigh kabob and wagu beef, outstanding does not begin to describe nor does any other adjective in the English language the taste and experience that these dishes will give you. Hard to believe you can come to a place and no matter what you order everything is beyond your expectation of greatness. While in chi-town go to THE PURPLE PIG."
Excellent food but need to take off a star because of extreme saltiness of several dishes.
"If you are into trying unique foods, this is a place you need to experience- house cured meats, pig ear salad, roasted bone marrow with sour dough toast, beef tendon chips, pork fried almonds, and pork pâté.  Tasted awesome, several people around us ordered these after seeing ours.  They have more normal fare, but why order that when you can experience something unique?"
"One of the few places in a city like Chicago that has so much to offer, which I go back to more than a few times.The braised pork shoulder, dear lord.The turkey leg confit, again, *moan*.The rabbit roulade, little salty for my taste, but glad I ordered it!The foie gras with roasted lentils, again salty for my taste, but I liked the combination.The chicken thigh kebabs, meh. Quite honestly, I'm biased. Never came across better chicken kebabs than those made in cities across North India, and Kolkata.And my favourite of all, the house made sausage. I stopped eating the mass manufactured ones ages ago after I discovered that what goes into them is largely non-meat portions of the animals. I knew I'd love this one when I saw the diners next to me order it, and hell yes! Everything about that hot dog, except the bun, is fresh, and solid good, real, wholesome food!"
Food was great! Great atmosphere and different food. Would recommend this place and come back next time I'm in Chicago!
"Do expect a long wait at this place, if you did not make a reservation. While you were waiting, you can enjoy some wine and relax on the benches outside. We ordered a lot of food:- salt & vinegar beef tendon chips- razor clams w/ oregano, lemon & olive oil- pork neck bone gravy & Ricotta- fried pig ear salad w/ crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg- milk braised pork shoulderMake sure that you came hungry. All items were must try. The service was awesome! The ambiance was trendy."
"Wow, was it good. After a cold day, walking around town, I decided to drop in. Considering they dont take reservations and the waits are usually lengthy, I took the risk anyhow.  We were told the wait time would be about 60 - 90 minutes. In all, we were sat in about 15 minutes. The place was packed, music jammin and the vibe was excellent.We started with a great Spanish bottle of wine. For food, we began with the Chirizo stuffed Olives (Delicious), follwed up with the crispy pork ears (on point) and finished with the Brussel sprouts (The best Ive had). The service was very knowledgeable, courteous and attentive. Cant wait to return."
"Cheese, Wine and Swine, a bit of  a line!Of all the places I visited in Chicago, this was my favorite (and that is saying a LOT!)My girlfriend and I went in for a late tapas round/dinner on a Friday night during December. It was quite chilly so the heated coat roam is a great start to the evening. There was indeed a wait for a seat, but it only took around 20 minutes, so it wasn't horrible, especially given how popular The Purple Pig is.We sampled the Fried Pig Ears with pickled cherry peppers, Eggplant Parmesan balls, lemon Panna Cotta, Blue Cheese with fresh figs and toast, topping it all off with an Old Fashioned. If I lived in Chicago, I would definitely make this a staple of my weekend. You can go in for a full meal or share a small plate and a drink with a date. It is in a great location and the crowd and ambiance are quite enjoyable. The restaurant feels like its own community, encouraging conversation between guests of different parties. It was a very unique and welcome experience."
"I really wish i could gave more stars! Food: GREAT.. AMAZING.. its the spot! Location: Perfect! Service: one of the worse i had in a long time. My significant other and went here on one of the 1st warm weekends in Chicago. We expected it to be packed and we understood that. We got a table right away and it was busy and our server was very helpful and on point with the service.  Then once our food arrived the level of service from our server became shitty. We never really saw him expect when he kept forgetting for bring us our drinks. Not once Not Twice but Three times. However, people who ordered more than one bottle of wine seemed to have his attention. To top that all off he forgot put one of our orders in and they ran out of that dish. Well if you placed the order two hours ago you could have told us you didn't have it anymore. Didn't even say sorry or anything.  He gave us the check and proceeded to help those who seemed to have ordered more food and wine. Maybe we will try this restaurant again. Food was great .. service could have been better."
"Meat. And so much more. A must stop every time I'm in Chicago. Try the fried pig's ear; sounds weird, but can't be missed. I always get a charcuterie board as well, and while I know my cured meats, I'm not great with knowing my cheeses. The staff has always been very helpful with pairing cheeses to my meat selections."
"The ambiance, food and wine list are worth the wait. The wait staff is very patient in explaining items that may seem a little weird. Always a five star experience!"
"The one hour wait was definitely not worth it. We wanted to try this since there was so much hype. They don't take reservations, so I recommend you go put your name down and they will call you and you can go do something else while you are at it. We tried the Bone Marrow spread, I almost gagged but my friends liked it. Our server was nice, and the plates we got were ok. Nothing out of this world."
"We came with four people at around 8:15 on a Friday and ended up having to wait an hour to get a table, but it was well worth the wait. Everything on the menu is built to share and comes out as soon as it is prepared, so everything tasted fresh and delicious. We ordered around 10 dishes, but some must-haves include the razor clams (we ended up having to get a second order), the gyro, the turkey leg, and the octopus with green beans and potatoes. I cannot recommend this place enough. It was an extremely memorable dinner"
"Loved the food here and OUR server was amazing! (Can't say the same for a few snoody waitresses eyeing our table to leave and another male server who made some very rude remarks to our large party - for that, minus 1.5 stars)What we ordered : Shaved Raw Summer Squash : Amazing! Slices of squash and zucchini marinated in salt water to make the squash crunchy and mixed with lemon, basil, and arugula. Charred cauliflower : Average. Tasted like any cauliflower thrown in the oven with lemon sauce on it.Roasted Bone Marrow : Amazing. This dish came with a few baguettes to spread the bone marrow on. Like butta!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder : BY FAR my favorite dish of the night. I'm not a huge fan of pork but this was amazing. SO tender and soaked in a milky mashed potato type of sauce. ORDER IT. Scallop Spiedini : The chickpea aoli was good! Almost had a hummus taste. Scallops were really goodWagyu Sirloin Tip : Very tender but forgettable. Served with soggy pieces of cabbage and beans. The wait seemed very long. We had a large party of about 10 for a bachelorette party but they sat one guy in between all of us because it was bar seating. I'm pretty sure he felt awkward sitting between 10 girls but the food is just THAT good"
"Got here 10 min after they opened, and the restaurant was full. We were put 3rd on the wait list for a table. Turned out to be an hour wait since we got there at the time everyone had just been seated. It was poppin, probably also due to St. Patrick's Day Saturday celebrations.Bar is first-come-first-serve, but don't get your hopes up. There aren't any places to wait for a bar space without getting in the way of the waiters. Barely any walking space, but it's chill when you're seated. But when another party starts eyeing the same bar spot as you, even though you've been standing there for 45 minutes... It's like fighting for a parking spot, damn.They were out of the bone marrow... One hour after opening? Cmon guys.... :'( maybe next trip to Chicago I'll get a taste, whenever that'll be.Must try:Crispy pork ear was on point; perfect combination of crispy, salty, sour... The kale appealed to the California girl in me.Foie gras: I've only had Foie gras once before and wasn't impressed but the one here was delicious, spread on bread with bacon and capers. YummmPork neck bone gravy with ricotta: recommended to us by some regular customers seated next to us. Rich, but tasty.Milk braised pork shoulder: um, delicious. So tender it falls apart in your mouth. Perfect with the mashed potatoes.Lemon Panna Cotta: nice light ending to the heavy meal.Could pass: Fried chorizo olives: olive taste completely overpowered the chorizo.Greek cornbread: good concept, but it was way too soaked in honey.Overall yummy, but careful not to over-order, as you can easily reach that point where the food becomes too rich/salty. Order strategically."
"There was a two hour wait, had just come straight from the plane and was very hungry. The appetizer was really great. We had the fried pig's ear, it was crispy and delicious. I got the chicken thigh kebabs and they were very well seasoned and the fried potatoes in tzahazti sauce completed the dish perfectly. My sister got the tenderloin and was very hungry. She was expecting a really big dish because they had brought it to our table before they put it in the oven. It was the size of two plates before they put it in the oven. Afterwards, it was half of a plate long andthe sauce on top was very bitter. My other sister got the milked pork shoulder and it was very good, but very small portions. Coming from Texas, we expected more. It was very crowded. We sat at a communal table where I lost feeling in my legs. Not coming here again, wouldn't recommend it."
"Unique selections and new twists on old favorites make the Purple Pig one of the most fun spots to eat in Downtown Chicago.If you are staying at a hotel near here, this is your lunch spot.A extensive cured meat and cheese menu make this a great place to just grab a drink and relax with friends even if you aren't looking for a full meal."
"You rarely go to to a restaurant where you see the owner getting down and dirty doing the actual cooking . This place is the exception. Jimmy Banos Jr. handles the heat and served up some innovative items. I've seen the elders in my family suck the bone marrow out of the bones like it was a shot but he prepares the bone marrow as a spread. Put it on the bread. Add some sea salt and top it off with a refreshing herb salad. Delicious! We also had a calamari salad, beets with whipped goat cheese, wagyu beef with cannelini beans and horseradish, turkey leg and finished it offf with desert. Everything was amazing! Even the best reviews can't give the cuisine justice. You'll have to try it for yourself!"
"SOO-EE!!!Calling all things piggy including myself.  Like the city of Chicago the Purple Pig pays homage to the old and the new; modernized old world wines dominate a list that pairs perfectly along side modern interpretations of classic old world dishes.   Best part, it's almost all about the pig.All dishes, except soups are meant to be shared.  Portions are large.  Two per person is sufficient.Easing into things?  The Pig Platter, a selection of classic salumi including lingua agro dolce (calf tongue), cacciatore, coppa di testa, Catalonian fuet, jamon serano, prosciutto did San Daniele, Prosciutto di Parma, tartufo, chorizo, lomo, and coppa.  Eat it with your fingers.  The warmth of your hands releases the fat and aroma making it even better.Top props to the fried pig ears.  Served in a pig head dish, uber crispy, thinly sliced pig ears served with deep fried crispy kale, tangy pickled cherry peppers and topped by a sunny side up egg.  Break the yolk, mix it up.  Heaven.  Great texture, even better depth of flavor.  A swig of any wine further brightens the palate for the next eagerly awaited bite.The pork neck rillette is the perfect smear.  Perfectly cooked and pulled with a great, sweet, and very pronounced pork flavor.  The right amount of pork fat is reincorporated back in to make the dish creamy and spreadable.  Aggressively seasoned and pairing perfectly with the earthy ""mustardy"" tang and sweetness of the accompanying mostarda.  Finally the bone marrow.  Simply broiled, topped with a bright, vegetal parsley and caper ""salad"".  A squeeze of fresh lemon and tinge of what seems to be grape oil creates the perfect foil to the rich, creamy marrow.  Spread on a piece of toasted baguette; done.Service is Midwest friendly and attentive.  Courses are well timed, plates and utensils changed regularly between shared dishes.Very well chosen wine list.  Great selections from Spain, Portugal, Greece, France, Austria, and even Croatia.  All from winemakers producing ""new style"" wines.  Zero American wines.  Low markup.By the numbers, 500 Michigan Avenue, one lunch, two friends, four incredible dishes, two bottles of wine, two hours, countless raves."
"Perfect for a solo diner. You get seated quickly. Food arrives at amazing speeds. You don't feel awkward because there's communal seating so it feels like you're dining with other people. The girls next to me even struck up a conversation which was so nice! Service was incredibly attentive.I just wasn't wowed for some reason. I think my expectations were raised too high from reading the previous reviews. I was expecting this place to make me re-evaluate my relationship with food, with life, my place in the cosmos - alas no. Every dish felt like there was some element missing. Except for the chocolate torte - that was divine."
"Between all the ""fatty"" food & the ""skinny"" service not sure if I will become a frequent customer. The Beets salad is good but I would pass on the Croquet Monsieur. Had to send the cold toasted bread back :-("
"This place is such a hidden gem.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I'm an extremely picky eater especially when menus make things complicated, I guess you can say I like things basic.  Well there is nothing basic about this menu and I wouldn't have it any other way.  I was in Chicago for 4 days and literally ate here three times, that's how good it was.  You literally can't go wrong with anything on that menu."
"I didn't know what the hype was all about but honestly the food wasn't what I had expected....I was thinking for it to blow my mind after seeing more than 2000 reviews but meh all I can say is that it's not a bad place but not a place I would come often...the items on the menu were so detailed I didn't even know what the heck I was ordering until I asked the waiter. It's a really loud place but the decor is pretty neatMind you we waited 50mins and on July 5 it was a 2hour wait. Food items are tapas so sharing style, got 3 items: milk braised shoulder with mash (like brisket and little bit too salty), pineapple rib tips (like honey glazed ribs.......altho the pistachio sauce was good), blue shrimp wrapped in sausage (nothing special, neat how they stuffed it in sausage)Great service and great atmosphereA one time thing for me"
"A great place to grab some tapas! The only drawback was the waitress who was selling the food as she was making a commission. She was kind of pushy and hardly came around our table. Another thing I ask her if they had craft beers and she said yes! But it turns out they didn't. I believe we got a rookie waitress. Other than that, the food was really good. We ordered the Blue Prawns Sausage and the Pork Shoulder from a la plancha section of the menu. I was impressed with the flavors the food offered. I will be back to try other items from the menu. I recommend this place. Two thumbs up! #SeñorFood"
"This was our first meal after getting off our early morning flight so let's couched our experience in the fact that we were already famished.  It was a concierge recommendation so there was no preconception or prior knowledge of this place.It is inside an office building through the lobby in the back so you know it's already cool because only people in the know, know it's even there.  The only sign with their name is the one on the door when you've already arrived.This place is all about textures and flavors and that, if you're an adventurous foodie is what you seek and live for.  We started off with salt and vinegar beef tendon chips.  Having had braised beef tendons which are gelatinous delights,  these crisps are surprisingly light and crispy, reminiscent of fried pork rinds, only lighter.  The salt and vinegar gives the tendons its chip appeal that will have you craving a second bowl. (By the way, the beer and wine list is extensive and you can't go wrong if you like pairings with your food.  We just had a sparkling Muscat and red and was fine with that throughout our meal.)The portions are meant to be shared but are not as big as full entrees.  Think tapas.  You would probably be good ordering 3 or 4 dishes for 2 people.Next was a special antipasto of 2 fried  chicken wings, chicken feet and a cock comb.  We cut into a piece of the fried comb which was rich and very gelatinous but not much flavor.  The chicken feet was a little over fried (and nothing like the Chinese dim sum dish I so love where the fried feet is meatier and is then braised with garlic and black beans).  Next was the familiar fried chicken wings with the bones conveniently removed and the skin doused in a hot sauce so it was basically buffalo chicken wings but without the drumette part of the wing.  Unfortunately, the wing was a little pink and underdone.  When we told the waiter this, with military precision, he immediately whisked the dish away and brought us a whole new dish cooked perfectly, in spite of the fact we already ate the other pieces on the plate.  Our waiter gets high marks for his no hesitation, deep apologetic, great resolution to a slight snafu in our meal.  The next dish of pork jowl or jowl bacon, frisée and tomato on brioche toast with a sunny side duck egg affectionately called ""JLT"" was rich and delicious.  Jowl meat is tender and a great alternative to ubiquitous pork belly.  Apparently jowl bacon is more common in the south than in the northeast.  Think it will gain more popularity as more of these farm to table restaurants put it on their menus.We added an extra dish of the Wagyu sirloin with cannellini beans, escarole in a bone marrow vinaigrette topped with fresh horseradish and we're glad we did.  At first we were hit with the pungency of horseradish as our waiter set the plate down but when eating the dish, it had the right amount of kick and was not too overwhelming.  In spite of it being Wagyu (which was probably domestically raised since the dish is only $20) parts of the beef were tender and parts were a little chewy which I attribute to the nature of the sirloin cut.  This is a perfect lunch size portion if you're eating alone but good eats if you're sharing and having other dishes.  I like the escarole and slightly al dente cannellini beans but could not appreciate the bone marrow due to the vinaigrette. Leave out the vinegar and let us savor all the protein richness it was meant to have.Finally, we could not not resist ordering the Sicilian Iris, a fried brioche with a warm ricotta and chocolate filling.  See the photos, you'll understand.If you like pork and willing to eat any part of the pig, the Purple Pig tries to give you a variety from pork foie gras to fried ears, tails etc.  Go with a group, try everything and have fun with it."
"Dos:Meat and cheese plate with wineDuck proscuitto and hot sopresatta were good meats. Duck was fatty but good and the sopresatta was a salami like meat and was deliciousCheeses: Uniekaas gouda (which I thought was going to be softer but wasn't), parmigiano,  mobayPork shoulder which is very small in proportion but when you order too much food, it's enough. Pictures make this shoulder look HUGONGOUS but it's not!Pork was seasoned well and mashed potatoes were on fleek! This one came out last and I was SO full and didn't get to enjoy it as much so I was sad!Fried chicken- flavor was goodBombolone for dessert (donut holes). What more can you ask for?!Cappuccino and lattes to go along with dessert. Don'ts:Pig ears - nothing special. Mixed with kale..meh..kinda bland. Squid. This looked amazing In pictures but did not follow through. I could've lived without it. Flavors weren't doing it for me..I would've tried the bone marrow but since we got in around 1030 pm it seemed a bit heavy. Enjoy!"
"Rainy day in Chicago?Sneak in here! (They'll take your number and call you when the table is ready- so you can go shopping at a nearby store or mall.)Then, after you settle in at either a shared table or single table- you MUST get the fried pig ear, crispy kale, and egg. It is bomb dot com. (It's like chicharones). The bone marrow is not bad. The seafood something is creamy, tomatoey, cheesy, and delicious. Next time we'd get a meat and cheese platter. Great food.Cool atmosphere.Great service.A+"
"This is a great place to stop by while in downtown Chicago. A great selection of small plates to get a good taste of all on offer. I had the bone marrow salad, fried kale with salty pigs ears and rounding it out with an extremely intense lemon panna cotta. It's  a really viby place and can get busy buts it's totally worth the wait."
GREAT restaurant with a vibrant scene and great shared plates BUT they don't reservations so it's super annoying to try and go here. They should get on the bandwagon and offer reservations via Opentable!!
"I really hate the communal seating.  Hate, hate, hate it!  That said the food is out of this world.  One of my GF's works at a hotel in the area and takes clients here often so she has an in with management and when I went with her we got a high top table.  Woo hoo!We tried a bunch of stuff and my favs were:Chorizo Stuffed Olives (Yes, please I'll have another)CalamariWhipped Feta with CucumbersCheese selections (to die for)Cured meats (I love a good cured slice of meat, I should be a fattie with a cholesteral count of 600+)This place is always packed so go with an open mind, be hungry, plan on a super long wait, expect to eat with stangers and enjoy the fine fare!"
"Came here for lunch on Thursday since it was close to our hotel. We showed up right when they opened. So glad we did because the food was great. My favorite was the razor clams - so sweet. I could've eaten a couple of orders of those all by myself. We also ordered the salumi platter, pig's ear with kale, foie gra, mild braised pork shoulder, and pork steak. The pig's ear with kale was a little salty, probably due to the kale. Our server was super nice and the whole wait staff was very quick and efficient with clearing out dishes and refilling water. It got pretty packed later on, difficult to maneuver chairs around because there was no space. People would walk by and they would hit your chair because of the limited space. But overall, we the food was delicious and staff was very friendly. Highly recommend - if you love pork."
"Great service, big wine menu, delicious food. Came here and sat at the bar. This place definitely fills up fast. Loved the wine menu ( can't even call it a list) and the 8 oz wine option. Tried the deviled egg, the butternut squash with browned butter, safe and pumpkin seeds, and the pork neck bone gravy and ricotta spread. So much food!  All so savory. I would have loved to try dessert, but I'll definitely be back!"
"Wow- heart attack artery clogging stuff! I cannot fathom eating this kind of stuff at 11am but came here cause it's one of the highest rated places in Chicago. I came 15 min before open and there was a line out to Michigan avenue. I guess I can see what the hype is about but this is really just not my kinda taste. Pig ears, duck pate, grilled octopus was just all so greasy and heavy. This was not one of my favorite meals in Chicago."
Absolutely great food accompanied with excellent service. Casual place with out of this world food!
"This was definitely on my Chicago To Eat list! We got here around 8pm on a Thursday but we weren't able to get a seat around 9pm for the three of us. We ordered:-Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg-Pork Liver Pate-Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesI'm not usually a big fan of octopus because I usually find it too chewy and tough but the octopus here was incredibly tender. This was by far the best octopus I have ever eaten. The other dishes that we ordered were also very good. The pig ear in the salad added a nice crunch. The pate was smooth and had a bit of a smokey flavor which I didn't expect but enjoyed. The pork shoulder was moist and very flavorful. Overall the meal was very enjoyable - good atmosphere and great food. I wish that we were able to be seated earlier, but that's to be expected at such a popular restaurant."
"I don't get what all the fuss is about. If you're a tourist, about to pay Chicago a visit soon, continue reading. THIS along with Girl and The Goat were on my list of ""must-try"" before moving to Chicago, and I can say if you're Asian from LA, these two restaurants are on your ""must-try"" list as well. Let's face it, we're all part of the same bubble, so the recommendations are the same. Food is good, but there's absolutely nothing unique. You can get the dishes here virtually at any trendy New American restaurant in Chicago and elsewhere. Dish names may vary, but all in all, they taste about the same and concept is the same -- small tapas great for sharing. Purple pig doesn't take reservations, so you have to wait. Wait on average is 1.5 hours. Bone marrow, good but extremely fatty. Desserts, good. Drinks, skip. I've been here 4-5 times now b/c every visitor wants to come here. I've backed out of dinner with some people just because i'm so sick of coming here and it's usually a hassle to get a seat. Try something more unique, such as Bavette's (pricey though), or even Little Goat, which is a lot cheaper.Warning: do not take reservations. Wait is typically 1.5-2 hrs. Very loud and packed inside."
"Really well done tapas style restaurant ... Octopus was AMAZING!!!Pretty amazing non US wine list.  Inside is a bit loud with many large tables and kinda an actual Spanish bar feel.  Great selection of cheeses.Long wait for larger groups, but I would definitely come back."
Great food and service. I prefer the inside of the restaurant to the patio outside. It is a popular place but for good reason.
"Wow finally. We probably put our names in three or four times before this, but our stomachs usually gets best of us, and we opt for a restaurant without the two hour wait. This time, I was determined to eat at Purple Pig.One word? Savory. Doesn't matter what you read, you can't be prepared for how heavy your meal will be. Each dish is laden by butter, bacon fat, deep fried grease and rendered grease. This can get burdensome towards the middle of the meal - when your stomach tells you that you can still fit some more food into your mouth, but your arteries is beseeching you to please stop eating."
Oh my goodness the food here is delicious! We ordered 3 things and they were all great. The calamari was light and refreshing. The crispy pig ears had a nice kick. The pork neck gravy smear was so flavorful. I don't think you can go wrong with anything off the menu! Service was also excellent for how crowded this place was on a weekday afternoon. Our waters were always refilled and plates cleared promptly. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!
"Went here for the first time the other weekend and loved it. My 2 friends and I split the beets with goat cheese, pork liver pate, bone marrow, and two desserts and were totally stuffed without breaking the bank. The pate was a little disappointing, but the rest of the dishes were spectacular. I highly recommend the beets as well as the lemon panna cotta. We were at a communal table, which ended up being really fun - we sat by a couple there on their anniversary and had a great time chatting with them. I think it really added to the experience. Their outdoor seating area is awesome.Service was decent. Our waitress was pretty absent for a lot of our meal, but the busboys were on point and really helpful. Definitely going back!"
"The Purple Pig is the place to be any night of the week, which is why it's so busy! Named as one of the best new restaurants by Bon Appetit in 2010, the Purple Pig has clearly remained a favorite restaurant. I went on a Tuesday night and even being one person, I had to wait and swoop in to take a coveted seat at the bar. It's loud, bustling, but totally worth it for the extensive wine list and tantalizing array of tapas. I tried the burrata pugliese with crushed fava beans and strawberries and a summer squash ribbon salad with crushed hazelnuts, pickled blueberries, and grated cheese. Both were exquisite. The first dish emphasized the creaminess of the crushed fava and smooth buratta with crunchy accents from the crispy cauliflower. The salad highlighted the freshness of summer produce with sweet nuttiness from the hazelnuts. They were light, satisfying, and totally worth the wait. Be ready to wait when you come, but come you should!"
"Great meal!  I was visiting Chicago for a conference and came here with some colleagues.  We lucked out due to the rain, and got seated right away.  Between the three of us, we shared the roasted beets, burrata, stuffed olives, pork tenderloin, and a cheese plate.  All were delicious.  The best, though, was the warm Greek donut with the chocolate and mascarpone filling.  I could eat that on a daily basis.  In all, highly recommend this spot!"
"COMPLETELY WORTH THE WAIT. This place is so good, reasonably priced, and so satisfying in every way. Perfect for all types of eaters and you literally can't go wrong with any of the items. My tops:MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER - if you can't tell that shizz is written in CAPS and when its in CAPS you damn well know it's the bomb. I took the effort to capitalize all the letters so you can read it and be like oh baby that sounds delicious. you're welcome. I don't even have a description - just trust me. it's good. it will change your life and make you want pork shoulder for breakfast lunch and dinner. Fried Pig Ears - do not be afraid young padawan, for tasty is the ear of the pork it is. This dish has kale, and bits of jalapenos to give it a yummy kick!Bone Marrow - this is an obvious one, bone marrow is the bones answer to bacon and if you don't like bone marrow then more for me because i literally tried to shove my tongue in the little crevices to get all that goodness out. don't you judge me....Honorable mentions:Brussel SproutsChorizo olivesBurrataDon't be a lame-o and just wait an hour...or two, you won't regret it - I promise :)"
"Wow. The food here is amazing. The service was wonderful. Our server was very attentive, as were all the other servers. Each course was independently amazing! Loved the Parmesan cheese, the cornbread, and the pork shoulder. Also loved the white sangria. Would recommend this to anyone visiting for a day or two! It's a tapas-style, but each plate has good portions. Wonderful to share and discuss around the table."
"The place is really crowded to the point you can't talk to people in front of you. The foods are average. It's overrated. The octopus is really really sour that it doesn't taste like octopus. The pork is good though. Don't order the wagyu, it tastes like spam."
"Great Mediterranean food. Lots of foreign wines and beers.  Always crowded, and the meals are family style, meant to be shared.  A must try if in Chicago!  Very popular."
"I was really looking forward to try this place based on Yelp reviews.The decor, service, and the plating are nice.The flavor profile of the starters, entrees and dessert were off. The combination of flavor was flat. I can't recommend this over-priced place.You will probably have to park at a private parking around there."
"Went here for dinner one week night. We made the major mistake of not making reservations. We ended up waiting for about 30 mins for a table and bar seating was ""take it if you can get it"". Once we were seated, we immediately ordered a bottle of wine from Spain (the exact name fails me) and the bone marrow - Another dish that I was inspired to taste by Anthony Bourdain. We also ordered the milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes (twice), the lemon panna cotta for dessert with a nice hot cup of coffee to wash it all down. We also enjoyed great conversation with a couple that was in town from Seattle. The place is really quaint and most of the low table seat no more than 4 people. The tall tables seat at least 8 people. I would suggest making reservations at least 2-3 days ahead of time if possible. The restaurant sits back off of Michigan Ave, so if you're not paying attention you can walk rt past it. This place is very romantic and cozy. The waiters are very knowledgeable when it comes to pairing wine with the food and they are appropriately attentive. Try and take public transportation, if possible."
"its not a trip to chicago if you dont make a stop at purple pig!we came here on a thursday so the wait wasnt too bad. you're also able to put down your name and number and they will give you a call which worked out because walking along magnificent mile was soooo beautiful!anyways... on to the food. among the two of us, we tried the crispy pork ear, milk braised shoulder, jowl ""JLT"" and the pork tripe and feet dishthe crispy pork ear with fried kale and pickled jalapeno was my favorite! the JLT was a fun play on the classic BLT. the jowl was super tender but was a littleee big too salty for me. the milk braised shoulder was pretty good too but its not something i can eat too much of because its very dense and heavy. the pork tripe and feet dish wasnt something we expected. it was a stew that wasnt anything too special and the bread that it came with was burntoverall, im a fan of purple pig! it gave me a great chance to try out different parts of the pig and cooked in different ways that i normally dont get to eat."
"Nice little tapas style restaurant tucked away in the middle of a busy shopping district.  Venue is cozy with some small tables, a picnic table area and some outdoor seating.  Make sure you get there early or expect to wait at least an hour.Overall, the experience was a good one.  The staff was attentive and made some good recommendations for a first time diner and checked periodically to make sure I was enjoying the food.I had the fried manchego cheese which was outstanding.  There was a sweet sauce to cut the saltiness of the cheese and was the perfect balance and starter dish.  So long fried mozzarella sticks, we had some good memories.If you're not an adventurous eater, then you'll enjoy these recommendations.  The pork shoulder with creamy mash potatoes were great.  The braised and flash fried pork belly was sweet and savory, melts right in your mouth.  Finally, we had the turkey leg and that was fall off the bone tender and succulent.  I'll never look at a turkey leg the same again.  I'll be back again the next time I'm in town."
"This establishment really focuses on flavours and textures harmonizing together to create a memorable dining experience unlike any other. If you love pork, cheese boards and fine wine, give it a try !"
"This is a fantastic restaurant and a must hit in Chicago. It's not cheap, and the price tag almost cost it a star, but it's an upscale place and it delivered on quality.The atmosphere was great, but part of that may have been my happiness to escape the Hoth-like weather outside for a few hours.Food was fantastic.P.S. - I would sell my grandmothers diabetes medicine for another plate of those razor clams. Holy sh** are they good."
"First stop on our first trip to Chicago was The Purple pig...We walked in without reservations because they don't take them and the wait was 45 minutes. Luckily 2 seats became available by the bar and we jetted towards them lol. Zero wait. SCORE! I needed alcohol quick! I ordered the flippy cup.... WARNING after one drink I was already feeling buzzed. Fantastic. I love Chicago! I love The Purple Pig! I love flippy cup lol! Deviled eggs- think of a fried hard boiled egg encrusted with their deviled egg mixture. It was genius. I loved it! NEXT!Fried Manchego cheese- GENIUS! It came sitting atop a delicious membrillo sauce (like a sweet jam) that made love in your mouth. Why have I never had this before?!Prosciutto Stuffed squid- it was OKAY. I had higher expectations. The prosciutto came minced and looked like ""stuffing"". It tasted good. But nothing wow. It came with this green sauce which was very acidic...overpowered the whole dish. But don't be discouraged to try it...I ate it all. It just wasn't my favorite.Pork shoulder- yes. Yes. Yes. Perfectly cooked pork. Melted in your mouth like butter. My favorite dish hands down. The pork came resting on top of mashed potatoes which were delightful. Order this. Would def visit the pig again!!"
We had a blast easting at the Purple Pig which was jumpin on a Wednesday night at 8:30.  The wait wasn't as long as they said it would be but it didn't matter since we were able to get drink service outside.  Great beer selection and coffee!The dining area is great for sharing with big long tables.  Some might not like sitting next to strangers but it didn't bother me.  Our cheese and meat choices were all excellent.  I honestly don't remember what we had.  Our hot plates had a greek/mediterranean vibe.  Each small dish is easily shared by 2-3 people.  Everything was excellent and we stuffed ourselves to the point of not being able to eat the amazing dessert options.  Next time.
"First things first- you will likely have a wait. We had a 2.5 hour wait, but you can give them your number and as long as you can be there in 10 minutes they will hold your table. We put our name in, went shopping, went back to our hotel room (Marriott on Mich ave) and when we were called, made it there in 5 minutes. It worked out perfectly. Don't be scared by the absurdly long wait- it's worth it. Excellent food. Small plates here- they bring the food out as you order it, in no particular order. Wonderful selection of wine and again, the food is wonderful. We had the butternut squash, cauliflower, fried Brussel sprouts, chicken, and meatball sliders. To finish, had sweet potato ice cream and the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Couldn't say which item was better. Prepare to spend some money- but it's well worth the splurge. 5/5 stars."
"Yum, Yum, and Yum!Pork Fried almonds, Fried Manchego, Feta & Cuc Bread & Pork Shoulder!Delish!!!"
"When I sat down and started reading the menu, I was pretty close to leaving. After some taunting by my friends and a reference that I might be an uncultured person, I was forced to stay.I wish I could remember our waiter's name...regardless, we just asked him what his favorite items were on the menu, and ordered every single one.The food was exceptional, service was exceptional, and tapas style dining is awesome! Highly recommend the ossobuco (not sure if their menu frequently changes like some tapas restaurants)"
"I was stuck eating here with coworkers since I was visiting Chicago for a week and didn't want to leave the group for this particular meal. I figured they would have something on the menu. I asked the waitress if they had any vegan, gluten-free options and she gave me a grimace... which I replied to with ""Any sides? Veggies? Probably the wrong place to pick, obviously. I don't have to eat, I can just get a drink."". She insisted that they did have something, took a menu, and preceded to cross out ALL the things I COULDN'T get. Although I noticed they did have PORK BRAIN (mmm, might as well eat a dog's brain since pigs are actually even smarter) and PIG's EAR (how is this even appetizing??), I was trying to be nice and find something so I didn't seem like a burden to my coworkers. The waitress comes back with the menu and has practically EVERYTHING crossed out, which I expected (she didn't give me a chance to stop her) and found entirely unnecessary. I would've sincerely appreciated her efforts if I thought she was trying to be nice, but when it's obvious that you're trying to make a point, it becomes pretty absurd. DESPITE all of that, I decided to order the one vegetarian eggplant dish, sans bread and cheese. Admittedly not knowing much about Italian cuisine, I was expecting a hot dish, which came out to the table as cold. The flavor was fine, but I still paid full-price and didn't feel satisfied with the amount of food. Our table was off-put by the fact that we weren't allowed to split our checks, and it took almost the entire hour for my coworker's pig shoulder to arrive to the table. The waitress comped it, but he never got his food since it was too late to eat it. Not to mention, water is $6! Pretentious place for pretentious people (excuse my bias, but really??). No thanks."
"I realize that many day jobbers cannot pull off our 3pm Monday lunch scenario easily, but it was perfect. And you get days off and seminars dontcha?Wound up downtown for a meeting that ran late and when we realized it was after 2:30 started sorting through where it was too late to go, and maybe too early. But Purple Pig is JUST RIGHT at 3 pm on a rainy Monday.We were seated immediately with choices inside and on the patio which we opted for. We had already reviewed the menu online but asked our wonderful server for his recommendations and John immediately recommended all 3 of the dishes we had in mind. We ordered the fried pig ear and the calamari salad to start while we waited to decide if we wanted one or two more plates. We were also watching out for salt levels based on Sarah's experience.I'll just tell you what we particularly liked about these 2 popular plates. The chopped fried pig ear on top of the fried kale with a sunny side egg up SOUNDS like it would be really greasy, and it was not. Our pig ear was fried so dry, not burnt that it seemed to somehow absorb some of that and still be yes, amazingly like a cross between tasty crispy bacon and fried onion crisps. More substantial than we were expecting with the kale and the egg, and not a salt bomb but it would be easy to see how it could be. The Pickled Cherry Peppers also add acid and cut any greasiness. Just amazingly tasty.I love poached cold calamari ring salads and the Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios was light and fresh. We were trying to figure out what the dressing was, lemon and what? John said JUST lemon when we asked, so I'm sure they are marinating the calamari in something maybe a light vinegar?  It also had very thinly sliced basil and I'm going to go home and practice slicing my radishes that thin. Where is that Xmas mandolin?We went with the Milk Braised Pork shoulder as our next plate and were ready to order more. We received a larger than expected maybe 8 ounce fall apart melt in your mouth portion that was plenty for us (remember we were there on a VERY slow rainy Monday). Couldn't really identify the sauce on top of the small mashed potato cushion other than delicious. Again, not peppery, not too salty, moist, rich complex, no knife needed.We aren't that big a desert eaters, and somehow ALMOST forgot the Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche}, orgasmic. Do it. Could share to 3/4 if you have some control.We were struck by how much the staff seemed to enjoy each other, and appeared to enjoy serving. I don't see that very often. It wasn't busy, maybe 1/3 full but we had several really interesting conversations with John and one server in particular Peter, and friendly check ins from several more. It IS tight in there and even when less than 1/2 full pretty loud for a rainy afternoon, and we were on the patio.NO bar report since we had mass quantities of iced tea and escaped with a bill including tip of around $57. We weren't stuffed, and didn't want to be for a 30 minute swim back to Ogilvie. We got soaked even with umbrellas and saw many a drowned smiling conventioneer. Ever hear that tornado siren midday?  Eerie.Do it, check Purple Pig off your gotta try it list but look for that day off if you can.And watch out for the salt levels if you dislike oversalted as we do. With all these interesting cured meets and cheeses you may want to steer away from all saltier choices. Plus it's a fascinating menu, and the bar looks great; it is easier to drop a $100 here than not. Thanks for the salty heads up Sarah."
"2nd time at this place. Enjoyed the food and wine. Had the beets and goat cheese, pig ears and kale, pork tenderloin, pig jowls, pig shoulder, pate, and shrimp crisps. Also finished with a 5 piece cheese plate.As the food went, all was good. The Stars were the salted pork tenderloin. They bring it out to the table and break it apart from the salt covering to show you the herbs inside. My favorite from this time and last was the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. It was so tender that it just fell away. They only give you a spoon to scoop it as it is so tender. If you go for a cheese plate, I would suggest that you tell them to pick something for you that you do not normally see at other places. They have a wide selection and it gives you a chance to to try some cheeses that are not seen everywhere. Small downside is Seating can be a bit  tight here. They maximize space, but fatties should stay away.The one real disappointment is the employees use the guest restrooms. I would be fine with this, but they do not understand that the customers should go first. I waited behind 2 employees in line to use restroom. This is just basic customer service.Overall, great place, with friendly service and good food."
This place was really good. We had a bunch of different items off the tapas menu. Definitely go with the bone marrow and foie gras.
"We came around 530 and experienced no wait! Very innovative dishes with an amazing wait staff. The pork steak was cooked so perfectly (tender, full of flavor). The fried man heck was served with a sweet jam, which was a great flavor combo. I didn't love the stuffed squid, it was ok, but not worth the $15 for 3 small pieces imo... Something just didn't work with the black sauce it is served on. Great ambience and attentive staff."
"Highlights:Pork Liver PateCheese Plate & Cured MeatsBoudreauxPigs ears and beef tendon chips were average at best.  We had a party of 4 and grabbed the last spot at the bar.  This placed was packed on a Sunday around 5pm.  No reservation needed for us, but I think that's because we were lucky.  I would come back for their smooth and tasty pork liver and delcious bordeaux collections."
"First time today-showed up early, trying to beat the rush-arrived at 3:45-and had to wait 20 minutes for a table for 2. It was worth it, though! Food was fabulous-i would go back and order everything again! The goat cheese with strawberry rhubarb preserves and sea salt was my favorite!"
"Went to this restaurant in May 2013 - it was alright. We waited for a very long time at the front doors, about 25 minutes, and were seated outside underneath a very large party tent. It was pouring rain and the tent had little leaky holes but IMO, I don't mind rain. It actually enhanced our experience. What really made me feel uncomfortable was the clothing attire. I hadn't realized this place is more upscale so I definitely felt out of place in my strapless top, jeans and summer sandals. The wine list is extensive and the glass I ordered was nice - pricey, but nice. I can't recall the name.My date and I split a few mains (they are actually very small so order a bunch to sample) and I had a salad. It was the ""Castelfranco, Sunchokes, Hazelnuts, Apple Cider Vinaigrette"" salad. I became very ill and remember how unpleasant this was coming up. Not sure if it was something I ate, but still unenjoyable. The other foods included the pork shoulder, quail, and waygu sirloin tip; all were delectable.I would return wearing nicer clothing and skip the salad."
"What can I say that people haven't already said about how awesome and amazing this place is?!The Cured Meat Plate -- worth it if youre a big meat head, the chef provides about 5-6 different types of meats with about 5-6 slices each. It is complimented with some peppers and jam.The Chicken Kabob - by far my favorite. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. Be careful because it comes with a good amount of fries, so do NOT order the side of fries!! (waste of money)Turkey Leg - goodness gracious, I have never seen a turkey leg so big!! The turkey leg was overwhelming, both in size and flavor. Definitely a dish to share and not eat alone. It is cooked and drenched in this delicious savory sauce however I needed carbs to go with it.Ahi Tuna appetizer -- bleh! Not worth it, too sour, too small and didnt go well with any of our dishes.I have to say that my serve did suck, we ordered 9 dishes between 5 people because he said the dishes were meant to be shared, however it was way too much and we didn't finish and had to leave the remaining food there.This place is amazing, however once every 6 months is enough."
"Second time to Chicago, second time to Purple Pig.  We went on a Sunday at 11:30am and there was no wait.  My friend got a delicious bloody mary and I got some bubbles to start.  We followed with burrata, fried cauliflower, and pork shoulder.  All of it was simply amazing! Every bite was better than the one before it.  This is a must stop if you're visiting the city."
"In Chicago for the weekend and after walking around the city a bit I stumbled upon Purple Pig and figured I would give it a shot as I had not had the opportunity to do so before.  There was a decent wait but we placed our name down and within 30 minutes received a call during prime lunch time. The weather was beautiful so we decided to sit outside on the patio. It was quite noisy but I could see that being different based upon the groups that are dining at the current time. This restaurant is tucked away in between two buildings in an alley. The servers were all very attentive and were friendly offering suggestions on the menu. This joint is definitely not meant for any vegetarians and they do not mess around with the amount of meat dishes. It was a weekend so we went with a bottle of white wine which was pretty delicious or maybe it was just the heat. We decided to go with the famous Bone Marrow, a sausage and veal dish. The sausage dish was good but maybe a tad over salted?? But an interesting dish given the ingredients. The bone marrow was definitely good but maybe a bit too fatty for my taste? I realize that's probably the purpose but just seemed a bit over the top. The veal dish was cooked well and I enjoyed it. All in all it's a hip place and definitely a great environment honestly im not 100% sure I am sold on the food. Still an OK joint for me."
Food was great.. tasty and fatty.. when i asked the server what veggies they had - he pointed out mash potatoes - hehe.. Food was delicious!!
"Vacationed to Chicago and everyone raved how The Purple Pig was a MUST. They don't take reservations and we came shortly after they opened so there wasn't a wait.We ordered the shaved brussel sprouts (amaaaazzzinggg!), calamari (we thought it was fried, but it was served cold, so we weren't a fan), pigs ear with crisped kale (surprisingly had lots of flavor), the roasted bone marrow (according to everyone, it was their must order dish, but it was oily/greasy, we couldn't eat it all. If the bread wasn't buttered, maybe it would have tasted better, but I felt like I was slurping straight up fat!!), milk braised pork shoulder (good, but on the dry side), chicken thigh kababs (LOVEEEEEDDDD it!), and ended it with a panino con Nutella (was also good, the banana tasting balanced it well).Overall, the dishes were enough to share, and were decently priced. Maybe $$-$$$ stars in my opinion."
"The food here is both unique and in my top ten brunch places of all time in the city. I can't get enough of their pork liver patte, bone marrow or their sweetbreads! The wine list is bar far one of the better ones I've seen in the city at the overall restaurant price point they fall under. My only gripe would be for the host stand to do a better job at predicting wait times. I've been to multiple brunch places that have always been right on key or pleasantly surprised us with having a table ready earlier; purple pig has not met their given times yet though the food has always been worth the wait. **fyi huge touristy spot so go early if you want to avoid the inevitable."
"I've been here with friends two or three times already. By pure luck, I've never had a wait but I generally go right as they open and I have early dinners out of habit so I manage to always beat the rush. I always get the bone marrow and pork shoulder when I visit (they're must haves!). I've also tried the eggplant parmesan balls (they were decent), the lamb steak (pretty good), the chicken thigh kebabs (very good and I liked the smashed potatoes that came with it), and the turkey leg confit (oh my god it's delicious and the portion is huge). The service is always pretty good here. You can dine inside or on the patio but it's always a little crammed due to the popularity and size of the space. The prices are about what you'd expect for a popular tapas restaurant and I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."
I'm a little disappointed with this place maybe my expectation was too high but the pig ears and the octopus were just mediocre for me. I only enjoyed my el nido red wine other than that I don't think I will ever be back
"Really crowded... Had a great beet salad, pork belly, and cheesecake. Convenient location"
"This place gets one star for the service. Which is unfortunate since all the food items (literally 80+ dishes) that came out in front of me while I was sitting at the bar and being ignored by my incompetent and inattentive server Santos for 45 minutes between my two starters. I wasn't very hungry at 6pm so I ordered roasted beets with goat cheese and pig ears with a glass of chianti to start, and while the first dish came out within 15 minutes (perfectly prepared beets with velvety whipped goat cheese and crunchy pistachio pieces creating a pleasant contrast of flavor and texture) I completely lost appetite while waiting for my second appetizer to arrive. I watched at least twenty of the same dish being prepared in front of my eyes and served while patiently waiting, and ended up calling the manager to inquire about my order. My server checked in with me once during the entire evening after taking my order (and an hour from then), asking if I would like another glass of wine. How about my food...? Turned out there was an error (I believe no order was put in). Completely unacceptable. This is while he is chitchatting with the customer next to me, still with zero apologies and a lot of attitudes. The manager apologized and brought another glass of wine, and the chef recognized an unhappy customer, which brought back some hope for the restaurant and recovered one star. When my pig ear finally came out it was probably pretty good, but I wasn't in the mood to enjoy it any longer - too bad. It's very rare for me to leave a restaurant angry, especially with decent food. If I ever come back here then I hope Dan is my server. He was busily handling orders from the kitchen to the tables in the dining area and still gave me the best personal recommendations with a smile as I sat and watched various dishes leaving the kitchen for 20 minutes before my server introduced himself. Dan also noted me getting upset after waiting over half an hour between two small plates and asked if everything was okay even though he wasn't responsible for me, and apologized for the wait after checking on my order with the chef. He was the saving grace of the evening for me. Overall, the food itself would get a solid 3.5-4 stars, and I really hope they work on improving the quality and consistency of service. If I were the chef or the manager, I would not be a fan of watching an initially happy customer turning angry over the span of two hours while sitting at the bar two feet away from the chef and watching the kitchen operation, with a rating of the restaurant dropping from four stars to one in real time. I sent a text in the beginning of the night ""I can't wait to come back to try all these wonderfully smelling items on the menu"", which was later followed by ""completely unacceptable service, not returning anytime soon if ever."" Dining is an experience, much more than just the food itself."
"I was in Chicago for a conference, the location was within walking distance from my hotel and other attractions in Chicago. Came here on a Monday for lunch... and then same day again for dinner. There was no wait for lunch and about an hour wait for dinner. It's probably of the best restaurants I've ever had the chance of trying. The Purple Pig is Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. The food is meant to be shared amongst the table. For lunch, I had the Foie Gras & Pork Tenderloin Torchon w/ Bacon, Crispy lentils & Rhubab ($14) as a starter. It was my first time trying out Foie Gras-- I can't say I can comment too much on the flavor of the Foie itself as the sauce that is drizzled on the plate definitely overpowers the entire dish. The texture, however, is pretty much what I expected-- soft and creamy. Next, I got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes ($15) as recommended by my server-- BEST THING EVER. I don't know how long they braise the pork, but it was soooooo tender. It was slathered with a butter roux and was served over a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. If you had to get only one thing on the menu... THIS IS IT.For dinner, I was still pretty full from lunch but I was determined to 1) get drunk2) order some more of their smaller platesI tried-- 1) Salt Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio vinaigrette: I'm not a huge fan of vegetables. at all. I'm a meat eating machine. But this dish made me a convert. The Whipped Goat cheese paired perfectly with the beets. 2) Brocolli w/ roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs & Anchovy vinaigrette : Don't be scared of the word ""anchovy"" on the description-- it doesn't taste fishy at all. I do prefer the beets over this, though.3) Chorizo Stuffed Olives: This one was the most... ""meh"" on the menu. It'd probably go really well with beer. It was served over a bed of greek yogurt. 4) Pig's Ear w/ crispy Kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg: Who knew pig's ear could be really really tasty? (I did, that's why I ordered it!) Anyway. The pig's ear is deep fried to a crunch-- if someone didn't tell you what it was, you'd have never guessed it was Pig's ear. It gets busy at night it seems-- there was still a huge wait as I was leaving the restaurant. For a better experience (without the wait), come during lunch or before the dinner rush."
"The Purple Pig definitely lived up to its hype.. LOOOVED it here :) Came here early afternoon to lock in a table and was lucky enough to grab a seat half an hour later! Lines kept building up during our dinner here.We ordered so much food for two people but we ate pretty much everything.. haha5/5 for everything below except for the ones I've specified:JAMON SERRANOThe ham was excellent.. their bread was what surprised us.. How'd they make it so crispy without being that oily? So good!CHARRED CAULIFLOWERThis was the rare veggie dish we ordered to ""balance"" our meat intake of the evening. 3/5WAGYU SIRLOINA must order. The wagyu beef was too good.. We were planning to come back the next day for just this dish itself..MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDERSo soft! I couldn't get enough of the fatty part..PORK JOWL ""JTL""A must order. The duck egg made everything so creamy - different textures for each part of the combo (Crispy pork jowl, creamy duck egg, crunchy tomatoes & lettuce..)LEMON PANNA COTTABest panna cotta I've had in a while.. I'd recommend this to anyone that doesn't like their desserts to be too sweet. A very savoury finish to the meal.SICILIAN IRIS 3/5Our waiter recommended this dessert for us.. We ordered this after the panna cotta and thought this was just ""meh!"" in comparison! haha"
"Fantastic meal at the Purple Pig last night. In town for a few days and this place caught my eye here on Yelp. I mean who doesn't love a swine-filled menu?! We went on a Sunday evening, which apparently turned out to be a god-send because our 1-hour quoted waiting time turned into a quick 30 minutes, just enough time for a glass of Prosecco. The majority of the seating is at communal, high-top tables. Not my favorite setting, but it works for this place. Here are the must haves :- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - Simply Amazing - Unlike anything i've ever had in my life. The Ear's are so thin and crunchy, and the yolk from the egg runs all over them to make a great thing better.- ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - Recommended by the staff and it was well worth it! - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - A must have here. It's their signature item, and trust me, you won't want to leave this place without trying it!- Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki - I know it sounds super boring, but the chicken is so juicy and the skin is so crunchy. The Tzatziki makes it.The Wine List was very good as well. They had a nice selection of European wines (think Spain, Greece, Italy, France). We stuck with our usual Italian's (Rosso di Montalcino, followed by a Brunello) and they were both tasty and very reasonable priced!At the end of it all, the bill was about half of what I had envisioned in my head. And we were stuffed!Service was very attentive but not too over bearing. They gave us time to sit and enjoy our food and wine with no issues.If you're in town, do your self a favor, try this place !"
"We stopped in here for lunch after our boat tour of Chicago and it was a pretty good meal. Fast and friendly service, busy and trendy atmosphere. I must warn that their flavors are hearty and STRONG so make sure to order a plethora of varying dishes. Ie: Not all heavy / salty meat stuff!Final Verdict: If you're in the area definitely give it a try!"
A little bit on the pricey side but food was great! Came here with 4 friends for lunch on a Saturday and took an hour to get seated not bad for prime time. Everything is meant to share and they had an extensive wine list. Definitely recommend the turkey leg and bone marrow.
"The service both times I've been here was exceptional.  The food is interesting and fun. Today, a few dishes were too salty for my taste, but it was an overall win.  I love tapas style dining.  I'll definitely be returning.  Here's a quick rundown of today's meal:Duck confit shmear:  delicious and flavorful, the cherry and peach (?) jam went great with it, one of my favorite plates of the daySmash potatoes: I thought they sounded ordinary, but they were awesome!Beets/goat cheese: NOPE!  I had this the first time I dined here and it was great, but today it was sickeningly salty.  None of us could eat more than a few pieces.  And beets and goat cheese are two of my favorite ingredients. Turkey leg: delicious, moist, fall off the bone, very flavorfulWaygu beef: tasty, but again, too salty.  The horseradish on top and the greens/beans on the bottom saved this dish.  I'd give it another try...Dessert!!! I had the affogato with chocolate/hazelnut softserve.  Yum!!!The cheese and meat boards are excellent too.  They have some fabulous choices.  The wine selection is nice as well.On a street crammed full of chain restaurants, why pass this place up?  Check it out!"
"I don't get it.... why does everyone love this place? I was in town for only a couple days and as a foodie, that meant that I only had a limited amount of meals to try the best restaurants of Chicago.  I was debating between Girl and the Goat and The Purple Pig... I ended up picking the Purple Pig because of the convenience of the location.  Needless to say..... I should've went to Girl and the Goat.I understand that the tagline of this place is ""cheese, swine and wine"" and I should have been prepared for some salty dishes, but I literally felt like I was eating a block of salt... Seriously, high blood pressure, here I come.  I am so confused as to why this place is so popular.  The interior and vibe was cute - I liked that we were able to share one big table with other people.  It definitely made my dining experience better than it would've been if we were at our own table.  We ended up sharing dishes with the couple next to us since the menu is pretty extensive, but all the dishes were just meh.We ordered the salt roasted beets to start because of the rave about it on yelp.  Beets are beets... it wasn't anything spectacular.  I ended up ordering the pig ear with crispy kale - again, was too salty.  My sister enjoyed it, but I literally could not finish it so she ended up eating it.This is a great ""wine, cheese plate and cured meats"" kind of place, as their tagline implies.  I wouldn't order any prepared dishes in particular unless you love salty food."
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before, but let me rectify that omission. We had some friends in town this weekend, so we got to enjoy The Purple Pig the best way....with lots of people (6) so a plethora of dishes could be ordered and shared! (I have to say...with only a couple of people, The Purple Pig is not your best restaurant option in Chicago.) We had great service, and some spot-on food suggestions from our server (kudos to Josie). My top-3 choices kept changing throughout the meal, but, when the dust finally settled, these were my top dishes of the night...though there were quite a few others that almost made the cut. Can't go wrong with any of these:1. Pork Liver Pate (Smear)2. Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette3. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (mix it up for best taste!)Also, be aware they don't take reservations, but they will take your cell phone number when you arrive and call you when your table is ready, so it's a perfect opportunity to grab a drink nearby while you wait. Oh....and it's shared tables...so break out of your shell and chat with the strangers you're sharing a table with...you might get to sample what may turn out to be your favorite dish of the night!"
"It was OK. My buddy and I came at 4pm on a weekend and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. We had already eaten not to early before, so we were lookingWe ordered the the pig ears and the bone marrow. Both were underwhelming :( :( :( I was expecting so much more; I was waiting for my stomach to change conformations to accommodate those crunchy pig ear slices coated in sweet vinegar, for that glistening and bold bone marrow dribbling down my chin. But nothing happened."
"I freakin love this place so much. Seriously one of my favorite small plate restaurants. Fantastic combinations of flavors. I have never had a bad thing here, some of my favorite items: raw Brussels sprouts salad, beet salad (comes warm), bone marrow, pork flat iron steak, and really everything else that I have had here."
"Purple pig is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. We went around 3pm so the resto wasn't packed and the atmosphere was really nice. We ordered pork shoulder and it was the best decision ever lol the pork was tender and incredibly delicious. However, the portion wasn't THAT big so we finished super fast. Would highly recommend u guys to try it!!!"
"""Try and Try again"". Our cute host said upon entering for lunch since he remembered us from the previous night quoting a :45 min wait. Two kids in tow wouldn't be able to handle that wait so we came back for lunch and were seated immediately. Vibrant open kitchen bustling from the main dining room and service was fantastic. Look up at your frommage & foodie cheat sheet. We dive into foie gras spread (cuz it's illegal in Cali) and the beets with whipped goat cheese. Foie melted on the hot toasted bread and the beet dish with pistachios were UNBELIEVABLE !  Our kids loved the crispy pig's ears and the meatball slider. Our 3 year old picked through the crispy little bits as if she was chomping on bacon. I tried a Basque Rose which was light, fruity, and perfect for lunch. The 80s music was pumping in the background and the table was a big long community table. Great mix of tourists and biz power lunches in the room. It's definitely a place that we wanted to experience as out of towners."
"I had the broccoli salad and the potatoes. They were so good, the flavor was excellent. And the gordonsola dip of the potatoes was great too. Service was quick, informal, and good"
Get the JLT. Best. Sandwhich. Ever!
"My fiancé and I went on a mini-vacay to Chicago and we heard so much about the Purple Pig restaurant that we had to try it for ourselves. Our experience was mediocre because of the following reasons.1. The line is too too long! We waiting 2+ hrs to get a table. We literally put our name down on their waiting list, walked to the Sears Tower, hung out there for 30 minutes, took a taxi back to the restaurant and we still had to wait 15 more minutes.2. If you've already had different parts of pork as your regular cuisine options growing up, you're really not missing much. Pork ears and bone marrow, been there, done that. I prefer to eat those parts of Pork prepared in Asian dishes (more flavor, easier to eat).3. The space inside the restaurant is small and the noise level is loud. After the long wait and the noisy atmosphere I just want to eat and go. The Purple Pig is def a good place to try exotic pork dishes if you've never had it before. But if you've pretty much ate all different parts of the pork before, skip the line and go experience something else!"
"Simply overrated. We ordered beef marinated with vinegar, taste like crisps rather than a real meal. Completely disappointed"
Fun menu with lots of things to chose from. Walked in for lunch Thursday afternoon around 12 and the 2 of us were seated at the bar with no wait. Waiter was helpful and knowledgable with great reccos that we were glad we followed. Stuff neither of us would have ordered on our own but were fantastic. Peas and bacon - sounds weird but very refreshing! Pig neck bone gravy smear - slow cooked in tomato sauce ands other goodies then meat taken off bone and more tomato base and homemade ricotta. Delicious. The boys wagyu was tasty. Instead if listening to the guy and getting pork secretto went with pork blade with honey glaze which was way too sweet for me and a hugeeeeeee portion. Good wine learned a new one: navarra yum!!!Unconsciously located off michigan ave next to a Bank of America. Had we not heard about it through friends would never have walked in.
"I'm pretty sure I've tried every single thing on the menu at one point in time. Despite the ridiculous wait time, we keep going back for more deliciousness. They don't take reservations and weekends get really packed. Bone marrow is to die for; super juicy and fatty. Cheese selection is amazing. Must try the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. The combination of crunchy, salty and gooey is mouth-watering. Drinks are spectacular; definitely ask for recommendations from the bartenders. They know what they are doing! :)"
"More tapas than mediterranean, a bit pricey even for downtown.  3 tiny slices of cheeses for $15, dinners somewhat reasonable if you choose right ($10-$20).  The sausage is literally a sausage on some tomato sauce.  The chicken shish kabob is just about the right portion, and has a delicious crispy skin, potato wedges, and a yummy taziki sauce."
"I went to the Purple Pig on a Thursday afternoon, and we got seats right away. Great vibe, great date place, but you are seated really close to your neighbors -- an Avec-like feel to this place. This place is so similar to Girl and the Goat except slightly less expensive, slightly not as good (Stephanie Izard is tough to beat), and with pig as the focus instead of goat. Pigs Ear: 4/5 -- Excellent. Chicago really showed me that sunny side up eggs go well with meat (think of Au Cheval's cheeseburger and Girl and the Goat's Pig Face). While quite flavorful, crispy, and delicious, I did feel like there was an overload in the kale. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs and Sea Salt: 4.5/5 -- Served with bread. The bread itself was not the best I have ever had but pretty good nonetheless. The bone marrow is melted and can be scraped with a knife (like butter) and put on the bread. Very intriguing dish, and I have never seen anything like it. Pig Shoulder: 3.5/5 -- There is a lot of hype about the pig shoulder. Cheesy mashed potatoes with pork blended with milk. Unfortunately, I found the dish good but not mind-blowing. It definitely could have used more flavor. Octopus: 5/5 -- Like Yelp's description of a five star restaurant, this dish was as good as it gets. So much flavor! I am not huge of veggies (as you can see from my dish selection), but I ate every last green bean and devoured the delicious potatoes (yes, potatoes are vegetables). Almond Dessert: 4.5/5 -- Apologies for forgetting the exact name of the dessert, but very solid dessert! The cake was hot and fresh, and I had never tried something like the jelly served with the cake. Expect to pay around $40 if you don't buy alcohol. This place really deserves a 4.5, but I'm bumping it up, because (1) there are so many more things on the menu that I want to try so I will be back and (2) I just really want to give a restaurant five stars. Been too long."
"Very nice! My husband and I came here at 2:45pm on Saturday afternoon hoping that the wait would be shorter. The hostess quoted me 45 minutes  to an hour and called my cell phone exactly 45 minutes later. Since she took down my # we were able to wander around Michigan Ave a bit on a lovely October day. We were seated indoors at a communal table and was offered water right away.  The server also came over shortly to take drink orders and introduce the menu to us newbs. My over protective husband told the waiter I was pregnant and to let us know if there was anything on the menu I couldn't eat without providing the waiter with a list of restrictions.  The waiter was well trained and very knowledgeable as he knew to tell us that all the cheeses used in dishes on the menu (except the ones indicated with an asterisk on the cheese plate menu) were pasteurized.  Additionally he also pointed out the caviar as a caution item. Very impressive!We ordered the bone marrow smear, pig's ear, pork shoulder, and a meatball slider.  We also tried to order the fried deviled egg but they were out already! Good thing too cuz what we ordered was plenty for 2! We are pretty conservative eaters so I felt quite adventurous ordering the marrow and the pig's ear. Marrow was very fatty and a bit tasteless but really good once u put some of the parsley/onion/caper salad on it or dip it in the flaky salt. The kale and fried egg in the pig's ear were very good, as was the pig ear which was cut in very thin strips and fried crispy. Anything fried is delicious!! Pork shoulder was tender and heavenly,  I think they sold out soon after we got ours. The meatball slider was tasty too, the slightly sweet bun complemented the meatball well. Overall very delightful meal and service! One gripe is that there are only 2 bathrooms and they are unisex. For such a busy restaurant, this means there is always a line for the bathroom. It's a bit annoying when all you need to do is wash your hands before you dig into your food!"
I love everything here except that you can't make reservations so I get sad when I don't have a guaranteed seat!
Worth the wait! Favorite spot in the city. Milk braised pork shoulder and shmears for the win!
"The food was really good, but I'm deducting some points because of the seating. Granted, my friend and I were there right after work on a Thursday, but there were a few seats open at the communal table so they sat us there....next to each other. We aren't sure why they didn't seat us across from each other but it was really awkward and uncomfortable getting up into the high seats - I think it took about 3 minutes to get in them and scooted up to the table. We didn't see any hooks under the table so we just had to throw our purses down onto the floor - which was about a 2 foot drop down. If you go - be sure to get the broccoli with breadcrumbs and anchovies vinaigrette. So good! I also had their sangria which was pretty tasty!"
"I've had multiple people recommend going to Purple Pig while visiting Chicago, so I decided to come. Came on a weekday for lunch, but it was still busy! A really popular spot for people to come to. They don't take reservations and can get very packed during peak dining times. Fried pig ear: The pig ear was thinly sliced and fried. Didn't really taste much because it was so thinly chopped. It came with kale chips and a fried egg. The kale chips were super crunchy! The egg added a nice touch to the fried dish. Milk braised pork shoulder: Super tender meat and wasn't dry at all. Bone marrow: The bone marrows were huge. It comes with unlimited bread and salad topping. When you smear the bone marrow onto the bread and top it with the salad, it's great! The bread is nicely toasted and the salad makes it feel a little cleaner because the bone marrow can get a bit heavy. For me, all the dishes were on the saltier side of the spectrum. Maybe it's not salty for others but I am sensitive when it comes to salt. Other than that, the execution of the food was done perfectly."
I went here with a couple of friends since I always wanted to try this place since I pass by so many times. The restaurant is not that big and its tight in space. I must say the food is phenomenal which my friends and I order pork dishes. The service was great and the restaurant had a nice decor. I would definitely go back to this place and recommended to others since I have yet to try other dishes on the menu.
"Really loved our food.  We ordered the Fried Chorizo stuffed olives, the Pig's Ears with Kale and Fried Egg, and the Chicken Kabob and Smashed potatoes.  Everything was well timed and delicious.  It was really busy.  Ate on a Saturday at around 12:30 - had a 20 minute wait which was fine.  My only suggestion was their set up wasn't great - had to walk through a busy outdoor area to check in with hostess for a table and then return outside to wait.  Would make more sense to have a hostess station at that patio entry.  Just a minor thing.  Wait staff was superb.  Truly a team effort working to ensure smooth dining.  Would definitely eat here again."
"Got here on a Monday night at 4:45pm and was seated right away. We had heard from others that some have had to wait 3 hours for a table--that was enough to scare us into going in in the early afternoon to ask the hostess what time would be best for us to come in to be seated for dinner. They suggested 4:30pm to be seated by 5--we were worried for nothing!! I'm sure if would be different if it was the weekend. I'll start with the food, get to the service later.WHAT WE GOT:1) Pig ear with crispy kale and a fried egg: we agreed this was our favorite! Usually pig ear is a bit chewy and you get the crunch of the cartilage when you bit it---this was not the case! The fried pig ear with the sunny side up egg mixed in, the crispy kale, etc. was absolutely perfect. I'd love to have that for dinner as a stand alone!!2) Charred cauliflower w/ cornichons and parsley: good but not great. I don't think we thought this was anything too special.3) Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta: This was good, but again we felt like this was just a ragu--with some ricotta at the bottom. It was pretty filling though because they give you big pieces of bread (this is labeled under smears). 4) Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: mMmmm who doesn't love fatty bone marrow? Spread on warm, toasty bread?? Topped with herbs and sea salt??? We are big fans fo bone marrow, so we weren't disappointed by this dish (also a smear). 5) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: good but not great--the pork shoulder was salty which evened out with the mash. It was eh to me.6) Waygu beef cooked for 30 hrs with fois gras: I think this was a dinner special for the day because I can't find it on the site's menu! So good--beef was so tender and soft, and fois gras was perfect. It came with an arugula onion mix on the side.As a party of 3 we were way too full to get dessert :( but we did have the white and red sangrias--both equally yummy! SERVICE:Service was sooooo so attentive!! But maybe too attentive for our taste. Our plates were cleaned/replaced and our dishes taken away so quickly, there was no time to think. In addition, it almost made it seem like they were rushing us to finish our food because they had clean plates to give us. AND on top of that, we had only eaten one dish before they took away our plates to give us new ones. What??? I think plates are changed too often--it interrupts conversation and also takes away from enjoying our food at a good pace or having to interrupt runners to tell them we're not done yet, or that we are ALMOST done. Meh. :/ After the 3rd change of plates we were just thinking it was too much. TLDR: food is good depending on what you get; I think it's a bit overhyped; everything is very savory/heavy; service is attentive but maybe too much so. Still give it a shot and come early to get a seat!"
"I think it's overhyped.  It's tapas style and and a bit pricey for food that was good, but it didn't amaze me. I came here in weekday at 3pm and there was no wait. The menu was really extensive and we ordered the pork sausage with foie gras which was a spread with bread. It was enjoyable and good. The razor clam was inconsistent in portion therefore a few was bit overcooked and chewy. I was disappointed that it was such a waste, but the flavor was good. The famous pig ear with kale and egg. It looked tasty, but you won't taste much of the pig ear for it was deeply fried. You are really eating the batter.   It was a good concept and nice presentation. The wagyu sirloin was done medium rare as requested. It's unfortunate that it was overpowered by the sauce/compliment that's bit tangy and taste like vinegar. I really enjoyed the cheesecake with greek honey and walnut. The classic cheesecake was well dressed. Overall, I thought it was okay, good, but I wouldn't love it. I would probably go back but not worth the wait. I would definitely try something different."
"Very cool place and great food. The service was good as well. We got the cited meat sampler plate, chicken thigh skewers, and deep fried deviled eggs. All of this stuff was very good. I am a big fan of those eggs! For drinks we got the white sangria which was well made and very refreshing"
The positives about this restaurant were the atmosphere the restaurant had and bus boy service. It was lively and busy. Which made the feel of the restaurant very nice. The dude (bus boy) who kept taking our plates when we finished our apps and gave us our water was the best. He attended us more than our waiter did. He was always present and helping. I gave him a bigger tip than to our waiter.The negatives about Peppa Pig* was that the hostess (guy with glasses) was rude and wait service was nonexistent.
"I came here on a recommendation from a few people. It was a Monday night and the place was buzzing with people. We had a twenty minute wait, but we grabbed some glasses of pinot noir and waited outside in the cool night air. It was quite refreshing. We started the meal off with some jamon serrano and cheese, then moved onto the crispy kale and pig ear with fried egg which was very tasty. The milk braised pork shoulder was extremely tender. With my brother being a chicken eater the waiter recommended the chicken thigh kebabs, which were juicy and tender. We ended our meal with fried dough balls and honey, which was probably the least memorable dish of the night. Our experience here was fantastic and the wait staff extremely friendly. I'll have to try more dishes the next time I'm in Chicago."
"The food is great here. Loved the turkey leg! Delicious! The servers were helpful, and the wine was nice too. I don't have too much more to add.. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in chicago"
"So... of the multitude of places I tried during my weekend Chicago Foodie Crawl in mid-Sept, I would say the PP was pretty much at the top of the list (but not the #1 spot, more on that to come...)We walked over from our nearby hotel and showed up 15 min prior to opening on a Sat morning, knowing this was a popular spot.  There was already a short line, but we had no issues with being seated immediately (and per requested) at the bar so we could see the kitchen.My friend and I shared 3 things, 2 of which were amaze, flavor wise.  The two ""small"" plates (I say that tongue in cheek given the size of the marrow bones) were Pig's Ear off of the Fried Items list (w/ crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg) and Bone Marrow off of the Smears list (roasted w/ herb salad and sicilian sea salt). Hom Nom!Less amaze was the Octopus off of the A La Plancha list (w/ green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde).  Our server recommended it stating this was the best octopus she had ever had.  Nope, not even close.  Not tender in the least and totally chewy and tough.  Sorry, if you're going to set us up like that, make sure it's perfection when it arrives.It's still towards the top of my list, given the taste of the other 2 items and the warmth of Jimmy Bannos Jr to spend a 10 min convo with me speaking about our collective love of food (yo, is it just me... or is that a handsome dude? hubby, don't read this! LOL)"
"Food was amazing. Bar staff just as good - led me in the right direction. Would literally fly here from NJ to take my husband here for the food. Lee at the bar was awesome. If I do take my husband here after a flight, will they take a reservation?"
"What can you add to 2700 or so reviews?  Maybe the fact this was the first place for me where fried pig's ear, tripe (had to Google it - part of stomachache tissue) and pig's feet all reside on the same menu.  Same menu sitting next to an impressive wine list (sweet Riesling does compliment he crispy, salty fried pig's ear very well.  So does kale and an egg, sunny side up.  You mix it all up like a Korean dish.  Well, just ear, kale and egg, not the Riesling.)Tripe and pig's feet were somewhere in the stew/chili consistency, served with toasted bread.  Yum.  Roasted beet salad well complimented by goat cheese.This was one place you keep thinking - I must come back to try house-cured meats, artisan cheeses and bone marrow served right in the thick bone sawed in half.  And deserts.  Some other time... When I feel adventurous enough to brave the ""no reservations"" scenario."
"Second time here and it is officially my favorite spot. This time we had almonds, tendon, octopus with green beens, turkey leg, and marrow. And finished off with the Iris. Everything was unique and hands down delicious. Add in an excellent wine and beer list, and a great vibe, and there is just no reason to go anyplace else."
"This restaurant has one of the most interesting menus I've ever seen. The selections are unique blends of the usual and unusual. Each entree was a flavor adventure. The chicken kabob was like a party in one's mouth! And, they were very careful re: GF offerings. If you're in Chicago you must try it!"
"Definitely have heard great things about this place and it did not disappoint at all. Went late night Sunday and the place was packed which shows how good it is. Sat at the bar and ordered one of their great wines and razor clams which were awesome. Even though they were busy the bartender was very attentive and friendly. The bartender, suggested another wine that I really enjoyed as well, so decided to stayed for another. Overall awesome place with a really cool open kitchen. Will definitely head back soon!"
"4.5 stars for food! Three stars for service. My friend and I went to purple Pig around 6PM on a Sunday evening after it had rained, which was great because we only had to wait for about 15 minutes. (So lucky!) The reason I give the service three stars is that our waitress was incredibly slow. Yes, it was busy, but it almost seemed like she had forgotten us. It took her about 20 minutes before she even came to our table and asked for orders and another 20 minutes at the end of the meal before she picked up our credit cards to swipe, even though we were literally sitting right next to the cash register. (At the two person table in back next to the register and bathroom.) Also, they only have two single stalk gender neutral bathrooms, meaning that lines can get ridiculously long.As for the food, it was fantastic! We ordered the eggplant carbonara goat cheese smear, and it was sooooo gooood. Can you say foodgasm? I usually don't like goat cheese, but they made it so that it wasn't as ""pungent"" and spread it over the toasted warm bread. The eggplant carbonara sauce contrasted nicely with this, a little sweet a little tangy (almost like a tomato based past sauce) and cool enough that every bite was not only layers of savory goodness but of the perfect temperature contrast.We also got the cauliflower which was cooked to perfection. The cauliflower was just the right amount of crispy on the outside, and the dish itself was buttery and crispy with other contrasting vegetables to make it a little on the tangy and flavorful side.I was really disappointed with their wagyu beef tips though. The meat was tough to chew (which is opposite of what wagyu should be). It was like well done on the outside and medium rare on the inside so that eating it was like chewing through burnt edges and gooey middle. It was also on a bed of greens and beans. The beans were kind of too mushy and became like a paste. Very disappointed with this, but the other two dishes made up for it!"
"Wow. Wowie wow! I need to live in Chicago so I can live at this restaurant. Wine selection is top notch, prices may turn off some visitors, but not a seasoned big city girl like me. Only had one small dish as I had dinner plans elsewhere, it was the crispy kale and pig ear appetizer. It is served with a wonderfully sunny up egg. Would have loved a second egg to increase the wonderful gooey nature of the dish. Could eat this for the rest of my life and never want for anything else. Service very prompt and attentive! Go! Wait, and enjoy!"
"i have been at the Purple Pig several times and everytime I am on Michigan Avenue at dinner time, there is always an excuse to go there!!! I think I tried almost all the items on the menu. I am a huge fun of the burrata. it is just great although my Italian nationality makes me a biased customer :) I also love the bone... it is great!! and the caponata with goat cheese. I never thought about putting goat cheese before and now every time I do caponata at home, I add goat cheese.   the turkey leg is huge, if you order that, you need at most one other plate but it is not my favorite item on the menu.overall, definitely better thanThe Girl and The Goat, cheaper and you don't have to wait 6 months to get a reservation."
"This is a perfectly fine place. However, I came with high expectations, and was kind of underwhelmed. Maybe I just ordered wrong...every dish had a fancy description, but the end result seemed a little more routine. The ""Broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinegarette"" was pretty much a cheesy broccoli casserole. It was fine. The ""Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta"" was pulled pork, heavy on the sauce. Also fine.The ""scallop spiedini with local lamb's quarters and hazelnut tarator"" was 3 lukewarm scallops with an herby dipping sauce. Not my favorite scallop dish.Anyway, I'm used to being blown away by Chicago restaurants. This place is absolutely worth your time, but not quite what I had cracked it up to be."
"Bar seating is the way to go.  Shorter wait.  View of the kitchen with the chef orchestrating everything.  So much better than any other food tv reality show.It's not the place for a large group.  But maybe you can make reservation for large parties.  It's perfect for 2 so you can share some dishes.  I was dining solo.  Bar seating is always my option especially in an open kitchen restaurant.The wine menu is quite impressive.  Take your time and ask for a taste if you're not sure.With pig incorporated in its name, I thought it would be the right strategy to order their pork dishes.  Bread - doesn't come automatically.  You have to request them.  No charge but they do take up the grill space since they actually warm them up a la minute.  Amazing that they still do that.  Pigs ear and kale - not salad.  All fried and so good.  It's served in a big bowl with generous option and I couldn't finish which I am still disappointed at myself for not being able to finish.  It was so crispy and well seasoned you don't need olive oil or anything else.The milk braised pork shoulder was so tender you don't even have to chew.  The mashed potato serves as a good base and in a way sauce for it. Lemon panna cotta - light and not overly sweet.  Great ending to my meal.These are the staple items.  Order them is this is your first time.  I am looking forward to come with another person so I can order the bone marrow next time.Watching the kitchen crew prepping dishes the entire night was a priceless entertainment.  I didn't event check my phone once.  That's how good.  They care about your food.  The chef quality check all the dishes.  Don't try and interrupt them though.  At the end of the night, there was a change of the head chef and the new guy was much more relaxed and was actually checking his phone while working.  I am glad he wasn't the one in charge when I got my food.They have a lot of people workings.  My water is always filled.  Plates cleaned.  My waiter is attentive though it's hard to find him since I was facing the kitchen.  I actually forgot my wallet in my hotel safe and he was nice enough to not get upset or call the cops on me ( I left my mobile as collateral while getting my wallet).Can't wait to come back."
"It was a long wait for dinner. I think it took us 45 minutes to an hour. Was it worth it? Yes! The servings were like tapas so you get to try a few dishes to share. For me and my friend we ordered 4 dishes and it was filling. The servers are very friendly and accommodating, and knows the menu very well. Price wise? Reasonable. Drinks? Mostly wine and only a few choices of beer, mostly irish, scottish beer...i ordered the Belhaven (scottish beer) and it went well with my food...awesome tandem with pork shoulder and pork belly. Parking? Being in downtown, expect to pay a lot or just use thr train."
"So good that I ate here twice on my one week trip in Chicago! This place is packed during dinner time. We waited for an hour at 5:30 pm, but you can leave your phone number and they'll call you when they can seat you, so we were able to spend the one hour doing some window shopping at Magnificent Mile. If you come towards 11 pm, practically no wait. Ask for an indoor seat as the wind and rain can pick up and drench you outside. If you come with a group, it's easier to order a couple of plates to split and try everything. However, portions are on the sensible side so you can easily share a starter, entree and dessert(s) for two.Starter favorites:- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (do not pass up!)- Pork Neck Bone Rillette & MostardaEntree favorites:- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes  (do not pass up!)- Squid stuffed with prosciutto- Pineapple Glazed Rib Tips- Seafood Saganaki  (do not pass up!)Dessert favorites:- Sicilian Iris (do not pass up!)- AffrogatoIt seems like their menu changes a bit, though I can't tell if it is due to seasonality or not, as the menu changed between the two visits I had here...which were only 3 days apart.Service is pretty good and the wait for the food is pretty reasonable. Will be back the next time I am in Chicago!"
A really great find on Michigan Avenue. Fourth generation chef definitely knows what he's doing. Exceptional flavor and wonderfully fresh. Highly recommend the cheeses and the pork neck gravy. Sounds unusual but your mouth will thank you.Can be very busy so recommend you get there early. Good wine selection and customer service is top notch. Tika was taking care of us and she was outstanding. Wonderful evening.
"This a gem of a little restaurant. Very quaint, very busy, very tasty. No reservations, and the wait for a table at lunch during the week was 45 minutes. The bar is opening seating, though, so you may get lucky and snag a seat.They have a varied wine list with great options and a full bar on top of that. A good number of the bottles have glass, half bottle or full bottle options. For food, there a bunch of small plates to share and get a wide variety. All of the dishes we had were tasty, but the Sicilian Iris was the star of the meal. Desert isn't very high on my list, but a fried brioche ball filled with ricotta and chocolate was spot on. Left very full and very satisfied."
"One of the more unique spots in Chicago. The Purple Pig takes no reservations and is not kidding about the long wait time, but it's 100% worth the wait!Expect to try new foods and new preparations of old foods - try cheeses you have never tried and food you will want to go back to try again. Trendy and active scene with experienced wait staff who are willing to discuss the menu. The menu is for the adventurous - only go there if you like trying new things. Loved the atmosphere and the quality of their food is impeccable!"
"Tasty and great selection of flavorful and well presented dishes. Good value too. Just get there early so you don't have to wait forever.Bone marrow was not bad. Brussel sprouts were surprisingly good and I usually hate brussel sprouts. Pig ears were tasty and crunchy. Braised pork shoulder was flavorful and the mashed potatoes with it were great. Waygu sirloin tip was also good. The Italian sausage with fava beans was also great - great tasting sausage that didn't taste like your typical boring italian sausage from the market. The beets with goat cheese was interesting - wouldn't get that one again personally, though."
"I loved the food at Purple Pig.  But there were some things I didn't love:1) Wait Time.They do not accept reservations.  On a Tuesday evening, we were quoted a ""45 minute to an hour"" wait time, but then I was told, ""but it will probably be closer to an hour.""  We ended up waiting about an hour and a half.  Lucky for us, the weather was awesome, so waiting on the patio was moderately comfortable.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but I do mind when the estimated time is way off from what I was told.2) Communal Seating.I can deal with communal seating, but Purple Pig's table arrangements take advantage of every single inch of space.  We were seated at a long table, one side against a wall, in between two other groups.  There was a pillar in back of one chair, so my husband could not pull his chair out to be seated.  When I wanted to get up, I had to maneuver out of my seat and made a spectacle of myself.If I came back to Purple Pig, I would not do it in a large group (there were five of us), and I would sit at the bar or pray for a small table for two.Let me be clear:  I LOVED the food at Purple Pig.  They do small plates, but some of the small plates are quite big and could comfortably serve four people.  Most plates are $9-14.  They also offer a ""Piggy Plate"" in which you can build your meat & cheese plate (about $20).My favorite dishes were:Beef Tendon Chips:  It took me a few bites to like this one.  The texture was crunchy, but had the melty effect of a packing peanut.  But it tasted like beef and vinegar, not styrofoam.Roasted Bone Marrow:  This was the first time I tried it, and the flavor was enhanced with the herbs and salt that was served with the marrow, which we spread on some garlicky toasted bread.  We packed up the two massive bones to take home for our pup.Cheese:  We only sampled one cheese - the Chocolate Goat.  Cheeses are $7 for one selection, and this one was worth every penny.  It tasted like a creamy chocolate cheesecake with the tart kick of goat cheese.  This would also be appropriate for dessert.Chicken Thigh Kebab:  The chicken was moist and salty.  Served with a cucumber sauce and fried potatoes, it's what I'd call a ""safe"" dish.  Anyone would like this.Sicilian Iris:  Dessert is a must - make room!  Fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips.  It's plenty for two to share.There were two dishes I wasn't thrilled with, one was the Goat Cheese with Beets.  There wasn't enough cheese or pistachios to mix in, it was one mouthful of plain beets after another.  We didn't finish this plate.  The Pig Ear was OK, but it needed to be more crispy.For two of us, we had two drinks, and we shared 6 plates and dessert.  The total bill was around $80 (before tax + tip).  I definitely feel that this meal was worth the pricetag."
"Tourist trap. 2 hour wait. Super packed inside, people will crash into you. Upscale food should taste a lot better. A runny egg over some meat and vegetable. Razor clams are too briny and nothing special. Pickled things. I was unimpressed by their food. 2/10 for flavor overall. Ordered 8 plates, and had nothing I would want to eat again. And I was starving, which usually enhances tastes. Slow, bc of the bajillion orders ahead of yours in the kitchen. Holey Moley expensive. Tiny plate. There will be no sharing of bites. They cram chairs on the patio. We had to eat there, bc inside is past capacity."
"I've been waiting to experience The Purple Pig since I moved to Chicago in January of this year, 2014. That's 9 months kids. We live 3 blocks away yet every time we roll in, super starving, their like, oh for 2? It's a 2 hours wait. Riiiight. One time we gave them our cell number, but were so hungry after 45 minutes we ended up at Rosebuds. So tonight, it was raining. It was 10pm and I was flying solo with my honeybear out of town on businasss. So tonight was the night that I walked right in to The Purple Pig and sat down at the bar, no wait. The expert foodie behind the bar recommended the octopus and charred cauliflower to start. The octopus was THE BEST I've had in Chicago, ans the second best only to Aspen, Co. SO tender, perfectly flavored, no ""weird"" texture that Octopus can easily posses. Mixed with creamy fingerling potatoes and crisp green beans, this dish is a must and the portion perfect to share between 2-4 people. I also enjoyed the charred cauliflower, shaved into thin pieces, browned golden and served with cornichons and breadcrumbs - which did make it a bit salty, but addicting. Finally I ended the night with the scallops, three large, perfectly seared, atop chickpea aioli. It was a bit too salty, the aioli, but overall, yum. My food was accompanied by a lovely 2012 merlot from France, chosen after about 15 minutes of pouring through their lengthy wine list. It was, in a word, delightful. Blackberries abound and smooth. It was smooth like butta. I love when I find a menu so scrumptious, that I want to order almost every item. And when you get home with our leftover octopus, and promptly finish it off like I just did, well then you know, it wasn't good. It was great. Hint: there's a bar you can walk into with to res. The atmosphere feels like your in a cool instagram photo with a sepia filter. #worththewait"
"We went to the purple pig for our anniversary on a Monday and we were seated right away outside. The menu is interesting and has plenty on options. We had the half duck, corn bread, tuna salad sort of dish and lobster and blood sausage dish. All in all it was decent, nothing to complain about but I wouldn't return."
"Excelent food and service, went on a tuesday end the place was packed, food was served fast. Wine and desert were amazing. Great place to chat, have a drink and share a cuple of plates."
"Seriously delicious! The wait could be long depending  when you go, Saturday could long, but the wait staff is great. Get a drink and just chill. There's a lot if seating to relax while you wait and socialize with others. The food is fantastic and be prepared to eat outside your comfort box.... I encourage it!"
"So I've been here one time before, to have dinner but the wait was so long we decided to stand up (because it was standing room only), at the bar and have a drink. I returned last night with a friend. Around 5:15 on a Friday this place was absolutely crawling with people-which is to be expected at this time. We somehow managed to wedge ourselves into one spot at the bar, upon looking over the extensive drink menu we decided to ask the bartender for help with our wine selection. Purple pig is big on their wines (swine pairs with wine, makes sense), and the staff was knowledgable. We got our Italian wine on and then asked for food recs. Here's what I suggest:Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta smear was rich, hearty and savory, but got cold fast even when served in a crock pot. So, eat up!""JLT"" was just delicious. If pork jowl, lettuce tomato topped with fried duck egg isn't your thing then get out and give up your coveted seat, because this tiny swine shop isn't big enough for you. Skip the oysters, way, way over cooked and greasy. This place needs to stick with turf food.By the time we wanted a second glass if wine the bartender was totally inattentive and actually looked at the check about 15 times to see if we had put out cards in to pay. Nothing in my mind says ""get lost"" than that. So that's what we did. And that's why you lost a star from me."
"Of course we had to try this place out after seeing everyone I knew who went to Chicago eat at this place.  This place is smack dab in the middle of downtown so parking can be expensive in one of the nearby garages.  I had heard horror stories about the wait since they don't take reservations so our party of 4 arrived at 4:00pm on a sunny Tuesday afternoon.  No wait at all!  This seems like a small restaurant once you walk inside which explains the long waits.  There are 3-4 main long communal tables, seating at the bar, and a few regular tables along the walls.  We ordered:_Pigs Ear with Crispy Kale and Fried Egg - This was pleasantly delicious.  I was weary cuz I had never tried pig ear, but the combination with the Kale and Egg was PERFECT!_Roasted Bone Marrow - Easily the best bone marrow I have ever tried.  Comes with the perfect bread to spread the marrow on.  We ended up asking for more bread though -- it was a lot of bone marrow._Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Tzatziki - This dish comes with fried potatoes.  The Tzatziki  sauce (or as I like to call it: white halal sauce) was the perfect compliment to the chicken and potatoes.  Since there is no kids menu, this is what we ordered for my 7 year old nephew.  He (and I) LOVED this!_Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - The meat was very tender but unfortunately was very salty.  Good that they paired this with mashed potatoes which helps mask the saltiness._Cape Cod Mussels - Not mind blowing, but very yummy.  Texture of mussels was not tough and the sauce that it comes in compliments it well._Waygu Short Ribs - Unfortunately this was the only disappointing dish of the meal.  It's a korean short rib but they use some spices and sauce that did not go well with the meat.  They gave us two cuts but we didn't finish them._Sicilian Iris - we ordered this for dessert. It is a Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche, super yummy!We pretty much tried all the main recommended dishes from yelp and friends.  The pricing here is decent too.  So glad we visited this place, it really did not disappoint.  I am now telling people that they must try this place when visiting Chicago!"
"nice sized portions with reasonable prices. most plates are shareable and that's how you get the most out of your money. if you pick wisely, you can try a nice variety of menu items for under 60 dollars for 2 people.also, get the crepe. the sorbet on top is amazing."
"There are few places which tend to have a perfect combination of good ambiance, great food and nice service. Purple Pig excels in all of these departments.Came here a couple of times in last few weeks. Just a heads up they don't take reservations and I would suggest arriving early as this place gets packed very early on. They have a concept of community tables where one can sit with other random guests. I normally get a glass of wine and wait and occupy a spot at the bar.Below is the list of delicacies I have had here -* Chorizo stuffed olives* Deviled Eggs* Octopus Salad* Pork Rib with pomengrate* Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes* Pig ear in Ricotta cheese with tomato sauce* Sicilian Iris(Dessert)I really like all of above except the olives. The octopus salad was just awesome. The rib was probably one of the most succulent piece of meat I had in a long time. Definitely get the Sicilian Iris which is so rich and tasty ( I am drooling just writing about it).Really a big lover of ambiance here , love the whole idea of being able to see the food cooked in front of your eyes."
Awesome rabbit!! and octopusSmall plates but really good. Nice wine selection too.
"Everything we tried was awesome, pig ears with kale, razor clams, and octopus was so soft... Great food and atmosphere!!"
"Terribly long wait times, no reservations.  Still 5-stars.  Do yourself a favor and go here, no matter what it takes...We ended up electing to be seated immediately outdoors.  It was 20 degrees out, and although they had heaters and a tent, it was cold, my legs were tomato red.  Still worth it.We ordered drinks right away and water followed quickly after we were seated.  Our server was really great, helping us decode the menu and make suggestions as requested.I started my meal with the olive-oil poached tuna with quail eggs.  It was amazing, creamy and light and just delicious in every way.  I wanted to order another and try to take it home with me; I am not sure I would've made it back on the plane, I would've eaten it straight away.Our table ordered a slew of items, including the Foie Gras which was nice, a first for all of us.  The fruity spread served with it really added to the taste of the dish.  I don't remember everything we had, just that for some reason, but nothing that touched our lips disappointed our taste buds.I ordered the Porchetta Panini, which was a way bigger portion than expected, and was completely delighted.  It was so good!  I want another one just typing this review.My counterparts ordered the chicken sausage, JLT and Chicken Thighs.  All equally as amazing.  We all ended up sharing our dishes with each other because everyone was oohh-ing and aww-ing when they took their first bites.I think the menu rotates from time to time, so I cannot wait to go back and try some other superb dishes.  The Chorizzo Stuffed Olives really wanted to go in my belly, but I just didn't' have the space, so I didn't order them.  Someone out there get them and let me know how they are...Thanks Chicago, I miss your many foods.  Eating just isn't the same any more..."
Great place to stop by after work.The food is very delicious! They have more appetizers than anything but they blend well with any beer or wine.
"I have never done a review and felt like 4 stars was further from 5.  PP definitely deserves 4, but I can't fathom giving it 5.  Service was very good, and the food was solid with a fwe highlights, but there was zero ""Wow!""  The hour-and-a-half wait early on a Sunday evening served to emphasize the lack of punch.  -Beets/goat cheese - good if you like beets, I don't-Oil-poached tuna - solid.-Chorizo-stuffed olives - delightful.-Bologna sandwich - has about as much in common with the crap you ate as a kid as pastrami.  I was disappointed I ahd to share this one. -Meatball slider - good but not impressive.-Milk-braised pork shoulder - probably the best prepared dish ofthe night.  Again, did not want to share. -Wagyu sirloin tip - perhaps the worst prepared dish of the night.  I don't know if they started with a bad piece of meat, or if they started with a good piece and botched the preparation, but this was just a waste.  Quite overdone, flavorless, a waste of my chewing muscles. -Fried cheese - has anyone ever had bad fried cheese?  Yes, it was very good, but it didn't do much to separate itself from any other fried cheese. -Iris - the people who tried it loved it.-Jam-stuffed donut holes - pretty damn good. A good meal, no major disappointments aside from the wagyu, thing is, I can't thin of a reason to pick this over any other place.  Especially not with any significant wait.  Glad I went, don't think I'll bother to go back."
"We ate here on a Sunday, and it was a really uncomfortable experience.It was freezing cold inside (yes we were even seated inside the actual building, not the patio) and we had to keep all of our winter wear on or else we were shivering. Our server (didn't even introduce himself/told us his name) was THE RUDEST server I have ever had. My guest and I were appalled. He didn't smile once, he didn't try and engage with us about the food and ingredients at all, and when we asked for things (like hot tea, the dessert menu, and the actual menu to order more things) he looked at us like he was exasperated and was almost scowling. We really were so shocked at how he was treating us. The busser was extremely friendly and like a ray of sunshine, I wish our tip went directly to him.The food itself was o-k, we had:-Roasted carrot and grapefruit, whipped robiola cheese, farro and black truffle vinaigrette (DELICIOUS!!)-Olive oil poached tuna with tomatoes, quail eggs, roasted red peppers, and greek lemon vinaigrette (Wasn't great, wasn't bad. But definitely forgettable)-Roasted bone marrow (have had much better than this)- Squid stuffed with prosciutto and bread crumbs, santorini fava puree and charmoula (This was pleasant, the squid and the puree was delicious and flavorful, the prosciutto and bread crumb stuffing was bland)Overall, we enjoyed the food, but the scathingly rude service really have made us not want to ever go back. My friend and I were beyond excited to try this place out, and we've been planning to meet there for weeks as a reunion, but it was really disappointing on how we were treated. The server really shocked and dampened our excited moods. I will recommend this place to people who want to try good Mediterranean food, but I will also warn them to avoid the skinny server with a scowl on his face. Please fix your server's attitude."
"Came here for an early dinner on Friday at 4, good thing because by the time we left, the line to get in was out the the door.  To begin, the staff was really friendly and helped explain the menu, which is a little bit overwhelming to read.  The purple pig is creative and uses fresh ingredients so I can see how it is so popular, but I am a picky eater and with all its ""odd"" items, this place was not for me. I really enjoyed their cheese plate and vegetarian small plates.  Also, I recommend the pork ossobucco which was literally fall off the bone tender.  Overall, I really liked the food presentation and plating, but the dishes were overpriced and the table too tiny to hold everything you ordered."
Favorite place we ate over the weekend. Went to see a 7:30 Book of Mormon show at the Bank of America theatre and got to the PP at 6. They said it was an hour and a half wait but we were able to snag a spot for two at the bar. The bartenders were all incredibly friendly and helpful. We split three plates and a bottle of wine and it was plenty of food and under $100. Delicious!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! I could go into detail on all the awesome things we experienced here but really you must go and check it out for yourself! FYI - Be prepared to wait for a table! Completely worth it and you surely will not be upset over the wait!
"Marrow will not make your waistline narrow. I'm feeling generous and will not let apathetic and snobby service from a female bartender knock this review down to 3 stars. I was on a work trip and decided to grab a quick bite at the bar before an appointment. I easily grabbed a seat at 2 pm on a weekday. Perhaps it was because I didn't order a cocktail, but service was subpar until Dominique entered the scene and checked on me midway through my meal. He was attentive and made up for a rocky start. I checked out the roasted bone marrow dish which came with two large beef bones and an herb salad. I spread the fatty marrow on the toast, topped it with herb salad and capers and sprinkled on Sicilian sea salt. I really liked the sharp, salty taste of capers with every bite. Indulgent and not to be eaten often. The toast was crispy but a bit oily on its own not to mention when paired with the marrow. I knew what I was getting in to though. I liked the dish and the vibe of the restaurant and am curious about other menu items. If I was a local, I can imagine good times here with friends, drinks and noshing on your not so typical late-nite bites after some Michigan Avenue shopping."
"CHICAGO: Trendy little joint, good lunch.  All meal items are served tappas style and meant to share.  Specialize in pork, but many of our items weren't pork and were super good.  We tried the pig ear (4 star), octopus (4 star), the caviar smear (4 star), stuffed olives (3 star), the pork shoulder (3 star) the blade steak (5 Star), and the Iris dessert (5 Star).Ultimately, the blade steak stole the show, it was like a steak of bacon atop chorizo with a little spring mix on top.  Very good.  The iris dessert was great, too, like a big puffy eclair.  The smear, octopus, etc. was novel and good but not craveable.  The pork shoulder is one of their most popular, but tasted like pork chop and mashed potatoes, very bland, no smoky or fatty textures or flavors that make pork interesting."
"Anyone who truly knows me, would tell you that the last place they'd EVER expect to find me is a place with the tagline ""Cheese, Swine & Wine."" And they'd be right! My lack of enthusiasm for ""pork fried anything"" or for that matter ""anything pork"" aside, I LOVE THE PURPLE PIG! First of all, the small dining area has great ambiance, and an awesome bar. There's an amazing energy inside this place! And, every single dish I've tried has been delicious! ...I recommend trying several things and sharing. The menu is so overwhelming to me that I always ask the server or bartender to help and they've always steered me toward something creative and wonderful!I also love the fact that the servers I've had have always helped me find the perfect wine to accompany my experience. Always!So, definitely go to the Purple Pig! Check it out. That is, if you're courageous enough to brave the lines and crowds of people, which I highly recommend you do. Because this place is truly special. Pork and all!"
"On a 48hr visit.  Came for apps and cocktails.  The server left allot to be desired but the food, AMAZING.  the deviled egg with aialaama capers salad  so tasty. The arugula lemon dressing fantastic. Taramasslata Greek caviar smear, delicious.  Our waitress not very attentive but the buzzers attentive. Brought us more bread to go with our SMEAR"
"Too small and the food taste like a bunch of grease, such as the bone marrow. Where's the meat?!! The staff was nice and tried to accommodate but we'll pass. We left there starving and went to another restaurant. We have no desire to return."
"We went on a Wednesday and got lucky to be seated right away. Our last attempt was a 3-4 hour wait on a Saturday we didn't quite make. They don't take reservations. Go before you're hungry to put your name in and explore the area. They'll text you when your table is ready. The menu was amazing, and quite expansive! We needed the assistance of our server to narrow it down a bit and he did a great job. We loved everything! Go with a group and plan to share."
The Croque Mansieur Panini was FABULOUS!!  Highly recommend!!!  The seating is crowded and very busy so I'm sure the rest of the food is as wonderful!
"Foody hotspot! Sat at the bar, great service, amazing food! Olive oil poached tuna was a circus of flavors in my mouth - excellent!!"
The gyro was amazing. A little too crowded and cramped for me but I love the food and drink list.
bone marrow cauliflowerappetizers are very good
"A go to place for me in Chicago for years - now that I live here, it's a place I love bringing my foodie friends from CA to when they visit.  The only thing that overshadows the excellent food is the brilliant service.  The staff here has as much passion for the menu items as I do and I will always defer to their recommendations.  If you visit Chicago you owe it to yourself to come here.  It's worth the wait for a table and I promise you that your tastebuds will do a happy dance. #youarewelcome :)"
"If you're visiting Chicago, and walking up and down Magnificent Mile, and need somewhere interesting to eat, Purple Pig is a pretty good option. Assuming you don't mind the 2+ hour wait. You're better off if you can go at a less standard meal time. However, if you have the means to get yourself off mag mile to eat somewhere else, that's a better idea. Purple Pig was pretty good, but there are way better places not too far away. They have an extensive menu, and its not terribly expensive, but in the 3 hour wait time you could stroll leisurely to any number of better options. That said, it is a pretty creative menu, and nothing we had was bad (just pretty good in a ho hum way), and you can't beat the location. It's not a terrible option, just not somewhere I would seek out again."
"Holy sh*t. I'm not even a big pork fan and came here b it was close to my hotel and open late. THREE dishes - all delicious! The JLT was INSANELY good. Omg. Also good was the deep fried olives and the roasted almonds. I come to Chicago 1-2x/year. Good vibe, good service and holy crap this place was good!"
"We stayed at the  Intercontinental and called at 6:30 to see how long the wait was. She said 30 mins but it would only get longer, so we went straight over. The place is just crowded. Not necessarily with people. It is just cramped. Tables smooshed together and a constant line of people crowded around the two, yes only 2, non gender-specific restrooms. The music is blaring over the buzzing conversations. They really want to turn over the tables,  so don't dally. They lose a star for a lack of ambiance, but the food is really why we went. We had the bone marrow, fried manchego, the garlic broccoli with anchovy dressing and the 30 hour sous vide Wagyu eye of round. The latter two were the standouts.  It was nice to have a little veg to cut through the other rich dishes. And the eye of round is usually a cheap, dry cut of meat. This was like cutting through butter with the decadent fois gras and flavorful sauce Bourdelais. They also score huge for the wine selection and the fact that you can get a glass, a quartino, or a whole bottle. We tried a Portuguese and a Spanish Navara.  We would definitely go again."
- Put your name in because this place is hot - Came in midday on a Saturday and it was busy (two hour wait for tables )Sat down at the bar seatingOrdered osso bucco (HUGE)  tender delicious and flavorful Service was friendlyWell knowledged and quick.Would recommend
"Ordered four plates to get a good feel for the place. The taste is definitely there in all the dishes but sadly often lacking in texture. The bone marrow was well prepared, and very much enjoyed the wagyu beef. Atmosphere is great, wine list is terrific for a range of tastes."
"Well, we went there just by the four star rating from over 3000 odd reviews. Gladly they didn't disappoint us. Service was very quick as well. The chicken kabob was marinated and grilled to perfection. The eggplant smear with the goat cheese was quite flavorful, but was served cold. Lot more to try out from their menu."
"The long wait is probably not justified. The Purple Pig is a popular tourist destination, and the quality of the food is what you would expect: good -- some dishes are rather good -- but definitely not all. On top of that, the service is slow because the restaurant usually operates at full capacity. For reference, I've had the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey at least twice, and a few of the other dishes. The Pork Blade Steak is pretty good, but the other dishes were generally not as convincing."
"Pros:- Food is excellent! We had the bone marrow and the lamb blade steak and they were both delicious and cooked perfectly. The Sicilian Iris was also amazing for dessert!Cons:- Tiny spot with too many people packed in- Servers/Bartenders were not friendly or that helpful- It was VERY loudSo I did love the food, but didn't enjoy the experience. I would try it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."
I love this place.. the food is different and tastes amazing. The prices are right and the atmosphere is so cool.
"My only complaint about this place is that while we were waiting to be seated there was no where to stand that was ""out of the way"".  We asked where we should stand and went there, but we seemed even more in the way there.  It was about 8 pm on a Sunday night, so the wait wasn't too bad only about 15 minutes. Once we were seated, the waiter went over the menu and told us that everything is intended to be shared.  We were given water right away and a bottle was left on the table to keep our glasses full.  We were not super hungry and really just wanted to try the meats and cheeses.  We ordered the three cheeses and the pig platter.  Both were incredible and I really enjoyed getting to try a variety of dishes.The restaurant was clean and had a cool décor.  The service was fantastic.  I would love to return!"
"I am obsessed with the purple pig! Every time I visit Chicago I have to have at least one meal here.There is a huge wine selection & pairings are always on point. Do NOT skip on the pork shoulder and the ragu, the eggplant is also delicious. The portions are tapas style and the prices are reasonable, warning once you start eating it's hard to stop!!!"
Great food - this place should be a Chicago landmark. Portions are generous and prices are very reasonable.
"This isn't for the faint hearted eaters and for people with lots and lots of patience. Trust me, your patience will be tested by the lack of a reservations system and extreme popularity of this restaurant.That being said, I loved The Purple Pig. My favorite was the pork liver pate, so delicious.  They put a lot of effort into spices and preparation of most dishes, so it may not taste what you would have expected. However, the preparations were delicious.On a Monday night, the wait was close to 40 minutes around 6pm. I would imagine it being even longer at the peak 7pm. And I can't imagine how anyone can come here on a weekend. Hope you didn't decide to bring a date here, because guess what, his/her patience will be tested too. Either that, or you guys would have boozed it up at the bar enough to try everything on the menu."
"This place seems to be ALWAYS packed and they don't take reservations, so make sure you get there early. Ambiance here is awesome, you are high above the street, with nice lighting and decorations. Very upscale feeling and you feel like you are important. Staff here are very friendly and service was quick, especially considering that you could order food anytime being that it is a Tapas bar.I highly recommend getting the Roasted Corn here as well as the eggplant spread. Those were my two favorite things here. Both were full of flavor, not too salty and were absolutely incredible.Awesome place, five stars. Will come here again if I was back in Chicago."
"Hands down the most amazing food, service, and atmosphere. Well worth the wait! Only in Chicago for a week and I want to go back again! Great selection of wine as well."
"Had to wait for a little bit to get a table, but we totally didn't mind because we weren't in a rush, and they let us sit in the patio with some wine. We got half bottle, while we were outside, and when we got our table we decided to get another half. They were able to accommodate and just charge us for a full (which costs less than two half bottle orders). That was really nice of them.All the food was unique and amazing. Never tried or even heard of some of these things, like the Salt and Vinegar Beef Tendon Chips -- basically pork rinds, but made with beef tendon instead. Damn addictive. Other must-have items are the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder (can't stop thinking about it) and the pork neck bone gravy. In general, if you order a bunch of pork dishes from here, you're pretty much guaranteed to be satisfied.Another one of those places which I can't wait to revisit next time I'm back in the windy city."
"This place is fantastic and is a must try when you stop by in Chicago downtown.   location:This place is located 3 stores down from Nordstrom within the magnificent mile.   Service:The service is great.   Even though with a huge line and wait, our hostess helped us find a seat in 15 minutes.   Our server is fantastic as well.   She helped suggested the wine to go with our order and she came back frequently to check up on us despite the restaurant being busy.  The food also came out pretty quickly.   Food:- pig ear and fried kale - this is so good.   The fried kale kinda tasted like seaweed and the mix with the pig ear was a unique taste.   Milk braised pork shoulder is so good.   This is literally like the best thing I've tasted.   The meat is very tender and the sauce just melts in your mouth.  We ordered the Martindale red wine and rose white."
Some of the best-tasting food I've ever eaten north of the Chicago River! One of my Top 5 places I recommend people to try. Yum!
"A friend and I went to The Purple Pig for the first time because of the great reviews this place received,  however,  we were disappointed . The day we went,  there was a horrible storm outside. Our clothes were completely drenched and we were shivering. Every waiter/waitress seemed  friendly except for ours! He barely spoke to us and wouldn't even crack a smile!  We tried to ignore how uncomfortable we were and began to order. We had the cornbread, chicken kebobs , and octopus.  The cornbread was delicious,  the honey on top was the perfect way to counterbalance the salty feta cheese.  The chicken kebob was good especially with the tzatziki sauce on the side.  The octopus on the other hand, the most unappetizing dish. I love to incorporate olive oil into food but that dish tasted like the octopus,  green beans and potatoes were just sitting in a pool of it! I REALLY  wish we had a better waiter that day because our experience would've been so much better."
"I had heard amazing things about this place, but I wasn't impressed. The restaurant is soooooo small and crowded - they put us at the counter like it was a normal place to sit. The other option was sitting with strangers at a communal table...wtf?The menu has limited vegetarian options and is very up its own ass - just stuffy for no apparent reason considering the casual seating situation. My husband ordered meat and seemed to enjoy the food somewhat better but wasn't thrilled. Won't be returning considering this place isn't cheap either."
"Mmm. Good good good. I went with my friend on a Friday evening at around 5:45 pm, and there was no wait to be seated. It's definitely a popular place and was very busy when we got there, but I think we just got lucky or came at the right time. The foie gras spread was delicious. I know they tell us to order about two dishes per person, but after the second one my friend and I were feeling pretty satisfied. The pigs ear was great, but not excellent. The texture of the ear bits was crunchy and savoury. I'm not sure if there were pickles or some other pickled vegetable, but there was a sour flavor mixed in there which could have balanced the fried pig ear well, but there was a little too much of it. But the (kale? Broccoli?) vegetable was cooked well and the combination of the three textures and flavors, and I'm sure I'm missing other parts of the dish, was great overall. The Pork Shoulder was also satisfying, the mashed potatoes and gravy were cooked to perfection, and made the dish in my opinion, more so than the pork.Service was fine, but not great. We were in a rush to leave, and we saw our waiter just start to take orders from a big group table so we decided to go up to the register to pay. Suddenly the waiter rushed up behind us, looking a little bothered that we had left his table. Though I doubt anyone else will have this same experience with the service. Ultimately, I would highly recommend The Purple Pig as a great spot for groups small and big alike, with great food and a fun atmosphere. Doesn't quite deserve 5 stars, but I'd give it a 4.5 if I could."
"No reservations accepted!!! Get a seat at the bar!!!We went early on a weekend night so we could avoid the crowds, well it looked good on paper, but the pig was still packed. We put our names in wandered to the bar to wait then what happened next could only be described as a nod from the food gods???? A couple was getting ready to leave just when we walked up and offered us their seat. You did not have to ask us twice we moved in quickly and staked our claim. In my opinion it was the best seat in the house, the bar section directly in front of the open kitchen. We watched the chefs prepare food was offered a few free tastes and even had a nice chat with Jimmy Bannos Jr. The food was phenomenal and they have a great menu that will keep you coming back for more. Service was also very good with excellent recommendations.We had the following dishesChorizo Stuffed Olives  - tart salty crispyProsciutto Escarole Bread Balls - good but will pass next time.Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios - don' miss this.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - was not our fav but will try again.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - fun dish to share great flavorMilk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - a little salty but tender and tastyRazor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil - Star of the night sweet tender tasty.The razor clams was our favorite I could of eaten a boat full of these!! The prep was simple but so tasty. It was the first time I had razor clams they are sweet similar to crab in taste and texture. We also loved the calamari salad, excellent. The Pigs ear was the only dish that did not live up to the hype. the fried pigs ear was just  plain and the egg was over cooked it was still good we will give it another try.If there is just two of you try and snag the seat at the bar in front of the kitchen it really adds to the experience and you may get a few great sample tastes."
Simply overrated. Crowded. Hipster bearded bartender with attitude. $13 for a 5oz plain margarita. Not vegan friendly at all.
This place is awesome!The razor clams are delicious.  This place definitely lives up to all the hype.  The only bad thing about this little joint is I don't get to eat here as often as I'd like to.  But that's my problem. If you get a bit stuffy during holidays.  But stick out the crowd if you can if you're only in town for a limited amount of time.  You'll definitely leave being jealous of the locals. :)Do yourself a favor and check this place out.
"I love bacon, I love ribs, I love pork belly. Simply put, I like pig. So needless to say, my friend said we had to visit the Purple Pig for dinner. It would require thoughtful planning, but we had to go. I on the other hand, being the skeptic, had to hop on to Yelp and get a feel for what to eat and was quickly put at ease when I saw familiar faces with notes to share.Since tables are hard to come by and they don't take reservations, we arrived fairly early for dinner and had a cocktail while we waited on the patio. The wait wasn't long, but I could imagine that the wait could get progressively longer as you go later in the evening. We perused the menu and after consulting with the waiter, we opted to start with the house cured meats and chose the mortadella, duck prosciutto, and capocollo. All were fantastic with the bold flavors you would expect with the fatty meats. The bone marrow was to die for.  It was prepared well and the savory flavors of the fat melded with the bread and the heat that came from the parsley, onion, and capers. Do not miss out, order this dish. Even if your cholesterol or blood pressure might be high, you deserve this dish.Moving on to the Wagyu short ribs with the mushroom duxelles was a decent dish, but nothing truly special. It reminded me of korean style kalbi to be honest and expected it to be a bit more tender since it was wagyu. The pork secreto was good a dish with the braised pork being complemented with sweet red peppers and a bit of bite from the pickled watermelon rinds.Service was stellar and food arrived in a perfect orchestration. Our server clearly knew the menu like the back of his hand and knew what wines/cocktails would be a good complement to our dishes. The ambiance was comfortable and nostalgic of that neighborhood spot. i'd recommend grabbing a table on the patio if the weather cooperates since inside can get a tad hot.Its clear why the Purple Pig is popular, it puts out some stellar dishes and service that make it a unique experience."
"Great and unique combinations! The octopus was savory and unlike anything else I've ever tasted. The shredded pork smear with ricotta was a delicious twist to your average marinara sauce. Dining experience was great in the heated tent, got a little loud at times with helicopters and city traffic, as expected. Overall great service and fun lunch atmosphere!"
"We came here for a friends birthday and although we sat in the extended seating part that isn't as nice and a little crowded, the food more than made up for it.We ordered at least 6 dishes and all shared them and every single dish we had was so good that I wish they had put more on the plate.  Nothing was ever dry or over cooked, it was all done to perfection and our waiter had some very good suggestions when we couldn't choose which dish to get."
"Turkey Leg Confit, Beets with goat cheese, Neck Bone Gravy, and an amazing wine list.  Some of the best food in Chicago hands down."
"We showed up Saturday evening around 550 and the wait for a table was already over an hour. We decided to wait it out and order some drinks. Well worth the wait!!! We ordered starters, first one up was the fried olive stuffed chorizo- AMAZING!!! We had to reorder it, was so good. When we got a table our waiter was very friendly!!! We each ordered a plate and shared. Everything was delicious! You must try the pork belly rillions and the meatballs! They gyro is actually pretty big and can be shared! The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. Great place for groups!"
"I went here for my last meal in Chicago this summer. I had been meaning to go for awhile but never wanted to brave the 90+ minute wait. I finally went for a cocktail, app, and dessert on a Monday evening (still 90 minute wait). The food was phenomenal. I got a fried manchego cheese appetizer which was delicious, and a chocolate tart dessert. The cocktail I got was called Spanish pantalones and was like an old fashioned- my favorite. Overall great food! Not sure it's worth the wait, when other places have similarly amazing food and take reservations. But still a wonderful meal!"
"I came for lunch to have the bone marrow and it did not disappoint. You get a long bone cut in half set in front of you, with greens and a hearty portion of bread. for 13$, it was quite satisfying. Scoop out some marrow, spread it on the bread and then sprinkle the salt on top and each bite is just mmmm, delighttop notch place to eat!"
Love it! I always go there when in Chicago.
"Popped in for Easter and had Kelly as our server. She was all smiles and sooooo friendly, how southern! :) We ordered the beet salad, fried manchego, pig ear, radicchio salad, and deviled eggs. To down all this goodness, we ordered several cocktails too. Boy were those strong! Overall great chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious bites. We will be back when in town, thanks Kelly!"
"This place is unreal.  Everything we ate was amazing - especially the pig ears (which I was nervous about, but they were incredibly delicious!)  I would definitely go with a smaller group as this isn't a HUGE restaurant.  I went for a late lunch and we were seated right away.  Our waiter was very friendly and made awesome recommendations as far as portions and selections.  The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  We never felt rushed or ignored even though it was packed.  The lowkey environment would make it perfect for a first date.  Would definitely go again!"
"Had lunch hear while passing through Chicago. Really inspired small plates menu with lots of great choices. Pork fried almonds were a good starter. Salt-Roasted beets with goat cheese were also very tasty. Thought the pig's ear was good, but the proportions were a bit off (too much crispy pig's ear and not enough of the kale and pickled cherry peppers to complement it)."
"This is a fun place! Between the cured meats, smears, and extensive wine menu you'll definitely have a unique experience at purple pig.  We had the bone marrow smear, chorizo olives, some cured meat I can remember the name of and halibut for our entrée. I'd definitely recommend the halibut! Great service as well.Definitely a great place to take a visitor but make sure they are willing to try these dishes. We went at 11:30 on a Friday so we got in right away which was lucky compared to the other reviews I've read. Overall really fun but the only thing is it is a bit crowded in the actual restaurant."
"Super crowded and loud there, but other than that it's a fun spot to dine! The bone marrow is amazing there and is a must! The cauliflower I had there was so good too! The food was delicious!"
"We came for a snack and tried a couple of items. At around 3pm on a Saturday it was buzzing inside and out. Luckily, we got the last couple of seats before a longer line started to form. The patio is very cute and a perfect spot for some snacks and drinks with friends. They have a great variety of cheeses with some catchy names.The milk braised pork was melt in your mouth wonderful. So tender and moist...mmmmmmThe fried chorizo stuffed olives were good and exactly what you would expect. Salt with a side of salt bursting flavor when you bite through. It would be a good accompaniment to martini.Solid place but service was a bit slow at times.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesChorizo Stuffed Olives"
"This is actually the fourth time that I've eaten at Purple Pig and it never, ever disappoints. To begin, for the uninitiated, this place is busy. We usually go inside and put our name on the list. The restaurant is very good about taking phone numbers and if it's a long wait, we stroll along Michigan Ave. and do some shopping. It never really seems to be a problem for my girlfriend or I. Seating is always tricky (hence the long wait times), since the restaurant has a small footprint. The first time we ate The Pig we were seated at the corner of a large table shared by many people. We loved it, being able to sit close to each other, share wonderful food and sip on wine - it was fantastic. However, I realize that it may not be for everyone. This time, we were seated outside the entrance in a tent on a rainy day. Not the most ideal circumstances and not the most comfortable, but we still enjoyed our dining experience. Our waiters were terrific. They were friendly without being intrusive, willing to let us take our time eating, drinking and savoring our meal. As for the food - I love to eat tapas style, and this place is genuinely creative in the way they approach this style of cuisine. My girlfriend has a dairy allergy, and they have plenty of dishes that are tasty and dairy-free. There are some dishes we always get and then we always find a couple of new dishes, as well. This time my girlfriend and I were a bit disappointed that the grilled octopus wasn't on the menu (one of our all-time favorites), but were absolutely happy to find a couple of new dishes that were outstanding substitutes. We particularly liked the pork liver pate. All said, this is one of our personal favorites and we'll definitely be back."
"Best dinner I had in Chicago. It was highly recommended by friends and yelp. I mean who could turn down a place that has 4 stars and 2600+ reviews?They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Surprised? No. But we waited 3 hrs. What's nice is that there's a lot to do not too far from The Purple Pig so we relaxed back at our hotel, grabbed some snacks to hold us for the 3 hrs, did some touristy things like going to the John Hancock building, etc. You can also leave your number with them so they can call you when your table is close to being ready.We were seated out on their patio where they do provide heated lamps.Their menu is condensed with a good variety in foods. Now this place is tapas which means small plates. So, expect to order a few dishes. Their wine list is very extensive with great choices (prices were also reasonable for full bottles).The tapas we ordered:1. Cauliflower- 3.5 stars. The cauliflower was cooked perfect and seasoned well. I loved the hint of lemon juice. However, expensive for just cauliflower.2. Beets- 3.5 stars. The beets were cooked perfectly and paired very well with the goat cheese and vinaigrette. But I'm also biased because I love beets. So couldn't go wrong with this dish.3. Pig's Ear- 4.5 stars. Don't let the name discourage you from ordering this dish. The fried egg was cooked perfectly and our server told us it's best served all mixed together. Each bite had a nice crunch packed full flavor. It was really good. But I just wish the portion was bigger!4. Roasted Bone Marrow- 4 stars. They give you two pieces and each piece comes with plenty of bone marrow. All that fat gooey oily goodness to go on top of their perfectly toasted and fluffy bread. I recommend eating this while it's still hot. You don't want it to cool down because it solidifies and becomes unappetizing.5. Foie gras- 4 stars. The foie gras spread was very good. Not too rich with a hint of sweetness. Their bread was delicious, they give you more bread upon request. It also comes with a jam that's pretty good.6. JLT (Pork Jowl) - 5 stars. Which is pig face/cheek. The meat was very tender. The fried duck egg on top was cooked perfect and was a perfect combination. We should have ordered 1 per person. It was delicious!7. Razor Clams- 5 stars. I really liked this dish and I loved the seasoning on top of it. The clams were chewy yet tender and packed full of flavor.8. Octopus- 5 stars. This had a very similar if not exact same dressing as the razor clams. Delicious. The octopus tentacles were cooked perfectly.9. Chicken Thigh Kebabs- 3 stars. Just average. Some pieces were juicy while some were on the dryer side. The sauce was tasty however.10. Pork Shoulder- 4.5 stars. The pork shoulder was very good. It was super tender and juicy. However, the gravy was very salty. Luckily the gravy covered mostly the mashed potatoes and not the pork shoulder. I love mashed potatoes, but it was hard to eat because it was super salty.11. Sicilian Iris- 4 stars. Just a perfect dessert. Who can complain about a chocolate chip filled brioche. It was just like eating a beignet, but fluffier more bread and less fried.I was very happy with everything and because it's tapas I wasn't overstuffed and I was able to try everything.Our server was also awesome. He was super friendly and helpful. Our food came out in spurts. A few dishes would come out then there would be a pause where we had no food for a while then our table would be filled again with more dishes. Not sure if they planned it that way, but it was interesting.Overall, great dinner, great food, great company that left us with a great impression.I recommend other out of towners to try The Purple Pig even though the wait can sound ridiculous."
"We put our name down on the list and took a seat outside and were served some drink while we waited under the warm, lovely sunshine. Finally got a place at the communal table outside and started ordering right away.Everything was oh so tasty and well-presented. We ordered:- salted-beets with goat cheese- tuna- octopus- eggplant caponata spread- pork shoulderBest part: making new friends at the communal table and sharing dishes together and bonding over food and loving Chicago!"
"This was my first meal at my first visit in Chicago. What a first impression!I rarely give 5 star reviews. I reserve that for the most memorable and positive meals/experiences.At the first moment when we walked in the host was fun, we put our name down and he took our number to call in case we wanted to walk around a little. (This is important because they quoted us 30-45 minutes on a Wednesday night) We spent 20 minutes outside, walked back and were sat within 30 minutes of when our name was put down, not bad for such a high profile restaurant! The moment we sat down we were greeted by our friendly waiter (forget his name as it was a few days ago but tall, skinny Caucasian w dirty blonde hair) He immediately offered is drinks and eagerly answered all our questions about the menu with a smile and a willingness to educate. We ended up ordering bone marrow, foie gras, pork belly and face, and the blood sausage lobster tail dish.Each starter came out in perfect sequence of each other in a smooth transition to our entrees.  The staff was super attentive ensuring that the bread and water was replenished. The meal was completed with our dessert pastry stuffed with melted chocolate chips and cottage cheese. OMG. If you've never been, go. Now."
"We had just had deep dish pizza for lunch and had a hankering for a glass of wine.  We followed the lines of people waiting for a table.  Luckily, we found 2 seats at the bar.  So glad we did.  This bustling spot is very busy but smells amazing.  We weren't hungry at all but this young woman dining alone shared her pig's ear dish and some beets thing with us.  Phenomenal!  Why did I waste my precious stomach space on pizza?"
"I love purple pig.It is one of my go-to spots for bringing friends from out of town.It's right on michigan so you can go shopping beforehand or while you wait after putting your name on the list.The hostess Malory last night was patient, understanding and attentive while dealing with hundred of tourists and really made the wait easy for us. The best bet is to be with a small group so you can try many things but not so big that you have trouble getting seated. I have been several times and enjoyed every experience with Purple Pig. The food is spectacular. I came to Chicago with a Chicken Nugget palate but places like purple pig have opened up my eyes to lots of delicious new foods. I never would have thought that I would like pigs ear, sweetbreads or hog jowl ---typical fare at purple pig that comes from their snout to tail style of dining. It's actually quite amazing how their flavors are paired up. As a ""meat-atarian"" I never thought that I would be singing the praises of a salad but the summer squash salad at purple pig is amazing.  currants and hazelnuts really make the salad. Everything is served ""family style"" the plates have varied amounts of food on them and they come out whenever they are ready.  In my experience, the plates that are more entree sized portions come out later. I typically like to get something from each of the menu categories. AntipastiSaladFried foodsCured Meats / CheesesSmears A La PlanchaStars of the show are :Pigs Ear Bone Marrow Milk Braised Pork shoulderDon't forget the sweets.Get the Sicilian Iris. So delicious. Purple pig is absolutely worth the wait."
"If your in Chicago this is a must..wine bar mostly with pork themed tidbits. I tried the bone marrow for the first time, it was great..like bacon butter you spread on toast. Also tried the chorizo stuffed fried olives, yumm"
"While I visited for the nice wine selection, I was surprised to see several vegan options and couldn't help but try a couple of small plates. Tapas, after all, are among my favorites. The charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs was among my choices and I enjoyed it, however, the parsley was a bit too heavy. The Cornichons which I had not had before, taste similar to pickles and were an interesting and satisfying pairing to the cauliflower. For my second dish I had the fried Brussels sprouts which I have had before. While they were good, I preferred them with cranberries or better yet, not fried but rather sautéed. Be prepared for communal seating. If you're good with cozying up toward a stranger you'll do fine here. I dined solo and a friendly family made me feel right at home with nice conversation. I cannot help but miss my fiancé who couldn't make this trip."
"My sister and I were here for a couple of days and absolutely knew that we HAD to try this place! Safe to say it definitely lived up to our expectations-- great service, delicious food, inviting atmosphere. We made the wise choice to go on a Monday night right after St. Patty's Weekend festivities so when we got there around 5, we were seated immediately with more than plenty of seats around us.We ordered the pig ear with crispy kale, roasted cauliflower with breadcrumbs and cornichons, the bone marrow with herb smear (OF COURSE), the 30 hour wagyu, the milk braised pork shoulder, and the pork neck bone gravy. We also ordered both the white and red sangrias.All the dishes were delicious, but our particular favorite was the pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled peppers and fried egg! I am drooling just thinking about it T__T Our server was very knowledgeable and really nice and accomodating. The staff were really on top of their game, constantly changing out our plates and utensils after we finished each dish! I would definitely come back here, though I must warn that it CAN be a little bit too rich, thus the knocked off one star. I guess its a personal preference though - eat to your own tummy's delight!"
I saw the great reviews of this place and then had a family member who is from the area recommend it to me as well. My boyfriend is particularly picky when it comes to food so wasn't sure if he would like it though but decided to give it a try.. we were both so glad we did! It just might just be the best food we had while we were in Chicago and we had lots of good food. It's tapas style so you'll want to share a few plates between everyone. The milk braised pork shoulder was my favorite of what we tried but everything was wonderful. Also the staff was very attentive and our waiter was wonderful in helping us pick dishes to try. Do your self a favor and make this a stop when your in Chicago!
"Came here with a group of 6. Here's what we tried:Pork fried almondsRaw corn, tomato and arugula pestoOlive oil poached tunaCured troutBobota Greek cornbreadChorizo stuffed olivesBone marrowBeef tendon chipsPigs earPork heartPrawn & sweetbreads sausageFried deviled eggLoukoumadesMy favorites were the crispy pork ear and the almonds, but everything was awesome. Service is wonderful and chances are that your wait will be shorter than what you're quoted, so plan accordingly to stay near the area. A great way to try new things with your friends! Just watch out for the alcohol prices."
"Yum! A little pretentious and unwelcoming for a single, but the food was amazing."
I went to the Purple Pig the other day on a first date. Be prepared to wait about 45min to an hour and a half. While you wait you can order drinks. Drink service seemed to be a bit slow since it was packed but we didn't mind.Now I have had tapas before so I knew what to expect. However the seating area is tiny. Not the best for a first date. You may not get a private table. Instead they have these long tables for parties to sit at. We had a lovely German family next to us that did give us any trouble.The food was amazing. Lots to try. That is the beauty of tapas places.I would recommend the following. All where yummy!-Salt-roasted Beets with goat cheese (must have)-Chorizo Stuffed Olives (must have)-Pigs Ear-Roasted Bone Marrow-Razor Clams-Octopus (must have)-Pork shoulder (which is very tender)You will have a good time and leave full.
"Get the corn dish!! Dooooo it! You will thank me. I know the menu often changes, but I got it on 9/21. My friend and I loved it so much, we each brought home another order! Freakin' awesome. It's this raw corn/pesto/tomato thing and I could eat it all day. You're welcome!"
"I'd heard all about the pork-lover's paradise known as the Purple Pig (nice alliteration!) long before my recent trip to Chicago.  Apparently, folks come from miles around and wait in endless lines to taste its pork-alicious treats.  When I learned that the Purple Pig was literally right next door to my hotel -- and I was able to score weekday lunch reservations for 2 at the last nanosecond -- I knew the stars had properly aligned.My friend and I arrived at noon sharp.  We were seated on the high patio, with a view of the alley below.  (Some might call this view a dynamic urban landscape, while others might think it's dank and depressing.  I'll leave that decision up to you.)We began with drinks, of course.  My friend had a glass of Chardonnay, while I sipped on a refreshing gin fizz cocktail.  We quickly ran out of booze early in the meal, because our indecisive selves spent way too much time looking over the (ridiculously long and complicated) menu.We finally settled on a few items to split and share... and yes, they were all pork-based.  (Go big or go home, right?)FIRST -- deep-fried pig ears with crispy kale, pickled peppers, and fried egg.  I'd never had pig ears prior to this, and, unfortunately, I still don't see the appeal.  It's just deep-fried gristle with tons of salt.  I preferred the kale and egg more than the pig ears themselves.SECOND -- porchetta panini with salsa verde.  I loved the fatty porchetta, which held its own against the spicy and fragrant salsa verde.  I was especially impressed at how the salsa verde was baked into the bread itself.THIRD -- Milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  Now this was the rock star of the meal.  This was the juiciest and most tender preparation of pork I'd ever had.  And those mashed potatoes?  There was probably more butter than actual potato there.  Pure indulgence.We wanted to try a dessert...but we just couldn't.  Even after sharing three average-sized plates, we practically had to be rolled out of there.Service was fine, if a bit stiff and impersonal.  I don't expect much else at a restaurant in the heart of the tourist zone that probably gets zero regulars.The verdict?  If you love pork, you *must* visit this the Purple Pig.  I'm not entirely sold on the concept (yet), but I might be convinced to return for a another pork-gasm."
"Southern table at its best!Right on Michigan ave. This place is always packed with both locals and tourist. They sit you in a big table and most likely you'll be dining among strangers... Octoberfest style. That give's you the opportunity to peek around an decide what you will order.The menu is wide in variaty but most of the dishes... as you can expect... has pork in it. It's hard to recomend an specific one, because they all look and are very delicious. But I would start with a Belhaven dark beer and then just follow your heart.Service is good, but it has room for inprovement. Sizes are fair for city prices, you can expect to send around $50 per person, but with enough food to fill you up.The place is also clean and the atmosphere is young and casual. Perfect for a Friday night after work meet spot.It's a most in Chicago for sure."
"I just had an 8-minute foodgasm eating the meatballs!! The food here is EPIC!!!!! They don't take reservations, so come early. If you can't, then hang out by the bar. It's SOooooo worth the wait!"
"A hip and trendy restaurant located in Downtown Chicago, the Purple Pig serves tapas style dishes that's sure to wow all the foodies. Because this place is fairly new, it took over 2 hours for us to get a seat. Famished from a long day of activities, such feelings I had my party did not know we could feel in the amount of time--hunger, deliriousness, desperation and finally acceptance. While waiting, we decided to split a couple bottles of wine. Yes, drinking before we even got into the restaurant, but maybe that's how Socal girls do it. Just kidding, we were just super hungry and figured sipping on wine would help us forget our hunger. It was awesome how diverse their wine menu was in terms of vineyards and pricing. Definitely makes it all the more tempting to enjoy a bottle or two when you're here. When we finally got seated, we've had plenty of time to decide what we were going to eat. These were the following items we got: *Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - My favorite part of the night! Crispy fried pigs ears and baked kale that tasted just like chips. This is a must-try for all you fried food lovers out there. *Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Perhaps there's something wrong with me. This is the second time I've had bone marrow and again, I just couldn't enjoy it. Everyone else had no problem eating it, so maybe I just have some weird aversion to bone marrow. This was served with thick slices of garlic bread and large sea salt to accompany the bone marrow. *Foie Gras & Membrillo - The foie gras was also served with bread, but the pieces actually resembled bruschetta more. There was also jam to complement the foie gras. This dish was just okay, though not really memorable. There wasn't a lot of flavor in the foie gras, so I'm not quite seeing what the hype is over it in general.*Proscuitto Stuffed Squid  - You got your proscuitto and you got your squid. Can't really go wrong here. *Cheese platter of various cheesesI'd love to return here some day but I'd probably order other items on the menu. There were so many other dishes that I wanted to try. And I'd definitely try to come on a weekday instead of during a weekend holiday."
"I took a couple friends here who were in town for the weekend. We went on a Friday afternoon at about 4:30pm, and we waited about 15 minutes before we were seated (the quoted us 30 min). We ordered the Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil; Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive, & Agrodolce; and Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. Everything was absolutely delicious from the way the turkey leg melted in your mouth to the smashed potatoes. My only complaint was that I was rather excited to try razor clams for the first time, and I'm pretty certain they were just regular clams. The server was also polite, but didn't check up on us very often. The food, though, is phenomenal."
"Food was really amazing here, the octopus appetizer, was the best, very interesting  plates"
"Favorite tapas in Chicago! Especially recommend the beetroot Gorgonzola salad, Brussel sprouts and any of their bread/spread combos."
"Amazing! So, so, so good. Our server was kind and knowledgeable and gave us awesome suggestions, all of which we loved. The portions were perfect for sharing and the flavors were incredible. The wine was delicious as well and we left very happy! We shared: the shaved Brussels sprouts salad, pig's ear with crispy kale, pork neck bone with ricotta, and milk braised pork shoulder. The flavors in each dish were carefully thought out and perfectly placed together.  A beautiful explosion of flavors in every bite. So, SO glad we have the unique menu a chance! Can't wait to come back here again!"
"After a few mishaps of poor planning and poor time management, we finally got to eat here with a wait time of 45 minutes. The first two times we tried to eat here, the wait was 1.5 hours and 2 hours, so plan ahead! Put your name down and then go shopping. Or, you can order cocktails in their waiting area.I believe this was my first time having Mediterranean tapas. A lot of cheese and meat, of course. I don't have anything to which to compare this meal but I enjoyed it. Don't come here if you're a vegan - you will eat nothing. Thankfully, I am only vegetarian so I was able to eat the grilled cheese and fried smashed potatoes. Both were amazing. There was some sweet tomato jam that came with the grilled cheese - it was really good. It was a blend of cheeses - chef's choice. I don't know my cheeses well enough to tell you what was in it, so this review probably isn't helpful.Overall ambiance - it's a little loud because there are so many people. The outdoor seating area is nice though the view isn't great. Waiter was extremely courteous and knowledgable."
"If you love charcuterie and pate, this the the place for you. Arrived at 11am and there was already a line to get in. Line moved quickly to be seated; the place was packed at 11:05. I sat at the bar where everyone was friendly, offering to share plates. Everything we had was delicious. Service at bar was very good. Overall great experience."
"LOVE this place. Servers are extra nice and really know what they're talking about when it comes to wine and the food served. They don't take reservations, which could be a potential problem for some. Personally, I haven't had any problems with getting in immediately or having a really long wait. Try the pigs ear! You won't be disappointed."
"Just an awesome spot to grab some share plates, people watch, have a glass of wine and lurk. Pork Shoulder OUTSTANDINGCauliflower AMAZING - yeah, I said it. The Cauliflower. Had some additional meats and cheeses and all were excellent. Service was also terrific. Just go eat here asap."
"This place doesn't take reservations and is so popular that you could be waiting for a while - 2 hours to be exact! - before you're seated. My friends and I planned to eat here during our last night in Chicago so around 5pm my friend called to check the wait time and was told the wait was already 2 hours long!! Crazy, but maybe not all that crazy since its so popular. Thankfully, we were already in the area so we walked over to the Purple Pig to put down our name and number. The Purple Pig is at the Magnificent Mile so I recommend walking the area like we did and doing a little shopping while waiting - that will definitely pass the time.The seating style at the Purple Pig is communal and the atmosphere is loud so you may find it hard to hear what your friends are telling you. My boyfriend likes to think that the place was intended to be a bar because it has that kind of look and feel to it.The 6 of us ordered a variety of dishes to share and they were all delicious!From what I do remember we ordered the following, although the name of the dish is most likely not what I use below:Salt and Vinegar Beef Tendon ChipsBurrataCornbreadPig EarBone MarrowSummer Squash SaladPorkMixed seafood dish, the sauce went so well with breadEverything was prepared so well and tasted very delicious, but if there is one thing that I recommend it is the Bone Marrow. I've never had it before and I'm ready to go back to Chicago to eat it the way they prepare it here again."
"I had to come to The Purple Pig because of the over 3,000 reviews. I tried the most popular dishes, roasted bone marrow, pig ears, and octopus.Roasted Bone Marrow - 3/5 stars. Nice toasted bread. There were about total 6 breads but 2 were overly burned on the back side. Well-cooked on the roasted bone marrow but nothing special to me. Pig ears - 1/5 stars. I like the overall presentation on this pig ears however, the pickled cherry peppers were too SALTY. Just too SALTY. I do not know how other people eat all of this dishes. I drank a lot of water.Octopus - 4.5 stars. Actually this is the only dish I enjoyed in this place. Despite the sizzling was little bit salty, I had to say the octopus was so soft and delicious. I was wondering if this octopus was cooked in a secret recipe. Or the chef had a great skills."
"I don't know if I'm giving Purple Pig only 3 stars because I went towards the end of my Chicago trip and I basically compared it to everything I already ate but I really did not think it was that good.I understand that Midwest food is generally more salty and fatty but most of the food here was just way too salty and heavy for my taste. The meh:Crispy pig ears weren't that good, just dry and salty.Bone marrow was a salt bomb and not that good. The bread that came with it was WAY too hard to even eat.The good:Charred cauliflower - just crispy and flavorful enoughOctopus with green beans, salsa verde and fingerling potatoes - I loved the zesty flavors, I couldn't stop eating this Pork ribs with pomegranate dressing - I can't find this on the menu currently but THIS WAS THE BEST THING EVER. There was some tendon sandwiched between the rib meat which made it special. The dish was sweet and soooo tender, if they have this, you MUST order it.I would come back to re-order the things I liked and try other dishes but after having high expectations, I was definitely dissapointed. I felt like I needed a bolus and some blood pressure medication after I left. Their prime location is a huge plus and you should get there early to avoid waiting in the cold."
"Have to say I really enjoyed The Purple Pig - it is my kind of place. A fun and bustling atmosphere, great decor and fantastic food. Tapas can always be a hit or miss affair but the purple pig does not disappear. The meatball sliders were fantastic as well as the shoulder - it was cooked to perfection. The meat dishes are not all that is good, they can pull off a convincing salad and dessert. One only thing and this can be considered to be picky - is that some of the dishes are too small to be shared. For example the Devil Egg - though fantastic - it is only one egg to share. Highly suggest if you like pork to try this place out."
"I ventured downtown with my wife this weekend for something a little different and this place certainly fit the bill. Swanky, exotic and a bit pricey, but worth it if you are looking for a unique experience. The server was knowledgeable and helped us select some exotic cheeses that I have never heard of for a platter. Although I probably can't remember the name of any of them, all were really awesome and tasty. We came in at 11pm and it was an ideal cross between restaurant/lounge/ritzy club. The grilled octopus was great and I didn't partake, but my wife loved the crepes for dessert."
"The Purple Pig was fantastic. From the level of service, to the atmosphere to the delicious food, everything lined up perfectly.This was our first meal in Chicago and it did not disappoint. We had the beets with whipped goat cheese, which was great and improved as the tastes mixed. Also had the Greek cornbread which was a fantastic mix of Greek flavours with American cornbread. The chorizo stuffed olives were also tasty along with the fried manchego cheese. We also had the prosciutto stuffed squid and bone marrow which by itself would have made the meal great. Second time having bone marrow and it was incredibly rich. Along with 3 courses of dessert, our bill came out to be $100, which was very reasonable given the amount of food we ate.  Absolutely will return during this trip and would recommend for anybody near the Magnificent Mile."
Went on a Wednesday evening for starters and drinks. Seems like the place to be seen. Cramped space and loud. Service and food were both just OK.
"Solid 3.5 stars.We came here for lunch and decided to do family style so we would be able to sample a variety of dishes. Ordered: The menu is extensive, but good thing I had locals who were dining with me. Tuscan Kale & Romaine Caesar Salad With Soft Boiled Quail Egg & House Cured Anchovies: 4/5 Wow!! This dish was absolutely amazing--Probably not the healthiest salad, but deliciousPork Osso Bucco with Soft Polenta & Gremolata: 3.5/5, good but I won't be ordering it next time. Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes: 3/5 eh, a little too salty for my liking.Berkshire Pork Chop with Fava Salata & Horta: 5/5 My favorite dish"
"Good place to eat! we had to wait for 20 min to get a seat, but it was worth it. We got an octopus, squid and a piece of bread with something and egg on top of it. Satisfied!  :) will come again to try other menu."
"Was in Chicago for the international housewares show and every person we asked for recommendations, Purple Pig was the first thing anyone said.Got a reservation for later on a Monday.  We walked in and we were actually able to sit at the bar (which I prefer normally)  Tried too many things to single out anything in particular but everything was spot on and as a whole everything lived up to the hype.Going back for sure next time I'm in chicago."
"Dishes are way too salty, still feels weird 4 hours after dinner, drinking a lot of water now. For people who likes light food, not a good choice. The place is packed, seems very popular, but it's too noisy to me, need to raise my voice when talking to my friends."
"Their paninis are huge! Flavor is good, but seemed to be a little too much sauce in mine. Really inexpensive and casual but very much classy place.Service was great at dinner one night, but so bad when I went to get lunch to go the next day that I just left."
We let our waiter pick some meats and cheeses for us. Really fun to try new things that I wouldn't normally  pick myself. Also got the bone marrow.  Served with soft toasted bread. Really enjoyed  it! Great wine selection.
"The Purple Pig never disappoints. Amazing food! Each bite is a burst of flavor, no matter what you get on the menu! Its always on point. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is a foodie and doesn't mind trying new things!!!"
Soooo delicious and super nice service. You wouldn't think to go in from just passing by on the street but it is worth it. Try the stuffed squid and the grilled cheese...Sooo good. They make their own mix of cheese and it is like nothing else I have ever tasted. The sauce the squid comes in is delicious. Really beautiful interior and cool covered outdoor patio. Loved this place!!
A hidden gem hidden in downtown Chicago for all the wine lovers with great variety of bar food. Must have the spreads. The pork neck bone gravy is bomb! For desert you have to try the Sicilian Iris.
Food tasted way too salty last time we ate here. Waits are also a deterrent for me coming here at regular meal times
"The Purple Pig is an excellent place to try comforting small plate foods focused on pork.  I especially liked the pig's ear which wasn't as good as my late father's.  Other favorites were octopus, pig's tail, pork sweetbread, mussels, braised pork shoulder, lamb loin salad, etc.  I don't remember all the dishes that were ordered, but everything was tasty.  They have a good wine selection and outdoor seating is available.  Our server was most helpful in making recommendations."
"We came around 6 on a Thursday and there was no line. We ordered the bone marrow, pork shoulder, wagyu sirloin tips and fried pig ears. My favorite were the wagyu sirloin tips. They were medium rare and perfect. The sides were seared with extra saltiness. Even the veggies in that dish were good. The meat was tender and naturally flavored. I also really likes the fried pig ears and kale but it was super oily and the kale was a little too salty. The jalapeños added extra flavor to the plate so it took away a little of the saltiness. The bone marrow came with cilantro, capers and salt. The cilantro and capers added lots of extra flavor to the bone marrow. I didn't think the salt was necessary. The pork should was really flavorful and tender. We didn't need a knife to eat it. But it was really salty, to the point where it was hard to eat. I would definitely come back here."
"I was gonna order Chinese food takeouts but they couldn't deliver to my hotel. So naturally, I went on Yelp and this place seemed interesting. So glad I got to try this! The interior was fun and the food was spot on. Although it's on the salty side, we enjoyed every plate. I loved the bone marrow, the octopus dish was also cool. I didn't like the pig ear too much but the crispy kale that came with it was sooo good! We ordered another pork dish and it was solid as well.Overall great atmosphere and great food!"
"Love this place for after work happy hours. Delicious tapas-style options. Tiny, crowded space, but you can drink wine outside while you wait for a table!"
"Follow everyone else's review.  Its worth it.  Go early and get your name on the reservation list and expect to wait.  I repeat...EXPECT TO WAIT.  But its worth it.  The same way its worth it to wait in line for Violet Hour is the same way its worth it to wait in line for Purple Pig.Wine:The list is extensive and your server will help you with the different regions they are from.  Our server was fantastic.  He brought me three different tastes of red wine before I found the one  I enjoyed.  It was a 100% tempranillo.  Check it out if you go.  Beautiful, bold, with a nice finish.  Not too long, but long enough to appreciate it.Food:To die for.  We had the eggplant schmear, muscles, and a squash salad.  We could not stop eating!  And it was a lot of food for my boyfriend and I.  Id suggest only getting two dishes to share.  It was more than enough food for two people.  We sat at the bar and watched the magic happen.  Their chef is on it and so are all of those line cooks.  I think they forgot our muscles because we received it 15min after we finished the other food, but it was ok.  We were so full anyway of wine and nummies that we had a bite or two and took the rest home.Ambiance:Super cute place.  Its loud and crowded but once you get your seat, cozy up, be happy, and deal with the crowd.  The service, drinks, and food are worth it.  The decor is lovely, the lighting is low and makes for a warm unique feel.Service:I felt for those servers, I dont know how they traverse through the crowd, but they do.  And its appreciated.  If you are reading this, I appreciate you.  The place is packed and my server still got me three tasting as I was deciding what wine to order.  That is feat in itself.Price:The cost is not too bad.  Id say as low as $8 and goes up to $20sth or so.  Everything is worth it so just order.  Our bill was probably around $70sth with wine, three plates, and tax and tip.  Great night out for two in my opinion.Dont walk RUN to this place.  Ill be running right next to you to get there."
"Been here twice now. Came one on my own because well... I just had to try it. Had the Pig ears with crispy kale which was good but probably not my fave because it just tasted like... fried/crunchy/crispy batter. I also had taken the Sicilian Iris to go to have later on. That was delicious (but I am a chocoholic by nature).Also had the beets with the whipped goat cheese. That was probably my favorite.Came back here a few months later for a business lunch. I was able to try a lot more things this time. We had both the same items as above, we had the tuna (decent... maybe a little more cooked than I'd like (I prefer sushi tuna), the bone marrow was excellent, and brussel sprout salad which was delicious and fresh.I would like to come back again with friends and maybe during dinner where we can order some of the meat dishes. It's hard to enjoy food over business with vendors since you're chatting most of the time and you clearly don't want to pig out. :) Sit outside when the weather is better. It's nice during the Fall months. Summer would be even better!"
"This place was definitely worth the wait. We waited for about an hour and 45 minutes for bar seats. The bartender was very helpful in suggesting several dishes. The pork shoulder, pigs ears and bone marrow are a must try. Everything was delicious. Well worth the wait"
"Outstanding!I arrived here around 3 on a Saturday afternoon in a group of 3 expecting to wait an hour before being seated. We ended up waiting only about 20 minutes before we were seated at a big shared table with some other people - awesome. The waiter took his sweet time to come by and then take out order, but it is a very busy place and I don't blame him. We ordered: Salt roasted beets w goat cheese - so unique and delicious. A cold dish of tangy beets and pistachios mellowed out with a healthy dollop of the whipped goat cheese. Greek cornbread - I loved this! Only $6 for a sweet/savory treat. The feta on this cornbread is some of the best I've had, and it's balanced perfectly with the sweet honey and savory bread. Everyone should try this. Squid stuffed w prosciutto - beautiful dish. Squid was cooked well, stuffing was mostly breadcrumbs with some crispy prosciutto morsels, texture was a little surprising. Good, but not amazing. Lamb blade steak - possibly my favorite dish of the night. The meat on this steak is ridiculously juicy, and is served in a citrusy sauce. Seriously falling off the bone delusions. Highly recommend. Pineapple ribs - so, so succulent. The pineapple glaze is delicious and the pork is full of flavor. The pork has a delightful crispy skin and the meat is crazy tender. I can't wait to come back here and try more plates!!"
"This is what you get when you throw in a bunch of visionaries and all star Chefs in one kitchen, a Streamline of greatness!  I don't know how you play your board games, I play mine with meat and cheese accompanied by a glass of robust red.  Bustling location with an amazing stretched out patio.  Get Porked here"
"We went in February, and it was about a 2 hr wait for a party of 6....that turned into a 3 hr wait. Once we got seated the service was amazing, and the food was fantastic. I'll definitely be back!!"
"I'm so glad I was able to check out this delicious gem in Chicago. I don't know if the stars aligned for us but 4 of us came here on a Thurs night and were initially told we'd have a 40 min wait. Well, we decided that alas we may have to go elsewhere but after a quick run to the bathroom before searching for a new place to hang out we miraculously got seats! It was a long shared bar height table which was comfortable enough though I did bump elbows twice with the stranger next to me. Food: We weren't here for dinner so only shared two plates while we enjoyed our drinks, but both were delicious. Fried pig ears and prosciutto stuffed squid. Love the creative menu. They tell you it's Mediterranean inspired but I would say it's heavy on the ""inspired"" which I have absolutely no problem with. Drinks: Apparently known for their cocktails this place did not disappoint. My sangria blanca was amazing. Probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had, but I'm not an avid drinker so take that for what it's worth. The other 3 people enjoyed their drinks as well.Service: Satisfactory. Our waitress was friendly enough, she gave us suggestions on what to order and checked back on us regularly, which is all I really ask for in a server.It's a little on the pricey side, but I think it's definitely worth it from the drinks and food to the pleasant service and ambiance. I had a great time and would love to come back again. It's on Michigan ave though so parking is quite expensive, I was lucky enough to find a metered spot a couple blocks away but it might add up if you end up waiting to get seated."
"What a cool spot!!! Traveled to Chicago from LA and man do I wish we had one of these back home. We went with a group of about 15 and all spent about  $20 each. Fun tapas type restaurant with lots of pork dishes(hence the name). I normally don't eat meat-- but splurged today. The pigs ear with kale and a fried egg was my favorite. Also the braised short rib. So flavorful!!! This place is a must, if your in Chicago. Prime location, and GREAT service. always filling up our drinks and taking good care of us."
"Took my mom to eat here a few weeks ago- to celebrate her birthday when she came in town. She is from Ohio and never had food like this. The waitress was extremely friendly and recommended a great bottle of wine for us. We got five delicious rounds of food - including the Pork Neck gravy with Ricotta, the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, the Turkey Leg Confit with Napa Cabbage and some salad plates - and two desserts. They even put a candle in the cheesecake for my mom!The service was unbelievably wonderful, the family style seating led to great conversations, and the food was beyond perfect."
Came here on a Sunday and there was already a line by the time we got there at 11:15 AM and the place opened at 11:30 AM. We managed to snag a a spot not too far down the line and was able to get a table right away. The place was full by the time we were ready to order! We had the following:1. Chorizo stuffed olives- they were good but not great.2. Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes- overheard the lady sitting at the next table say this was her favorite dish by far.. It was good but I would say the best part of the dish was the mashed potatoes.3. pig's ear with crispy kale- this was one of the more tastier dishes that we tried but it was a little too salty. 4. bone marrow- this was the best out of the 4 dishes we tried. It is a really popular item on their menu and you eat it with bread. I thought the food was good but it seems like the flavors weren't very bold. The chef definitely took the safe route on the cooking style. Much preferred the Girl and the Goat!
"I was in Chicago for a long weekend, and heard so much good stuff about Purple Pig that I was determined to go there. Made it there at 12pm on a Thursday, right before the restaurant had started filling up, so my friend and I managed to grab a table indoors. The place was a little cramped and we could hear bits of the other table's conversation, but that was not too big an issue.We started off with the olive oil poached tuna, which was light and refreshing, and at the same time tangy. The chunks of white tuna were chewy and had great texture. While this dish had a good balance of flavors, it paled in comparison to the other appetizer we ordered, which is the crispy pig's ear with kale. This dish was topped with a sunny side up egg, fried just to the right degree so the yolk was runny enough to be mixed with the dish. The pig's ear was interesting, deep fried and oh-so-sinful. It was slightly salty, but extremely flavorful. Together with the crunchy kale, it was extremely addicting and we polished off the dish.For our entrees, we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder. This dish was very rich, you can taste the creaminess of the milk in sauce. The pork was tender and well cooked. I also liked the plating, as they served this dish in a mini skillet. We also ordered the Wagyu sirloin tip. This is my favorite dish. It came in a perfect medium rare, topped with horseradish (of which I am a big fan) and drizzled with a bone marrow vinaigrette. The combination was interesting, but worked well.The Purple Pig definitely did not disappoint! I'll be back if I find myself in Chicago again - tip: come earlyish for lunch to grab a table!"
"Ok I have to admit...The food was great but way too salty. The chef must have been in love or something, but please bring down the saltiness a bit and it will be a marvelous. I mean we ordered five different dishes and every single one of them was salty...very disappointed. Will not be coming back again."
"I wasn't a fan of the food, but I did like the ambience and flavor. I though their tag line -- ""wine, swine, and cheese"" -- was super cute!FOOD- Eggplant Caponata: My favorite dish of the night. The dip itself is flavorful. It comes with bread that has goat cheese spread on it. The combination is to die for. If I could only get one thing, I would get this- Charred Cauliflower: Also a great start. Not as good as the caponato but the cauliflower was cooked just the right amount to add a crispy texture. There was also a nice lemon tinge- Chicken Kebab: Super bland - the chicken itself was juicy but there was absolutely no flavoring!- Sicilian Iris: This ricotta filled fried donut is apparently this is the house specialty. Unfortunately, it is entirely forgettable. Try something else for dessert.SERVICE/AMBIENCEThis is really what you're paying for. The servers are very friendly and super helpful. Service is quick. The restaraunt is tiny, but it lends a cozy atmosphere. The outdeer seating is adorable. Keep in mind you might be ""sharing"" a table with another party, but I kind of liked it. I could see what looked delicious and figure out what to order!Tips+ They do not take reservations. Plan accordingly+ Its tapas style -- get about 2-3 dishes per person+ Be ready for exotic pig meat -- bone marrow, ears, etc."
"Purple Pig was recommended to me by a friend who had been there before.Kudos to the person who wrote their menu, because just by reading the menu you feel like eating half of the things they offer.We were in a group of 4, and were seated on the communal table, which I thought it was great. One of my friends is really uptight and she made some new friends and even shared dessert with them!!! We had a lot of things: turkey lag, eggplant, Greek salad, short ribs, bone marrow.Turkey leg was the best turkey leg I've ever had, and I am a sucker for turkey legs! And the short ribs were perfectly seasoned and came with a red sauce that went perfectly with it!!!They don't get 5 stars because they don't take reservations.Would definitely go back if I lived in Chicago!"
"I brought friends back to the PP when I was in town last month and we had a lovely meal despite the chilly May temperatures; those heaters on the patio do their job. It was our 2nd try; the 1st time the wait on a Friday night was 2.5 hours. Mid afternoon on a Saturday, it was only about 30 minutes.I had the cauliflower again and it was still delish and we shared an asparagus salad that was AMAZING. And fried eggplant balls which were really good and made me forget my tendency to dislike eggplant. We had the feta and bread again and it was still huge but I this time there were 3 of us. Plus my friends got the pork shoulder and said it was tender and yummy.The wine list is good with something for everyone. I wish the staff wasn't so...not really snooty but disinterested maybe? I guess I'm just used to the warmth of the servers in NOLA."
We ordered pig ear with crispy kale -Sooo delish you couldnt even tell its a pig's ear. I dont eat veggie but the kale is crispy and juicy. We had pineapple glazed steak --- meat is sooo tender. We had to wait for the milk braised pork shoulder but it was worth it! Def will go back and recommend to friends. Love this place!
"FOOD here is an amazing experience. be prepared to wait and squeeze in. the space is pretty packed with lots of foot traffic. there's outdoor seating but it looks pretty cramped out there too. we had a great waitress that essentially picked out all the items for us. it was our first time and had no idea what to order. first off, the wine was sooo good and i regret not taking a picture of the label. now i will never know. :(everything is meant to be shared and we had a lot of pig-pig jowls (my favorite dish)-fried pig ears-pig neck spread- short ribsLOVE LOVE LOVE. will be back next time i visit chicago!"
"Ugh... I think I may be burned in effigy by the entire Chicago Yelp community, but I did NOT like Purple Pig.... ::ducks::We attempted to go here twice while visiting Chicago.  Luckily it was a few blocks down from our hotel.  Our first attempt was on the Saturday of St Pat's and it was just a nuthouse all over the city.  They don't take reservations and we just came at a bad time.  We tried again on Monday for lunch with better luck.The first thing I noticed is this place is SMALL and they PACK those tables in!  There was a poor woman trying to get around in a wheelchair...  I felt really bad for her and I have no idea how they even accomodated her.  They have a bunch of outdoor seating, so if you come in the summer, you may have better luck with getting a table.Upon opening the menu, we decided to splurge and get some wine.  They had a really good wine and beer selection and they have plenty of affordable wine options.  For our meal, we ordered a bunch of things.  These few stick out in my mind:Charred cauliflower with cornichons:  I did NOT like this dish.  It had a bit of a sour taste (probably from the cornichons) that I didn't like.Eggplant caponata:   I was expecting more of a baba ghanoush and this was more of a tomato sauce with pieces of eggplant swimming in it.  It came with grilled bread with a goat cheese spread that was tasty, but I wasn't a fan of the dip itself.Salad with carrots and farro:  I LOVED this dish.  I wish I had ordered just this.  It was amazing.  I think their salads change with the seasons, but I recommend trying one- they give you a decent sized portion as well.Stuffed squid:  Ugh, I am gagging thinking about this.  I'm a huge fan of calamari and I like it grilled more than I like it fried (unlike a lot of people) but something about the seasoning on this was not good.  And they had this sauce made from the ink that was just unappetizing.  Yuck.Smashed potatoes with goat cheese:  These were amazing.  But if you can't fry potatoes and serve them with a cheese sauce, you should probably quit being a chef.  Regardless, they were delicious.  BTW- what is up with all the goat cheese here?  Yikes!Overall, I felt like The Purple Pig was a little expensive for a meal that I wasnt blown away by.  However I think we may have ordered a little bit too much, which may have made the last few dishes a little unappetizing. Also, I am not the hugest meat person so we stuck with more of the veg-friendly options, which may not be the stars of the show here?"
"When people say they have to wait to be seated, they're are not joking. We had a group of five and came here at 6:30p on a Tuesday. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to be seated.But when we were seated, everything was amazing!! Our waitress helped us pick our wine and cheeses and also highlighted her favorite things with a legit highlighter on our menu. We ordered 3 cheeses, the scallops, the octopus, the milk braised pork ribs, the pork ears, the short rib, the chicken kabob, the bone marrow, and 2 more dishes.Hands down, the milk braised pork ribs had the best flavor mixed with tenderness that I've never encountered before. Second best for me were the scallops- juicy and delicious... But there were only three. And our third favorite was a tie between the octopus and the chicken kabob. The octopus was marinated so well and the chicken kabobs sauce was also unreal. On top of all that, out waitress parishes an amazing Greek wine with our food!!"
"The Purple Pig would normally be my kind of restaurant -- Mediterranean-inspired small plates with a great beer and wine list. The perfect place to gather with friends for a fun night of sybaritic eating and drinking. But somehow the food and service just did not quite live up to my expectations.The Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers, and Fried Egg sounds amazing, but it was actually really oily and salty. And heavy. The cherry peppers helped to cut through the rich unctuousness of the fried elements, as well as the egg, but much to my surprise and disappointment, I could not manage more than a handful of flavorful bites before the oil started to get to me.The Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta was delicious -- rich and deep with porcine goodness -- but like the pig's ear, it was also on the salty side. I definitely needed the grilled bread. I just wish that it wasn't so oily as well.Finally, my rather rushed and apathetic server recommended a Burgundy to go with my food, but I actually didn't think it paired very well. Something along the lines of a Barbera or Sangiovese would have been much better."
"Way too popular for its own good.  We showed up on Sunday night (they don't take reservations). It was a madhouse. We were told that the wait was an hour and a half. OK...  We got on the list, and tried to check out the bar area to see if we could enjoy a cocktail as we waited for our name to be called. In the process, my wife was almost run over by a waitress, who not only didn't apologize but actually gave her attitude because she had the audacity to be in her way!  We understand you're busy, but you don't have to be a jerk about it. We left and found another place to enjoy the evening."
"********************* 1109  ********************    The famous The Purple Pig, with gazillion of reviews, I'll make it short. Located onThe Magnificent Mile next to the Marriott Hotel, The Purple Pig is a collaboration of Chefs Scott Harris of Mia Francesca, Tony Mantuano of Spiaggia, Jimmy Bannos and Jimmy Bannos Jr. of Heaven on Seven. Featuring housemade charcuterie, cheeses and classic Mediterranean fare, and an extensive Italian focused and  and reasonable wine list.     I love Spiaggia restaurant, when 1 of my first FAV chef Adam Sobel (now RN74), took me there while he was working at the late Charlie Trotter restaurant. Then I got to check out chef  Tony Mantuano cafe at the Chicago Museum of Art. So this visit was long over due.      I came in on a Sunday afternoon, the place was packed like sardines. I wonder why there was so many guys in here... Arrr the 35th  annual International Mr. Leather moves to the Magnificent Mile at the Marriott Hotel   International Mr. Leather competition--with accouterments, goods and services;  which draws thousands of leather daddies, rubber-suited men and other fetish folk from around the world. It was happening next door on Memorial's day weekend, no wonder. There was absolutely no seats. I ended up at the communal table, it was so tight, that every time I move the fork or knife, I hit the guys next to me!!!!   Then came the another group of people sat next to me, they kept pushing our dishes over. Absolutely wasn't a pleasant way to wine and dine. We hurried up and left, packed some of the food to go. It was a MAD HOUSE with tourists like myself and the locals.    Amazing charcuterri and cheese selection here. - Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano, love- Purple Pig Platter, just do it, if you are carnivore. You got to try all their in-house meat, it went perfect with their E. Pira & Figli ""Chiara Boschis"" Cannubi, Barolo- Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta, it was 1 of their popular dish, this dish was too salty for my taste bud, although the meat was tender.- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - seems to be popular around here, but I had it better in the San Francsico Bay Area. It's a 2 giant half bones, peppercorn, parsley, sea salt and grilled brioche, very generous potion.- Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic with Grated Egg & Parsley - it was good and full of flavor.- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, the pig ear was crunchy, the kale was crispy but oily.      Service was good and efficient, the servers and bus boys work very hard to make sure their guests enjoy the visit, but the restaurant this packed, and tiny jammed seats, on the first weekend that Chicago got warm weather, it was just too crazy for us to dine in.     I will have to come back on a week night to enjoy the meal more.P.S. The website got so many broken pages!!!"
"Dined with my wife (and new friends) on our trip through Chicago. I was a little worried as it is situated in the heart of a prime tourist location. They take your name a text you when your table is ready (love it). We got at table family style and promptly shared stories and apps/wine/food with each other. This conversation was honestly one of our favorite experiences. Our meal started with a great wine. They seriously have an amazing wine list (even for this craft beer lover). We had: bone marrow (my first), tuna and short ribs. The purple pig sealed the deal for my blossoming love for tapas. This style has solved my over indulging tendencies. However, if someone opens a traditional tapas service style in the United States that idea may be short lived. Thanks!!"
My husband said I would enjoy the food here. We had just arrived in Chicago and I really looked forward to enjoy a nice first meal the small restaurant was crowded with 1.5 hr wait for a table. We tried our luck at the bar it was also a long wait but eventually we got seats. The menu was so varied and interesting with sections such as 'smears' and 'plancha'. While we waited a few dishes caught our eyes i asked for those we had the fried pigs ear and crispy kale topped with a fried egg the vinaigrette had the perfect acidity to balance the dish it was such a harmony I could not stop eating it the pigs ear were cut in thin strips and fried very crispy. The fried sardine with fennel salad was also excellent. The plancha-ed stuffed squids with prosciutto with a fava bean/black ink puree and chermoula dish was so amazing I could have it every day! The last dish was the smear it was a dish that could smeared on bread we had the pig neck meat slowly braised in a homemade tomato sauce and finished with ricotta it was also very tasty smeared onto toasted crusty bread. The service was excellent our bartender was so friendly and helpful he said to take our time enjoy a few dishes at a time and order as we go. Nice service! He recommended a few places to try and these places turned out excellent!!
Love the food here.  A lot of different items to try. I was there around 4pm so I didn't have problem getting a seat at the bar.  The place was hidden inside so I passed by it a couple times.
"Big fan all around!It was a little shocking to get there at 9:30 and find out there was still an hour and a half wait, but I get it now. We lurked around the bar, hoping for a spot and sure enough 20 uncomfortable minutes of dodging servers and diners looking to adjust their seats and ta da, we have a seat!Never being there, but always wanting to, I was over the moon excited and very concerned about making strategic and sound decisions. Naturally, I refer to the expert, the man behind the bar. He was excellent! Starting with the enormous drink menu, I told him what we like and what we were looking to spend. Without flinching, he made two recommendations and hit the nail on the head. Then I asked for some recommendations for the courses. He gave a perfect and concise speal (sounds like he's done this before) of his favorites and the most popular from each of the courses. We went with most popular...when in Rome...so we had the pig ears, bone marrow and waygu short ribs. My faves in order:bone marrowshort ribpig earI would most certainly return for the first two. I could probably skip the pig ears next time. It wasn't that it wasn't good, it just didn't blow me away and besides, I need to explore other options, right?! Personally, I think I prefered sitting at the bar. It was really cool to be able to see all the action behind the line. Jimmy Banos Jr. was expediting tickets (I was a bit star struck, just wish he would have talked to us. I was trying to make eyes, but either he didn't get it or wasn't impressed). Plus we got to have a very interesting conversation with a very weird and eclectic group of fellow diners. Loved this place, loved the experience. Would definitely recommend but my advise is to keep the group to under four. It's small inside."
"Got the jowl, salumi platter, and some other stuff with a bottle of pertinace nebbiolo.  That jowl with an egg on top was stupid good"
The food was great and the staff are very friendly. My only issue is the wait time and lack of reservations.
Amazing meal.  Be prepared to wait a while for a table.   Seating is communal.Stuffed squid and bone marrow were faves.  Also love that you can get 1/3 and half bottles of wine.
"Hmmm, not really sure what all the hype is about. The wait was about an hour mid afternoon, and then about 2 hours near dinner time. My bf and I put our names down, went to watch the fireworks at Navy Pier, and made it back just in time for dinner.We tried the salad (the only salad), the fried pork ears w/ crispy kale, and of course the bone marrow.The salad - extremely SALTY! Over seasoned, and then over compensated by a lemony acidic flavor. Bone marrow - two very large portions (one bone split in half) accompanied by some bread, herb mixture, and salt. Very buttery and tasty. I don't think the salt is needed at all, because the herb mixture itself is already very ""flavorful"" and it has capers in it. Between the two of use, we each got a good half of a bone - slightly too much / fatty. (Apparently a few years back, they used to serve bone marrow in smaller portions).The fried pork ears - probably the least salty of the three, comes with fried eggs, fried pork ears (kind of reminds me of eating calamari a bit), and (probably) fried kale. I feel the crispiness of the pork ear is lost by frying it, but then again, non-fried pork ear may not be so easily accepted by the masses. I also don't like how they suggest you to mixed everything up before you eat it..We sat at the bar by the open kitchen, and I spoke of the Saltiness of the food several times, and noticed that at the end of my meal, the lady making the salad started tasting her mixtures before serving it. Overall, didn't live up to my expectations."
"The food is really good, 4.5-5 stars. The service is a little slow but very friendly and they are obviously working hard and keeping busy. My husband and I ordered 7 items: 3 appetizers, 3 fried items and 1 entree. The food was brought to our table in stages and we were stuffed by the 5th item. Probably 4-5 items for 2 is sufficient. Our fave was the pig's ear/kale/egg. Also great: hot dog, peas/bacon, cornbread, all great."
"Oh man haha! This is a place not too far from my place where I live at and let me tell you that this is definitely on the list of places I've been to. Service? They've got it! Food? You bet! But it's the combination of the two that really makes this place a restaurant. My recommendations? If you're looking to eat, you can't go wrong with ordering the food, but if you happen to be there when you're thirsty (happens, right? haha!), try ordering something to drink, which really hits the spot.  But let me warn you, make sure to bring $ because it will definitely come in handy, since most things here cost money.Overall, I saw lots of people eating the pork shoulder or bone marrow, talking with friends and having fun. My only complain is eating here alone which can be hard when friends don't respond 4stars."
Very impressed with the variety of tapas and the imagination of the creators! Tasty and lots of variety. Great for a date or work meeting.
"Ordered the squid and prosciutto with breadcrumbs. Real tasty. Love the ambience of this place and their wine selection is great, was able to sit at the bar and get in and out of there fairly quickly. Great at night."
"If you love a million people within arms reach then this is the place to be.Great, ""non-conventional"" options for food. The food is a lot more filling than you may be told. Order as you go is my advice, aaaand try something that sounds weird."
"Came here on a Saturday night with a friend. We forgot to make reservations and had an hour wait. If you're in a hurry, this is not the place if you did not reservations. But, no big deal for us. The food was so worth it. My favorite was the Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans. Incredibly fresh and wonderfully prepared. Would definitely come again!"
"I must be too old, because this place is too loud. Lol. Between the loud music and the two Asian dues literally screaming at each other at the table next to us, my ears started hurting.We started with the fried eggplant Parmesan bites, and these had this strange and unexpected salty lemon flavor. By the third piece, we got used to it, but it was jarring and unpleasant.The pork leg and mashed potatoes was flavorful, but really salty and smooshy. There was no definable texture to the food besides soft. The chicken kabob over the smashed potatoes was a much larger portion than I imagined. It was  salty as well, but good-tasting. The tzatziki sauce tasted like someone had accidentally dropped an entire container of salt into the mix. It was inedible."
"I came here on NYE for lunch and had the best time ever! We waited about 30 minutes and found a spot at the bar where it's first come first serve. I love sitting at the bar so it was perfect for me and I got to see all of our food being prepared because the kitchen is attached to the bar. We ordered so many delicious things off the menu and were excited to try all of the unique items. We started off with a slice of cheese as an appetizer that went great with our wine from Spain. Then we ordered the octopus which was bursting with flavors the octopus was so huge and mixed with delicious potatoes, green beans in an oil sauce, I've never tasted anything like it before. We also had the braised pork shoulder that just melted in my mouth. My bf ordered the jamon serrano which was beautifully marbled and reminded us of Spain.  I wanted to order the bone marrow but there was no more at that point.The place was packed and it was fun sitting at the bar because we got to mingle with other patrons and check out the kitchen. I will definitely be returning to the purple pig to try more of their delicious menu items and the bone marrow. I think you need to be a little adventurous if you want to really enjoy the fabulous food here."
"So, if you like pork...you need it stop here. The wait is VERY long but is so worth it. We orders the salt roasted  beet salad, it was amazing. Also the bone marrow smear, a must try. The Sicilian iris... It was the most popular dessert item and we had to wait 20 min but yum!!!"
AMAZING! The food was perfect. The pork shoulder out of this world! The waitress wasn't that friendly in the beginning but she got a lot better. I will for sure go back and recommend this to friends!
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago!  The tapas here are incredible....unique and delicious. My favorite is the crispy pig ear.  I crave that dish. I also recommend the caesar salad. It's piled high, great dressing, and has a tiny quail egg on it.The challenge is that you want to come here with a few people, so you can all order and share. However, it's such a small place, and they can't take reservations, so it can be difficult to come with a group.There are a lot of fancy culinary words on the menu, but not to worry...they post up definitions and the waitstaff are really helpful with recommendations.My hot tip is to go for lunch and arrive just before they open for lunch service so you can get a seat when they open the doors. Otherwise, go solo and try to get a seat at the bar.  You might even make friends and share tapas with everyone. This has happened to me twice now and it's a great adventure."
Another amazing restaurant the we discovered by complete accident. We were drawn in by the great looking and relaxing outdoor eating area. The cast iron entrance was amazingly cool and we thought if the front is that awesome the food must be amazing. Let me just say that this was the COMPLETE dining experience. We didn't feel rushed. We were relaxed. Our server was very knowledgeable. He had a passion for the food he was serving. We had the sunset bay cheese and 2 others that I don't remember. And the best part was the house cured sardines with avocado hummus. Wth?!?! Game changer. That meal was perfect!! Definitely going back.
"Pretty great, tried the Bone marrow that was awesome,first time eating that. Service was nice, dinner impossible to get in, lunch easy and great. Didn't love the cheeses"
"This place is AMAZING. I love my pork, and I love my bones even more! This place has got many combinations of both. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork face, pork shoulder, the marrow on toasted bread, and the octopus with spinach. Each dish tastes unique and flavorful, in fact extremely savory. Do bring your appetite as this place can be quite heavy. Here are some tips to help you enjoy getting to try this place. Purple Pig is always super busy during dinner times but highly available during lunch and afternoon hours before 4 PM. I would highly recommend those who are able to come during lunch or afternoon eats as nighttime lines can get extremely long."
"This place was a disappointment to me. While it certainly was not bad, it was just not great. My expectations were much higher. Firstly, it is super loud and busy, which I am typically fine with, but it looks like they have over-crammed tables and chairs into a space that needs fewer to be comfortable. While we were waiting we had a cocktail and they were ok, but nothing special. Wine prices a bit high compared to other spots in Chicago of similar caliber. We finally got a seat and were ready to dig in! Wait staff, unfortunately, was a bit snooty and not very helpful. I'm not sure if they just didn't have enough staff on hand the day we were there or what. We had asked for a few more chips for the cheese board we had ordered. We literally received three measly chips for all the cheese. That seemed extremely cheap to me. We literally asked 4-5 times to get more chips. By the time we got them we were over the cheese selections and moved on. Next we got one of the schmears. What was quite bizarre was that they gave us a TON of bread with the schmear in comparison to the three measly chips for the cheese. The schmear was good, but they served wayyyy too much of it, almost to the point where if you were to use it  all you had to put a disgustingly thick layer on the bread. It became somewhat nauseating after awhile. This restaurant seems to have their proportions way off. I would think a restaurant that prides itself in being foodie-like would have a better eye for this kind of issue. The cauliflower we got was ok but super oily, I mean really, really oily and it did not look appetizing whatsoever. My favorite thing by far was a tuna appetizer that had lots of flavor (also maybe a bit too much oil, but nonetheless tasty). I was so disgusted after eating too much of the schmear that I did not eat as much of the tuna as I would have liked. All in all, with the sub-par/somewhat snotty service, overly crammed space and food that just wasn't that great, especially for the price, I do not see this as a must place to try. I spent over 40$ for lunch (we got a gyro as well) for something that I did not find very enjoyable."
"This was actually one of my fav places in Downtown when i used to live in Chicago, my friends and I would come and leave happy and always wanting to come back!! It's actually a very affordable place but it's kind of annoying with kids around.. AKA no kids"
"Probably my best restaurant experience in Chicago that didn't break the bank. We were lucky enough to get a table with only 15 minutes wait. Their beets and goat cheese were the best I've had; the duck spread was exciting and new; our waiter gave us an awesome cheese suggestion; the pork shoulder was merely ok, but saved by the poached tuna with quail egg. Also, I had 8 glasses of iced tea and my cup was never empty - the service was superb, and our waiter was a step ahead of our requests. I hope I find time to go again soon."
"The Pig Platter - Delicious selection of cold cuts. It comes with about 10 different selections of meats and 4-6 slices of each. Loved the prosciutto and salamis especially. The small fruit mix of soaked raisins is amazing and really helps to cleanse the palate after each type of meat. I shared this platter with two other people... I think this amount was ideal. Also tried the salad containing asparagus, peanuts, and avocado. Good, but nothing sensational (I know, who orders salad here, right?). The dressing in my opinion should have been more peanuty and less vinegary, similar to what they might do in a Thai style salad. Also tried the spread of pork neck and ricotta. Tasted like a kind of ragu sauce, which I liked a lot. Was rather surprised the pork hock and tripe plate ended being another spreadable sauce. I would not order this again. Way too sour for my taste, and neither the flavor of the pig hock nor tripe came through.The wait here is ridiculously long and the inside is way to load for comfortable conversation. I've had the most popular dishes including the roasted cauliflower, the bone marrow, the pig ear, and the milk pork shoulder before, and honestly, feel that this place is over rated. These dishes are not at all difficult to cook at home. I think the popularity of this place stems mostly from people who think that anything other a pork chop is novel. Not a place for people who are already adventurous eaters. Nice place to grab a drink on a nice evening around ten though. Less crowded and you can drink it outside where it is a lot more quiet."
"The Purple Pig is definitely a place to stop by if you're just visiting or bringing friends and family from out of town.  I visited Purple Pig twice and did not enjoy the first visit as much as I did with the second time around.  I initially remember Purple Pig as being a bit salty and less veggies, so this time around, I decided to order more veggies to please my palate.  Between my friend and I, we shared bone marrow, pig's ear, and a steak dish.  The portions definitely filled us up to begin our long day of exploring the city for the day.  The wait can be awfully long, but you can leave your phone number and wander nearby; they will call you when you're about to be seated.This worked the first time, but the second time around, they told us that they will call us, but never did!  When we noticed other people (who came later) being seated after us, we asked about our seats again, and they told us they called us when I never received a call.  I guess the long wait was balanced out with great service and good food!"
"No doubt that the food was a 4, but the price just drops this a little.  I went here today to grab a quick bite to eat...I ordered the meatball slider and the veal short rib marsala.  The meatball was good. I've definitely had and made better though, and I wasn't too impressed. It was also kind of hard to eat with the brocclirabe.  The short rib marsala was phenomenal.  It's a little hard to eat as the short rib bones make it hard to pick through, but it was delicious.  Only complaint is that it should have had some pasta, potatoes, or bread with it to go with the sauce.  The mushrooms were delicious in it."
"Sat on the communal tables and enjoyed an excellent glass of : Toro Numanthia ""Termes"" 2012, which was awesome. Good wait staff who recommended the wine and red fish cooked with grape leaves(which was not on the menu) made with wine and some white sauce. It was delicious. But the best part was the dolci : Cheesecake. I wouldnt have ordered cheesecake cos it seemed so ordinary but it was recommended by the girls sitting on my table so I went for it and it was mind-blowing! The greek honey along with the crusty filo felt like 1000s of pieces of tiny dough crackling in my mouth."
Expectations were high and I have to say I was not impressed.  The pig ear with kale was just way too salty.  The bone marrow was not my thing.  The octopus dish had a generous amount of octopus but the flavors weren't intriguing.  Desserts were disappointing.  I left there thirsty because everything was too salty...
"It is only ok, the food is not great just ok,  I had the hotdog and the bread was cold and bland, my friend had a panini and was tasteless.  My experience here is not as expected, maybe just an option for a very late dinner."
"Ahhhhn purple pig... Where do I begin...I had such a great dinner here that I cannot wait to come see you again on june 2015. Things we ordered:1) bone marrow- the biggest I have ever had in my entire life. Don't you get disappointed when they don't give you enough bread for the big slab of bone marrow? Well here in Purple pig, you won't . They give you 4 huge slices of Brioche bread which is perfect for slabbing all that fatty goodness on the bread. Add some sea salt  and cilantro on top and you are ready to take the first big bite that would blow your mind away. 2) Fried brussels  sprouts with thyme lime and chili- yum!! Very flavorful and amazingly good.   3) pigs ears with kale pickled cherry peppers and fried egg- OMG!Orgasmically goooooooodddddd. A MUST to have here. The flavors from this dish was very well  balanced.  The peppers and kale just cuts through the fattiness from the pigs ears. Next time I come , I will have this all to myself. 4) pork tripe with pork skin bread crumbs smothered with parmigiana cheese- this comes with bread slices and you smother this goodness on the bread , super yummy5) wagyu sirloin tip- very flavorful and super tender. When this dish came, I was super full already but still had to try it. 6) tart with persimmons mousse, white chocolate and dark chocolate mousse with caramelized hard candy  - (this is not in the menu on the website) not your typical dessert- presentation was different, unique and beautiful. I dont love desserts that are too sweet and this was just right for me. I cannot wait to come back and try the veal, pork secreto , pig tails and whole lot more. See you soon my purple pig."
"While I was visiting Chicago for the first time, people were recommending that I try Purple Pig if I could get in.  While we were shopping around the area, we decided to pop by to see how long the wait was.  It was packed but we put our names down anyway.  They take your phone number and give you a call when the table's ready.  So we ended up walking around for a little before they called us.  It was only about 20 mins wait.  We were seated in the center communal table which unfortunately got some of the fierce wind when the doors were open.We weren't overly hungry so we got a few dishes.  The bone marrow came out first.  It was so indulgent and rich.  We didn't like that the bread we got to eat with the marrow was greasy as well.  But I love the capers!The mussels were just okay, but I'm not a mussels kind of person.  The broth was tasty to dip though.  The neck bone gravy was pretty good.  The pork shoulder was ridiculously tender.  I wish there was more mashed potatoes though.  Everything was a bit salty for me."
Very good food but not extraordinary and certainly worth experiencing. Not sure if it worth the price tag though.
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago as I try to come as often as I can. Trying to beat the crowd each time is tough but well worth it. Since it's first come, first serve, the best time to go and wait outside is when they open at 11:30 A.M. You'll see a line of people already around 11 sometimes but don't be discourage; they sit everyone quickly once they open. I've gone on week nights and the wait is ~2 hours. When that happens, I wander off into shops along Michigan or grab some coffee. The menu has good choices from octopus to turkey to bone marrow. I always get the bone marrow no natter what I order and it's definitely something you have to try at least once! I scout for tasty bone marrow and Purple Pig is top pick! TRY THE MARROW, Y'ALL!"
"Alfresco dining in the busy street of Michigan Avenue. I would give you about 5 stars too but you said I had to wait 1.5 hours even though it was first come first serve and then called me like an hour later and told me you had a table ready when I was trying to catch the fireworks at the Navy Pier. Anyhow, we wanted alfresco dining with tapas style and this suit the bill. I'm glad I drop by on my way back to my hotel to give you my name because that would probably be a longer wait. Thank you for being so flexible because we immediately had a table outside for 5 right after the fireworks which was closer to 1045pm. We got a bottle of wine - dont remember which though. For dishes, we had the chorizo - nothing to brag about, bone marrow - um yes and there is good amounts of bone marrow to spread on your bread - omg - my favorite dish at this place, pig ears - I know it sounds disgusting but you won't regret it. You must try it. Pork chops was surprisingly succulent and juicy and I would recommend it! And we also got the grilled octopus here which was good."
Great food and good wait staff.
"Absolute favorite place to eat in Chicago.  Food was superb!  We were recommended this place by a few friends.  Pretty small place but the restaurant was decorated nicely and had a very calming and romantic vibe to it despite it being packed with people at 9pm.  Left my name down and the hostess informed us that it would be around 45 min and that she would call us.  After exploring the shops around the area, we got back and were seated immediately.  For the food (for 2 people), we ordered:Bone marrow: This was one of my favorite dishes.  I must admit that it is rather oily, but the herbs and seasoning that come with it really freshen up the dish and make it feel less heavy.   Gigantic portion for the price as well.Octopus dish: I am not the biggest fan of octopus because of the texture.  However, it was prepared here perfectly and was very tender and flavorful.  Beets:  Also not usually a fan of beets, but loved the beet combination with the cheese and pistachios.  Bursting with flavor and definitely was not a dish to disappoint.Pork secreto: Warm slices of perfectly cooked pork complemented with cold tangy sweet bell peppers and herbs.  Loved the mix of flavors (sweet, salty, sour) and the refreshing taste it left.  Boyfriend did not really like the temperature differences of the dish, but I thought it was unique.  Who really cares what he thinks anyway? :) I'm usually right.Sicilian Iris: This is the dessert we ordered.  Fried brioche filled with melted creamy ricotta with sweet chocolate chips.  The best ending to an amazing dinner.  The dessert  easily became my favorite dish of the night.   Not too sweet and the texture of the brioche was perfect.Overall, we paid a little under $100 for two people, which is to be expected for the quality of the food and the ambience.  We actually thought that the prices were unbelievably reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area.  Definitely recommend!"
"++- They call you when you're reservation is ready, allowing you to not have to sit around waiting for an hour or so- Portions; they're HUGE. There's a few (such as bone marrow, pig ear) which can substitute as meals by themselves- They give you instructions on the best way to eat the food (like with bone marrow and pig ear salad) - Pig ear salad; Pig ears taste like bacon straws- Bone marrow +- There's a waitress just for the waiting line- There's plenty of waiting seating- They have half carafes, which allow you to split wine amongst others without having to pay full price-- The wait; it's a long damn time. We were told 1.5-2h, we got the call around the hour and fifteen markTIPS:- One reviewer said to put your name down first, shop,  and by the time you're done, your table should be ready...Nothing could be more truer- Who cares about my individual dishes, everything is good here, it's really a matter of what you want. You don't necessarily have to look for an all star dish...or just ask the waiter"
"I have been to this place several times, and have found it a wonderful experience. I basically just ask the server to pick the dishes for me, and I have never been disappointed! The portions are small and sharable, which is delightful because you can try a lot of great things. The wine is also PERFECT, and the servers are excellent at giving recommendations to suit your taste. It can be crowded and it is a little expensive, but it is well worth it. LOVE IT."
"I actually came in to this place because it was raining and this place is the closest restaurant/bar for us to just chill until the rain stops. We ended up eating here because a friend of mine who lives in Chicago always wanted to try but never got a chance to, so we grabbed a table while waiting.Few things to say about this placeFOOD - tapa style, large selection, reasonable pricing, and taste great! We ordered the fried pig ears with kale (2 portions also cuz it was so addicting), fried tendon, blood sausage, turkey leg, milk braised pork shoulder, and octopus with string beans. Everything turned out to be so good, the meat were tender and seasoned perfectly. Satisfying meal.SERVICE - Can't get any better than this!! We requested for table for 3, and 2 of us sat down at the bar (first come first serve) to wait for our other party to arrive.  The bartender was nice, fast, and very professional.  When our table was ready (~30-45 min on a friday night), the hostess allowed us to sit down first without the full party.  Either the server/hostess were concerned about not seating full parties, and didn't seem to care or bothered by the fact that there are a line of people waiting to be seated.  So, we just went ahead and enjoyed our drinks. Fortunately our friend arrived within 20 min after we sat down.  Our server was nice and accommodating, made suggestions for dish but not pushy, comes by to check on us every once in a while when he sees that we are almost done, so we never had to wait long between tapas. What more can you ask for?ENVIRONMENT - OK enough of the good stuff, this place isn't perfect.  The layout of this place is the weirdest and most inconvenient dining area I've seen.  I assumed that it used to be a small bar and went popular so they expanded it by adding long tables in the restaurant, so you are actually going to be in close proximity and sharing a table with other people.  The server station is also located right at the entrance of the restaurant, so there's a weird and crowded line of movement between waiters trying to put in/close orders and new customers coming in/out restaurant.  This becomes extremely chaotic when it gets busy, and will constantly be running into other people or getting in someone's way. There are no places to put your bags except on the floor or risk hanging on the chair where people walk around, which may get knocked over or stolen easily.  The long wooden tables are stylish, but I personally don't think bar chairs are very comfortable while dining.  I will highly recommend the owner of this place to consider rearranging its layout.  This is also definitely NOT a good spot for dating.Other than the strange layout, I like this place and will want to come back the next time I visit."
"My third try, I made to this place finally. It was worth try the third time. Food was amazing here, they change the menu twice a day. We tried Sprout salad,  gyro, bone marrow and razor clams. They are great! Good gourmet place,  I will be back again. Only negative thing about this place was the space was so cramped up (reason for the 4 stars, otherwise, it deserves 5 stars), other than that, it was amazing here"
"If there is one place to check out whether you're a Chicago local or just in town for the weekend, It's The Purple Pig! Sure in most cases it takes longer to be seated anywhere from 40 minutes to 2 hours, but it's worth it!From their starters like Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano (TO DIE FOR)  and Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (Heaven may feel like this) to their share-able entrees like Quail with Trahana & Porcini Stuffing, Salsify & Pomegranate (My Personal Favorite), Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki and  Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic with Grated Egg & Parsley, your tastes buds will be very happy!However, if you are not an adventurous eater, have a sensitive stomach and or have diet restrictions, this isn't the place for you. But If you want to experience something new its a great place to check out!"
Great spot.   The charred cauliflower was excellent.  As were the beets and bone marrow.  Sitting at the chef's counter was pretty cool.  Got to see everything getting created and sent out.
I've never had a bad meal at the purple pig and have gone about 5 times.  The menu my staples are the bone marrow and the artichoke salami antipasta.  Very well priced for the location and quality of food.
"Food was good, but I think its really a big hype! but everyone should go at least once for the experience."
A lunch that I will remember for years.Classy. Delicious. Authentic.Tried these below items and all of them are more good than another. Cant pick oneAppetizers:-pork fried almonds-calamariMain Course:-Turkey Leg Confit-Octopus with Green Beans-Chicken Thigh Kebabs-Pork SecretoDesserts:-Panino con Nutella-Affogato-Grandma D's Chocolate CakeAll of them are tremendous and you will be blown away by the wine menu. The drinks are overnice. Must go place and beware of the huge lines.
"Great wine selections, pretty good shaved Brussels salad, avoid the dry and over cooked octopus, decent bone marrow and amazing chicken thigh kebabs and white sauce."
Worth the three-hour wait (you think I'm kidding). Don't be afraid to try the sweetbreads or bone marrow!
"We were lucky to get in early today and didn't have to wait long.  It was a very cozy restaurant with a lot of communal seating.  Some of the dishes on the menu reminded me of Barcelona with its Mediterranean inspired tapas.We shared a few dishes between the three of us:Pork Neck Bone Gravy With Ricotta:  We had this last.  We were already full by the time we had this.  It was actually light and had good flavors.  I thought it would be oily but the sauce was good.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs:  The 2 large pieces of bone marrow came with their infamous bread, sliced onions, cilantro, capers, and sea salt.  It was a very delicate taste and it was my first time having bone marrow. It was quite good.  We all liked it.Chicken Thigh Kebabs with smashed potatoes and tzatzikiOctopus: This was my favorite dish. It was perfectly cooked and had nice flavors.  This reminded me of the seafood dishes we had in Barcelona.  Same flavoring.Razor clams: Similar flavoring to the Octopus. Nicely cooked and nice flavoringFor dessert, we had Loukoumades a type of Greek fried dough drenched in cinnamon and lemon.  This was good.Food was a bit salty at times but overall good.  Brought back really good memories of Barcelona."
"The atmosphere inside was pretty cool. But PACKED. Packed like if you sit at the high tables with a bunch of other parties awkwardly placed around you, you will have people running into your back. Service was good. The food was good. Extensive wine collection. Only downside? The group of three that were placed right next to us were super annoying. A group of college kids trying to impress one another. One guy kept talking about how Gin was a cordial? We only ordered 2 appetizers and hit the road for a more enjoyable experience."
"Had a very nice, delicious lunch here on an August Saturday.  We arrived when they opened, were seated quickly, and the service was prompt throughout the experience.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the food because the menu sounded complex and some items did not strike my fancy from the descriptions and pictures.  However, we decided to try it based on the positive reviews and seeing that it always seemed very busy and thriving.  We ordered the Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios, the Slow Roasted Ham Panini with Scamorza Cheese, Pickled Portobello & Sundried Tomatoes, and two Meatball Sliders with Parmesan & Arugula.  Each item was shared and completely delicious.  I imagine everything else would be the same way.  We also shared half a bottle of red wine which was very good.The atmosphere was bustling and lively.  Mostly adults.  I will definitely visit again and bring friends who've never been before."
"My wife and I relied on the great reviews here on yelp and felt we had to try The Purple Pig. We were not disappointed. Everything we had was incredible. We did have to wait an hour but it was worth it. If your not sure what to get just ask the waiter for recommendations as we did ours. He did a stellar job picking out everything we ate. Some of which was a three cheese platter, olive oil poached tuna, turbot fish, pork ossobucco and Sicilian Iris for dessert. My wife and I highly recommend this place and when back in Chicago we will return ourselves."
"Love love love everything about this place. I've tried coming here two times before on past trips to Chi town but it was always crowded. This time we came right when it opened and were seated at a table of 2. It definitely filled up fast. We ended up ordering way too much food but it was all great. Also, I had asked for sangria which they didn't have but the waiter offered me a red, sweet wine which tasted pretty closely to a sangria. This is a must try for all and staff will also recommend great tapas."
"Between this place and Girl and the Goat, I've seriously considered moving to Chicago. I'm not a huge fan of tapas and reaching over people to snag a bite of food, but its well worth it here. The bone marrow was the highlight for me. So salty and has the rich pork marrow flavor that went perfectly with the bread. Spectacular. Also got the pig's ear and the octopus, both fantastic. Chicago loves sunny-side up eggs, especially on a lot of salty pig dishes, but I'm not complaining. The wine list is amazing and I was quite surprised at the staff's knowledge of the individual bottles. In a past life, I've worked as a bartender in the food industry and  I constantly had waiters/waitresses asking me about each wine when questioned by a customer. Our waitress knew just enough about each wine for us to make a knowledgeable decision for our meal. It's refreshing to have the sort of service.Always recommend this place if a friend is visiting Chicago."
"Went here on a date at the end of last summer. They said the wait was going to be awhile and it ended up being only 10 minutes or so which is always a happy surprise! We followed other yelpers recommendations for food; the only thing we weren't crazy about was the bone marrow. This has nothing to do with the execution or presentation; I just think we aren't bone marrow fans-- glad we had the opportunity to try it out.Everything else was great, we sat at a family style table outside which was awkward for the first 5 minutes but we ended up making friends with both parties on either side of us which was neat because we each recommended dishes to one another which we all enjoyed!Great place to enjoy a few small plates and a bottle of wine. Can't wait for the weather to get nice again so we can return to their patio!!"
Horrible service.  Bartender hated life and his job.  Waited 20 min for a second drink cause he was too lazy to make it.  Food was ok
"We had the beets with goat cheese, chorizo-stuffed fried olives, razor clams, grilled octopus and chicken kebab. We'd go back for the beets and octopus, and most definitely for another bottle of the getariako txakolina. We also quite liked smashy fried potato that came with the kebabs (and went really well with the tzatziki)."
"It's been awhile since I've been here, but I realized I had forgotten to review it and wanted to throw in my two cents! I came here with a gf and had a blast.  It was chilly outside, but the heaters were going and the patio was PACKED, as was the inside. We got seats at the bar somehow, and I really enjoyed that experience.  The bartenders were accomodating and helped us to select great entrees and wine to boot. The brussel sprouts were boss, and the other things we got, I can't remember to describe in detail.  We had a beef dish, a pork dish and a veggie dish.  We didn't put too much thought into what was in them, we just took the recommendations of the staff, and we were pretty happy with everything! Can't wait to go back!"
"You're guaranteed to wait at least 40 minutes and, yes, they kind of pack you in like sardines. It may be less stellar than similar tapas/small plates restaurants in other neighborhoods but, for the Loop, it's  great!We had:Eggplant caponata: thick slices of bread with - well - probably spiced up cream cheese ( it's good). The bread makes the perfect foundation for the eggplant caponata, which had a smoother consistency than other caponatas that I've previously tried.Olive oil pouched tuna: Am I crazy? Has anyone else tried this? It's so tender and well-seasoned. I'll admit that I love tuna carpaccio so this was a great alternative!Pork secreto: meh. Don't get me wrong, the pork was very tender but I felt a little cheated for 14 dollars.Meatball slider: not worth it. Milk braised pork shoulder: i agree with everyone else (mostly). The meat literally melts in your mouth and the potatoes are sinful.Chorizo stuffed olives: I really likes them but if it's battered and fried, I'm always pleased Lemon pane cotta: a little dense so it was tough to stomach after that monstrosity of a meal.Overall we ordered too many plates for four people but it's was a wonderful experience."
"The layout of the Purple Pig was hectic and chaotic--not really the first thing I want for a wine bar. Once we snagged two seats at the bar though, we had a great time. The bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. Warning, if you prefer new world wines, they don't have them here. But their wine list is extensive--they can definitely recommend something you like."
Omg The beets dish followed by the pork shoulder was awesomeThe meat melted in my mouthLee was perfect with wine selections
"If you like different foods or want to try something new this place is perfect for that. I had the Bone marrow, squid and octopus and they were amazing, minus the squid ink. The place is clean and they have a good verity of beer.Service is quick but not very polite at times. Food: 8/10Service: 7/10Cleanliness: 7/10Price: $$"
"If I had to sum up The Purple Pig in one phrase, it'd be this: ""Like Barley Swine in Austin, only not as good."" That may be dag-nabbiting with faint praise; then again, my Barley Swine experience ranks amongst the best I've had in the past year (and change). Of course, Barley Swine was made possible only because of places like The Purple Pig, a trend I term ""trendy casual"" that I myself first experienced in cities like New York and Chicago (re: Publican, Ruxbin, Girl & The Goat, etc.).OK, so all that introduction was probably unnecessary, but it helps set the stage. I finally made it out to The Purple Pig (with three non-pork eaters, natch) after having it bookmarked for the longest time. There's no reservations here, and the wait times have been unusually extravagant the two or so times I've stopped by looking for a table. Apparently, the trick is to go before 5, as the wife did to secure a table with minimal wait. Duly noted.She did the ordering for the group before I even got there. By the time I finished the plethora of small plates, I was too full to order anything else. I did sneak a peek at the menu, which is, frankly daunting. There's a lot to pick on there, and I wonder if the food would have been slightly better if the menu tended towards a narrower focus.One more dig, and then I'm done. There appears to exist a ""salt culture"" that feels predominant in Chicago. As in: salt is the best, if not only, seasoning needed. I call it The Girl & The Goat corollary. I had a friend warn me that The Purple Pig is excessively salty. After a first-hand experience, I don't disagree.By this point, you may be wondering why I gave it four stars. It's simple. I actually really enjoyed the spectrum of food. My personal favorite, and not just because it's really hard not to ever like, was the bone marrow. It tasted expertly done, and I loved the parsley-onion-caper relish that accompanied it.Our vegetable dishes--beet salad, cauliflower, corn relish, and fried brussels sprouts--ranged from a refreshing salty to overwhelmingly salty. Again, it felt like G&TG-esque. The crispy pig ears with fried kale was pleasantly delicious, and I eyed with envy the sliced pork plate that the communal table next to us ordered.As mentioned, the menu is much more extensive. I would've also loved to delve into some of the bigger plates. Next time, I suppose."
"The sign reads, ""Wine and Swine!"" They are not kidding. I travel often with a vegan co-worker, and I embrace the animal-product-free dinning we do. The Purple Pig is not a place for the vegetarian or vegan. Yes, you can find some veg friendly items, but head on over the Karyn's Cooked or raw. Leave the wonderful MEATS to us barbarians. The Purple Pig is tucked back along a walk way by the river, so your Google map will leave you scratching your head a bit. Head down the sidewalk, you'll run right into it. The place is a meatetarians gastropub extraordinaire. I think I ordered wrong, honestly, by not getting the charcuterie board. Several diners on either side of us at the common table ordered them. Have the waiter make a recommendation. They have a well curated set of taps and bottles. They can suggest one to pair with your orders. We did olives with Chorizo, goat cheese smear, and a sirloin with citrus glaze and fava beans. The sirloin was tender and wonderfully flavored. Delicious. Stop in here. There is something special going on in the kitchen."
"Calamari, Bone Marrow Smear, Pork Shoulders. Purple pig is definitely a spot in chicago to check out. Walk-ins only so be prepared to wait a little longer during peak dinner times. I went to this place for my girlfriend's birthday. The food was amazing. I really enjoyed how they take pride in their food. I got a sausage dish that wasn't that great in my opinion and didn't really touch it. The server asked why I didn't like it and after hearing me out, he took it off my check and asked if there was something else I would rather try. The food items that I listed above are what I had during that meal. I say the best was the bone marrow smear. I would definitely recommend trying Purple Pig if you are in the area and have time to wait for a table."
"I came here for a late night snack and thought it was pretty good. The best thing we got though was their fried manchego cheese with the apricot jam on the bottom- salty, sweet, and cheesy! I thought their bone marrow was pretty good- a huge bone with crusty, toasted bread- it didn't taste much different from other places I've had it although the horizontal cut, rather than the cross sectional cut, was unique.I didn't think their pork braised in milk was too special, just standard pork in gravy and mashed potatoes. Their fried pork ears tasted like salty, crispy fried things with peppers- I wish it had more kale in it but the egg on top was nice.I really enjoyed the lemon panna cotta- refreshing and well made!!!"
"Swine so fine which goes well with .. wine? :) Yeah, yeah. I won't be quitting my day job soon so ANYWAY ...Prepare yourself to be blown away with the food! You take one look at the menu and you instantly notice how many, many, many choices there are. Dizzying, in fact.  Small plates, paninis, house made charcuterie (OMG), shmears, entrees, dessert. The menu is pork centric but seafood and ""healthy"" greens are on it as well. Our dishes were well paced considering the place was PACKED with 9-5 workers, yuppies, couples, locals and tourists. Although our server was a bit harried and forgot my Negroni at first, we were enjoying the bustling (understatement of the year!) atmosphere. The olive oil poached tuna with lima beans was delicately tender and has that citrusy zing; the crispy pig's ears were a textural delight with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and a runny fried egg. The foie gras with membrillo schmeared on their grilled house bread is TO DIE FOR (yes, I'm foie deprived!) while the humoungous turkey leg has mucho MMMeat. * burp * You definitely get more than your money's worth here at the Purple Pig: affordable AND amazing eats make me squeal with happiness! Go Pig out ;-)"
"Came here for a late dinnerFood:I ended up ordering Pig ear fried egg, octopus  w green beans fingerling potatoes, milk braised pork shoulderThe pig ear w the fried egg was really good. It was crispy and good balance w the kale. Braised pork shoulder was very tendered and seasoned beautifully. The octopus dish was a disappointment. It was overcooked and it was not a big dish at all for its price.  Presentation of the dishes were pretty done pretty good for tapas style. 3.5/5Service:They were really busy.  We got sat down right away but the waitress was scattered around.  It took her a while to get our order. It also took a while for her to bring my check. 3/5Atmosphere: it was very crowded but it was very lively. The place is very well decorated and the set up of the tables were efficient. 4/5Overall, the prices are fairly pricey for some of those dishes.  However, they do have a unique creativity of dishes.  I would go back and try the other dishes."
Great food is an understatement. Device is impeccable. Really clean and well decorated. If u try it you WILL return
"Everyone raves about this place. I get it's THE gastro pub to visit when you're in the city, but really, it wasn't amazing. It was good but nothing wowed me. We were crammed into the patio space, literally dining with the next table over by 8"". We shared the tuna, pork shoulder, pigs ear, and marrow. Like I said, they were good but I wouldn't rush back for it."
"Ohh yeahh! Really dig their tapas here. Out of the 4-5 times I've been here, I noticed that the wait time really depends on how big your party is. Keep it small (2-3 people) and you will be seated in no time. Some of my favorite dishes are: bone marrow, fried pig ears, jowl, and calamari. There are plenty more dishes I enjoyed. You just have to come try for yourself!"
"Oh my God, where do I start? Excellent Excellent Excellent!First off, our waiter, Steven was the absolute best. He was friendly, knew the menu very well, made excellent suggestions and not to mention, he had us cracking up with his crazy sense of humor. Now on to the food. This is a tapas style place, so if you're not into sharing, you'll be fine if you order two dishes each. The servings are quite large. I went with three other people. We ordered 6 total dishes and this was more than enough food to satisfy all of us. Now onto the food:- Roasted bone marrow Smear with herb salad & sicilian sea salt - I've never had bone marrow like this before. I was a little weary to try it, but it was actually really good! Very tasty, fatty, and mixed with the onions and seasonings it went perfectly with the toast. Of all 6, it was definitely one of my favorites-Turkey leg: large, tasty, succulent, the juiciest turkey leg you'll ever have. Totally worth the food coma you'll experience right after- Fried Manchego Cheese with Membrillo - mmm mmm yummm!! Talk about the best tasting fried cheese! Fingerlicking good. -Chicken Thigh Kebabs - Now this was definitely a crowd pleaser. Juicy, seasoned to perfection, two whole kebabs. Food heaven. -Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - You absolutely cannot go to this place without trying this dish. It's a burst of flavors in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were perfect. -Octopus - I'm not a fan of octopus, but one of the people at our table who seems to be obsessed with this dish thought it was absolutely delicious. You get about 5 thick 6 inch pieches of octopus and he said it was some of the best he's ever had. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"
"Been here 3 more times and always good.Is a nice place, good decor. The line( kitchen) is tiny and saw the chef cooking in induction burners(3) which helps to keep the place cool since it does not generate heat. The dishes are rustic, done to be share, good flavors. Very interesting combinations. Tried sardines with a fennel salad and lemon dressing, sharred couliflower and the Estrella Damm( my favorite beer when i was in spain) is good to go 3-4 people and share 5-6 dishes to really apreciate their food.Next time i ll try pork liver paté, calamari, octopus..."
"Good food, drank a $13 beer which tasted exactly like a Guinness....sad face. That and our waiter(bartender/mixologist since we sat at the bar) was a bit of a snobby hipster douche who's haircut looked like he had a greased up dead rat on top of his head. Needless to say we didn't think much of his stuck up attitude. But damn was the food good."
"HOLY SHIT, even in cold weather Chicago natives will travel for food.Like a fool, I assumed that 1 degree weather would deter people from forming the long lines at The Purple Pig.  Wrong. This place gets full, especially at brunch. Be prepared to wait. If you find yourself starving, there are plenty of good/ acceptable joints nearby.A trio of us ordered the following:Fried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili FlakesPig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried EggOctopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa VerdeI swear we got 3 other dishes, but I can't recall what they were.  Additionally, the menu changes but you are guaranteed great food every time.  We ordered a bottle of wine, some recommended desserts and settled for an amazingly good time.Service was steady and timely. Food is served family style. Be prepared to spend dollars and nibble on a variety of small plates. I can only imagine how amazing brunch in the spring must be. If you are in Chicago and can't get raffle tickets for the OTHER joint, don't worry. This should be on top of everyone's list. AMAZING."
Sooooooo Goood! I have been several times to The Purple Pig! Excellent menu and wine selection. I love to sit at the bar and watch all the action. Try not to salivate as sexy chef Jimmy Bannos whips up a delectable dish or 10 right before your eyes.
"YUM.So, the service was kinda slow when we were sat!! I did feel that maybe the host didn't tell our server he had a new table.....none the less a good experience.My girlfriends and I came here after a concert on a Sunday evening around 10:30 pm. It was packed! We were sat right away at a long outside table on the tented patio that was heated. The ambiance was chill and hype. The plates are a great size and the flavors are spot on. I believe it was the Pork Ruben Sandwich which was so amazing and my personal favorite. Hope I got that one right. Everything was very, very tasty!The staff is quick to clean up any dishes and are on the ball threw out your meal. Ill be back with my hubby and 12 year old. Cool place!"
"**I did NOT eat here**Pretentious staff. Overly crowded. Two hour wait. Shallow wine pour. Wanted to dine here for a few years now, and upon finally attempting to, I was nothing but disappointed with the experience. I totally expected to wait, but two hours with zero waiting room and a snobby staff wasn't worth it. I ordered a glass of wine (to drink on the cement outside) and for $12 I received a tasting pour. I noticed an older couple waiting next to me kindly tell the server that their wine pours were very shallow and that they hated to complain but would like to be topped off, and the server basically just said, ""Too bad,"" and walked away briskly. I took my shot of wine and kept my mouth shut. Needless to say I left, and I won't be back. I am sure the food is amazing, but sometimes even that is not worth it."
"Very good experience here. The menu is not not huge, but it's a bit overwhelming as everything looks so good. I opted for a tune poke-like starter - I wish the tuna had not been slightly pan seared however. Nonetheless it was nice with great balance and the quail eggs and potato ingredients made it. For my main I had the Wagyu beef short ribs, also very good and a better match for the Nebbiolo red.Located on the prime part of Michigan Avenue. Get there by 11:25 AM on a weekday and enjoy a seat at the bar."
"This was excellent.  The grill cheese was the best my boy friend ever had! Such a great vibe and all the tapas we ordered were yummy. If this was in my hometown, i would go often!"
"Wow this place was good! We tried few of the appetizers and then had the pork shoulder. The food was so good, I really wanted more. To top that off we had one of the desserts, forgot the name, but it's a fried bun with ricotta and chocolate in the middle. I can't get over that. Definitely a must go in Chicago."
Overly popular and the wait is too long.  Food are average. For tourists. Locals have much better other choices. Price are average.
"The service started a little slow, but they more than made up for it with a couple of free plates. This place is very well staffed, and their food is phenomenal! The perfect place for a group of adventurous eaters to experience together. Moderately priced considering the ingredients they're using. Great wine and cocktail selection. Would definitely recommend!"
Awesome food awesome atmosphere!! Pork shoulder was amazing. Really tender cut and it melts in your mouth. The mashed potatoes complimented the meat. Their desert was also amazing.Great beer and wine selection and their prices really isn't that bad. Definitely a must eat spot if you're ever in Chicago.
"Just amazing, every single plate is delicious/tasty and still ""classy"".We had Morcilla, Pork Tripe, Pig Ears, Octopus and Pork Liver, each one was just better than the other, no matter the order...We ended with the Sicilian Iris, which was perfectly sweet to end with."
Interesting food. I liked the cheeses and the stuffed squid. The crowd was nice. Try the Purity vodka if you normally like Titos.
I love Purple Pig.  Location is wonderful as it is near my work.  Their food is wonderful and I wish to go there more often.  Cheers
"I love you, Purple Pig. Keep doing your thing. The food was delicious, the staff cool and friendly despite the insanity that was going on around them (saturday night dinner), in a chill vibe space. The only con would be the long wait, but what can you do, it's worth it - grab some drinks, sit outside & google pork photos, you'll make it."
"How would you like your pork for lunch? Cooked three ways, of course. My long anticipated first trip to The Purple Pig in Chicago did not disappoint. Pigs Ear was fried and delicious, it's flavor accented by pickled cherry peppers, enriched with a fried egg, and justified to all of my friends at home in Boulder with a healthy dose of crispy kale. Up next was the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta - I cleaned up every last bite. Slow roasted, rich pork neck bathed in sweet San Marzanos and creamy ricotta. They ran out of my first Panini choice, the Corned Pork Brisket, but the Porcetta Panini hit the spot - how can you go wrong with a pork roast rubbed in garlic & rosemary, wrapped in bacon, and thinly sliced? The panini was topped with a mint pesto spread that was the best part of the sandwich."
"My boyfriend had previously dined at The Purple Pig on a business trip and loved the food, so when the opportunity came up to spend some time in Chicago, he insisted we go for dinner. We arrived ahead of the dinner rush, but the place was already packed with at least an hour wait. We decided instead to take seating at the bar and their bartenders helped us to quickly order drinks and food: - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio VinaigrettePerfect blend of flavors, soft but firm beets, served at room temperature and a great way to whet the appetite.- Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda SmearGrilled sour dough bread with a smooth and savory smear, crunchy and slightly chewy but good to the last bite. - ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck EggAgain, served on a grilled sour dough bread with tender pork jowl and a perfectly fried egg. Delicious, but requires a steak knife and leverage to cut into and eat. Sour dough probably could have been a little less thick and crouton-like.- Salt & Vinegar Beef Tendon ChipsThe first bite is a bit like an inhale because the chip melts away instantly. Heavy on the vinegar, but addictively delicious.The service was impeccable, timing and pacing of food great, and the atmosphere was loud and lively with the chatter of other restaurant-goers. Loved dining here at The Purple Pig and could readily see why it's one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Definitely looking forward to returning!"
"I hear that getting a table at The Purple Pig is nearly impossible.  Luckily, I walked in alone, mid-week, and easily found a seat at the bar during peak dinner hours. I thoroughly enjoyed the wine, calamari and broccoli tapas suggessted by the bartender.  Both items that I would not typically order, but were very tasty! I sat at the bar with other business travelers and enjoyed a great meal. I will certainly come back again when in Chicago."
"finally tried this place for Saturday lunch few weeks ago. evening waiting time seems too long like 1-2 hours or even longer if you go there during peak. we planned to be there for the opening time. people already made lines 20-30 mins prior to 11am.we got there exact at 11am and didn't have any problems for getting a table. lots of pork dish for sure per name. we tried pork shoulder, prom BLT sandwich. both decent.my favorite was squid dish stuffed with grains and salad. another favorite was warm olive and cheese. surprisingly good when olives are warm with cheese. seasonal salad was very good. dessert we had Greek donuts with housemade ice cream swirl. would definitely go back!"
"DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  A must go in Chi-town.  I can't wait to go back.  The place was packed but we got luck and scored a seat at the bar.  Ordered a couple Italian bottles of wine which the bartenders did a great job of helping us pick.  The cheese platter was one of legends - and if you see any of my reviews you know I have seen a lot of cheese platters!  :)  We also had the Kale Salad, Deviled Eggs (fried and amazing), scallops and mussels.  All amazing and a great experience over all."
"The hubs and I came here for dinner around 5:30 on a Saturday night and the wait was already an hour.  The Shops at North Bridge is literally two stores down, which gave us a good amount of time to explore the indoor mall  and kill time.  We were seated on the outside covered patio.  Service is a bit confusing because there was two waitresses coming to check up on us and take orders.  The outside patio is very cramped and I could see the staff's frustration with maneuvering around the tables and hoards of people waiting.  Everything at the Purple Pig are small plates, which is nice because you can try a variety of dishes.  Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- great texture with all the ingredients and a fried egg makes every dish better, right?  Waaaaay too salty though.  Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- my first time trying bone marrow and I think I'm just not a fan in general.  This dish was presented beautifully.  Two big pieces of marrow, crispy toasted bread, with a side of fresh herbs/onions and sea salt.  Too rich for my taste.  Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette-  The wayyu was extremely tender and the flavors in this dish was so good!  You could taste horseradish in every bite.  I love horseradish!  Sicilian Iris- the most amazing dessert!  We waited about twenty minutes for this dish to come out.  I was practically jumping off my seat when it came.  Ricotta and chocolate chip filling in a fried brioche.  As soon as you cut into the brioche, all the yummy goodness comes out steaming hot.  Before this dish came, I was telling my husband how I wanted to try an amazing dessert in Chicago.  This is definitely it!  One of the things that puzzled me was that it took a very long time for the staff to seat guests.  I'm not sure if it's because they were understaffed or poor communication between staff.  While we were waiting for dessert, the couple next to us finished and left.  There was a couple who was waiting for a table near the front door.  I saw the guy asking the host at least two times if their table was ready.  They kept waiting and waiting.  FINALLY, the poor couple was seated next to us. But the table was empty for at least twenty minutes.  Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely come here again for the Sicilian Iris.  If the wait was long, I probably wouldn't come here for the food.  Props to the staff as I could see they were working hard to accommodate a full house."
"I came by myself so I couldn't order TOOOO many things, although I still stuffed my face.First of all, I sat at the bar and had great service! I had a glass of wine per recommendation of my server, but unfortunately I don't remember what it was called.I started with the burrata, which came with grapes and candied olives to spread on toast. It was perfect. The burrata wasn't too cold (which makes it weird imo), but it wasn't too warm either (also weird). It was the perfect temperature and texture for spreading on my toast! The flavors are a bit more delicate so it was a good starter.Then I had the octopus with green beans, which was amazing. The perfect cook on the octopus (not too chewy, not too mushy). Super great, bright flavors and well balanced with the octopus:green bean:potato ratio. I shared some with my neighbor, also a solo diner, at the bar since I was getting full and wanted to save a small space for dessert.For dessert, I ordered the ricotta and chocolate stuffed brioche. Good heavens. It is quite large. It comes as an oval puff, about 6 inches in widest diameter. It takes about 15 minutes prep but so worth it. Light, warm, fluffy, RICH chocolate flavor. Everything I am always looking for in a dessert: Flavor, temperature, texture, but somehow not cloyingly sweet. This probably has to do with the quality of the ingredients and the juxtaposition of a great chocolate with the creamy ricotta. I give an entire star just for that fluffy puff of dessert euphoria."
"This restaurant is not worth the hype! I've had much better meals in Chicago...Everything was too salty and the bone marrow had no taste. I had such high expectations for the bone marrow because of all the reviews I've read but it was so bland. In fact it left a rather nasty after taste. If you want amazing bone marrow, go to Blue Duck Tavern in Washington, D.C. Other than the bone marrow here's what I tried: -Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil-Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette, -Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette-fried oysters (some special they had that day I think)The razor clams were good, but too chewy for my taste. I enjoyed the broccoli and wagyu, but I don't remember much about the oysters...I guess it wasn't good enough or bad enough for me to remember. I do remember finding a piece of hair in the fried oyster dish though. Maybe I just ordered all the wrong things, but I didn't have a very pleasant experience here. It's definitely not worth the 1.5-2 hour wait and I won't be going back."
Finally got chance to visit this place.Came before the store's open time so that we could eat here.Very tasty food. Tried their popular pork dish. ordered turkey leg- very large!
"If I lived in Chicago I'd be a regular for sure! This place made me close my eyes, dance in my seat and make all kinds of noises. You know, the kind you make when the food is just so damn yummy! My husband often doesn't dance when he likes food; but he did all that stuff too. This review is for us both! First, the service was top-notch but not in a stuffy way! We called ahead so we already knew that they didn't take reservations and that there would be a little bit of a wait. so we decided to have a late dinner so the wait would be shorter. The host who put us on the waitlist was very friendly, a server came out to show us the wine list and let us know that we could get a drink on the patio while we are waiting. This is such a plus. The host had already managed our expectations by telling us it would be a 20 minute wait. alas, it was only 10 minutes. Yay! Our BusBuy was so knowledgeable that by the time the server got there, which took about 10 minutes, (no big deal) we already had a great idea of what we wanted to order. Our server was also very knowledgeable and helped us decide what might be the right amount of food as with small plates we might tend to over order. Five stars for service and the food! The Food: We had basic drinks: Panna still water, iced tea and later hot orange tea with dessert. The plates (sorry no pics:( - but I've seen other's pics of the same dishes - ck it out)- Peas & snap peas tossed with mint, Daigon sprouts, bacon, in a light citrusy drizzle. This was bright, fresh, green, subtly sweet, minty & sprinkled with just enough  fatty/crispy texture.  wow! I loved this dish and will try.... To re-create it at home. - whipped (yes whipped) Buratta with lightly fried artichoke hearts and candied Citrus salad - Yum! There were perfect amounts of each element. - 4 small Deep fried Manchego cheese blocks with Berry Membrillo (like a preserve) Heaven! Light crunch, creamy and stronger cheese profile paired perfectly with the sweet Membrillo. yum! - 6 mildly spiced chorizo stuffed green olives - breaded, deep fried and served on top of a light yogurt sauce - Briny, oily rich goodness! Yum! - pork Neckbone tomatoe gravy with Ricotta smear - on toasted - soft & crunchy bread - Italian seasonings (chef's Family recipe we are told) with deep savory flavor & a generous dollop of ricotta creaminess - This was so yummy but for me best had in small doses as it could be a lil heavy. I liked/did not love only due to its heaviness. My husband loved it and the guy sitting next to me loved his too! - dessert#1 - Sicilian Iris which is a ricotta & semi sweet choc chip filled lightly fried Brioche - Heaven!!! - for me it was just the right amount of mildly sweet cheese, light pastry and Chocolate. - dessert #2 - Lemon Panna Cotta - This was nice; but the only dish that fell a lil short for me. It just didn't rise to the level of the other dishes & I'm pretty picky bout my PC - it shouldn't taste or feel like lemon flan but this one did..Bring someone who appreciates quality food, a variety of flavor combos & likes to share. Just go!!!!!! And let the staff help guide you. I wish I could transport this place to Pasadena!!!!  - THANKS for making our 1st Chicago foodie experience so wonderful!"
"The wine is ok. The food is ok. The wait is super-looonnnnngggg. We tried a couple of dishes; the bone marrow was awesome! Growing up eating this, it is the best i had so far, but if you never had it before, you might find it too greasy. The freid pig ears are too oily, honestly i only tasted oil. The cauliflowers  were good, nothing special. Razor clams were covered with herbs (almost every dish is) and the herbs went ok with it (I prefer tasting the freshness of seafood).  The sausage we tried was okay. SO overall, this place is- OK."
"Was in Chicago for business and coworker suggested Purple Pig because he heard from a colleague it was good, so we gave it a try. Its a bit hidden in the back of another building and you have to go along a side entrance. Food was GREAT! Big fan of tapas because you can sample and share items."
"Jizz worthy pork belly. Served me while I waited outside, made sure I got a table, served me amazing food, always fulfilled my water glass and just countless amazing interactions with friendly staff. Hands down worth a wait and worth the food. This place had my friend amazed and in love. I left thinking that I'm so happy this place resisted and had amazing food. The pork belly in honey way do good that I jizzed in my pants!!!"
Sooooooooooooo good! Charcuterie and cheese heaven!
"It's family style! Primarily a tapa bar with the notorious P-I-G as it's logo, you should expect generally salty treats.It's a cute little establishment tucked in the corner next to Nordstrom.  The have an extensive wine list and sell by the glass, 1/3, 1/2 and full bottle. I didn't partake but that's always a nice option.The pork secreto and wagyu beef were both winners in my book. Deliciously tender!The fried pig ear is an apparent staple and an interesting surprise. As I mentioned, a little on the salty side.Finish it up with some illy coffee. Can't go wrong.Bonus: always playing some bitchin' music."
"One of my favorite spots in the city. The bone marrow is the best of many great items on the menu. The toasted bread compliments the bone marrow perfectly. Other great dishes are the pork shoulder, chicken kebabs, the JLT and the Brussels sprouts. The service is fast and food comes out in a timely, well paced manner. The wait time is usually long but they let you leave your cell phone number and will call you when the table is ready. Given its prime location on Michigan Avenue, waiting is no problem because you can just shop while you wait!"
Fine dining with adventurous ingredients.  Great dishes prepared in appropriate portions.Excellent value for $$.Roasted Corn ($9) -- serves 2.  Cold side dish with my favorite ingredients (corn and mushrooms).Squid ($13) -- you only get 2 stuff squids.  Love the tentacles.  The exquisite swirls of sauces are complimentary and complicated that balances the entire dish.Nutella Panini ($6) -- definitely serves two.  Marshmallow galore.  Best eaten warm.  A dinner in itself.Gingerbread Rooibos Tea -- light clean taste by Rare Tea Cellar (Chicago local).Service -- Good recommendations Brian (knowledgeable and informative).  Superb water service.Venue -- tight and loud.  I love the marble tables.Be back for more menu tasting!
"The Wagyu Sirloin Tip was out of this world. Big crowd during lunch, so sat at the bar. Great staff and service."
"I think I saw God on Saturday night.Let's rewind. I had finished up a night of work (on the road) and decided on the Purple Pig based on the recommendation of the Chicago Tribune. I walked in and was informed that there was a two-hour wait for a regular table, but since I was alone, I opted to sit at the communal table immediately.Once I sat down, Nancy took over. She was an exceptionally enthusiastic server, one that offered suggestions without pretense and was attentive to a fault. (So, too, were her colleagues. I had a carafe of ice water at my disposal, but rarely did I have to fill up my cup myself.) She advised that I order my dishes as I go; the tapas plates varied in size, so it was best to eat slowly to my fill.I began with a charred cauliflower appetizer that was solid, but something that I still felt like I could replicate with a little bit of care on the ol' cast iron skillet.Then, the main course. I was split between the pork shoulder and the ""JLT"" -- their spin on the BLT. The pork shoulder, apparently, is one of their most popular dishes, but it's also one of the safer, more traditional plates. Nancy steered toward the ""JLT,"" an open-faced sandwich that consisted of pork jowl, tomato, arugula, pesto aioli and a sunny-side up duck egg. I did not regret it.This was easily the best dish I had in Chicago, a decadent concoction that balanced the deep flavors of the thick pork jowl bacon against the creamy aioli. The sandwich comes with a heavy knife, but I opted to just dive in with my hands and mouth. This resulted in some extra napkin usage, but it was worth the extra hedonistic pleasure of shoveling food into my face.Bite far enough for the sun-yellow yolk to dribble through, and even the most ardent atheist might believe in a higher power.If you're in the Chi, order this. For around $13, you won't regret it."
"Went back for seconds and just as good as the first! This time we had the octopus, razor clams, and duck prosciutto and all were so favorable and delicately delicious."
OMG just had the most amazing vegetarian meal at this place. Excellent wine selection. Dessert - try the hazelnut verrine.
"I ate here today, and the lackluster service was the reason I gave 2 stars.  After about 20 minutes, the server had not acknowledged us.  I had to walk to the host stand to complain before the server came by.  When he did visit the table, he had a stuck-up personality like we should be thanking him for being served by him.  Food was good and unique.  Prices are high for the smaller portions so the bill can add up fast."
"Wow, my kind of place.  I do think it's worth the wait, but why wait?  My friend and I showed up a few minutes before they opened for lunch on a Sunday and joined a short line of eager patrons.  There was so much on the menu I wanted!  But with just two of us dining we had to limit our selection.I knew for sure I wanted the PIG PLATTER of cure meats.  I think it had 10 of the 13 cured meat items on the menu and plenty of thick, buttery toast.  All excellent!  I took leftovers on my flight home later that day.From the antipasti section, we added the PORK FRIED ALMONDS, ROSEMARY AND GARLIC (amazing) and the SALT-ROASTED BEETS WITH WHIPPED GOAT CHEESE AND PISTACHIO VINAIGRETTE.  It was okay...a bit heavy on the vinaigrette.From the smears section, I had to give bone marrow another try.  The ROASTED BONE MARROW WITH HERBS came with two generous sections of bone, parsley, capers and more thick toast.  You spread the oily, rich marrow, dust it with salt and herbs and enjoy.  I'm not a huge fan of marrow, but this was probably my favorite take."
This place was great. Busy but once we got in the service was great and the food was awesome. Definitely good to be adventuresome with food choices here.
"OMG. Long, long wait, small space, and very crowded with a diverse mix of people. Somehow the waitstaff just knew when to pop in to check on you so that made everything better while you're standing and waiting. After 30-45 minutes, we were lucky to snag a spot at the bar - very good spot to see the synchronized action going on in the open kitchen. The food and wine were soooo worth the wait and I'm not really a pork lover either so it was that good. I love small portions and sharing. I love mixing different food ingredients together in an unorthodox and creative way that just feels like a party in your mouth and that's exactly what we got. My dining buddy (ie foodie friend) and I ordered a lot of items. What I remembered most were the delicious kale salad, bone marrow smear, and foie gras. We ordered Greek wine and it was so perfect, we ordered a bottle after.This place has an exciting energy and whether you're dressed up, in biz attire, or casual in workout clothes, you belong. Be prepared to get very cozy with other diners. Well worth it."
Had the bone marrow and the beets with goat cheese. Both excellent. Had no problems with seating. Definitely going back. To try more things. Friendly waiter. Thanks to yelpers for pictures and recommendations.
"If you love meat, thiss the place. Last time we came on a Saturday night and they told us we'll have to wait for 4 hours. So be prepared to wait!"
"This review is a long time coming! I went to The Purple Pig for the first time on the 4th of July with my husband and a friend. I'd heard horror stories about the wait, so I arrived around 3pm and asked when I would need to come back in order to get a table at 6pm. The hostess told me to come back in a half hour. This turned out to be right on the money. Yes, it's a long wait, but I reasoned that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow would make it all worth it.And it did. The wine and beer lists are both tremendous, and the rest of the menu is small plates. We ordered many delectable things, which included bone marrow, which we'd had twice before at other places, and taramasalata, which we always order if we see it on a menu because it is delicious.The service was snappy and quick and, if it weren't such an undertaking to secure a table, I would definitely return more frequently!"
"I once came here two nights in a row. I'm not even the least bit sorry. Incredible wine list, martinis, and, of course, the FOOD. Where to begin...Some items on the menu are offered only on a seasonal basis, but: my must-haves include the milk-braised pork shoulder, bone marrow, charcuterie sampler platter, brussels sprouts (a cru or fried varieties), butternut squash with salata ricotta, crispy pork jowl, kale salad with quail egg and anchovy... I could go on and on. If by some miracle you have room for dessert, order the ""Sicilian Iris"" - it's a religious experience."
"Amazing service and food. Let's start off with the service. Everyone from the host to our server to the busboy, they were all extremely friendly and attentive. My glass of water was never more than half empty and the table was cleaned after every plate came out.Now for the food. The food was very unique and was meant to be shared amongst others. Definitely worth a try if you are in the Chicago area."
"O-M-G!! You'd be an idiot to not come here! Who cares it's first come first serve - it's worth the wait. First off the manager, Ana was phenomenal. She saw how nervous my partner was - she picked up on it right away and immediately made her comfortable!  Amazing service. She seated us in a cozy spot and we ordered away. The food is simply divine. I would have tastes everything but my waistline wouldn't permit it. I'm certainly coming back!! You would too...."
"I think it's overrated. Long wait (no reservations), high prices (even for the area), and small portions (you have to get a great number dishes to share). The food itself tastes good - if you can get into some creative (i.e. weird) flavors and ingredients like pork tripe."
Delicious wine and tapas bar just off the magnificent mile. Great outdoor seating area and servers who never made us feel rushed.
"I went twice to The Purple Pig and wasn't disappointed by the food - everything was excellent but the rillettes and octopus were probably my favorite dishes. People are squeezed and it's noisy, with most of the time a very long waiting."
"Here's how I decide where to go on vacation...""Never been to (fill in name of city), let's go there.""  Thankfully I have a best friend that is usually game for whatever city fills that blank, provided she too has never been.  When a member of my self-selected family suggested we hit up her hometown of Chicago I was game, because ""never been to Chicago.""We landed after a long day of travel due to flight delays, get to our hotel and we are all quite peckish.  We knew we where having a good dinner later on that evening, but wine and nosh were required so we headed out to The Purple Pig.  It was the perfect place to begin our food tour of Chicago.  Everything at the Purple Pig is meant for sharing.  We ordered a bunch of small plates that were all fantastic.  A couple of standouts for me were the cheese and charcuterie boards (which we let the staff make suggestions and that worked out real well) and the crispy Brussels sprouts.  They also have cool paninis and some nice eggplant dishes, and a pork liver mousse that even I enjoyed (and I generally don't enjoy liver).The staff was fantastic.  Full of knowledge, and willing to share, about the food and wine, friendly, attractive...these sort of things are important to me.  The decanted some wine for us, twice.  The environment was bright and cool.  We sat at one of their two community tables.  There were five in our party so we didn't end up sharing, but we could have.  The music was also fantastic and went really well with the environment.  This is definitely a spot I can recommend.  Way to welcome a newcomer to a cool city."
"This is probably one of the easier five stars I have ever given. I just recently moved to Chicago and have heard non-stop about the Purple Pig, but also about the terribly long wait. My girl friend and I decided to go there right after work this week and we only had about a 15 minute wait, totally worth it! I am from Denver and this restaurant really reminds me of places there: lots of wood, metals, textures, close quarters, small tables, inspired menus, plenty of flannel, beards, and an upscale hipster vibe. This is not the place to go if you want a quiet place to linger, it's loud with ahhhmazinggg jams bumping in the background. My friend and I definitely got down to Estelle's ""American Boy"" (I mean how can you not dance to that song!) I was really impressed with the wine list. From first glance, Purple Pig seems like the kind of place that would have a very inspired, cocktail heavy menu, but they actually place the emphasis on wine. Of course, you are welcome to get a delicious cocktail as well, but with a wine list this good, you may not want to miss it! I love the focus on international vines; they take the Mediterranean focus to the extreme by offering Greek wines, which are extremely underappreciated but so tasty! Once we ordered some great Burgundy reds, we turned our attention to the menu. I used to be someone who was anti-pork-I guess I always pictured those cute pygmy pigs ending up on my plate. Well, these thoughts disappeared once I took a look at the menu. We went all out and ordered 4 different plates (more than enough for two people). My favorite was the pig ear and kale salad-crispy, salty, and flavorful deliciousness. Not too oily, not too crunchy, the ingredients struck a perfect balance with one another. Second place was the braised cauliflower. I want to serve this at Thanksgiving, it was so nurturing, buttery, the perfect texture, all without being too heavy. The bone marrow was next, which, judging by fellow Yelpers, is one of the highlights of the restaurant. I have to say, it was spectacular, but my favorite thing about it was the herbed salad served with it. The bones are huge, so be prepared. Make sure and combine all the ingredients for maximum satisfaction: bread (lightly buttered), bone marrow, sea salt, and salad, the perfect little sandwich. Last up was the short rib. We were almost hoping it didn't come because by this time a food coma was setting in. But it did come, and we did our duty and ate it. And enjoyed the heck out of it! The sauce that is served with this is fascinating: a combination of roasted red peppers and a pesto that is pretty sweet to the taste, and when combined with the salty smokiness of the short rib, you get a burst of harmonious flavor. It was fabulous, but we couldn't finish it! However, we were able to order and eat all of our dessert. We decided on the Greek fried dough with honey and cinnamon, a perfect light ending to a filling meal. I was certainly overly impressed by the Purple Pig. Sometimes these celebrity chef restaurants can fall short of expectations, but Purple Pig did nothing but exceed mine. Go here, wait in line, have a glass of outstanding wine while you wait, and enjoy that pygmy pig on your plate."
Checked out a new spot for me tonight and I couldn't be happier with the entire experience! My friend and I decided to get dressed up and hit the town on this gorgeous chicago spring night! We shared multiple small plates and a fabulous Italian wine recommended by our waitress Lauren! Thanks for a great evening and I'll definitely be back with some of my salon friends! I highly recommend the pork rillons with a honey glaze....absolutely delish and almost like dessert!! Great overall atmosphere as well!!
"I like this place a lot, the menu is very interesting and attractive. Full of dishes to be tried.. the by the glass list is nice too. I had a blackberry sage icetea which was a curious combination too. Olives+squid(see pictures) very good. Bravi!Ps. I would give 4++"
"A friend and I travelled to Chicago for the marathon and the restaurant was highly recommended by a friend. We waited approximately one and a half hour, but it was worth the wait. The Purple Pig provided one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! The restaurant seated us at a communal table, so we feasted like royalty in company of fellow runners. Our waiter provided exceptional service and all his suggestions were on point. So, if your travels ever take you to the Windy City, make your way there PRONTO!"
"The Purple Pig is definitely a little more on the touristy end of places to go, but you won't be disappointed with the food one bit! Everything we ordered when we went tended to be a little on the greasy and heavy side, but could be due to the fact that we were focused on the savory items (bone marrow, turkey leg, panini, etc). On top of that, the food is great, we were able to sit on the patio which is always nice, and the staff is phenomenal. I don't think my water was ever less than half full. In terms of getting a table, I would highly recommend going early. People start lining up the second they open, and it seems like they're on full throttle until the end. No need to get there ridiculously early, but a good 5-10 min will definitely help you out. (They don't take reservations). For pricing, definitely a little on the higher end for a brunch place since it's in the heart of the city, but well worth giving it a shot! You'll have a great time!"
"Sigh Purple Pig, where does one begin?   Is it this atmosphere of coziness and perfection.... Yes!!  Are you walking into an old world in Spain, Italy or France or some other magical location who knows but the vibe is on point. First visit was truly a delightsecond visit...Why haven't we come back sooner.Enjoyed the Pork fired almonds with rosemary & garlicMarinated olivesCharred cauliflower, toasted breadcrumbsShaved brussels sprouts, percino noce Salted roasted beets, whipped goat cheese Octopus & green beansBurrata Pugliese, grilled kohlrabi, apples, crispy speck & beer agrodolceBone marrow with herbsVino: Portugal, AlentoCheeses: Caso Bolo MellagePercino NoceBlu di bufalaPoddaMeats: TestaProsciutto di ParmaChorizoPurple Pig PlatterPort: Porto Kopke Late bottle Vintage 2001Dolce: Lemon Panna CottaAffogatoWhen you've completed this incredible trip somewhere amaze, you may want to lick the plate.  Don't be ashamed, be you!Purple Pig leaves you wanting more and more!Don't drive, take a cab or uber."
Another Chicago favorite. very great atmosphere. we came right before closing and the wait was not long. I would recommend ordering small plates and sharing it amongst friends so you can get a taste of everything.
"I stopped by while in Chicago for work, so I was by myself. To enjoy this place to the fullest, it's best to come with 1-3 people and split the tapas style dishes.I tried the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and it was the perfect amount for me. The pork was so tender it fell apart! I definitely want to come back and try to bone marrow smear!"
Simply amazing and delicious!  Yes we had to put our names on the list and had to wait about an hour..  But well worth it . .  Calimari was the best ive ever had.  Light fresh and perfectly cooked. . Pork tenderloin was unbelievably moist and flavorful.  Also the Pork Neck gravy with Ricotta was so SO good. . The desserts were incredible too!  Excellent all the way around! Cant wait to go back.  Only complaint: it was VERY loud!  Could hardly have a conversation.. . But..  It was a Friday night..  Soo somewhat expected ..
"The Purple Pig did not disappoint! It was recommended to us while on a biz trip in March. We took the waiters recommendations and shared a bunch of small plates which were mouthwatering, we tried a couple things we've never had before most were great, but I think my own head stood in the way of the bone marrow, but the plate was cleaned by the rest of my group. Inside was crowded so we were on the enclosed patio w/ heater which also filled up, apparently we timed it perfectly for an early dinner.They bring food out as it's ready, so it's perfect for sharing and having plates come one right after another, we ended up ordering too much, but it was polished off anyway."
"During our trip to Chicago we went here for our fancy splurge date and tried a variety of things. All pretty good. Over $100 though. First up for the fancy feast, Fried Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries. Awesome.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. Like butter. Very unique rich flavor. We also tried a meat (Prosciutto di San Daniele) and cheese (Casa something from Wisconsin) plate that came with a jam spread and bread. I didn't get a picture of it, but it was very good.Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. Really good.Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette. Refreshing.And lastly, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. You could cut it with a spoon. Melts in your mouth. Excellent."
Great place - good food - only complaint is space - you sit on top of folks inside (which is ok in the winter!)
"I had the octopus w/ green beans and I must admit, the cephalopod was cooked to perfection!  I also tried the feta corn bread and the contrast of the sweet and cheese was delightful.  I would imagine all the other food at this place would be good.  I reserve 5 stars only for the elite, superb food, service, and price.  PP fell just short due to the value, either give slightly bigger portion or reduce the price.  I will definitely return again in the future."
"Dined at the Purple Pig on a Thursday. It's busy. The restaurant is small and the tables are close together while this is something to expect at a downtown establishment it seems that even though you have separate tables you are joining the strangers next to you for dinner. Tables fill up fast and the restaurant does not take reservations. The service was ok, people are friendly but not personable- you can tell they want to turn tables (this is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars)The food was delicious, the plates are tapas style so order about 3 to 4 dishes to feel satisfied if your party is 2/3 people. Skip the house made gyros... But the prosciutto stuffed squid was delicious, superb in fact. A last minute addition of meatballs did not disappoint. The meatballs rival my Italian in-laws but these were better (don't tell!!)!  The wine list was impressive and it was served at the perfect temperature. If your looking for something one of a kind, stop at the Purple Pig."
"Pigs ear with kale FTW. Also winners from the night are the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta and milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Start with a cheese and cured meat plate, and you'll have the perfectly balanced meal!"
"We got to the Purple Pig at 11:45 AM and we were able to snag a table without any wait.  It was pretty much a full dining room by Noon.  I have to admit my first impression wasn't great.  Our waiter didn't come over to our table for at least 10 minutes.  The water dude did come and pour us water (more on him later).  Once the waiter came by and the order was placed - I'm happy to report it was very smooth sailing from there on out.It was just the two of us so we shared a few plates.  We ordered the grilled octopus, the chicken sausage with kale and chickpeas, and the eggplant crostini.  My favorite dish was the grilled octopus.  It was so tender - it almost tasted like seared scallop.  It was served with a chimichurri ""like sauce"" - the waiter said it was their version of a salsa verde but it was more like chimichurri.  It was so delicious that I was thinking about that dish many hours later! The chicken sausage was also very delicious - it almost tasted like veal, it was again super tender.  My husband loved the eggplant crostini more than I did.  Maybe I was too full by then but it was verging on being ""too salty"" and I would have liked a better quality goat cheese (it was more like a spread) on the thick slices of grilled bread.Service was actually phenomenal (once the meal got ordered).  Our water glass was never less than 3/4 full before the water dude would fill our glasses up (even though there was a bottle of water on our table).  And when our plates got too messy between courses 2 and 3, we had not one, but two people rush over to replace our plates and silverware. We were sadly, too full to sample dessert (fried brioche sounded heavenly) but we did have espresso. It was done right!So, why the 4 stars? Granted, it was a truly amazing meal but I personally would have enjoyed an ambiance that was a little quieter and where you weren't literally rubbing elbows with the tables next to you.  I also think it was a tad overpriced ($75 for Lunch for two with 1 beer and 1 5 0z glass of wine)  but then again, I may be used to suburban prices.I had heard so much about PP that I was worried it was hype but it's the real deal!Definitely a memorable meal.  You do feel like you should run a marathon afterwards to burn off some of it but again - well worth the trip! And next time, I'm definitely trying the bone marrow."
"Wow wow wow wow. Probably the best Pork I've ever had. It can be Tapas-style or it can also be individual dish. The wait is quite long, but it's totally worth the wait. For those of you likes privacy, be ready to be nice and cozy with a stranger because usually the long table seats are the ones that open up, but hey no worries, because everyone will be too engrossed in the food. Highly recommended. Every dish I've tasted at the Purple Pig so far had been great so by statistical inference, chances are that you'll most likely enjoy it as well! Just go and give it a try. It'll be worth it. ;)"
"It's rare when I decide to write a review, it has to be perfectly crafted meals, service and value. The Purple Pig unquestionably delivered all three. The food was exceptional,  Mauro delivered fantastic service and we were able to try almost half of all the small plates at an incredible value.If there is one thing that is something you can't leave without eating,  it's the Milk Pork Shoulder and the JLT.  The pork shoulder fell apart with a fork and the duck egg smeared over the pork jowl to create this rich incredible mixture. PERFECTION doesn't even describe these dishes. We also had the chicken thighs, scallops, veal and the grilled cheese with bacon jam which were incredible and left us stuffed. My sister is an Executive Chef back at  home in Michigan and she told me if I went anywhere in Chicago,  this was a MUST.  I'm so thankful she did,  it's permanently on my to-do list from now on every time I visit the city. Thank you Purple Pig for what may have been one of the best meals I've ever had and for your great recommendations Mauro. I'll see you soon!"
"Best octopus I have had on this side of the pond. Fun, bustling, unpretentious atmosphere and great, honest food. Service was excellent as well."
"I rarely gave out bad review of a restaurant but this one made me do it. I had bone marrow, which is disgusting; pork shoulder is such a small portion and taste bad; almond is not as good as expected. The only thing I don't complain is the corn bread, that's because everything else tasted so bad. Too expensive for this kind of quality. Will never come back nor recommend it to anyone I know."
"Middle of the day, Saturday - 10.04.144.5 stars, rounded up.  This place is not quite as big as The Girl & Goat, but it was packed!  No reservations are taken here, so luckily, somebody left the bar as I walked in.  Great service, great food, but not 5 stars...I had the pork shoulder(excellent), razor clam(excellent), Octopus(great), deviled egg(not recommended), & Siri for dessert(good).  All the portions here are large and it would take a table of 4-5 to really sample more of the menu.  No half orders of anything.  Extensive wine list and a great non-USA collection.   This is a great Chicago restaurant, where everybody cozies up to each other.  The patio was open,  despite the crazy wind and rain...that's how popular this place is.  I will go again, but would need others with me to try more things."
"Another great restaurants in Chicago, we came here for lunch on a Tuesday, luckily we came early enough so there's no wait. We sat at the bar, great service. We started off with two smears dishes, bone marrow and foie gras & membrillo, both pretty amazing, I preferred the bone marrow because the foie gras was a bit sweeter than I like. We got JLT and chicken thighs kebabs for entrees. You can't come to the Purple Pig without ordering the JLT, it's their play of BLT. The jowl is tender and juicy. The chicken thigh was a bit unexpected recommendation, but we LOVED it, SO tender and delicious. I would definitely come back if I'm back in Chicago again."
"The wine and cocktail list is awesome and very extensive. The chicken thigh kabobs were fantastic, and absolutely could have been a meal for one. The fried olives were great, and the house cured capicollo was really good. I would have gone for the pig platter but they don't have gluten free bread or crackers available which is my only real complaint. Fun atmosphere."
"This is by far my favorite restaurant anywhere. From the cute dishes and plates to the great food, what's not to love? Except maybe the bathrooms, but as least they make up for it with nice-smelling soap. I ordered the cauliflower tapa... So good! There were bits of pickle in it, so our was a tad sour and salty, but that's how I like it. My server recommended the turkey leg. Boy was I surprised when it came. The thing was huge. My friends all had tiny bowls of vegetables, squid, and whatever, but I got this enormous plate and a knife. I somehow managed to finish the leg. I can't believe how cheap it was for the size and taste. I think it was $16 or $17. I split all the desserts with my friends. The ice cream by itself was to die for! The hazelnut verine wasn't as good as I hoped. It was also hard to eat since it came in a tall glass. I loved the nutella crepe and cheesecake as well. Ooh my, this review is making me hungry. Someone please take me back!"
Fantastic restaurantWho doesn't want to eat all parts of the pigWine selection is great!I love it.BONE MARROW IS TO DIE FOR.. MMM. BONE.... MARRROWWWWWWW.
"I was in the city for a week. This was my 1st time in the city and I went here my 1st night and had to return for my last night. Wish they had places like these in orlando. It has a romantic and chill vibe to it with the lights being dim. The waitresses I had on both nights were super helpful. Loved everything that I tried, but my boyfriend and I hands down LOVED the fried octopus. AHHHMAZINGG. The prices were worth the portion. This is true tapas were you can share and be full."
"Nice food, loud room.  I had some of the appetizers and a main that was fairly tasty. The wine list is adequate and approachable. Service was spotty."
Amazing food and great atmosphere.  Loved the long communal tables. We had a lovely conversation with a couple seated next to us. Great wine list.
"Divine doesn't being to describe our dining experience at The Purple Pig. But it's the best one I can muster up at this moment. The service: superb. A nice, go-get-'em waiter who loved the food he was serving. The food: divine. delectable. delicious. Every morsel was heavenly. We had Caramelized Brussels Sprouts, The Pig Platter, Roasted Bone Marrow, Roasted Turkey Leg, Pig ear with Mustard Green, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta, and for dessert, Sicilian Iris. It's not an exaggeration to say that everything, I mean EVERYTHING we ate was perfectly delicious. Nothing was over flavored, under flavored, or lacking anything. And I know some folks knock the small bites, etc. BUT, I appreciated that the portions were small and meant to be shared with friends. And the obvious plus is that we got to try so many awesome things on the menu. We were in Chicago for only 5 days and we are so stoked we got to stop by. Note: they don't take reservations. They are always busy. BUT you leave your name and cell number, go shopping around the corner and come back when your table is ready. What more could you ask for?"
"Came here for my birthday lunch on a long weekend and had an amazing meal. I read up on how crazy the wait was (thanks fellow yelpers), and so decided to come early. We had a party of 4 and got a table right away at 11:40 AM. By 12, the restaurant was fully seated, and by 12:30 there was a long wait.Bone marrow, foie gras smear, and pork shoulder were amazing. Stuffed squid, sicilian iris were pretty good.Fried pig ears tasted like they just put the breading into the frier and served it, no pork taste at all.We also had some dessert with caramel ice cream and popcorn on top. Just ok, wouldn't order again.Overall, I was really impressed with the food, and we had a great time at the restaurant."
"This place was AWESOME. They don't take reservations and there was an 3 hour wait when we went. I really wanted to eat here though, so we waited for a spot to open up at the bar. We got a bottle of Pinot Noir, which was amazing (don't remember what it was called). For dinner, we ordered the Pigs Platter, which is a chefs selection of about 9 different meats. We added 3 cheeses that our bartender chose for us since we aren't really cheese experts, and they were AMAZING. Not sure exactly what they were- one was a goat cheese and one a cheese from Wisconsin. Loved the atmosphere of this place, the wine and food were excellent, and the service was great. We would definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago!"
The food is amazing.  And the portions are perfect for sharing.  Must try the cheesecake!
"Line is long and the food is overrated. Kind of cool vibe. Loud and barish feel to the place. I probably wouldn't go back because the food wasn't that good and the wait was too long. I feel like they try to be like girl and the goat, but just not as nice and not as good. Not enough space in the restaurant and feel squeezed. I did not like my experience here."
"Absolute best place EVER. We went at 7 pm and they said the wait would be 45 minutes, but we just took a nice stroll down Michigan ave. and the wait ended up being a quick 30 minutes. The food and wait staff were amazing. I unintentionally chose a vegetarian friend to accompany me but the waiter was so enthusiastic and helpful in pointing out the vegetarian options, which she ended up really enjoying. She ordered the broccoli which was a little too salty but ended up going really well with the smear she got. I had the problem where I literally wanted to order everything off the menu. Ended up going with the bone marrow spread and pork shoulder and was so impressed with both of them. The bread for the bone marrow was amazing and went perfectly with the cilantro and salt they provided. The pork shoulder was so tender and also was so delicious with the sauce and mashed potatoes. The helpings are pretty generous for ""small plates"" so I think the best way to do it is go with a bunch of friends so you can order a plate of everything and just split it. Even before the food came I was already obsessed with this place because the atmosphere was amazing and literally every menu item sounded so good and exotic. I can list off at least 5 other things I want to try. I can't wait to go back it was absolutely worth it and is now solidly one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. My friend who was vegetarian also is dying to go back. The only thing I'm sad about is it was a little too dark to take nice photos of the food so I could make all my friends jealous!"
"This restaurant didn't meet my expectations.  The atmosphere is overly crowded and loud.  It is not conducive to a date night as it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  The food was mediocre and our server was rushed.  We shared a platter of cured meats and cheeses along with the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.  The experience was not worth the expense."
Ordered the pig ear with kale and fried cheese. Both were very good. The cheese was phenomenal but my taste buds weren't used to the fried pig ear. Not bad though- just a different palette.  For the main course I had the pork shoulder with potatoes. It was wonderful and fell apart in your mouth! Great place!
"Really enjoyed this place! Beautiful view in a perfect location, amazing food, fantastic wine and cheese selection, and an awesome atmosphere.Ordered the cheese platter to start. I'm one of those guys that has no idea what the types of cheeses or variations are, but just love cheese. The chef chose a trio of cheese for us based on our preferences and it turned out to be perfect! So delicious!Ordered the chorizo stuffed olives next and man it was one of the most delicious and unique things I've ever eaten. The acidity of the olives balanced perfectly with the smoky and savory taste of the chorizo.Ordered the veal tenderloin with chimichurri for the main entree and it was melt in your mouth delicious.Just a great experience overall. It was so busy when we went for lunch that it was tough to get a servers attention when we needed something, but the food more than made up for it. Great unique spot in Chicago. I will be back next time I visit."
"1:30 mins to get in. The Turkey leg and shoulder pork were pretty amazing. Unfortunately the two of us ordered the octopus and lamb dishes which were pretty small and left us hungry...so we had to order yet another turkey leg. Everything was good, but just take that into account when going in, since all 4 dishes run between 15 and 17"
"Vibe: The purple pig is such a fun place to dine at either for couples or groups of friends! Half way through our lunch, these two people sitting next to us started chatting with us and we found out that one of them was a former CEO of a big tech firm! How fun;)Food: the *braised pork shoulder* is a MUST-ORDER! The meat itself was extremely soft and juicy, along with the delicious mashed potatoes and gravy. We also ordered honey corn bread, salad and the deep fried pig ear and we thought they were okay."
"We heard from some friends that we HAD to go here on our most recent Chicago trip. We did. It was worth the 45 min wait. When we arrived on Friday afternoon around 2 p.m. the place was full. They took our name and phone number and said it would be around an hour. We went across the street and had a drink while we waited for our call. 45 mins later we were seated. We asked to be seated in the restaurant because the other option is under a tent outside with a bunch of heat lamps. I knew I'd be unhappy there. For the food, we had the chorizo stuffed olives and the shaved brussel sprouts for starters. We loved both. We had a charcuterie board for the main course and it did not disappoint. The only one better I have had is at Grey Plume Provisions in Omaha. Lastly we had the seasoned nuts. I need to figure out how to recreate these! All in all, highly recommend. Great food and service!"
"Amazing, amazing and amazing!!!!! Love the decor, ambiance, and FOOD!!! Everything is amazing!!! Service to food. Wow. We got there without reservation and put our name down and got drinks while waiting. The waitress who was taking care of us was awesome! They specifically had waitress assigned for ppl who's waiting. Pretty cool.Once we sat down we had Eggplant caponata & goat cheese smear. OMG!!! To die for! Also had Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette. Again to die for!!! Check out the pics I posted. I definitely know this will be my regular spot!  Can't wait to go back there next month when I'm back in Chi town :)"
"My favorite place that we dined on our trip to Chicago (and yes we did go to Girl & The Goat)! Our waitress was sooo great and made perfect recommendations. Our group of 4 girls tried at least 7 things from the menu, all of which were just phenomenal. We also got some great cocktails. I would highly recommend the Purple Pig and will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"I came here for my birthday last year. I really like their food. It's really special and delicious. A lot of people recommend The Purple Pig on Yelp, so when we visited Chicago we decided to come here. I love their service and environment. I think The Purple Pig gave me a very good experience of my 25th birthday!"
"Cheese, swine and wine! Don't let the pork scare you- extensive menu offerings!!This place is an experience in itself! The food- words cannot describe! A definite must when in Chicago. Walked in on a whim not knowing anything about this place and boy did we luck out. Didn't have high expectations as the spot is directly in the heart of tourist central- Michigan Ave!The location is right next to a river- sets a nice vibe with a patio overlooking it. Once the warmer weather hits this is where the seating is at! Be warned- tight quarters!Reservations are a must because this place was packed soon after we were seated.There is not one thing on the menu I wouldn't try and the server was helpful going through the menu. Definitely ask what the staff picks are- never a let down! Menu is primarily meant to be shared although portions are generous.Opted to start with wine and a cheese board. Extensive selection for both. Asked the server to surprise us and pick the five cheeses. Outstanding! My love for Manchego and Chèvre Noir was born!Turkey leg confit- HUGE portion, flavourful and not the least bit dry! If Thanksgiving turkey was this good it would be on the menu every week! You can walk off dinner by heading south/west along the Chicago River leading to the lake or continue down Michigan Ave and power shop.Left full and happy! The Purple Pig will always be on the itinerary when in the windy city!"
"Amazing service. I ordered a beer and didn't like it, so they offered to change it without even asking!Food was awesome. Best octopus ever. Best Pork Shoulder ever. Will go back next time I am in Chicago.Only order we made that I thought was lagging was the charcuterie. Small portions, very fatty (and not in the right way) prosciutto, and relatively tasteless salami. Didn't matter in the end."
"I found out why Jimmy Bannos Jr. was nominated for the James Beard Rising Chef Award. But, I failed to find out why he didn't win. The food was impeccable, the service was perfect.  I've never frequented the same restaurant twice during the same trip... until now.  A food and wine convention was in town at McCormick the week I went to the Purple Pig making it near impossible to get a table.  The wait for a two top was a little more than two hours!While waiting I got the perfect chance to catch up with my friend on all the happenings since we last saw each other (over two years).  We were given a drink menu to explore and delicious pork fried almonds.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…Once we were seated we looked at their seasonal, incredibly well-written menu.  I must admit almost all the dishes piqued my interests!I am convinced someone is hired to massage and tenderize their octopus.  Ridiculously tender, perfectly seasoned!yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…Next a traditional foie gras presentation.  Foie gras, membrillo and plancha toasted bread.  The plancha really transformed the bread into this magical, perfect, textured jewel for the foie.  Amazing.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…The bone marrow dish is a must.  Really simple, straight forward flavors, bright and tasty.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…Luckily my trip had landed right in the middle of ramp season.  A real treat to any foodie, ramps are a clean, earthy green that is special to have fresh because of the extremely short growing season.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…Next we had razor clams with oregano, lemon and olive oil.  The beautiful and tender clams were succulent with a little bit of acid.  Great flavor, memorable.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…The crispy pig ear is one of their specialty dishes.  Fried crisp, the crunchy bits are a great addition to the salad of kale, pickled cherry peppers, jalapenos and fried egg.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…For dessert we got the Sicilian Iris, a real treat.  A molten orb of ricotta and chocolate chips in a brioche. yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…The food here is amazing, the people are fantastic, the wine list is a real treat.  The next time I find myself in Chicago, you better believe I'll be back.There is so much more of the menu to explore.  Who wants in?"
"Mehhhhhhhhhhhh. My friend heard that Purple Pig is a must try in the Windy City, so we decided to try. The wait........ 3.5 hours?! No thank you. Honestly, I don't care how delicious your food is. 3.5 hours is not worth it. 2 hours is the max I'd wait for food. With that wait, we  would maybe have been sat at around 11pm. That's not dinner time. Anyway, we walked around and came back maybe 1.5 hours later. They said that people were taking themselves off the waitlist so it may be a 30-45 minute wait. We decided to go back to our room to wait, but ended up not going because they called us when it basically hit the 3ish hour mark. The next day, it was a 45 min to 1hr wait. We get seated and the waitress takes my friends' drink orders. Comes back and takes our food order. Our bone marrow came out before the drinks. My friend reminded 2 different waiters and it still took a while to come. The bone marrow was okay. But they don't give you enough bread with it. So while we were waiting for more bread, the bone marrow started to get meh. I ordered the Pork Blade Steak. Don't get this. It just tastes plain. Not worth the money. I basically ended up not eating. I know this place is popping, but I couldn't help but feel rushed by the waiters. They would constantly be standing near us watching our plates as it seemed as if they wanted us to hurry up and leave so that they could seat their next table.Honestly, I don't think this place is that great. I probably wouldn't come back. But hey, that's probably just my taste. My friends enjoyed it. NOTE: NO RESERVATIONS."
"Awesome place, came here w/ my wife this past summer, and the food was decadent! Too bad I figured out to late that the host took bribes to jump the long wait time ;) (maybe next time....) I watched him take 50 bucks from an eager customer and was seated immediately."
"Really disappointing.  We had high hopes from the good reviews.  We arrived at 2pm, and things started out well when my wife and I were seated immediately.  But things went downhill from there.My wife ordered the oil poached tuna and it came out with wayyy too much vinegar.  I got the cornbread which was dry and it tasted like it was made using a grocery store prepaid mix.  The feta cheese and honey on top was good, but it was not enough to save the dish.  I also ordered the meatball slider.  The meat itself was savory, but the tiny portion size left a lot to be desired. Save your money and go eat somewhere else."
"I've had about 20 different dishes here over a few years. They have literally gone from nose (OK, that one was a drink) to tail and most of the organs in between. All have been delicious. Seriously, in this one restaurant, I have had tails, tripe, feet, ears, and whatever they put in sausage. I'm pretty sure there is nobody else who can make all of that taste good.Plus, despite all of that AND being super busy, they're not badly priced. Sure, my check is often $60 or bigger. I also pig out (pardon the pun). You won't get this happy for this price anywhere else in River North."
"Walked right past it initially, so if you're walking down Michigan Ave just watch for the purple awning. Once you know what you're looking for, you can't miss it. Came here on a Thursday night and they were packed. Got extremely lucky and got a seat right at the bar in front of the food prep area. I personally think we had the best seat in the house.  Great attentive service, and very knowledgeable staff. Asked for a wine recommendation and got a great red to go with the pork belly. And then there's the food. The delicious, delicious food. Small plates and high quality. I would absolutely come here again the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I have a gluten and Shellfish allergy so that made it very hard for me to eat hear. The person I was with loved their meal, but it was hard to eat. What I did have was good, but wish i would have pieced another place. BTW the place was packed. So looked like a very hot spot, just not for me."
"Very Impressed.I was in town for a convention and my friends from the area all raved about Purple Pig, so I stopped by on my last night in town. For a table of two at around 7:30pm on a Tuesday, the wait was about 30-40 minutes long.We started off with the pig platter and a selection of three cheeses (a soft, hard, and a blue) - The pig platter had an excellent selection of meat and was almost too much for the two of us. The cheeses were good, but aside from the Oma von Trapp we tried, I can't say i remember the other two too well.The wine menu is extensive, and the white sangria is good.We also had the milk-braised pork shoulder, pork jowl, and wagyu sirloin tip - each of these dishes were prepared perfectly, and we left feeling completely satisfied.I'll definitely be back!"
"Came here off a good recommendation, but it was a big miss for my gf and me.First thing you should know is that they are busy, very busy.  Make sure to make a reservation cause we didn't and had to wait a while.  Most times that's a good sign, but we felt that the wait was not worth it, but more on that in a second.Sitting down, my gf and I waited an unreasonable amount of time for someone to come and help us.  When they did come they set a glass bottle of water on the table.  Completely normal, until someone comes around and pours you some water.  It seemed weird that we were given water, but now someone is coming around with to pour water (not from the bottle set on our table).  Seemed redundant and silly almost like the bottle was there just for decoration.  We ordered four dishes - we were not asked if we wanted something to drink.I had the pork shoulder and a meatball slider; my gf had the calamari and something else (sorry I forgot).  Good news was that the pork shoulder was spectacular.  It was delicious, amazing, I would have this every day of my life if I could.  The rest of our meal was complete rubbish.  One of my gfs dishes had more vinegar than a supermarket shelf and the other dish was salty beyond any expectation.  My meatball slider was plain, boring, and uninspired.  At twice the price of a meatball slider at the Meatball Shop in nyc, the Purple Pigs slider was the perfect punctuation of disappointment to the meal.We left as slowly as possible thanks to our waiter didn't come around to get our payment for a good long while."
I really like this place they have fantastic food that is really really delicious. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. The unfortunate part is that in the waiting to be seated is super long and that's kind of frustrating. I guess there's not much they can do but I sometimes don't come here just because of that. I hope they could fix it somehow!
Delicios as always
"Expect a long wait no matter what they say. Luckily we snagged a few bar seats. Fried Brussel sprouts - Anything fried is delicious. A little salty though.Pigs ear and kale - Topped with a sunny side up egg. You break up the yolk and use it as a dressing. Kale and pigs ear are so crispy then you mix it with the runny egg, yum. Again a little salty though.Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - really tender meat, really flavorful, and a good portion. Pork ossobusco (sp?) - Huge portion, again, really really tender meat. Fell right off the bone. Had a red sauce, mashed potatoes, and topped with some greens. The combination is just amazing. Melts in your mouth.Was so full but I'd like to try a few other items next time I come in."
"This was perhaps our fifth visit to Purple Pig, and we make it a stop on all of our Chicago trips.  We stopped here for a mid-week lunch and snagged a seat at the counter despite a 45 minute wait for a table.I thought I'd reviewed Purple Pig in the past, and while I may have given it five stars at one point, I think it's still great - although is sitting a bit on its laurels.We started with the kale/romain Ceaser salad with quail eggs and (missing?) house cured anchovies.  This was so good my wife wants me to imitate it for our next party.The octopus with green beans, etc. was probably our least favorite dish.  While the octopus was cooked perfectly, this dish was overly citrusy and too mushy.  The waitress did mention that the menu has tended to be very lemony as of late.We also tried the veal sweetbreads/prawn sausage.  I expected this to be a lot better than it was - a bit tasteless considering the ingredients.We finished with burnt caramel ice cream with sea salt - good but we only ate part of it.I might give Purple Pig three stars based on this visit - and most notably because of the trend toward heavy lemon in all its dishes - but our visits in the past were four-star visits.  Those meals included other dishes such as the bone marrow, the milk-braised pork shoulder, pannacotta, etc. - and they rated four stars.  So I'm sticking with that rating.Just please ease up on the citrus!!!!"
"I'll go ahead and say a warning first, because I was very disappointed by Purple Pig. But all my friends say it was one of the best restaurants in chicago, so I would love to go again one day and see if my experience can be improved.Menu:Roasted Bone Marrow with HerbsMussels with Pancetta, Creme Fraiche & MarjoramMilk Braised Pork ShoulderWagyu Sirloin TipBone Marrow:First of all, I was very excited for the bone marrow because I've heard it was the gem of the restaurant, and I've never tried it before. I was disappointed because I simply did not LIKE the taste of bone marrow. I'm not saying that Purple Pig's bone marrow tasted bad, I'm saying that I realized that I personally do not prefer the slimy texture of bone marrow...Okay, that's that. The bread though, was very very very buttery, which I liked in the beginning, but towards the end, my mouth was getting overwhelmed with slimy butter.Mussels:Omg. Best mussels I've ever had in Chicago so far. The creaminess of the broth was perfect and the mussels were perfectly cooked and all opened for easy eating. This, was the highlight of my night.Wagyu sirloin Tip:Four slices of sirloin, four slices of heaven. It was really tender and amazing, and for people who like their steaks medium rare, the sirloin was cooked perfectly, and the seasoning was not overpowering which complimented the beef.Pork Shoulder:Wayyyy too salty. I literally could not eat it without some bread because the pork was salty, and the sauce was also salty. I remember we couldn't even finish it because it was so salty...Atmosphere - I went here in November so it was very cold, and we didn't reserve a table so we were seated outside near the entrance - everytime someone entered, the cold breeze came straight to us, so we kept our coats on all night, but that's what you get when you don't reserve haha"
"Great atmosphere; young and middle aged patrons; high ceilings, with comfortable space; one clean, unisex washroom with long waits. The Italian sausage was a bit too salty, for my taste; albeit, I mind any salt. Bf enjoyed it, however. The meatballs slide was deliciously served as burgers. Bread and meat were tender and juicy. Favorite.The calamari dish was good, but I wouldn't recommend it. There were too many ingredients to distinguish any true, solid tastes. Drinks are standard;  service is great;  restaurant is clean."
"The purple Pig is really good. The reason it is so good is because everything you get there is unique and cant be replicated at another restaurant. The staff is also friendly and they rave about the food. Their passion for food shows in their enthusiasm. Its hard to get  a plate of bad food. We were a group of 4 adults and we shared the following items:Appetizers1. Pork Fried Almonds (4/5). The flavor was great but the texture of the almonds were too soft. 2. Petit Basque Cheese with Membrillo (5/5). Tasty.  A play on flavors in your mouth. 3. Corn Bread (5/5). Once again the play on flavors makes you licking your chops for more. Entrees1. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (5/5). Just get it. Its meat butter. Its amazing.2. Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs (5/5). its a play on a BLT but the tripe is meaty and full of bacon flavor. 3. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (4/5). It was good but i like my pork shoulder smoked and falling apart. This did not have that flavor profile. . Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive, & Agrodolce (5/5). My favorite dish. Its cooked in pork fat so it tastes like pork but its a turkey leg. Every bite is a indulgent and never a dry piece of meat. I would get this every time i went.  Dessert1. Panino con Nutella (4/5) - Great but nothing memorable. People rave about anything with nutella but from what i have learned is that it is best to be eaten in all of its glory with just the jar and a spoon. No ""nutella"" dessert comes close to matching its full glory of it being eaten alone. 2. Loukoumades  (4/5) - Not the best fried dough balls i have had but they were still darn good. I like them to be crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These were not the crispiness they needed to be to make them a 5. Overall, I would eat here again and again. I would also recommend this establishment visiting Chicago. We paid $100 without tax and tip for all that food, which was a great deal. We left stuffed because all of the food is very heavy. Come with an empty stomach."
"The food was amazing, the best I had in the city and the bus boys were incredibly nice!!! However, some of the servers were extremely rude. Especially ours: a blond girl named ""Lauren"". Avoid her at all costs. We were seated near a white couple and she blatantly treated us and the middle Eastern couple on the other side of us differently. Never wanted to come take our orders or give recommendations. However, she was so excited to speak to these two white people. With all that said, the wait staff and other workers were really really nice!!!! They were the ones who ultimately pushed us to tip anything at all."
"?? So many good reviews, and I'm left pretty baffled...sometimes yelpers do that to me.... I am def not a tourist, but I did get teased about this pick from my fellow Chicagoan diner.  Service: We went at lunch and I arrived first.  Beautiful day but the hostess ushered me over to an inside seat&forgot to offer the patio...  Then the waiter told me he would not do two separate checks (I needed my own tab to submit for a per diem business lunch) because they were small plates.  HUH?  So... put the ones I tell you on my bill. Didn't happen.  Then my friend ordered wine which we asked him to put on a separate tab (no boozin on the job for me).  Didn't happen. Scratching my head because I still tipped 20%.Food.  Overpriced average, if not mediocre attempt at ""unique american fare"".  The pig and kale wasn't bad, but oh boy, the panini was not edible really... Worst sandwich I have ever had.  Wow, that is a nasty label.... Fried olives, panko breaded olives, why are people impressed with this? The only reason I'm giving 2 stars not 1 is the bone marrow is a novel, fairly tasty idea.  Would not return."
Everything = YUMMMM! And great atmosphere!! Have you ever had bone marrow? No??? Get to The Purple Pig right now!
"Lunch Time on a Beautiful Monday afternoon with no wait time.  I was seated promptly within minutes of asking for a table for 2. Service was exceptional.  Food portions were perfect since most of the plates I ordered were on the richer side.  I ordered the Milk Braised shoulder, crispy pig's ears and the simple kale caesar salad.  Please note if you don't like your salad to be drenched in dressing, tell them to put it on the side.Overall, I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig for lunch."
"Five star food, and if you're a visitor to Chicago, consider this is six-star place.The downside to this place is only that it doesn't have a formal dining room, so you're basically looking at being jammed at communal tables with narrow aisles, but if you're okay with this - and you like Cheese, Swine, and Wine - then This Is Your Place. The food is excellent: everything we had was brilliant. For a couple, I'd suggest three appetizers and a main, because that gives you a lot of tastes. Very delicious tastes. OK, 2nd downside - this is not a beer-lover's paradise. A great wine list, though, and the prices are fair. We really enjoyed ourselves, and you will too!"
"1) They have merried three things in life that should have always been together in the first place: wine, swine, and cheese. 2) I have never in my life received such phenomenal service. It cannot be rivaled. And PS, I waited tables for 7 years, so I know what's up. 3) We tried everything from cheese, to scallops, to smear, to octopus.  Everything. Amazing. 4) Go here."
I get it. You don't make money from a family with a little kid. But don't call yoursekf family friendly. When is a high chair a special need aeating? Did not bother waiting hour and a half.
"Great food and selection of different wines. Definitely get the pork shoulder, it is tender and full of flavor. Also, we listened to the reviews and ordered the charred cauliflower and fried pigs ears as appetizers.  Both were yummy but I could see where yelpers mentioned they were salty. I'm guessing the higher salt content is due to sort of a pickle type of relish in both salads. Our group thought it was fine but I could see it getting a little salty. Definitely would go back there to try more of the food! We went after the lunch rush and got a seat at the high top tables where you are sitting next to other people. It is a little cramped in there and loud but it was great for us."
"When a review is long overdue, it just is and for that I must apologize to the Pig.We went here for my friend's post-birthday dinner last July and the weather couldn't have been more perfect for outdoor balcony seating. It was a late dinner. We made it here after 11pm on a summer Tuesday. The place was still very busy but luckily it was late enough so our party of seven got seated in 15 minutes. I probably waited as long to get into the restroom.We had the pork neck gravy with ricotta, rich and delightfully flavorful. The roasted, herbed bone marrow was surprisingly conventional yet very well-executed. The meatballs were moist and tender. My mental food notes become hazy at this point...there was a dish with chorizo...I definitely sampled the pork liver pate...aargh... maybe it's because it's been so long...maybe I was caught up in a fat-induced high...Our other friend, a vegetarian a month or so prior to this night was in full relapse. She busily reflected on the gross deliciousness of it all.Dessert came in the form of a Sicilian Iris, an unapologetically friendly fried dough-ball filled with sweet ricotta and chocolate chips. My after dinner shots of grappa and espresso were a nominal shock to my friend's taste buds, her tightly pinched eyebrows said it all. She would rapidly recover with a quick swig of beer.A great meal at the Pig is made even better in the company of fantastic people. You should have been there with us, next time for sure."
"The only reason I'm not giving 5 starts is because of the wait and the crowd.  But considering the small space and how good the food AND service is, it's worth it.  I was there by myself and sat at a communal table, which wasn't nearly as weird as you'd think it would be.  It was a challenge to decide on what to get (so many yummy things) but ask your waiter / waitress - they're very helpful.I wish I was there with more folks, so we could share, try more and not let anything go to waste.  I got the bone marrow smear (highly recommend if you love marrow), the pig brain and pea antipasti, and the milk braised pork shoulder.  All awesome.  I know there's a ton a great restaurants in Chicago, but I would come back here again.  Just be prepared to wait.... a long time..."
"Visiting Chicago and a friend took me for lunch. We were seated immediately and knew to expect tapas menu and seating. Wine list was a bit extensive and a tad confusing but server was helpful and his recommendations were perfect. Loved all three plates that we ordered: fried manchego, marinated olives and bone marrow. My only complaint is that the bone marrow came in a dinosaur bone instead of the smaller rounder version to which I'm accustomed.  So much marrow kind of put me off. Probably just a personal thing on my part. Service was great and lunch ambience was lively for a snowy Thursday. Hope to go back to try more items."
"I will preface this review with maybe my hopes were too high.  A lot of my friends like this place so maybe I just made some bad choices on the menu.  First off, if you don't take reservations, I'm not going to give you five stars.  I get it, you're a hot new restaurant and you're super packed.  You don't need to take reservations.  But some of us don't like to wait hours to eat.  I think it is just inconsiderate of your customers' time.So although we had to wait to eat, they did serve drinks outside.  Our waiter was just awful.  He could have cared less about our order.  It took forever for him to take our drink order and then longer to bring it back.  I'd say he brought it to us about 15 minutes before we were going to be seated.Our waiter inside had a personality and seemed like a good guy.  But the wine he recommended was awful.  We were in the mood for a buttery Chardonnay.  I noticed that there were no American wines on the menu.  When I asked the waiter if they had anything, he immediately recommended something from Italy.  It was not buttery and not even that good.  When I asked him about it he explained that wine not from California won't be buttery.  Yeah, thanks, that's what I thought.  That's pretty much what I told you when I saw no American wine on the menu.  That's why when I asked about it you should have said we don't have anything like that and I would have ordered something else.  Additionally, this wine took about thirty minutes to get to us.  We were halfway through our dinner by the time the bottle got to us.As for the food, I didn't think it was that great.  It was good, but definitely not worth the wait or the service.  For small plates, I'd go to Coppervine or to Davante Enoteca instead.  I thought they both had better food and service.I might be willing to give this place another chance. But with so many good restaurants in the city, I don't know if we'll be back."
"I just don't get it.  Did I read too many Yelp reviews and over hype this place in my head?  Was it the 1.5 hour wait that made me over inflate my expectations?  I have no idea why, but I was left disappointed.The ambiance and service are what you'd expect.  I hate the layout of the place, but rent is expensive and they need to cram as many people in as they can.The food is okay.  Some of it was cold.  Some not salty enough.  Other things too salty.  And no matter what you read, do not get the crispy pig ears.  The big ears are fried beyond the point of recognition.  It could have been fried paper for all I know.  The milk braised pork and razor clams are delicious though."
"My friend and I were visiting Chicago for the National Restaurant Show a couple of days ago and decided to try our luck getting a table at The Purple Pig. Being the highest recommended and most reviewed restaurant on Yelp in downtown, we were expecting a long wait. Surprisingly, we showed up for a 12:30 lunch seating and were brought to a table inside right away. Only a few minutes into our experience, a waiter came over with a plate of house made veal Mortadella sausage with black kale, fresh chickpeas & preserved cherry tomatoes. We were the lucky winners of a ""mistake dish""! What a great start to the meal. I had done my research and came up with a list of things to try. We began with the calamari with fregula, radishes, cucumbers, cous cous, & pistachios. Being the least commonly appreciated flavor, we were startled by the bitterness of this dish, but also enjoyed its irregularity. Then came one of my favorites, the salt-roasted beets, whipped goat cheese, & pistachio vinaigrette. Yum yum yum. Onto the main part of our meal. We had the pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, & fried egg. Although it was not as good as the reviews I read made it out to be, I can now officially saw I have eaten pig's ear and I'd say that's pretty cool. Next was the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Oh. my. god. We almost ordered another - IT WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! And finally, for dessert, even though we could barely fit it, we split the peanut butter semi-freddo with goat milk caramel corn and ginger-white chocolate mousse. Usually I am not a huge fan of peanut butter, but the best dessert I have ever had was a semi-freddo and they rarely appear on dessert menus, so it was a ""must try"". My friend loved it and the flavors were distinct, not too sweet, and a great combination of milky, sticky, crunchy, and soft. We left absolutely stuffed and still had money in our pockets. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant over the summer. I am already craving pork..."
"So I have a hook up here, or I'd neverrrr deal with the insanity of trying to get in. Don't hate the player. I can literally call the day of and request a reservation for 12 of us, and it makes me cry tears of joy. This group doesn't f around, they are ON POINT with their delivery and customer service. I've been quite a few times and had tons.Octopus- fantasticBroccoli with anchovy vinaigrette- anything with anchovies, I'm down.Charred cauliflower- saltyOlive oil poached tuna- yumPigs ear- I don't LOVE it as much as most, but it's good.Sardines- I'd make out with this dishProsciutto Di San Daniele- It's my namesake dish, of course it's awesomeJamon Serrano- if you don't like this, you are not allowed to talk to meMilk Braised Pork Shoulder- I'd go to 3rd base with this dishCobia- bombDon't shoot the messenger, but the desserts would barely get to 1st base with me. I want chocolate, donuts, etc. Of course the Glazed party at the end excites me, but their other desserts aren't my style."
"A Million Stars!....  What an amazing culinary experience.   I LOVED sitting where all the action happens.  The Executive Chef runs an amazing team with a OMG factor in every dish.The service was the BEST EVER too!  Thank You Colleen!!  I loved your passion for the food and help in guiding me through wine and food selections.  I was in the mood for the Burratta followed by the Tuna selection all served with the best wine that you steered me towards.   P&R?....   And, the Bus Staff and Management were so sweet and friendly.....Thank you all for your midwest charm and friendliness --   I am flying back soon and I am excited for more!!!!!!!!!!"
I'm officially obsessed with this place. All of the below items will transcend you into heaven:- corn pesto and tomatoes- brisket panini - calamari- fried deviled egg- Albariño wineThe service and ambiance/outdoor seating was fantastic. My onllllllly complaint would be that I thought it was weird to sit at the big table with other people. Just a bit awkward and not my thing.
"The food at The Purple Pig was delicious. The wine list is amazing, too. The service was decent but also not the best I've ever had. It's a small place and they don't take reservations. They do take your phone number along with your name when they put you on the wait list and call you when you're table is ready. That way you can go explore Michigan Ave, which is a nice way to spend your time waiting for a table. I definitely plan on going back once in awhile!"
"Cheese, swine, and wine!This place seems to always be busy so making reservations would probably be a good idea.  If you don't make a reservation, most wait seems to be approximately 30-45mins for a party of 2-4 and about 1-1.5 hrs for a party of 5+. I tried purple pig on my first night in Chicago and it definitely set the tone right.  I got the bone marrow, pig ears, and razor clams. The pig ears were very crunchy and came with egg and kale.  Very good and tastes like a crispy wonton chips. The bone marrow is very popular and huge. The razor clams were good also and very chewy with a squid-like texture. For dessert, I got the lemon panna cotta. It's a great choice to change up your taste palette with a zest. Since it was so good, I made a second visit on my last day of my trip. I tried the turkey legs that my friends suggested and it was the best turkey leg I've ever eaten. I'm usually not a big fan if turkey leg because it gets dry and salty after awhile, but this one was soft and tender throughout. I also ordered the lamb, but it was okay compare to their other items. For dessert, I got the cinnamon ice cream with pecan. Very delicious and worth the try. As other reviews mentioned, this is sort of a tourist trap, but their menu does not disappoint, therefore it is popular among both tourists and locals."
Delicious and very polite staff. Really liked this place! Would definitely recommend!
"This place is a little overrated.  It is pretty hipster and obviously a place where it's cool to be seen or be ... but the food is nothing spectacular.  Ordered the bone marrow and a few other items that the waiter recommended that I no longer remember.  Not worth the calories or cost, in my opinion."
"Amazing cocktails, extensive wine list, fast service, eclectic and unique selection of tapas! This restaurant is definitely worth the 30 minute wait (even on a Tuesday night...). Not very roomy so be prepared to sit close to your neighbors, but as is expected in a european/mediterranean themed spot. The morcilla was delicious! Quail egg, avocado, sword fish antipasto was also amazing! Every dish is very well thought out and surprisingly tasty. Definitely worth paying extra for the cocktails to compliment the quirky meal selection."
"I am not going back to this place.  Yes, it's hip.  Yes, the food is well-made.  Yes, they have a decent outside-seating option. But I have rarely received more insulting service. I went there on a Tuesday afternoon around 4:00 p.m. with a friend -- we were meeting two others after they got off work.  We were seated at the end of a communal table, and promptly ordered a bottle of wine.  The waitress asked if we wanted to order food, and we said we'd like to wait for our two friends.  Shortly thereafter, the manager came out and said ""You know.  You can't just sit here.  You are going to need to order some food.""a) It was a Tuesday and not yet crowdedb) We had already spent $60 or so on our bottle of wine so were not ""just sitting there.""c) The fact our waitress ""tattled"" on us to her manager was just absurd Beyond that, the food I was forced to order was fine (though the menu wasn't terribly veggie-friendly; I heard it has gotten better).  But there are too many wonderful places in Chicago to go without returning to a spot where I felt mistreated."
"Been a while, but I remember the food being really good.  A little too salty, but great tuff."
"Waited over 1.5 years after arriving in Chicago to visit Purple Pig, and I'm glad I got to try it before I leave Chicago.Every dish was delicious and we had about 6 dishes between 2 people. Everything has a Mediterranean flair, which is a flavor I love, so I was very happy."
"Dining here was truly a heavenly experience. The only things not so heavenly can be the wait times and the sharing of tables with other patrons, but my girlfriend and I had none of these problems last Friday night. Our wait was a mere half hour after checking in for a table at around 5:50... crazy. When we were called and brought to our table, we heard the host tell another party they would have to wait 2 hrs and 15 mins for a table. I was shocked at how many people could put their name down in half an hour's time. We sat down and were greeted excellent service. The waitress let us know exactly how ordering at the purple pig should be done, and cleared any confusion with the menu. She even let us know that my girlfriend and I were ordering TOO much food and we were glad we took the advice because by the end we were stuffed. Now on to the food:Octopus with green bean and potato: It was the first dish to come out and was a phenomenal appetizer for us. The octopus was tender and the outside was well done enough so that it had a slightly crisp texture. I bit in and noticed how easy it was to break down the meat while chewing. The dish came drizzled with olive oil and what I believe was pesto. Satisfaction.Bone Marrow: Everyone seems to order it here, and while very unique in its presentation, it was my least favorite dish of the night. It is served with 3 large bones and 5 slices of grilled bread. There's definitely way more marrow than bread so I tried to slather as much of the gelatinous spread on as possible. When I took my first bite, what came to mind was savory, hot blubber. It was pretty tasty when accompanied with herbs and salt, but in terms of flavor, it was the least unique.Pork shoulder in mashed potatoes: When my girlfriend used her spoon to take a slice of the pork, it cut through like a knife. The whole dish was amazing with the pork being very tender and the mashed potatoes complementing the pork.Turkey Leg: True star of the meal. I really wish my thanksgiving turkey tasted like this- the meat was so tender and the sauce it was cooked with was delicious. It tasted sweet and had a subtle vinegary flavor as well. Not only was it tasty, the turkey leg is HUGE making it the most filling and best value of the night. We ended the night with peanut butter semifreddo which had a ton of flavors that included ginger white chocolate and caramel. We also had the Sicilian Iris which was an amazing hot explosion of fried dough with chocolate and ricotta.Every time a plate was finished, we were given new silverware and dishes. Fantastic meal!"
"Best energy, service, wine list, play list, people watching. My husband and I had a blast sitting at the bar here last Saturday night enjoying and obscure bottle of wine from Croatia and a rich and flavorful cheese plate that the bartender picked out for us to go with our wine. I will definitely be coming back here for a full out meal as the menu was extremely enticing. The staff was very knowledgeable about wine and food and we had the best service here hands down just sitting at the bar than we have had in any Chicago restaurant. My husband and I love wine and The Purple Pig is known for theirWine selection. The wine list did NOT disappoint. They had wines from Lebanon,Greece and Croatia as well as the typical wine regions(Portugal, Spain, France and Italy and of course California).  If you come on a weekend you will have to wait fora table or a spot at the bar, but it is well worth it!"
If you are looking for a different tapas bar in the city after enjoying sight seeing and Michigan ave this is it! The wine list is amazing and the octopus is delicious! Get there early to put your name in and grab a drink at the bar!
"This place is awesome. Esxquisite flavors. We tried the bone marrow, fried Brussel sprouts and the pork ears with kale. All very stellar and can't go wrong. A def must try visiting Chicago."
Awesome staff!! We walked in and there was a long wait for tables so we grabbed bar seats (why don't people grab bar seats more often?!). Make sure you try the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta. It's the chef's grandma's recipe from Italian and seriously amazing!
"I never write reviews on Yelp but I was saving my first one for something special so my first review goes to Purple Pig :)My bf and I came here during a weekend trip to Chitown (last September). To this day, I still dream about that roasted BONE MARROW!!! *drools* So rich in flavor, melts in your mouth, and simply amazing! We also had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Razor Clams, and for dessert- Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche... All of which were equally delicious. The fat girl in me wishes Chicago wasn't so far away!"
"Waiter was point picking 3 delicious cheeses to go with our soppresata, Greek cornbread, and drinks. Cool vibe, staple of Chicago and I found out why."
"Great food.  Great location. Great Atmosphere.  *** July 16th dinner between 730 - 830pm sitting at the bar was the worst treatment I've ever received by a bar tender at any establishment in Chicago.***As usual the place was busy, but not crazy busy like some of the other nights I've been there.  I strolled up to the bar to order a drink for my girlfriend and I as the wait for the table as usual is roughly 2 hours.  So as most Purple Pig patron we usually order a drink and wait for a spot to open up at the bar to grab a seat and eat.  As I approached the bar the Bar Tender (the rudest, raciest, egotistic sh## Head) abruptly tells me that i need to order my drink from one of the other servers.  I don't know if the way I looked or something about me ticked this guy off as he was serving other patron who were standing beside me with all the libations that they desired.  I noticed that all of them were white and I was not.  I'm a pretty easy going guy and my girl friend is white and within a couple of minutes my girlfriend found a seat at the bar and nudged me over as the folks right next to her were about to leave and I was going to grab one of their seats.  We had still not ordered our drinks.  My girlfriend called the bar tender over and I asked if he could recommend a Pilsner.  Instead of getting a recommendation from him he rudely tells me to look at page 9 of their drink menu that he placed in front of me and abruptly walks away.  The patrons next to me and my girlfriend are in total shock to the bar tenders aggressive demeanor and tone of voice.  If I wanted to read the menu I would have done so and if he did not want to recommend a drink or beer, he could have politely said so  rather than giving me ""I hate serving you"" look and tone.  By this time I was starting to feel tense.  And I'm a pretty chilled guy.  We placed the order from our drinks and looked over the food menu and were ready to place the order for our food so we called Mr. Vigorous over to take our order.  He looked at my girlfriend and look at me and said ""he's gonna eat to"".  ""How"".  My girlfriend says ""he'll stand""  I was fuming by now.  Because this was getting to be very personal.  His demeanor, tone of voice and his questioning about my ability to eat standing up or sitting down was totally unwarranted and uncalled for.  The food was is and has always been good at the Purple Pig but I felt that the tone and position of the bar tender last night was based on the color of my skin and nothing else.  Its a shame the the ""Purple Pig"" has to hire ""Racist Pigs"" to serve.  Its an absolute shame."
"MAKE A RESERVATION! Or you'll be waiting at least 30 minutes!This place is so good we had to come back again before leaving Chicago.Fine dining with a casual vibe!The prices are fair and what I really enjoyed is all plates are shareable and come in good portions.We tried the fried pig ears with an egg, definitely good to try, kind of difficult to actually taste the pigs eat with the breading around it overwhelming the taste, but it was still good.Also tried the razor clams, really liked the lemony flavor, it was a squid like texture, I would skip this, kinda pricey for a few clams $12Tried the roasted bone marrow and it was delicious! Comes with bread and you spread the meat on the bread.Tried the turkey leg as well and it was huge!! The turkey leg was very juicy and flavorful, not dry surprisingly!We also tried the Lamb meat, that was probably our least favorite, I would skip it! They used a sour sauce on the lamb that kinds of kill the taste.For dessert get the cinnamon soft serve ice cream with pecans! Delicious!Servers are great and very attentive! Too attentive I should say, they refilled our waters every 15 minutes, even after only taking a sip lol.Nice and cozy place, can get a little cramp and the bathroom lines can get long, but I really enjoy the casual vibe in there.Each plates cost between $5-20, great price for great tasting food!"
"Not for real foodies. Beware! The shredded breaded pigs ears were so over-fried and salty they tasted like nothing. Bone marrow was served with bread soaked in so much oil it completely masked the flavor. Chicken wing was nothing special.  Octopus was better, but by that point we were feeling ill from all the oil.To add insult to injury, we waited almost 20 minutes from sitting down for someone to even take our drink order, which is just so very wrong after we had to wait 45 minutes for the table.Extremely overrated."
"OK, I know there is already thousands of reviews but it deserves another constructive one!My server Ms. Kamilah knows the menu and I can tell she really believes in the food.  The rest of the wait staff are so on it too which made this very, very busy eatery felt very inviting and comforting, considering I ate by myself at the long communal table.  I liked and enjoyed everything recommended by Kamilah but the other items I ordered on my own didn't disappoint either.The only thing I have to single out is the very popular pig ears- I think they are a tad over fried.  The crunchy cartilage and the chewy skin of the pig ears all got deduced down to crispness.  Not a bad combination with the crispy kale, peppers, and fried egg but it should have more texture than just crispiness...  Just saying, still good...  I can't wait to go back for more!"
"This place is expensive, move than I thought it could be so just be prepared to pay for your meal.The food is different which was a lot of fun for a girls night out and absolutely delicious! The atmosphere was incredible, young, vibrant and fun. However, the seating is very strange so be prepared to sit with random strangers at the larger tables. When you first check in be sure to request a separate table. I think we will be back but for a special occasion."
"Next time, don't charge me for a dessert but than give my neighbor a free dessert for her birthday when we are both celebrating our birthdays here. So rude and incredibly insulting to me!!!!"
"This place is pig heaven! I've gone here twice now on two different work trips, and the second time was just as good as I remembered the first time! The bone marrow is fatty deliciousness and the pork belly was to die for. This last time we went I swear we ordered half the menu and all of it was amazing. The other plus is that the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the wine, and work with you to find the perfect match for your pallet and food pairing. Next time I'm in town I will definitely be back!"
"I meant to try this place for years but was disappointed.  I had the marinated olives, pigs ear, bone marrow, sweetbreads, and something else I can't remember, plus the Sicilian iris for dessert.  Portions were tiny and bill was 130 for 2 and I left hungry and not quite remembering the meal.  The bone marrow was wonderful but I've never had bad bone marrow anywhere.  Maybe the expectations were too high having heard so much and always missing the chance to try this place out, but I wouldn't spend my money here again."
Best  food on Michigan Ave
"Easily my favorite restaurant in the city! And I'm a vegetarian!!! Yes, most of the time you'll have to wait for a table, but what do you expect with for like this?! Pleasantly, today we were able to walk right in for lunch and snag a table. The atmosphere is a little cramped, but this isn't a huge issue. The staff is super friendly, and the packed-in-like-sardines customers are patient. After all, how grumpy can you possibly be when you're eating this well? Just mentally prepare to not have a ton of room. The wine selection is very respectable, and I've found that both bar and wait staff have a good knowledge of what they're workin' with.Next, the food. Ohhhh, the food. The Purple Pig's beet salad is the first I ever tried, and I've not found a better one, despite many efforts.  I always come back to their beet salad, with delectable whipped ghost cheese and crunchy pistachios.  Today we ordered the eggplant  with goat cheese smear (a great recco by our server). It was hearty and delicious. The brusselsprout salad also had a really great variety of sweet, savory and salty. We also had a cheese board. There is literally a cheese glossary, so you can make educated selections from their plentiful list of cheesy goodness. Genius!!! And the fried deviled egg is the stuff dreams are made of. Is deep fried ever bad?!?I could go on for days... The Purple Pig has my heart. I bring anyone visiting from out of town there, and the place never fails to impress."
"Going on great reviews and proximity to our hotel, we gave this place a go. DEFINITELY the diversity of tastes and textures makes it worth the experience; however, not much of a family place. My boys were hungry and left still hungry. We would have had to spend a fortune to feed hungry teenage boys - small plates, not the way to go for our crew. For the record, the fried brussel sprouts were SO GOOD."
"Not wheelchair accessible & not willing to offer any assistance. It's rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate, & in violation of ADA regulations to tell someone ""you have to figure your own way up."""
"I'm still not really sure how to rate the purple pig. Overall, it's a ok restaurant.Food itself- I give 4 stars, there are many unique menus and portion is small, so you can enjoy sharing many plates with others. However, service wasn't great. We, a party of three, got there at around 6pm on Monday, thinking that it's early so we don't need to wait for long. The wait was around 30-40 mins, ok that's fine. 30 mins isn't so bad considering this is a very popular restaurant. Names were called and we were waiting and waiting.. Other groups who came later than us got called before us. I started to think they forgot about us, and asked them, they told me that ""they're smaller group, you're next"" with very rude attitude. Other groups were also a party of three, but i didn't bother saying anything further. I wasn't happy how they handled this.I was hoping it would be fun experience to have a meal here while in Chicago, but the experience wasn't so pleasure for us. Maybe my expectation was too high after seeing many great reviews on this restaurant. Maybe there aren't many restaurants like the purple pig in Chicago, so it got popular. But I have been to many places like the purple pig in other areas and they're much better than this."
"After being told it'll be a 2.5 hr wait, we put our name down and ate a meal some where else and then came back for to try some of the appetizers everyone had being raving about.   So we got the crispy pig ears, but found it much too salty to be properly enjoyed.  And this is coming from someone who likes a decent amount of salt on things.  The Beets and Charred cauliflower were good, not to crispy with just the right amount of salt and seasoning to be enjoyed. Over, the service is friendly, but absolutely NOT worth the 2.5 hr wait on a Friday night.  At least they take your number down and call you instead of you physically having to wait there for hours."
"Very interesting place with interesting food! Community style tables, so we got to chat with the people next to us & ask with they had & recommend what we had! Place was jammed so there can be a bit of a wait but well worth it. We tried the beets with goat cheese - the pistachios making a very interesting & tasty addition, the peas with bacon & spearmint we great also. Took a chance & tried the pigs ear with kale & a fried egg! Really filling & great textures & to finish 3 types of cheese from their expansive board, really good! Would definitely go back & would love to rage people for the experience!"
"This place is jumping, and there are no reservations, so prepare to be less-than-impressed by the time to get seated.... and when you do get seats, understand that there is a pretty good chance that you'll be sharing a table with strangers. We put our name in at 8:00 and were told there'd be about a two-hour wait. After killing nearly two hours across the street having drinks and waiting for the text they promised but which never came, we came back and walked in to see several tables available and when we asked the hostess, she acted clueless but guilty, and seated us right away.That said...Once we were seated, everything was pretty impressive. The food is amazing. So many interesting small-plate options. My date and I shared from everything and ordered more than enough to fill us both up, along with wine to wash it all down, and managed to get out for roughly $100. I was expecting it to be a lot more.Lot's of interesting things to try -- more than a person can get in one sitting -- so I can't wait to go back and sample some more of the unusual offerings, such as neck, tripe, marrow, and sweetbreads."
Finally I have made it to Purple pig. It was very nice experience! Despite 1 hour long wait and the place is so loud it is hardly possible to enjoy the conversation. Small meals to share and excellent choice of wines made it a nice night!
"A good friend of mine recommended I check out The Purple Pig ages ago.It's taking me a while to get back to Chicago, but as soon as I knew I was going, I immediately ran here to get me some pig.The vibe here is great. It's loud and fun - look around and you'll see smiles everywhere.There's a buzz in the room and you can really tell that everyone is having a great time.We had to wait about an hour which wasn't a shock for a Friday night.Tip - go early OR go expecting a wait. Put your name and number down, then go shopping for a bit down the road.Ok. The food. It's a tapas menu, so everything is meant to be shared. We had 4 items and were very full.The Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette was fantastic. We polished them off in minutes.The Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta ""smear"" was probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth....and that's saying a lot   :-OThe Burrata Pugliese, Grilled Kohlrabi, Apples, Mustard Greens, Crispy Speck & Beer Agrodolce was good...not my favourite but good.Squid stuffed with breadcrumbs and pancetta was deeeelicious.Check out #thepurplepig - you'll be glad you did.I can't wait for my next trip back to Chicago - imma get me some more smear"
Never disappointed here.  A long wait most times but orders come out quickly and the food is consistently great.Honestly reviewing the place just so I remember to return in the future.I've never enjoyed pork so much. Good job purple pig
Worse restaurant experience ever!
Excellent turkey leg. Octopus was a bit too salty. Bone marrow would improve with more seasoning. Sit at the bar to avoid the wait.
"Pretentious. Betrays a huge ignorance: crazy combinations of food and they serve only scraps and offal.Be prepared for  ears, feet and heart of pig. instead of chicken wings you'll have paws... who has a real food culture, is far from this place.Last thing: the place smells bad."
"I don't think I can say much that hasn't been said by about everyone. But I guess I can repeat things:+ Calling when your table is ready is like magic. There's a Starbucks and the Argo Cafe a block down and chairs everywhere, so you have no problems with things to do in the meanwhile. Yes, the food is worth the wait.+ Because the wait was SO long and because we had gotten a late start, we were a little crunched for time. I asked the server if we could settle the check early so that we didn't have to wait until the end of the meal and possibly miss the train we needed to take. He couldn't settle it until all of our food fired, but when he could, he did it very quickly. Very accommodating.+ Our server was super friendly without being . . . y'know, overbearingly so. Big plus in my book. Friendly but having boundaries is my ideal service situation. (I did see him linger at a couple of other tables, so I'm guessing that he read my desire for boundaries and accommodated me--even better!)+ The food was good. We ordered some small plates, some charcuterie. The things we super-loved were the pork fried almonds (omg), the chorizo-stuffed green olives, the olive-oil poached tuna, the meatball slider.+ The prices weren't crazy at all. You could do a very reasonably-priced dinner here even on a budget... I mean, not a crazy-small budget, but a moderate budget with entertainment room, yeah.- I probably wouldn't do the charcuterie again. I'd rather order a small plate or two for the money spent, as I didn't find the charcuterie quality to be insanely above what I could put together for myself, but their cooked food was really stellar.- I don't love communal tables? So I wish they had told us or asked us when we checked in if we prefer to wait for one that wasn't, if that's an option (which probably would have resulted in us not eating there because of the time crunch . . . . which: if we had been stuck in the middle of a communal table, instead of at the corner where we thankfully ended up being, probably it *would* have been better for us not to eat there. I have an autism spectrum disorder so certain things overwhelm me easily). If you also get overwhelmed by community tables where you'll be sat next to strangers, do know that this could be a possibility. I'm not sure if the restaurant will accommodate a wait for a smaller table.Overall, fantastic experience at a lovely restaurant. I wish we lived in Chicago so we could go back often."
This is a great place with great food it is quite small and you might have to wait for an hour once you have put your name on the list. The food is amazing the menu changes quite often but it is all good. They do have gluten free options they will mark up the menu for you if you ask.
"Purple Pig gets a ton of hype in Chicago. I've been here multiple times and can say that it's great the first time, but no need to come back. Every time I did go back, though, the overall salt content definitely increased.Bone marrow smear is ok. Lots of oil that slides down the actual bone when you're scraping the marrow part off. If you want to really taste the bone marrow, don't eat it with the 4 pieces of bread it comes with. JLT pork jowl was great - the fatty meat is just the right amount of OMG yum. If you get a panini, it's definitely large enough to split with a friend and still enjoy a huge half portion of it. Turkey leg is delicious, humongous, and juicy.I really recommend going for a late lunch or super early dinner between 3-5pm so you can skip the wait times. There's also a lot more elbow room at that time and you actually feel like you can breathe.P.S. The Sicilian Iris dessert is heaven."
"Delicious. We were sent here by Yelp reviews and I hope you do the same.The fried cauliflower with bread crumbs was so good. Be sure to ask your server how big each dish is. We ordered a ton of food (probably too much, but still ate it all) without really realizing it.Go here."
"My friend an I visited The Purple Pig for lunch today and had a great experience. I ordered a scallop dish, a roasted bone marrow spread dish, and a wyagu steak dish. All of the dishes were excellent. But the best of all the the bone marrow dish. The marrow was roasted till it literally ""melts in your mouth"". The bread aside makes it easier to eat while the sale on top cuts the grease a bit. Truly phenomenal. Scallop dish was average. Wafting steak was great. The staff could've been more friendly but they were nice. Loved the ambience as well"
"This place doesn't take reservations so we came at 530pm to hopefully secure a spot around 7. They initially told us 2 hour wait, but we received a call at 630pm saying we had only 10 minutes or we would lose our reservation. Needless to say, our group of 6 that was scattered around Mag Mile managed to make it back in time.This place serves a lot of tapas so the best way to enjoy the meal is to do family style. We ordered 6 dishes in total.Bone marrow - very fatty and deliciousPork braised shoulder - loved it, a bit small but extremely tenderPig Ear's - never had anything quite like it, kind of crispyPork Tripe Ala Parmigiana - didn't like this one very much, just tasted like chiliChicken Thigh Kebabs - amazing, very similar to Japanese skewers Turkey Leg - best bang for the buck, marinated in sweet wineI loved 5/6 dishes we tried here. This place is worth the wait albeit a bit pricey for the amount of food."
"The 3000 positive reviews didn't lie.  Good wine and Belgian beer selection.  Solid, friendly service and this was sitting at the bar. The beets with goat cheese and pistachios were amazing. I never thought beets could taste so damn could. Bone marrow is always a transcendental experience and I was impressed with the portion of marrow they gave me. I ended with the pork shoulder which came with mashed potatoes. It was fresh and tender as hell and essentially melted in my mouth.Great service, awesome food, solid drinks menu. If you're in downtown Chicago, u must check out the Purple Pig."
"Pricey with small portions but expected given location. Creative selections with immense flavors. Ingredient quality is high. Milk fed pork shoulder,  meatball slider. Pork jowl, kale n romaine caesar with Quayle egg, greek cornbread, fried chorizo stuffed olives,  nutella panini all recommended. Problem here in my 3 visits is their staff sucks overall Given how busy they are, you would think they d be able to find better servers. My servers have been either been dry, slow, rude, or burnouts. Hostesses are worse.One uni sex bathroom for staff n customers."
"Great food. Had the bone marrow smear, crispy pig ears and kale, fried sardines, and razor clams.  Our favorite was the razor clams. Place gets packed and seating was kinda tight (some bar height communal tables which we sat in - including my the year old son - hence the rating). No kids menu but he was fine with what we had.  Definitely a place we'd return to when were back in Chicago"
Great place with great food and chill environment. Love to sit on the bar and watch the chefs preparing the food in the open kitchen. They're such a great team. Great service too.
"""IT'S NOT TAPAS!!!!! Tapas are SPANISH! We have SMALL Mediterranean PLATES!""When our server asked us if we ""understood the concept"" and we said, ""so, is it tapas?"" We got ass reaming of a lifetime as quoted above.Rough start, to say the least. Particularly when many of their ""small plates"" include goddamn chorizo, and Spain just happens to be on the Mediterranean, but eff it. On to the oink.This is some great food. Everything that we ordered was dynamite.Fried Brussels sprouts? Love 'em. Never heard of them before in my life, but damned if I didn't spend three hours the next day trying to make this sons of bitches at home. May I recommend the pork shoulder steak? Sweet mother of pork, this honey glazed one-pound wonder had me squealing for more. Also recommended is the cheese plate. Every one of the selections was superb.Our waiter's casual-to-the-point-of-being-an-argumentative-ass approach subsided eventually. We found all of the other staff to be wonderful and welcoming.Highly recommended. I also recommend that you not use the word ""tapas"" if our server is around."
"So, you know when you expect something mind blowing because it got rave reviews but you end up being disappointed, although you understand why people really liked it but it made you expect something out of this world?? This is not like that! Because it WAS out of this world! First time ever! We read there's always a long wait so we figure going Thursday instead of Friday would be smart. It was still packed. We sat at the very front of the tent outside and normally I wouldn't have liked it being distracted by all the hustle and bustle of people walking by but I was so hypnotized by the food I didn't mind it at all. The server was super helpful and friendly. We had: fried pork ear, pigeon, chorizo stuffed olives, pork shoulder, bone marrow and wine. We could've done without the pigeon, it was good but it wasnt in the top four items our server told us were most popular. The popular item we got the pigeon in place of was the turkey leg. We both wanted the turkey but we knew we wouldn't be able to finish it because they're pretty big. Darn it, next time! The chorizo olives were sooo good, especially with the wine. If you love olives then you will love this.Bone marrow. omg . To die for! The herbs and capers were a burst of crazy flavor that were so fresh and crisp on the buttery bone marrow. This puts bone marrow on a whole other level for me. I don't think I'll be able to eat bone marrow anywhere else and really enjoy it Fried pork ear, who the hell thought a pork ear could be so crazy yummy? It comes with an over easy/sunny side egg (I'm not sure because I'm not a big egg person, especially when it comes to runny yolk). Typically anything slightly runny of an egg I will not eat or give away, but I said eff it, I want the whole taste bud experience. The server told us to break the yolk and mix it into the pork n kale. I was ready to be grossed out by yolk but I'm so glad I ate it because it blew our mindssss! My bf and I looked at each other with a look of ""what the hell is in here?!"" -in an awesome way, of course. I cannot even begin to explain what I was tasting. It was a taste out of this world. This alone vouches for Chicago being one of the best food cities."
"Salty, fatty, and a little out of the ordinary.Head here early and grab your spot! They run out of certain items early and if you are visiting from out of town, you will be very disappointed. I loved their selection. They are all very creative and their servers will gladly go over what is on their menu and recommendations."
We ordered #pig liver pate !! Strongly recommend that!! So delicious .taste like goose liver . #sea scallop the sauce is good #pig ear good but I won't order that next time...I little bit oily #prosciutto san Daniele  a little bit salty but still good!! And we also ordered roasted bone marrow!! It was a huge plate!! I'm not enjoy that much..#lamb blade steak !!i love that one!! The service is good!!
"We finally went to the Purple Pig!  A ""foodie"" friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere fun.  I've been hearing so much about the Purple Pig lately so we decided to give it a try.  It was a VERY good decision.  The food was wonderful.  We ate family-style sharing everything.  We had the meat-platter (the meats were so buttery and soft), a cheese plate (sheep Gorgonzola and some kind of ridiculous swiss cheese with tiny salt crystals inside), the chorjzo stuffed olives, some kind of fancy cornbread, cauliflower, and (drumroll) the bone marrow!  It was like meat flavored butter on crispy toast.The reason I gave only 4 stars:  The wait was pretty long- an hour and a half give or take.  This is okay.  I expected this.  But when after an hour or so when I went to check for my name on the list, the host was kind of rude to me.  Then our server was  friendly but felt slow.  I wouldn't have really thought about it but the folks next to us (and I mean NEXT to us- You sit at giant 12 person tables with other people) got there after us and seemed to get service so much faster.  I will return.  The food was amazing and worth the wait.  The price was expected."
"I'm going to be one of those obnoxious people who rates a restaurant without having eaten there, but hear me out: I want everyone to know what they're getting into if they attempt to eat at The Purple Pig.We went early on a Tuesday night and found the place packed to the gills. They put my 6'4"" husband on the end of a very long table, which had him partially blocking one of the only foot traffic routes in the dining hall. The seats are of the bar-height variety; for a shawty like me, this is a nightmare (my legs fall asleep inside of three minutes). Did I mention that you're basically expected to eat with strangers, which some people might like but which we do not? Oh, and it was loud. Very, very loud.I looked across the table at a man who was NOT my husband and said, ""Yeah, no. We're out."" And we left before they even brought us our water."
"Amazing food. Been here twice. I have never had a bad dish here. Order the pork live pate. If you want to live life and not be a poon, get the page. Don't say, ""oh, I don't eat patè, it's gross."" ITS AMAZING! Get some scotch and cheese, some fried pigs ears, and some grilled cheese panini. You will be set for the night."
"So dinner then, at a place that's usually so crowded I've never had the patience to try.  But tonight, a seat at the chef's table, because.  Because their well-trained staff looked at me and said, ""He ain't here for the salad!""And I have to say, in the hour or so there, every plate that passed the station was a beautiful plate.  Dressed wonderfully, to the point I thought about just pointing at random, to see what they brought.  Frankly, I think you'd be fine.  TPP has an excellent reputation, and they have been well-reviewed since their inception five years ago.Oh my, their reputation is well-deserved.  Started with a roasted beet salad with whipped goat cheese, pistachios, and a delicious Greek olive oil.  Compared notes with Sam about roasted beet salads:  feta vs. goat cheese, inclusion of dill, etc.  Short version, mine is brighter, theirs is deeper.  Would happily eat either one.Second course, a milk-braised pork shoulder, about a 10-oz portion of Boston Butt, braised for hours in milk, highly seasoned, both with salt and herbs.  Napped with a mild gravy, and served in a hunk, in an iron skillet, on top of whipped potatoes.  Divine comfort food.  If they sold this by the pound, I'd smash a biscuit around it for breakfast, and squish cornbread around it for lunch, about three times a week.  When I needed variety, I'd hit it with some stone-ground mustard, and call it a day.  Great stuff!At this point, it's dessert, or another small plate.  I chose the cauliflower:  dressed with the Greek finishing oil, salt, pepper.  Griddled on the flat top till carmelized lightly, then tossed with cornichons.  Delicious, crunchy, maybe wanting a bit of heat, if your palate matches mine.  But a great simple dish, in keeping with their modus operandi.The troubling question - with so many great restaurants in Chicago, do I eat dinner here tomorrow as well?  Certainly deserving of a follow-up, but so many restaurants, so little time!!"
"The waiting time was 3 hours for  two on Friday night. They do not take reservations. Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (antipasto) is good. 4/5 The Bone Marrow is a little greasy to me.  2/5.  Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes is really delicious. 5/5. Must try!Baby Scallop (A La Plancha) awesome. 5/5"
"Visiting Chicago from CA, we knew that we had to make a trip to The Purple Pig after passing by it twice. Each and every time, the restaurant was simply packed. When it was our turn to test it out, the Purple Pig definitely did not disappoint. The service was great, we ended up only waiting 20 minutes for a table. They also call you to let you know when your table is ready, so we just went across the street to shop and time flew by.  Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. Big plus.We ordered the Pigs Ear, the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, and the ""jlt"" Pork Jowl. I loved the Mortadella smears! It was the perfect mix of creamy, porky goodness combined with a little bit of crunchiness from the pistachios and that tarty, acidic kick from the balsamic vinegar. I died. I was actually quite glad they ran out of the bone marrow smears because we got to try the mortadella instead. As for the rest of the meal, the ""jlt"" Pork Jowl was also quite good. Nothing too amazing for me though, but maybe that was just because I got tired of that same texture over and over again. I thought that there wasn't enough of that bitter frisee to break up the dish. The last thing we had there was the Pigs Ear. So crisp and crunchy! Like little bits of porky fries! Now that I'm back in CA, I really miss the Purple Pig. I guess it's time to go search for that mortadella smears recipe! Until next time!"
"Absolutely wonderful!The entire menu is flavor-full and complex. Each dish had such a unique taste.Went to The Purple Pig on Friday night with my wife at 5:30. Had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table. However, the hostess takes down your name and phone number. They will call you when your table is ready, meaning you can go anywhere is the city before your table is ready, fantastic idea. We decided to stay near the restaurant and sit on patio deck near the entrance. It was a beautiful night so it was no big deal sitting outside, however, I can see this being a problem during the more stormy days. They do have servers running around I this area to take drink orders, major plus for a small place like this.The Purple Pig is a small place. They seat maybe 70 people inside the actual restaurant. This includes about 12 seats at the bar. However, they have added an outdoor area under the purple tent. It effectively doubles the size of the restaurant. They fully sit every inch of that place. Their sitting is random and party style. They will sit a group of 4 at the same long table as a few couples. If you want to si t alone you will need request a table for two. I'll let the food pics and other reviews of the food speak for themselves. They are all correct and are what I used for my choices.The only thing I suggest to Yelp users that go are to ask not only the waiters, but also the busers to get their favorite dishes. Pick one from what they suggest. We did and don't regret it. They are true professionals."
"Really interesting dishes and nice wine selection, it's great for trying something new!"
"Only giving it a star for the ambiance!Had such high hopes for this restaurant when my girlfriend and I came here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. This place was packed with a 45 minute wait, but we finally got seated in the outdoor/heat lamp area.FOOD:-Pig Ears- this was recommended to us and basically it tasted like fried, salty salty chips with a poached egg on top; fail-Bone Marrow- EPIC FAIL. based on all the ""raving"" reviews of this dish, we ordered it and before we could get a scoop to smear it on the bread as we were told, half the grease felt onto the menu, leaving a grease stain the size of texas. it was so greasy and oily i could feel my arteries being blocked. do NOT order this if you care at all about your health.-Pork Shoulder- the best of the 3 but nothing to come back for; the mashed potatoes and tender meat give you the soul food experience, but that's not what i was expectingSERVICE:pretty slow but it was packed with wait. also, teh server recommended the pig ears which were an epic fail.not sure why this place got high reviews, but i'm giving it a thumbs down!-Hungry Hungry Pongy"
Very cute place. Not a good place to dine alone because you are limited to the amount of food you can order. Came here alone and ordered the fried pig ears and the pork secreto. The secreto was super juicy and well cooked. Definitely would recommend. The pig ears were ok. Couldn't really taste much of the pig ears but it might cater better to most people if it didn't taste like ears. The kale that came with it was good. The wine (rose) that they recommended to me was not good. I would come back to try more but can't really rate them more an average based on what I had.
"Good food, fun environment. I didn't rate it high because the two plates I ordered were good but not fantastic. I would definitely go again."
"A lovely venue which packs in as many people as it can to make sure we can all get a piece of the action.This doesn't make it feel like a more upmarket, but crowded McDonalds at 3am after a night out, rather it is pleasant to be surrounded by bubbling laughter and conversation plus the chairs are big and comfy barstools which help everything feel that bit more elevated.I had a glass of pinot gris, which was delightful and I could not fault it. We had goats cheese and roasted beets to begin with which were topped with pistachios, really simple but delicious. We then had squid stuffed with proscuitto and garnished with a pesto, oil and squid ink sauce. This was slightly overdone, but the portion was large enough to share and the rest of the flavours were great. All in all, a good experience and I will be back to try the octopus. This place is great for weary feet, tired of shopping the magnificent mile. The servers and bussers however, do not seem weary at all! Top efforts from them!"
"Overall, Purple Pig creates a great dining experience at a great price.  You get to try lots of small dishes, some great wines, under a bustling Chicago restaurant atmosphere.Bone Marrow Spread:  A+Generous portions of bone marrow and toasted bread.  Cooked perfectly.  Unseasoned so they give you a bit of sea salt, capers, and fresh capers so you can season to your liking.  Probably one of my favorite dishes all night.  Fried Pig Ears and Kale Chips with Over Easy Egg:  BGreat textures going on here with the kale and pork ears.  Egg was cooked to perfection but the pig ears were a bit overseasoned.  Really hard to finish it all because it was salty.Roasted Razor Clams:  A+Tossed in lemon butter, roasted to perfection.  Would definitely order again.  Very fresh and succulent (along with the juices in the shell).Pork Osso Bucco:  BPork was braised and falling off the bone.  Served over some perfect polenta with a great marinara sauce.  Again, the pork itself was overseasoned, but cooked perfectly!PLT:  APork belly, lettuce, tomato.  Definitely a fresh take on a BLT.  Served with only half a bun under a nice over easy egg.  One of the highlights of my night.  Simple yet delicious with every bite.  Textures worked really well.  Pork belly was cooked perfectly and oozed with juices and fat.Braised Ribs over Potatoes and Gravy:  BA very standard dish, which was overseasoned.  Very similar in style to the osso bucco.  Didn't feel the 'pop' of this dish.Aged Balsamic Vinegar over Ice Cream with Strawberries:  A+++My favorite dish of the night.  Best texture from the ice cream.  Acidity from the balsamic perfectly offset the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream.  Holy moly my mouth is watering just thinking of this dish again!While the service was great, some the dishes were just too salty for both our palates.  We really liked the extensive wine menu and the overall experience was positive.  Just needs to focus on consistency and tasting before sending dishes out the pass.PROTIP:  No reservations, but they will serve you wine while you wait."
"Heard lotsa hype about this spot and it generally delivers.  Very good food and great service tonight.As every other review has said, the place gets packed, so be patient.  Sitting on the patio is an experience. It's generally cold and breezy even with the heaters.   Sit inside during colder months.  Sitting outside is a cluster!Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans - (A) for sure would order againFried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes - (B) needed more seasoning or lemonEggplant Caponata with Goat CheesePork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda - (A-) tasty, but make sure the toasts aren't burntWill be back."
I have been waiting to go here for a long time and finally did it. The bone marrow is very delicious and thick. Out some rock salt on it and enjoy on the buttery bread. They also have a very good selection of wine by the glass and bottles. The music and ambiance is great for groups. They don't take reservations so have a plan to do something near the retardant. Overall I had a great time with me and some coworkers. I would highly recommend for a great place with a small group.
We stumbled upon this place after a long day of walking down Michigan Ave. Didn't really have many expectations but the outside was pretty and it wasn't crowded - we were sold. The bone marrow is quite odd when presented but remarkable. I have never had anything like this. The neck gravy smear is also a very good starter. I'm not sure if the squash with pumpkin seeds and kale is still available as it was no longer there when we returned a month later. This dish was fantastic and my favorite until I went back a second time and had the milk braised pork shoulder. It literally melted in my mouth. I cannot express how delicious this is. I even tolerated the beets with whipped goat cheese and I absolutely can't stand beets. This is a good sign that those who do not hate this food will probably think it's amazing. I'll still pass.All I can say is this has easily become my favorite spot of Chicago. The menu is huge and probably impossible to actually try everything! I have yet to touch any of the cheese selections which I'm sure are equally phenomenal.
Food was good.   Service was far too attentive.   Think 8 different folks waited on us--asking us what we wanted to order before we'd even gotten settled or trying to clear plates we were still eating or pouring water when they also put a bottle on the table (don't think that would have bothered me if they hadn't bumped my arm each and every time).  And if I wanted to order your recommendations I would have.   Don't be rude when I choose something different.    All in all it just felt like they wanted to turn the table and I couldn't enjoy my meal.  The entire experience was irritating and uncomfortable.
My wife and I went here late night. We got the mussles. Better than Seattle! I will visit every time I'm in town.
"We lucked out and walked in on a Friday night and someone had canceled their reservation so we got a table. Our server was super nice and took us through the menu and we ordered everything he recommended. Got the cheese & charcuterie plate, highlights were the wagyu, Parmesan, and the pickles that come with the meat!!! Also don't skip the crispy pigs ear and kale salad, so good especially the peppers on the bottom. A super loud busy atmosphere with the tables really close together- which is why I didn't rate 5."
"I loved the interesting plates the Purple Pig had to offer. First of all, any place that offers tapas gets bonus points in my book. My favorite plate that I shared was the giant turkey leg...and by share I mean, I ate the whole thing. My only reason for not giving this restaurant the full five stars was because of the seating arrangement. We had to sit outside on the patio which was a but drafty in November. All in all though, I would definitely go back!"
"This place is great! My husband and I went on a Friday night at around 5:15p. Didn't have to wait at all. We ended up sitting at the chef's bar, which is right in front of the kitchen. At first we felt a little tight on space.. we got to see all the talented chefs cooks and creating all of the wonderful dishes. The prices aren't too bad either. When we were heading out there were a lot of people waiting for tables. Come here early. A few highlights from what we orderedSea salt Greek yoghurt Smear: You have to order this. So delicious. Chicken Thigh Kabobs with tahtziki (sp?) sauce:  so flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Juicy. We also ordered a half bottle of wine. All the wines are from Europe.. Given that my husband and I are originally from California, We usually order a California red. But their wine selection is pretty good too. Forced us to go outside of our comfort zone. All in all. I'd say this restaurant is a must. Before coming here, I had heard A LOT of really great things. And they are all true."
"I was in town in business and tried this restaurant based on Yelpers recommendations. What a feast. The menu changes twice daily, our waitress said. We had salted beef sirloin, pig ears, flavored bacon, pork shoulder and fried olives. The pork shoulder had great reviews and was extremely tender. It did not have the powerful flavor of the other dishes, but was still great. What a great restaurant!"
"My friends and I went to Purple Pig on our first night in Chicago.  We had to wait a little over two hours for a table, but that gave us time to go over to the lounge at the Hancock tower and enjoy the view.  While at the Hancock, I had no reception, so when they tried to contact me, I never got the call, and they left me a voice mail.  I was scared that we would lose our place, so I called them and they said that they could only hold the table 10 minutes after the call.  We ran over, and I received another phone call from them as I was approaching the entrance to see if we still wanted our table.  I found that to be very considerate.  I let them know we were almost there, and as soon as we got back, we were immediately seated.  Phew!Onto the food... We ordered the cauliflower, the turkey leg, and another item (but I cannot remember the name of it).  The food was great and it was fresh, but we decided that it was not the greatest we have ever had.  We were glad to have had something to do while we waited and that we were not too hungry for that wait."
"We heard so many great things about the Purple Pig to include; sometimes there is an 1.5 hour wait. We were lucky and got a table immediately. We ordered 3 apps and we watched as the waiter wrote them down. We only ever received 2 of the apps. Then we ordered an entree to share and kept waiting but it never came. Finally we asked for our bill as we realized no entree was going to come. Long story short we left there and went to the Capital Grille. Excellent always consistent dining at the Grille. In my opinion I predict the Purple Pig will be a quick hit popular restaurant and will quickly lose its appeal as diners realize the staff is not about the customer or dining experience. Upon bringing to the waiter's attention we did not get all of our order/food his only response was ""oh sorry"", then quickly walked away. ""Oh sorry?"" I'm sorry too. I'm sorry he did not care more about his job and the overall success of the restaurant that employs him. As we sat at the Capital Grille still steaming of the overall horrible experience, 3 separate individuals said they have either had the same experience at the Purple Pig and will not return or they have heard other people experiencing the same thing. I stress to management to get ahold of the business while business is good before it is too late and you lose it"
"This restaurant was recommended to me by a number of friends in the Chicago area, and I was fortunate enough to be able to try it out for my birthday awhile back. There was a line out the door before they opened, which I understand is not uncommon, but once they did, it moved quickly, and everyone was seated without fuss. There was an extensive menu, and while the portions were small (a given for a tapas/small plates restaurant) there was enough variety to satisfy everyone in our group - from the timid to the adventurous palates. I also appreciated the staff's knowledge and willingness to work with my needs for a gluten-free meal. They were pretty well-educated to begin with, but what they didn't know, they asked, and I get personal answers by the chefs or manager. It's not a place I can afford to eat every day, but I'd love to go back next time I'm in Chicago to celebrate a special occasion."
Wow so many good things here. The beets with goat cheese were my favorite. The grilled chicken kebabs were amazing. Great paninis. The Nutella banana dessert sandwich.  The fried deviled egg was not a good order though (just one egg?!) My friends were 45 minutes late in meeting me here and it was really busy but they never pressured me to give up my table. Much appreciated. However while eating the panini my friend found a piece of plastic in her food. The waiter comped us the panini and a dessert. So I'm knocking one star because of the plastic in our food and that the entire deviled egg dish had one egg.
"3 Words: THE PORK SHOULDER! Savory, succulent, EXTREMELY tender & flavorful. The octopus was awesome! The burrata was superb & the bone marraw was pretty tasty. I expected a completely different look & vibe given the location, but I was pleasantly surprised at how laid back the atmosphere was. I'd heard great things & in no way did the Purple Pig disappoint. Will be back SOON!"
"Get the kale and crisp pig ear salad.  It'll be the least healthy salad you've ever had in your life but the kale chips and battered and fried pig's ears are worth trying if you get a seat in this establishment.  The wait is long and I don't know if I'd go again but it was a nice place to try out.  Bone marrow smear was fatty and unctuous, perfect over the slices of toast that accompanied it and sprinkled with salt, parsley, and capers.  I can understand the hype surrounding this dish.  We ordered about 8 plates and the salad and the bone marrow smear were the most memorable of the bunch."
"I am a Chicago native and I've eaten at A LOT of restaurants in this city.  I can say with confidence that this is hands-down one of the best restaurants in the city. The quality and taste is consistently high and the menu always has new and interesting dishes like fried pigs ear along with the old standards like bone marrow.  Every out of towner that I've brought here has said this was in their top three restaurants in Chicago. I won't even bother elaborating on menu choices because you literally can't go wrong! Oh, and their cocktails are outstanding too!"
"We arrived 1/2 hour before they opened on a Sunday. The line was already 25 people deep. We did get seated which was great, but it was a cold day so be prepared to stand outside. The atmosphere is communal and no privacy while dining so it may not be the best for a date or large group but the food is different, menu options are vast and definitely a step above a regular brunch! A+"
"Though the menu items aren't common, they seemed interesting. For me though, that usually ends up as poorly executed food and imbalanced.I was pleased to find that they actually delivered here. The marrow, was rich and when you eat it with the greens and a touch of the salt, it was delicious (I noticed that if you just eat it separate, it wasn't as good) and the capers helped add some balance to cut the fat.The mussels though not necessarily awe inspiring, it was far from bad. I rather enjoyed these, though my gf isn't much of a mussels gal, she enjoyed the broth.The neck bone gravy was amazingly good. and the pork shoulder was also surprisingly delicious.As a recommendation the Pesche, or peach beer was an amazing pairing with all the food. A lot of the food (naturally) had a fattiness to it and so it's heavy. As such having things like the fruity beer and the capers acidity certainly helped balance the meal.It's a pain getting a seat, but if you do. It's worth sitting down."
"Just amazing!!! Please try the pate, mocilla and bone marrow!! But I am sure everything in the menu is fantastic! Save some room for dessert!!"
"I was disappointed. Waited 50 minutes for table, and noiselevel is too loud that I couldn't hear what the waiter said.  I ordered fried almond. But they are soft and way too salty for my taste. I have the milk braised pork that many loved. The saltyness overpower the pork. Everything thing is salt, salt and more salt.  I wouldn't recommended it to my friends.."
"Horrible service, but great food. Waiters and hostesses were extremely rude. Such a bummer because the food and atmosphere were awesome."
"This place was worth the 3 hours wait. It is tapas style so we ordered quite a few dishes to share. I loved everything we had. Was skeptical of the bone marrow at first but it just tastes like butter on bread. Don't be afraid to try it! The Chicken Tzatziki skewer was my least favorite. It was a little dry and just wasn't as good as everything else we had. Everything else was new, fun, different, and tasted good. (see pictures)Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried EggPurple Pig PlatterRoasted Bone Marrow with HerbsRazor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive OilChicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & TzatzikChorizo Stuffed Olives"
Lots of sharable dishes and tremendous combinations and not ridiculously priced. There were for of us on as Saturday afternoon and it wasn't overly crowded. We will definitely be back.
"If you are an introvert, beware, the purple pig is dizzying loud and you will most likely bump into at least five people. Never fear! The food is worth the hassle. Highlights: roasted beets, chicken kabobs, and the Greek cornbread. Great combinations of flavor, especially in the cornbread. The sweet of the honey with the tang of the feta was great!  The menu was a little heavy overall (most things have some sort of fatty meat, or cheese), but otherwise, no complaints. I just wish the purple pig would have been a bit less noisy and overcrowded.  It would have made the experience closer to five stars."
"The Purple Pig has long been a staple of the downtown Chicago area, and I tried it for the first time this past winter with a few friends.We ordered the the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Pigs Ear + Kale, Lamb Steak, the Ham + Sun-dried tomato panini, Razor Mussels, and the Stuffed Squid.  Overall, everything was just a little too salty, which we all remarked on.  The Razor Mussels and the Stuff Squid were definitely my two favorites, with good flavor and texture.  However, the other options were all a bit too rich and salty, with the lamb steak also being too stringy which made it impossible to share.In general, the food was fine, but I'll probably not be back on my own."
"The food here is amazing! If you love every part of a pig on your place, this is the place for you. A must have is the bone marrow, pigs ear, and the milk braised pork shoulders. As this place doesnt do reservations, it is wise to come down early or you can expect at least an hour wait. Despite the long wait time, this place is definitely worth the wait."
"Purple Pig was recommended to me when I was visiting Chicago searching for an apartment before I moved here, and has turned into my favorite Chicago restaurant.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the seasonal options are a must have.  I am a bacon (and pork in general) fanatic, but I have to admit my favorite thing on the menu is the turkey leg.  It looks like something straight out of the Flintstones - it's so huge. But the turkey will melt in your mouth and the fried lentils are to die for.  I would also recommend the drink that I believe is called the Cocchi Fizz- sparkling wine, Cocchi and a lemon twist.  Thanks to the Purple Pig to introducing me to Cocchi and Chinato.  If you've never tried it you'll fall in love.    There's usually quite a long wait so make sure you go a few hours before you think you'll be hungry, but it is definitely worth the wait!  My favorite place to sit is at the bar if you can score a couple seats there which are first come first serve."
"Came here with 3 other friends for our 'wine club' and ended up being more excited about the food than the drinks =PBut to start -long, long waits around dinner(we were initially told 3 hours!!) They'll take your number and send you a text when your tables ready and allow you to order drinks while you wait. Although where we stood was awkwardly in between tables while waiting, probably would have been better to walk down the street to another bar and wait. It ended up being about 1.5 hour wait instead of 3...We were sat at a large shared table (there ended up at least 3 or 4 parties at our same table) so if you're not into that atmosphere, ask for an individual table or go somewhere else. Now the food - although they're known for their animal dishes, we ended up ordering mostly vegetarian dishes. Our waitress was super helpful in picking dishes and with recommendations of how to order in what order. Of the 4 dishes we got, our two favorites were the greek cornbread (YUMMM) and the eggplant caponata. And for dessert, we split one Sicilian Iris - wow, delicious!! I mean cheese and chocolate in fried dough, of course it was going to be delicious!! Will definitely return and will have to try some of their meat dishes."
"I ate here for a late afternoon lunch on Monday, finding the restaurant full, but not packed. I was offered a seat at the ""chef's counter"" by a bright-eyed and accommodating maitre d' who made me feel more comfortable at a unknown (to me) restaurant in a large city that is not my own. Wait service was attentive, but never encroaching. Being that I do not generally enjoy trendy places that are very busy and noisy, I was very pleasantly surprised.I ordered the Foie Gras and Pork Tripe with Beans to go with my dry English cider. Salad and some appetizer preparation, including my Foie Gras, was performed right in front of me, inches away. The Foie Gras was in the form of a torchon, served cool with bacon bits (not Bac-os!), capers, and a reduction drizzle. It was outstanding, buttery and fresh on my tongue, and melted away into the fresh toasted and buttered bread. Several bites in, a lead chef commented that the casing was still on the torchon and insisted he have another prepared for me immediately. I was not even aware of this being a problem; several wait-staff checked on me to apologize. Although I was not remotely offended and I take their perfectionist attitude, recognizing where they're falling short of their own standards even before the customer realizes it to be a sign of both their food preparation skill and customer-orientation.The Pork tripe and Beans and Chicken sausage resembled a cassoulet. Preparation was outstanding with beans firm, tripe supple and porky, chicken sausage an ideal backing for the flavors in the dish. Perhaps slightly salty, but the unsalted toasted bread slices hosted the strong flavor perfectly. For me, the dry cider was an ideal compliment to the food.Portions are small and some might suggest prices are a bit steep, but I feel it was worth the expenditure considering the very rich, filling nature of the food, the outstanding preparation and presentation, and superior service. I highly recommend the Purple Pig."
"I was so excited to try Purple Pig on our recent trip to Chicago because of the high ratings on Yelp and it was 2 steps away from our hotel.  We went there around 3pm on a Sunday and were immediately seated at a communal table.  We order a bottle of wine to enjoy with our meal, the wine prices were decent.  The dishes are tapas style, small plates to share.   Here are the dishes hubby and I got:* Deviled Egg with Arugula and Capers -  deep fried deviled egg,  interesting dish, it was a bit bland* Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - this dish was very sour and salty because of the pickled cherry peppers* Shaved Brussel Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano - small portion for the price ($8), salty* Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - meh, hubby wanted to try it because it looked awesome when it was brought to another table but it was very disappointing, barely any marrow and no flavor * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potato - this dish was highly recommended by our waitress and Yelp, it was salty and lacked flavor* Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potato & Salsa Verde - the octopus was tender but lacked flavor, the rest of the dish was salty and the green beans and  fingerling potato was swimming in an oil bath* Waygu Sirloin with Horseradish, Greens & Beans - for $19, I expected a lot out of this dish, there were only 6 thinly slices of sirloin on top of the greens and beans, lacked flavor* Lemon Panna Cotta - NOT panna cotta consistency, it was too thick and didn't melt in my mouth like panna cotta should, hubby said it tasted like crème brulee without the layer of hardened sugarThe service is subpar, our waitress was barely around to ask us about the food or to see if we needed anything.  The food was one dimensional, salty.  The waitress told me it was Mediterranean inspired, didn't taste anything Mediterranean throughout the meal.  Everything lacked flavor, the only flavoring agent is SALT.  We were so thirsty after the meal.  For $160 meal for 2, I expected a lot more.  The only good thing about this restaurant is the location and we got to talk to other diners at the communal table."
"This is a story of ups and down. We had relatives visiting from California and Canada several months ago so I called to make a reservation for 7 for dinner for a rainy Friday. I was informed that the restaurant doesn't take reservation but will take my name down. I asked how much earlier should I arrive on Friday 7:30pm and was told about an hour wait will be sufficient. Having been there in past and waiting over an hour for table for 3, I called 2nd time to check on wait times and was told the same.On evening of dinner, we all arrives at restaurant at 6:30pm and were told of 3.5 hrs of wait!! I got really upset and told them that is way off from an hour of wait I was told. The manager lady told me they never tell people any wait times because they change. But, I was upset that I had a 3 yr old that can't wait 3.5 hrs and there is no way I was going to find a table to 7 at a good restaurant walking in. I called for the owner (also the chef) and he was very nice but told me the same thing as the manager. The manager lady told me she will try her best to get me a table if possible within the hour.We left the restaurant and went to a local sandwich/pasta shop to feed our 3 old knowing that we wouldn't get a call anytime soon. However, the manager bent backwards and found us a table in 15 minutes and called. We just began feeding our kid so said we won't be able to come quickly. The manager said she will give away this table but will find another table after half hour. She called us again after half hour with a table and our relatives from California were hungry and had started ordering sandwiches so I had to say no once more to the manager! We felt extremely bad that the manager bent backwards to accommodate us and we could not come back as we were 20 minute walk away.I can't speak highly enough for the service we received by the manager (can't remember her name). That was despite the fact that I got really upset with her for ruining our night with visiting relatives.We know the food is amazing at this place. Now we can say the same thing for their service!"
"Went last night with two buddies. The wait can be lengthy but well worth it. You have to come to the restaurant and put your name in, they don't take reservations and you can't just call in but the good news is they take your number and call you. They also serve drinks out to you while you are waiting. The food highlights- squid, mussels, foie gras smear, Sicilian iris- one of the best desserts I have ever fucking eaten. The only item I wasn't super impressed with was the calamari dish. The drinks are great and the wine list is small but good. The service was incredible, super busy yet still ""Johnny"" on the spot. Will come every time I am in Chicago."
"This restaurant wasn't on the original itinerary for my recent trip to Chicago but I am SO glad that I dined here. For me personally this restaurant is a must-do on any future trips to the windy city.You should take a look at their menu before going because I would consider it to be eclectic and experimental. There are dishes that many people would have probably never heard of before. This wasn't a problem for me; I am an adventurous eater and if I had had the room I would've ordered every single thing on the menu. I wound up ordering two entrees and a side dish because I wanted to try multiple things. Everything was delicious and needless to say, i stuffed myself.This is a great place to go with multiple people because you'll want to try different things and the plates are meant to be shared. If you are open to new foods, I can't recommend this enough. Just bear in mind: they don't take reservations and if you go at dinner time you can expect a long wait for a table (it was 90 minutes when I went at 7:00 on a Saturday but luckily I was able to poach a seat at the bar)."
"The service was too back. I will never come again. I can give three stars to the food, but minus points for the service."
"Simple, but tasty. As a native italian I definitely endorse this mediterranean restaurant. Cost/quality is pretty good as well"
"I finally made it over! We ordered everything on the menu and were so full after leaving the restaurant! We got the braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Absolutely delicious! It melted in your mouth and every bite was perfect. We also go the pig tail and it was really interesting because the pig tail was fried warm but the egg salad on top was cold. We also had proscuitto fried balls, the three cheese platter and then pork fried almonds. Then, we had the bone marrow. If you EVER go to the Purple Pig, get the bone marrow. The bone marrow with the arugula, capers and salt was quite possible, the most delicious thing I have had. I left the Purple Pig never wanting to eat again because nothing would probably taste as good. The service was great and the drinks are amazing as well. It is pretty well priced for the kind of food you are getting and as long as you go before 4 and after 9, you will get seats without a wait."
pig ear was interesting and a nice try. wouldn't get againi did not like pork shouldergreat service but long linessteak was decentbone marrow was huge and goodjowl was goodi couldn't find the dish i really liked; i think it was the pork neck
"This place is way overrated. When friends out of town told me to bring them to purple pig, i told them the same thing. Pig ears and foie gras are disappointments because they are too oily."
"Purple Pig was the first restaurant I ate at when I arrived in Chicago for my big food eating extravaganza. This restaurant was recommended by a foodie friend so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. First, the wait times are way off. We were told that it would be an hour wait so we went to get some stone crab at Joe's a block away. We got a call 20 min later saying our table was ready, which normally would be a good thing, but the hostesses assured us the wait would be at least 45min; hence the trip to Joe's. Okay, so rushing back to the Purple Pig we are told the wait would be ANOTHER 45min bc we didn't check in 10 min after they called us. Okkkkkk... We waited and finally got two seats at the bar in front of the kitchen. That was a mistake. I'm a chef so I tend to enjoy open kitchens, feels like home sorta thing, well, I do not suggest anyone who has ever worked in a kitchen, or values sanitation, should sit in front of the open kitchen. I witnessed cooks throwing food at each other, playing on their phones and then plating food, spraying oil on each other in front of the flattop, the garde manger girl reused her bowls several times (no I do not want the last orders' bits of salad in my dish, thank you) without ever washing them- the kitchen was a mess. Note to restaurants- please only have an open kitchen when your cooks can act professional and be clean. On to the service- our waiter, who seemed like he was on speed, rattled off a bunch of stuff before ignoring us for 25 minutes. We almost left. We finally grabbed some menus and ordered some food.We got: from the Antipasti, the beets which were good but again, I cringed watching the garde manger reuse the bowl she would toss our beets in, never throwing out the remnants of beets from the prior order. From the Fried, we got the crispy pig ear, it was boring and the ears were fried beyond recognition. It needed some acidity to balance out the blandness and overly fried ears and the 3 pieces of pickled Jalepeños weren't enough acidity for the whole dish. And lastly, we got the veal short ribs Marsala. We only took one bite of the short ribs because it was SO SALTY! I love salt, but wayyyyy too salty for me. My bf almost spit it out. I'm not sure what attracts this place to everyone, but I will definitely not be coming back. We should've kept our reservations at Girl and the Goat."
"Found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Outstanding doesn't come close enough. Doesn't matter what to order, you will be happy. I will be back!"
"I LOVE this place.Delicious food, amazing service and great location. Although sometimes they have really long waiting times, which can be annoying but hey! You want great food, you gotta wait for it! Just plan accordingly!"
"I am all about the pig.  The Purple Pig is right off of Michigan Avenue, next to the Nordstrom, in a little inlet up a couple of stairs around the corner.  What is disappointing about this place is the fact that they don't take any reservations - first-come, first serve.  During prime dinner time around 6-8pm, you can expect an average wait of at least an hour.  It's a very cute but small place, that offers booths, the bar, as well as a communal dining experience.  The staff are nice and pleasant, and the two bathrooms in the back are for both the ladies and the men, so that was a bit of a bother.  In regards to the food, the menu is set up as a tapas-style, where you can order multiples to share among the people that you're with.  Under the Antipasti section, we had the 'Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic' - beautifully sauteed almonds, slightly greasy, and wonderful wonderful whole roasted garlic - I just wished they put more of the garlic in!  I would eat this while watching a movie, no doubt.  Under the Fried Items, we had the 'Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries' and the 'Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.'  The deviled egg had bread crumbs on its exterior, filled with the deviled egg filling, and the caper berries looked like olives filled with some kind of a pate product, but ended up being like tangy caper-like olive slices.  The pig's ear were the best (even though it looked like tails, rather than the ears) - a better version of crispy fried onion rings, lovely crispy bits of kale, a runny egg, and a good sauce to just shove everything in your mouth - this was one of my absolute favorites!  One of my friends also tried their panini, the 'Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Pesto' - just like your everyday panini, but I couldn't taste the salami or the goat cheese - it was more of a mozerella and a green pesto throughout (nothing compared to Panera's or the Corner Bakery's paninis).  For the Smears, we had the 'Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda,' which was like a pork version of a tuna, kind of bland (but came with a sweet diced salsa-type with a cup of salt, and grilled bruschetta slices).  Under the a la Plancha, etc. category, we ordered the 'Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes &Tzatziki' and the 'Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic' - the chunks of chicken were juicy, but a little undercooked for my taste; I did like the smashed potatoes, though.  The pig's tails didn't look like pig's tails, but more like braised pork bellies, overly fatty, and kind of bland - the scrambled egg mush on top didn't help and it had too much of parsley.  The Prosciutto Balls were okay, since it came in a (barley there) tomato sauce, and the balls themselves were deeply baked and tasted like a hushpuppy, but without any hint of prosciutto. For dessert, we shared the 'Sicilian Iris,' which was a ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche - think of a fried donut that is heavenly and you want to just be encased in - a huge favorite of mine.  The dessert item was the dessert panin, with Nutella hazelnut spread, 1 slice of a small banana, and marshmallows  - it could have had more slices of bananas, but it was a favorite among my friends.  Overall, the dining experience was nice, and the food always came out quite quickly (since these are small dishes).  Get the Pig Ears, the Almonds, and the Iris - you will not leave disappointed, and I would order these by the dozen when I come back.  The place gets jampacked and loud, and they offer an array of wine and cheeses as well.  Metered parking can be found up along Illinois.+'Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic' + 'Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg'+'Sicilian Iris' for dessert"
"Was looking forward to a tapas style meal where we could enjoy good eats and converse.  This place didn't disappoint. The assortment of cheeses and meats were perfect as our starting point, and it pretty much just got better from there. Recommend the sangria."
"""Cheese, Swine and Wine!!!Wonderful tapas restaurant in the heart of Chicago's Magnificent Mile!!!After a nice day I shopping yelp guided us to The Purple Pig and this place exceeded our expectations.  This place offers indoor and outdoor seating with a generous size bar.  After a short wait we were seated outside.   It was a cool cloudy day, but the heat lamps made it very comfortable.  Our sever Mark was very friendly and advised us to order as we go to gage how much food we need  and answered any questions we had.  We started with a maialina chianti and primo Rosso from Sardinia two excellent wines. For our apps we had chorizo stuffed olives and prosciutto san Daniele both were devoured.  For our main courses we had the lamb blade steak, mussels and fried potatoes.  The lamb blade steak was very tender and tasty. The mussels were stuffed with pork onions and shallots and were amazing.  We didn't have time for dessert,but I'll be sure to have some next time I'm in town.  Whether you're taking a break from shopping, looking for a glass of wine after a day at the navy pier or having dinner with friends the Purple Pig is the spot!!!"
"AMAZING! They serve delicious Mediterranean food and it's meant to be shared. Everything we tried was delicious, and their staff is very knowledgeable about both the food and drink menu. Everything they suggested was delicious!"
Wine and Cheese bar. Excellent hole in the wall. Super exciting. Had the bone marrow tapas with the seafood platter dinner plate. Delish!! Didnt get a chance to have a glass of wine with cheese but you can tell everyone was loving theirs. Will be back soon.
Hadn't been to chitown in a few years and this was our first stop. For a Monday night it was crazy busy but that just is a testament to their service and food. Servers were very attentive and gave great wine recos. Would highly recommend coming and sharing a handful of the items. Great tapas! We had the beets and the Greek Cornbread and they were both outstanding.
Cured meats with cheese Everything looked amazing!Great wine and champagne too
"I was quoted 20 minutes for a table and it ended up being 5 minutes.  The bar seating was not budging at all on a Friday afternoon.  Order:-Mussels, beautifully tender and love how they give TWO pieces of bread to sop up all the goodness-Pig tails, super flavorful, fell off the bone and loved the fresh egg salad on top!-Kale Caesar, really good, too heavily dressed, loved the quail eggs, croutons and house cured anchovies.  Skip:Pig tripe, salty and texture was offputtingReasonable pricing, great wines by the glass and super warm staff."
Great place all the way! Service was superb. Food was deeellliiicious! Comps to the chef on Saturday night. Oysters with poached eggs with bacon and truffles was orgasmic! The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and hip. I wish I can come herefor a drink and try a different dish every weekend.
"I love this place!!! Its like love at first bite and drink...yes it can happen. All the food items we ordered are very good, not to mention, Wesley, the bartender is amazing!!! Best Old Fashioned by far....my first time is great!!! Its going to be my go to place when I visit chi town!!"
Flavorful and exciting menu-- small plates work great for larger groups. Food was very good but nothing too memorable.
"The Purple Pig was the first stop for food in Chicago on a recent trip. The Yelp reviews about this place were on point! My friends and I arrived around 7:45pm and the place was packed. A table for the 3 of us was about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't bad. We were seated at a communal table and waited for our server. The service took awhile because it was busy, but the food was worth it. We ordered the milk braised pork, chicken kebabs, and a turkey leg. The turkey leg was the best out of the three. It was cooked to perfection. The Purple Pig is a must stop when you're in Chicago."
"I have had this on my list for a quite a while and finally made it here this past Friday night! We were quoted over an hour and a half wait, but luckily enough there was one seat at the bar and after about 20 minutes, the bartender let me know that two gentlemen were leaving and he would move us down to their seats! Score! Sitting at the bar you have a direct shot into the kitchen! After talking with the bartender he let us know that the space used to be a FedEx/Kinkos and there was no gas lines to run a typical kitchen! They cook on these fancy looking hot plates that only heat up when in contact with metal (like a magnet!). Amazing! We started with the roasted cauliflower, which was excellent. Little bits of pickle with charred cauliflower. Next we ordered a cheese and meat. Thirdly, we ordered the scallops and pork shoulder. The scallops were good, but the pork shoulder that followed was AMAZING! The meat literally melted in your mouth. It was the highlight of the meal. I will definitely be back! The place was still packed when we were leaving at 10:30 at night - they clearly know what they're doing. The bartender serving us all night was awesome! Great customer service. The wait sucks, but its totally worth it in my opinion!"
"Dishes by order of deliciousness:1. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs 2. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg3. Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic with Grated Egg & Parsley4. Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots5. ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg6. Salt & Vinegar Beef Tendon ChipsWe ordered 6 plates for 4 people and overstuffed ourselves! The bone marrow and pigs ears are highly recommended. I would've loved the salt & vinegar beef tendon, but the vinegar was so overpowering. For dessert, we had the bread Pudding, but it was okay. I think us Southerners prefer the fluffier bread pudding made with croissants or brioche or challah. Even though this joint is known for their wine (which we had and it was delish), beer would've been SO much better. There were so many salty dishes that it would've been great to have some beer to wash it down with."
Pork shoulder is amazing. Paired with wine and the cheese stick. Right off of michigan ave. Music is load but works well
Amazing!!!! The food was so unique and well prepared. You will not regret coming here!
"Yes, it's always packed, but I would wait for hours to eat here. Get there early and enjoy the atmosphere. The servers are knowledgable and friendly. The food tastes fresh and gets to your table quickly.This is where I take people from out of town as a place from the usual Chicago deep dish. It never disappoints! As for my fellow people who do not eat pork, there is plenty for you to eat! In fact, I crave the octopus and butternut squash on a regular basis. 100% recommend."
another gem in chicago! i came here for a late lunch on my first day in the city. it was the meal the set the bar for the rest of the meals on my trip. the food here is tapas style.what we had:-crispy pig earswith sunny side up egg (my favorite). it was crispy like a chip. not salty and very well balanced with the egg-pork jowl with sunny side up egg (my favorite.... i can have more than one favorite right?) - the pork jowl was super tender -braise pork cheek with mash potato - delicious!we were only here for a little bit i can tell that it's a cute restaurant and can get lively and busy during dinner time. i'd love to come back here again!
"Bone Marrow for lunch?  Why not!Holy smokes, I wasn't expecting 2 huge pieces that covered the whole plate!  Nice and buttery but I'd have to admit, this was too much for one person."
"After a few failed attempts due to long wait times, we finally made it in for lunch. The food was great. The short ribs were very safe and tasty. The chicken kebabs were so moist. The tuna and octopus antipasti was packed full of flavor but beware, the tuna has lots of olives. The milk braised pork shoulder was very tender, mashed potatoes are to die for but the portion on this dish was a bit small. The Iris dessert and chip-wich was also so worth the wait!! The Iris will actually make you weep it is so good. The waitress, awesome... Back waiters were a bit gruff and rushed.... But what can you expect, there's always a two hour line staring at them!"
"Not for the faint of heart but excellent for the adventurous. Loved the pork and octopus!Our group of three dined on the patio.  Got there early (5pm) on Wednesday evening and did not have to wait for a table. We tried the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette (sweet and delicious), Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (probably our least favorite dish - calamari was a bit rubbery), Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (the fried egg added a nice creaminess to the dish.  It was a bit salty but overall one of the best of the night), Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (our first time trying bone marrow and we suspect it is an acquired taste. It was a bit bland yet rich.  One of those ""tried it, don't care if I have it again"" dishes), Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde (one of our favorite dishes - the octopus by itself was not remarkable, but when married with the potatoes, beans, and salsa verde - divine!), and Pork Osso Bucco with Soft Polenta & Gremolata (our #1 dish of the night!  The meat was so tender and juicy, the polenta perfectly creamy with just a touch of salt - perfect!).We did want to try the deserts.  We had the Lemon Panna Cotta (light, creamy, and delicious!), a nice cheesecake, and something like a sugared donut hole filled with raspberry jam.  All paired nicely with a cup of cappuccino. Overall, it was a great dining experience that I would recommend that everyone should try at least once. Don't worry if you don't know what to order, the staff is knowledgeable and willing to over suggestions."
"It was a busy place! We came around 3pm in the afternoon and the whole place was petty full. The food was very special and worth trying with reasonable price, just can't imagine how busy it would be at normal dinner time. Do come early!"
I absolutely loved this restaurant great service and amazing food. Pro tip... Make reservations! The wait was 2 hours for a party of 4. Try the Italian Sicilian for dessert and the octopus dish.
"I love small plate / tapas restaurants and was staying across the street so i figured id give it a try.  Lots of people were waiting to be seated but since i was solo i was able to skirt right in a grab a seat at the bar.  This was a sunday night too and i figured it would be a bit less crowded but this place was packed!  Good sign.  Actually now that i think of it, i wonder if i had to put my name down to sit at the bar? Did i cut everyone in line? i dont know, oh well.  So i was a bit overwhelmed by the menu.  I wanted to try everything!  I went for the Beet and Goat Cheese,  Stuffed Squid, Pigs Ear.  The stuffed squid was delicious, the beets and goat cheese were very good too.  The pigs ear was just okay.  The beets were cooked perfect, the goat cheese was delish, the crunchy pistachios mixed in was a great texture to have with the soft beets and cheese.  It was a bit sweeter than i expected tho.  The stuffed squid was soo good, i was about to ordered another portion.  The greek fava and breadcrumbs worked well with the grilled squid.  Ive had a similar and more traditional greek version of this dish but they totally killed it with their take on it.  Highly recommended.  The Pigs Ear wasnt what i was expecting.  Not much taste. The best part was the pickled cherry peppers but there wasnt much of them in my portion.  Skip this dish.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and laid back vibe.  The server behind the bar was super attentive and answered all my questions.  She was very busy, the bar was packed, so i figured at first that its gonna be a long wait or i wouldnt be able to get her attention if i wanted to order another plate or drink.  Not that case at all, she was on top of her game, and i never once had to ask for a refill.  Cant wait to try it again!"
"I really enjoyed my meal here. We shared a bunch of plates and everything was good. I'm going to ding them 1 star for two reasons. First, the 1.5 hour wait on a Tuesday. That's a little steep and no reservations. One good thing, they serve drinks outside so the wait was slightly better. Second, the communal seating was just too crowded. If you're a foodie and have time to wait for a table, go and enjoy a very good meal. Easy location in Chicago as well."
"This has to be one of the places your try when you're in Chicago! I've been here a few times now and always love it, but I usually drink a bit too much wine when I'm here and forget what I've ordered but here are some of the things on the menu you MUST try:Roasted Bone Marrow smear - one of their most popular dishes I think.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - meat just falls of the bone.Octopus - some in your group might be scared, but it's deliciousEverything I've hard here has been either good, or very interesting at least. The one downside is the wait - they don't do reservations so on weekends sometimes the wait is something crazy like 2.5 hours. Try to go right when dinner starts."
"I've been here 3 times over the past few years and always enjoy the food and drinks. It's really hard to go wrong with any of the menu items. We also got in at 1pm on a Sunday with no wait - absolutely unheard of! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 (any other day I may have given it a 5) is for the service we had. There were a few minor things that I haven't experienced other times when dining here. I asked the waiter for his opinion on their cocktails and which might be fruitier and summer-y. He responded by saying none of their cocktails were really fruity because they are of European/Italian influence. It made me feel pretty stupid, seeing that I had read the full menu but was hoping for an opinion on a refreshing choice since it was 75 and sunny outside. The other thing that was a little off-putting was that we waited for our dessert for what seemed like forever. When we asked the waiter for the bill and to check up on our dessert with the kitchen, he gave us the explanation that basically implied it'll be ready when it's ready (not ""sure - I'll check on that right away""). When he finally did bring out the dessert, he had a much better explanation that it had exploded in the fryer and they had to restart it."
"The food is very different! The selection is not varied, but meals are created almost artistically. The menu is offered in small plates. Therefore, you end up ordering ""rounds"" of plates. It can get quite expensive!The set-up of the restaurant is the coolest thing about the restaurant! It literally hangs over the river. The staff is amazing in that they know the menu like the back of their hands. The restaurant becomes quite a community within itself. Tables are close together, so we ended up joining with a couple at the table next to us in chatting."
"Man, I'm really bummed that we didn't go here during my last year's trip, because this place was AMAZING.We were staying with a friend that lives a block off the Magnificent Mile--so we passed this restaurant sooooooo many times.  Finally, we decided to go check it out.  We were really lucky and got here at around 11:30 for lunch on a Thursday (when it was pouring rain) so it wasn't busy at all.  We got a little corner of the communal table and our server helped us to pick our dishes.  The Purple Pig is all tapas style dishes with a huge selection of meats and seafood.  It was pretty tough narrowing down our choices but we ended up with:- Razor Clams: I think it ended up being five pieces and they were sauteed with some oregano, lemon, and EVOO.  Amazing!  Such a simple dish but it really brought out the flavors of the clams and was just very refreshing.  I definitely tried to soak up as much of that sauce as possible.- Turkey Leg Confit: the server got me with this one.  He said ""its bigger than the one at Disneyland"" and I had to have it.  It was cooked in duck fat and served with the meat literally melting off the bone.  Such an amazing dish.  We split it between the three of us and we still couldn't finish it!- Roasted Bone Marrow & Herbs: This was the only thing that was a boredline miss with us.  The sad part is that it wasn't because this dish wasn't amazing at The Purple Pig, but because we just had THE BEST bone marrow the night before at Au Cheval.  So this one was pretty good, but not quite as flavorful as the other.  The addition of the salt did bring out the wonderful flavors though.  -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: OMG I was so happy that this was served last because it just rounded out an awesome meal.  the pork was sooooooo tender and the combination with the mashed poatotes was amazing.  It was like the best, lightest meat I've ever had.The service was also amazing.  Our server (I'm blanking on his name right now) was such a sweet guy, always checking up on us and making suggestions.  Our water glasses were never empty and we were thoroughly entertained through dinner.  I'd love to come back!#Yelp100Challenge"
"With over 2000 reviews, what can I add to the list of what has been said?I love The Purple Pig. I am a fan of the tapas-style dining, and I love wine. The two combined is an ideal restaurant. I have not had a bad item off the menu. Both times I have visited, I have taken the wine recommendation of the server and it has been spot on!The best items that I have tried are:Charred CauliflowerEggplant Caponata with Goat CheeseRoasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (ah-mazing!)""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg-The better version of a BLTPanino con Nutella-A banana and Nutella sandwich, toasted to perfectionThe espresso is a great flavor at the end of a delicious meal. Definitely hit this place up when your shopping on Michigan!"
"EVERYTHING is AMAZING. You will NOT be disappointed. The plates are like tapas (small) style. Its a long wait, but I agree-worth it.  We ordered the Bone Marrow, Braised pork shoulder, turkey leg, pig's ear, stuffed squid and chicken kebab. Every single plate was tender and delicious. Except the pig's ear--crispiness. nomnom."
"Duck rillette & milk braised pork shoulder were fabulous.  Bartenders were friendly, efficient & knowledgable.  Awesome scene & energy.  Would totally go back next time we end up in Chicago!"
If you haven't tried this restaurant it's a must! It has a unique menu that you wouldn't find anywhere else.
"What we ate: Chorizo Stuffed Olives with Creme FraichPurple Pig Platter -- Charcuterie boardCheese Board -- *Le Chevre NoirMeatball Slider with Parmesan & ArugulaMilk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesSoft Serve Ice Cream - Strawberry Our bill: All in all with tip about $100 Overall thoughts:The wait was a little grueling - we usually have really good luck getting in at the bar when there's a wait but no one was budging. We finally got our table about 45 minutes later (they call and let you know it's ready - which was a great feature). The service was quick even with the amount of people. The atmosphere a little tight, the tables are kind of on top of each other and the girl next to us was SCREAMING to her date across the table, so there's that -- but overall a very pleasant dining experience. This was hubby's dream come true. He had some of the best charcuterie he's ever had and really enjoyed every single bite of it all. I died with the chorizo stuffed olives, as they were incredible! Can't wait to go back!"
"Delicious. Inventive. Eclectic. Only a few words to describe the Purple Pig. Have been frequenting for years, so about time I wrote a review! It is a must visit on every Chicago trip I make. Last stop was on 4/7/14. My menu favorites (I'm surely forgetting some):Whipped feta- you will dream of this Shaved Brussels sprouts- raw-perfect, tangy tasteTurkey leg- it is as delicious as everyone saysPork shoulder- meat falls apart, the mashed potatoes perfectly complement Nutella dessert panini- need I say more than Nutella Cinnamon ice cream and donuts- ridiculous The atmosphere is inviting and fun (music really adds to it), food is always on point, wine list is impressive, and the patio is now open (with heaters at the moment)! Planning my next trip!"
"Had a really nice lunch here.  Came alone and sat at the chef's station, no wait. Got the fried pig ears with fried kale and banana peppers, and the milk braised pork shoulder with mash potatoes. Both were very good. I think the only reason it was not a five is I am not as much a fanatic about pork that many others are. I would totally come back here and love their inventiveness and attention to detail. I found the pig ear dish a little too greasy for me but that is more a personal taste. I am glad I got it and would share with others but would not eat it alone again, just too rich. The pork shoulder was amazingly tender and a great dish."
"After 2 failed attempts to eat here in the evening, I lined up at 11:30 when they opened.  My wife and I were visiting family over the holidays,  A brilliant idea.We were #20+ but got seated at a table, which was perfect.  We stayed 2 hours and sampled the GF items.  Unfortunately that meant we had to skip the breads for the Marrow and the Manila clams. Nevertheless, these plates are fantastic!  Three bones of marrow and a small salad with wonderful vinaigrette.  The clams were done with Merguez sausage and tomato and sherry.  The combination with the clams were magic.  They had almost a rich chili flavor.A great find was the Chiraboga blue. Not being a blue cheese fan I was converted to this creamy cheese with a great salty mellow tang.  We had to order a second.  If there were a GF cracker it would have been even better.The service rocked.  Never had to look for help. Never felt like we were rushed.  While a little pricey it was well worth it.  We'll be back again at opening."
"This for me is truly as good as it gets.  We drank obscure Croatian wine, ate savory cheese, yummy kale salad, lamb, and had a cake dessert with olive oil gelato.  All the flavors were spot on for each dish! The evening started with the two of us huddled around one chair at the bar, but we lucked out and the single diner left before our meal arrived.  If you aren't lucky enough to get a bar-seat, the wait can be brutal.  I recommend dropping a name in and getting errands or shopping done in the area, since they will call you when your table is ready!!I really cannot wait to be back!"
I found this place on Yelp while looking for a place to eat.  I made a mental note of it because it seemed a bit far from my hotel (I am on foot).  I had gone to downtown and was walking around and about 6pm I started thinking about dinner.  I checked Yelp again and The Purple Pig was around the corner so I went.It was a Thursday night and the place was PACKED to the hilt.  I was by myself and got lucky with a seat at the community table right away.  I had a dirty martini with gin and it was very good.  They even stuffed the olives with blue cheese for me.To start I had the pork fried almonds.  They were interesting but good.   I also had the fried deviled egg.  It too was very good.I had salt encrusted pork tenderloin as a main.  They brought the tenderloin to the table in the baking pan to show me what the salt crust looked like when it came out of the oven.  They explained they always show the crust to the diner and would then take it back to plating to be sliced and plated.  It was very good.The atmosphere was great.  The wait staff is of the hipster type and it was a good place to hang out.
Waited about 1.5 hrs to eat at this place. It was alright. The price for the food was a little ridic.  The shoulder was delicious but the portions are so flippin small. Actually every dish is really small. We tried sharing everything but it just wasn't satisfying. I gave it 3 stars because I'm not so sure it was worth the time or money.
"We came here because it's the place to go when in Chicago but I probably wouldn't come back. Overall my experience was good but the food didn't live up to my expectations. The wait itself is pretty long and the restaurant fairly small, but there's plenty to do around the area and they take your number and give a call when your table's ready, which is nice.WARNING: they charge for water. they give you the option to choose from 3 different types - sparkling, distilled and tap. The last two confused me, wtf is the difference. I guess tap is the poor man water. we asked for distilled thinking it was just regular water - NOPE, it's 6 dollars a bottle. We ordered the bone marrow because everyone and their mother's told us to order that. It was okay, maybe i'm not a fan of fat smear but i didn't find it too spectacular. We also ordered the JTL which i thought was my favorite dish. I split it with some friends and thank god, because the pork flavor was really over powering. what was nice was that our server gave us a complementary dish because i think they made an extra one. after we paid and left i felt really greasy and fat.Overall, i recommend dining here once to say you did, but never again."
"Got there right at 1130 am and was seated right away. Thankfully,  because after we were seated a line formed. Ordered the bone marrow smear,  grilled wagyu short ribs and pork tripe and pork feet sausage and all were splendid. My favorite was the wagyu short ribs- it doesn't look like much but tasted amazing. Had service been spectacular I would've rated this place a perfect score. Our server wasn't personable and came off a little snotty. When we asked for ginger ale he replied a little irritated that there wasn't any and asked us to look at the drink menu. Um, perhaps clarify what's available then? Nonetheless, food was tasty, and ambience fun. Service was minus a few points."
"Went here with my fiance and the overall impression: totally OVERRATED. First of all, the wait is RIDICULOUS. When we put our name down, we were told the wait was 1.5 hrs. Fortunately, we live nearby, so, we put our names down & went home to wait (otherwise, there was no effing way I was gonna wait that long for a restaurant). After 1.5hrs, we returned, checked back in, and ended up waiting another 40 minutes. Finally, we were seated and we ordered the following dishes based off what seemed to be really popular from what we read in the other yelp reviews:-Bone marrow (1/5)-Crispy pork ears with kale (4/5)-Octopus (3/5)-Scallops with lamb quarters (5/5)-Milk braised pork shoulders (3/5)We started with the scallops, which was very tasty and well made. It was a good dish to start with. Next came the crispy pork ears, one of their signature dishes, which was very tasty and flavorful as well. At this point I was pretty pleased with how things were going, until the pork shoulder & octopus arrived. The pork shoulder was really absolutely nothing to rave about. It wasn't bad, but it's definitely not worth a 2hour+ wait at all. The octopus was very tender, but my fiance and I were not a fan of how it was seasoned/flavored. Our last dish was the bone marrow, which was pretty disgusting. It tasted like straight up grease, probably because the bone marrow was cooked/soaked in butter or something. On top of this, it was served with heavily buttered bread. We didn't even finish this dish. For dessert, we got the nutella crepe with banana sorbet, and the olive oil tangerine cake with olive oil ice cream, both of which were verrrry good. In sum, we did not get the hype for this place because it was not that spectacular."
"Amazing, the pork neck bone gravy is perfection. Spanish anchovies with avacodo hummus, bliss."
"Wow, not sure what everyone is raving about.  The purple pig is mediocre in both food and atmosphere .  Nothing really stood out to me, but the beet dish, which was just okay.  The standard for phenomenal is much higher than this joint. Sorry folks had all the sig dishesChicken on a stickGravy beef shoulderBeets Bone marrow Some other stuff that was both expensive and boring. The verdictWon't be back"
"Minus one star for the wait and atmosphere. Would like to subtract more, but the food was actually pretty delicious.Yeah, we had a large group, but a guesstimated wait time of FOUR HOURS?! Holy sheebus. We only ended up getting seated because we decreased our group size and were DETERMINED to go. They seriously need to work out a better seating system. There were always so many empty seats while they waited for the parties to return..When we were finally seated, we had to request to sit outside. It was so freaking loud inside I couldn't hear myself think. It was also too cramped.Honestly, I'm glad we had the wait so we could eat beforehand.. The food was delicious and rich, don't get me wrong, but it was greasy, fatty, and HEAVY. I couldn't have eaten more than we did, which wasn't enough to fill me up. This is what we had in the order that I liked them (see pictures!):1. Calamari salad - Very refreshing!!2. Fried pig ears - Savory and crunchy but too greasy3. Bone marrow - The bread was buttered on BOTH sides. a bit too much, I'd say. The greens that came with it made a really great combo though!4. Jowl - too bacon-like5. Fried eggplant - not bad, but it was the last thing we ordered, and it was more fried stuff, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have :(I usually avoid restaurants that are hyped up so much because I'm usually uber disappointed. I'm glad I finally came here before I leave Chicago. It was delicious and a great experience!"
"What an unbelievably wonderful restaurant concept! I recently visited The Windy City on what will go down in the T5 list of best vacations ever, and The Purple Pig made the cut. I am not especially thrilled with the concept of dining near strangers, nor am I a huge proponent of an elevated noise level. Somehow, this restaurant managed to make both of those concepts work to create one of my favorite dining experiences to-date.I'm becoming more and more of a fan of tapas-style dining. I'm not entirely sure when we arrived that we intended on having anything more than a snack, however that snacky feeling quickly turned into a full meal once the first apps hit the table. Fried olives?! Seriously?! These things were unreal. The cream sauce that lined the bottom of the plate added an extra dimension of wonderful to this dish that cut the harshness of the green olives. They were perfect. Their wine selection was obviously carefully selected, and my two girlfriends each found a perfect pair for their respective ""main appetizer"". I was feeling a little more hardcore, so i went straight for the gin cocktail listed on their menu (as recommended by our fantastic server). They have a selection of maybe 10 ""spreads"", which were also perfect for our impromptu-family-style-lunch. The bread served with our whipped feta and cucumber was delicious. The next time this Jacksonville-based yelper is anywhere nearby, I'll definitely be back, Purple Pig. Kudos to you."
"One of the worst dining experience we've ever had. There was plastic garbage in our charcuterie plate. Terrible response too. They tried to just take away some of the meat to ""solve"" the situation. Absolutely embarrassing. Will never ever come back here Again. Worse experience we've had in Chicago."
"This little piggie went to Purple Pig with two friends to introduce one of them to the legendary milk braised pork shoulder.  It's been awhile but the pork shoulder was as good as I remembered (and the only memorable dish the first time around).  We had to order two for the three of us.  We also tried two smears, the pork neck gravy (yum!) and the eggplant w/ goat cheese.  Both were accompanied by thick, toasted bread for dipping and the server gave us extra when we ran out.  The eggplant one was meh.  We tried the JLT and the pork jowl was crisped to perfection.  The egg made it messy to split and share, but it was still doable.  The pork osso bucco was my least favorite dish, mostly due to the spices.  The meat itself was tender, juicy, and fell right off the bone.For dessert, we split the Sicilian Iris (yum!) and the Panino con Nutella.  The iris was different and definitely worth a try.  The panino was underwhelming and something that could be made at home.  I regret not trying the salted caramel soft serve instead.In the end, the three of us were over-full sharing 6 dishes and 2 desserts.  In terms of service, our server was great and friendly.  We ended up ordering most of his recommendations, which were good.  Also, since they don't take reservations, we arrived early (4:30pm) and were seated immediately.  Since one of my friends was totally against sitting at a communal table inside, we were seated on the outdoor patio.  The weather was cool, but it was still comfortable since there were adequate heat lamps around the tables.  They also seated us even though we were still waiting for our other friend.  We started ordering and by the time she arrived, we had a few dishes on the table already.  Great timing!  Also, the pork shoulder comes out fast!I'd go back for the pork shoulder alone...and perhaps to try the salted caramel soft serve."
"Everyone has been talking about this place before, during and after traveling to Chicago, wait time was long. But the food worth the wait, it has a vibrant atmosphere, I had the duck prosciutto, the crispy pig ears that is balanced with kale and marinated vegetable. Lastly I have the pork chop, it was huge, I want to order more, but I only have one stomach. Will definitely come back next time!"
Top 10 meals of my life. A memorable night of ordering until I couldn't take it anymore. Thanks Chef Jimmy and Sr. for doing what you do so well night after night.
"Good food, especially the lamb stew made in a clay pot that's now on the menu. They won't recommend it because it's new, but it was by far the tastiest of the 4 items we ordered. TOO ATTENTIVE with the service. Too many servers. Too many questions.Too much (useless) information. I know my palate. Just let me order what I like."
"Tapas are good. Specially the dessert. I have been in Spain and seems legit.Service was ok, since was crowded is understandable to not receive 100% attention, but the attendant was mean and we had to repeat several times for more bread or water we asked."
"Easily one of the best and most innovative restaurants Chicago has to offer. Michigan has, for years, been filled with tourist traps and chains but the Purple Pig finally brings serious culinary skills to the Magnificent Mile.I had nothing that I didn't love. I was most surprised, however, at the deviled egg being my favorite dish by a long shot. While the Indiana State Fair works on a new junk food to fry every year, the Pig has fried a deviled egg and I believe that you'll find that a golden egg might be worth more than a golden fiddle.It's indeed pricey for what it is (you're still paying Michigan rent, after all) but at least make it a stop for a snack. A couple of glasses of wine and a couple of plates shouldn't break the bank but will let you partake of the experience."
"Ron Swanson would be both amazed and confused. This place makes great use of the pig in delicious dishes and was by far some of the best pork dishes I've ever had in my life. The atmosphere is great and the servers are extremely useful in helping you navigate the menu. Come with friends and just share many of their small dishes together, you'll be surprised and amazed at just how delicious everything is!"
"Worth the loooong wait (it can be 2 plus hours, so plan accordingly).  Friendly staff, interesting menu.  Wonderful wine list; and of course, amazing braised and cured meats, and some clever vegetarian-friendly items that you may recognize from Tony's other restaurants, such as roasted carrots with almonds and goat cheese (much tastier than one would think).Trendy.  Great date spot."
Quite unique menu. The Sardine fennel salad is fantastic. The octopus is tender and tasty.  But the marrow smear is a little bit greasy.  Good location.
I liked this place and the food was good. The service was also very good. my partner had a chicken dish that was very good. The drinks were made strong and good. It was a fun place.
"I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars, but that's not really an option and I don't think it deserved the full 4. Don't get me wrong, the food was alright, but it seemed really pricy for what you get and some of the dishes were extremely salty. I don't get how this place is supposed to be ""mediterranean inspired."" I don't think I had anything that was anywhere close to ""mediterranean"". I ordered the calamari (which was probably the closest thing to maybe being mediterranean, but not really), the pork shoulder, the bone marrow, the lamb, and clams. The pork shoulder was good but very salty and they barely give any mashed potatoes. The lamb was pretty good, but as I said before, it was kind of expensive. I had never had bone marrow before and that was surprisingly good. The clams were fishy and the calamari was very light and fresh. Another thing that was disappointing about this place was how they pack people in here like sardines. I came here when my parents visited and they put three of us at a table fit for 2. We barely fit anything on our table and had to put some things on the window ledge behind us. We were also in a really awkward corner, where there was basically a corner/wall between me and my dad. In order to talk to him, I had to peak around the wall and scream, because we were also under a loud speaker.Overall, I don't really know if I'll be back. After hearing so many good things, I was really excited, but I was definitely disappointed. For the price you pay for such small portions, you could go to a nicer restaurant and get a regular sized meal with the same ingredients."
"Been here twice in the last couple of days.  Stop one, we had the cocktails Il Saggio & the Martinez Fizz, along side the pig platter & 3 cheese plate for a snack.  Absolutely delicious.Second stop, a quick lunch bite (after a torrential downpour) and had the milk braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes.  It's a smallish plate, but it is OH MY GOD DELICIOUS.  Paired with the house Pinot noir, and wow.  Get this.Service here is 100% outstanding.  I sat at the bar both times.Cheers!"
"Good beer? Check! Good food? Check! Just... don't eat here if you're vegetarian. My friend and I ended up here due to our friend and fellow Yelper, Mary C. She had recommended this place, so we ended up there.What did we order?1) CHORIZO STUFFED OLIVES: These were good, but not amazing - mainly because I couldn't really taste the chorizo in it.2) PORK NECK BONE GRAVY WITH RICOTTA: Absolutely yummy! However, not a must-have.3) MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATO: Due to the raves on Yelp on this, we had to get it. Absolutely tender, and very soft. Highly recommend! Thanks, yelpers!4) TURKEY LEG CONFIT: Okay - so we thought this place was ""tapas?"" This thing isn't. It's HUGE. Like, it's bigger-than-my-calf, huge. Okay, not that big, but prepare to eat lots of it.5) AFFOGATO (with pumpkin soft served ice cream): I have this thing where if I see ""affogato"" on the menu, I MUST have. It was rather with pumpkin or mint soft-serve ice cream. My friend wanted the pumpkin, and boyyyyyyy was it YUMMY. HIGHLY recommend.All in all, we had great service, great food, great beer... Oh! And did I mention? They play a LOT of Canadian music here (it was great hearing Arcade Fire playing over and over again in the background)."
"Ate a lot of things here, don't really feel like repeating other reviews... everything was very good.   But that was the best turkey leg I've ever had.  And I love Turkey legs."
The food was terrific and came pretty fast.  The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great too.
Reluctantly went here for lunch due to it's Michigan Avenue location which lends itself to mediocre options.  Pleasantly surprised by everything about this restaurant.  Food was great and service was good.  Only drawback was it was extremely loud.  Must try is the stuffed squid.  Highly recommend this place.
"Thanks for the tip Yelp!Awesome experience. I'm only in town for a few days and I'm very tempted to forego something new and return before I leave. We were one of the last tables seated on a Thursday night and sat at a communal table. Our server gave us some suggestions and we took them to heart. Pork neck gravy ""schmear"", charred cauliflower, and the braised pork shoulder were bangin'. The ""schmears"" they have are a pretty simple, but great idea. Fresh crusty bread with a spread to schmear on them. It's great & probably has some great margins for the restaurant. The menu is so damn interesting. It's expansive, but very well put together considering the breadth and sophistication. It's not overwhelming, but is enticing and I get the sense it's diverse not for the sake of diversity. But that everything on there has a shot at being prepared exceptionally well."
"YUM! I've been here about 5 times now, and I'm not sure why I haven't written a review yet. I stumbled across this place randomly (which is rare... usually Yelp everything before I visit), and I was lucky to be seated almost immediately. I've tried a variety of things on the menu, including:-Bone marrow smear: you guys, don't kill me, but I don't get the hype of this dish. The bone marrow with the bread tastes like overly oily bread... I feel like its more of the excitement of eating something new that makes it fun to eat, but to each his own (let the hating begin)-pork neck bone smear: yum! It kind of tastes like marinara sauce on steroids... It looks tomato-y and tastes kinda like spaghetti sauce, but its SO good!-artichoke salad: good, but probably would spend the $8 elsewhere (portion is pretty tiny)-milk braised pork shoulder: fall-off-the-bone and melt-in-your-mouth delicious! It is a little salty, but worth it!-wagyu beef: Good, but wouldn't get it again (maybe it's because I ordered this dish when I was already past the point of bursting...)-clams with sausage (definitely not what it's called... but that's the gist of it): delicious!GET HERE EARLY! the last time i came here, ended up waiting for 3 hours... and this is not unusual. While I was waiting, people came in at around 9 pm asking for the wait time, and it was still 3 hours (the expressions on their faces were priceless). Also, whenever a dish comes with extra broth (e.g. the clams), I always ask for extra bread to mop up the sauce. Granted, the food is really heavy/salty, so you will probably drink gallons of water afterward, but so worth it!I'll always be back."
My husband and I were able to get a nice late afternoon lunch in without having to wait. Service was great. Food was good but nothing out of this world. I am afraid to say we found everything to be very salty which made the experience a little disappointing.
"If you love pork and want to try out some interesting dishes then this is definitely a place for you. it's totally worth it.We arrived quite early for dinner (around 6pm) and there was already a 30 min waiting list. However, we just waited in the queue where we were able to order some pre-dinner cocktails.We ordered the following dishes (all of which were great and worked very well together):- Calamari starter (nice and fresh)- The bone marrow smear (very rich, but amazing)- The pork shoulder (very rich and creamy)- The tripe dish (a bit of heat and smokey flavor)The restaurant was super busy, but the service was prompt. We were very satisfied with all the tips and recommendations that we received from the waiter."
"Nothing impressive.  Don't deserve the four star at all. Seem like the chef didn't put enough thoughts into the food. Plenty of food, no soul"
"Meh...At first I was thrilled about this place and then after about 5 times I realized that it was probably just the hype I was high on.The Burrata is good but I can do the same thing at my place...a little homemade pesto and some balsamic reduction = pretty much the same thing. Eataly sells homemade Burrata by the way.The foie gras is good but again.. just take some foie gras and whip it, toss in a little liquid smoke = pretty much the same thing. I'll give them the corn bread, it's damn good but really sweet. The drinks are good and I've had some cool waiters. & I have successfully avoided the crowds too and have always gotten a seat within ten minutes. This last time I showed up on a Friday night around 10pm, the extremely snobby maitre-D said it would be an hour wait. I was hungry so I debated going somewhere else. All I did was repeat the words ""an hour"" & the Maitre-D said to me in an amazingly condescending voice, ""you are lucky, usually it's 2 hours."" Wow. I am so lucky. Look dude, life is short & I am not wasting two hours of it hanging around a building waiting for you to bestow a seat upon me. For two hours of wait time my foie gras should have been flown in from Paris that week and not whipped with liquid smoke. So yeah..When there are countless of amazing restaurants in Chicago I am not standing around for 2 hours to eat some cheese and bread and meatballs, meatballs that can be found over at Cicchetti. Just then two guys came over and handed me their seats at the bar which miffed the Maitre-D. Sorry I didn't get to play in the sadistic/masochistic drama of staring at a wall for two hours so that you could get off on finally bestowing me a seat in your pseudo-French accent dude..."
Great food. Small portions for the price. 45 minute wait. Well worth it. You won't get flavor combinations like this anywhere else.
"Yes, the wait is long. Go anyway. The food was INSANELY good. There is nothing small about their small plates. We started with the whipped feta and cucumber shmear... this was enough for a table of 6, easily, to all get a taste. Absolutely delicious.Moving on we did salads and some charcutterie (lamb jerky/butter lettuce salad was refreshing and crisp, and the lingua had an almost citrusy sweet taste) before moving on to our meals. The milk braised pork shoulder was an absolute stand out. IF YOU ORDER ANYTHING, make it that. Seriously. You can forward your thank you notes to my message box. Their philosophy is delightful, the space is charming, the wine list is beyond reasonable, the staff is well informed and friendly. I'd do it all over again, wait and all."
"On a quick weekend getaway we hit up The Purple Pig as our first stop and I could have stayed all weekend!  We arrived around 2pm on a Friday and this place was buzzing.  Excellent selection of wines and very knowledgeable and friendly staff.  The meat and cheese options were superb and we jumped in head first with the waiters suggestions and were not disappointed.  We also went for the mussels and I needed a straw to drink the broth.  Thankfully they brought us extra bread to sop up the goodness.  We had a few (many) glasses of wine and finished the visit with dessert - salted caramel soft serve for me and soft serve served with espresso over it - both were sweet and salty and yummy!  What we loved the most about our time at The Purple Pig was the seating arrangements inside.  The large high top tables were community style and we got to know couples from Texas, Philadelphia and locals to Chicago.  I loved the atmosphere and how kind everyone was while we were enjoying our treats.  Everyone was offering bites from their plates and trading dishes and it made for such a fun afternoon.  We loved Chicago as a whole, but The Purple Pig was a big reason why.  I could live off meat and cheese and this place would be my first choice!  Can't wait to get back to the windy city and plant myself for more cheese, swine & wine!"
"I can't really review on entrees as much as wine, cheese and service. We walked in and we're lucky enough to grab 2 seats at the bar as a couple was leaving...score!My sister and I were in the mood for cheese and wine. Our bartender, Diana was very helpful with our selections and was super nice. We love stinky funky cheese so got brescianella, ew calf kidding and sunset bay. The wine was also good, praro de roriz.Service was great- our bartender was very attentive."
"Might have given this 4 stars because the food was good, however the service was really lacking. Came here for lunch with a colleague on a weekday, so the crowd was a mix of business and tourist. Didn't have to wait long for a seat outside, but most of the tables are large and therefore if it's busy you end up sitting with other groups.Looked like they had a really great beer and wine list, but we stuck to water this time. Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly, and when we asked for menu recommendations she seemed pretty annoyed. Settled on the calamari, roasted corn, milk braised pork shoulder, and affogado for dessert. All of it was super delicious. I just wish the atmosphere and service were better to make this restaurant really outstanding."
"I hate to give this restaurant such a low review when there were so many wonderful facets. We had read the reviews, and knew there would be a wait. No worries - we caught up at the Starbucks around the corner and they phoned us earlier than expected. 45 min wait on a Friday night - not bad.  The food was amazing...first foie gras for my friend, first bone marrow for both of us. Amazing wine from Croatia. Tasty dessert.  Attentive, funny staff.  Then the bill arrived. $160 for 2 - not bad considering the bottle and a half of wine, cheese plate (3 cheeses), bone marrow, foie gras, braised pork shoulder, salted caramel ice cream, cappuccino, and Bailey's.  We agreed one of our best meals of the year. Then my sharp-eyed friend noticed a discrepancy on the bill.  It was only $2. They had charged us $16 instead of $14 for the bone marrow.  The wait staff took off the $2.  When she asked us if everything was ok - we said it left a bad taste in our mouth to know the price had been wrong and made us feel like we needed to go over our bill w/ a fine tooth comb.   She sent a manager over. He explained that ""we needed to understand"" that the menu changes daily. It was fixed in the system and the bill had been corrected.  His whole attitude was - why are you bothering me - and way to make a big deal over nothing. In my experience, if there is an error in the bill, either the item is comped or a percentage is taken off the bill. Apparently at the Purple Pig its just the price you pay for a menu that changes twice per day.  If you go - check your bill carefully!!! As amazing as it was... Based on this I doubt we will be back."
"Not really sure what's the hype is for Purple Pig. We arrived here around 7pm on a Friday night. We were told the wait was ~2 hours. So we went into the Nordstroms next door and killed 2 hours while being extremely hungry. Luckily they did seat us after the 2 hr mark.  We had the following: Fried Brussle Sprouts, Bone Marrow Smear, Pigs Tail, Milk Braised Pork Shoulders, Pigs Ear, and Chicken Thigh Kebabs. The food was just ok. Nothing spectacular. Everything was extremely salty. If I had to pick I liked the Brussle sprouts and the Pig Ears with the Kale. But my favorite was their wine called Dignus! A superb blend of reds. Totally loved the wine. So overall... I prob wouldn't come here to just eat... esp if there's a crazy wait..."
"The last meal I had in Chicago and it was a great way to end. I don't generally like to do this, but my friend and I came with our luggage after checking out. This may have instigated the following situation. The restaurant was packed on a weekday lunch and there was a line of people passed the outdoors seating area. We walked up looking for the host stand to put our name down but was instead stopped by a moody back server who points at the people waiting and tells us that we need to wait. Oh, you mean the groups of people we had to walk by just now? Yeah, no sh*t they were here before us waiting for a table. Now, if you don't mind, direct us to the host stand so we can put our name down.The food was all extremely rich and very delicious. I highly recommend the pig ear and bone marrow. Service was on point after the initial smart guy. Pro Tip: This is a family style restaurant so bring lots of friends and order lots of food! It's worth the wait."
"Food. Poisoning. We waited 2.5hrs to be seated only to be given a table basically outside the tent in the cold where people were waiting for tables. We successfully were moved inside but not after waiting even longer. The food was terrible.  All of our orders were things we usually enjoy and have had many times at several other restaurants, but their variations of them were unpalatable. The service was some of the worst we've ever experienced. And the price inappropriate.  The kicker:  Shortly after, my husband and I started feeling pretty sick and now, about 3 days later, our stomachs are still reacting violently to that debacle."
This place is great! Minus one star for not taking reservations and making people wait when it would be easier to take resies and give people back their time. Food is great though and very unique.
"Had lunch here after a quick shopping spree on Michigan Ave. We were seated outside right away, but it took almost 15 minutes for a waiter to finally notice us. We weren't familiar with many of the menu items, so we asked the waiter for his recommendations. He seemed a little annoyed having to list out his favorite dishes, so we kind of had to fend for ourselves. We decided on the Coppa and Ham paninis, which were two of the best sandwiches we've had in a long time.The outside patio was nice but very loud and crowded. The service was fine - maybe the lunch rush slowed things down. Prices seemed pretty typical for a restaurant right off the Mag Mile. Regardless, this is a great spot for a nice lunch when you are done weaving your way in and out of tourists."
"I LOST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My friend and I were on Michigan Ave. searching for deep dish pizza, but I saw this place.  There were several reasons why we came here.1. I remember this restaurant's name.  (not hard to remember right.)2. We were a crossed the street.3. We were starving.4. Deep dish pizza was farther.  5. My friends from CA gave good reviews.Because of these no-very-legit reasons, we cane here to give it a try.Fantastic restaurant.  LOVE THIS PLACE  as my first dinner in Chicago.  Don't forget to order PORK NECK and PORK SHOULDER.  They surprised us and waked us up from a long walk on Michigan Ave.  Great recommendation from Yelp and the waitress.  (Thanks)However, something was a little off.  The cocktail was too strong for us.  We ordered one The Darkside (something start with The Dark) was totally not our favor, so we ordered another one.  Errrr.... STILL TOO STRONG!!!!!  Another thing that was not our favorite- PORK SWEETBREAD.  It was too salty.Overall, my friend and I love this place.  We were very satisfied with everything this place offer.  First dinner in Chicago was AWESOME!"
"The Purple Pig is outstanding!  The food was out of this world -- our favorites were the foie gras appetizer, pork shoulder entree, and JLT sandwich.  So flavorful and unique!  The ambiance was also great -- loud, but a fun and upbeat atmosphere.  And the servers were excellent -- friendly, prompt, and very focused on customer service.  We will definitely be back!"
"I understand the huge hype about this place, and I can definitely see why. I am solely giving a 3 stars based on my one personal experience, which was underwhelming. I was excited to try this place, and the menu was very unique and creative, which is a plus (if you're adventurous with food). We went here for a late lunch on a week day and was seated promptly (rare for this place especially during dinner or weekends). We had the pig ears, bone marrow, and braised pork shoulder. The fried pig ears were just okay. The bone marrow looked good but was way too greasy. The bread that came with the bone marrow was drenched in oil. A little overboard on the grease, which made me sick later. The best tasting was the pork shoulder. I am sure I'd like this place if I went a couple more times and had other dishes, but based on this first experience, it did not live up to the hype."
"I was treated to a birthday dinner at Purple Pig by my friend Amit T., entirely too nice of him. Neither of us had ever been so we kinda went a little overboard with picking out plates to try. We started out with the chorizo stuffed olives, I think this may have been one of Amit's favs! Next we knew we had to try the bone marrow, I had heard of this before but had never had the guts to try it. It was very interesting, when paired with the capers and such on the plate it really brought out a different experience. My favorite dish was the pig's ear with kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg. This dish was deliciously salty with a great crunch, the cherry peppers really set it off. We then went on a lighter note with the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinagrette. Neither of us were huge beet lovers, but the combination sounded really good, so we went for it. We decided that it was good, but pretty sweet actually to the point where we were glad we ordered it towards the end almost as a dessert! If all that wasn't enough we saw the rabbit salad and decided we hadn't been adventurous enough and ordered that as well. I had never had rabbit before myself and although I feel kinda bad about eating what may have been an adorable bunny...it was a pretty good salad (considering this was before my sudden salad kick!)All in all this was a great experience. So many new and interesting things to try. Delicious combinations in small plates which are great to share and taste. It was really a great birthday treat :)"
"Service was FANTASTIC this time and the food was even better than we remembered. Loved it! The fried Brussels were a favorite- so good. Bone marrow was out of this world. Every single dish we had was excellent. The chicken wings come with fried cox comb and feet so beware. The feet were good, but the coxcomb was a bit weird."
"Since I had read that this place gets busy I went with the fiance on a week night and early ~ 5:30PM. Was able to get a table as we walked in but did notice it getting quite busy shortly thereafter.Only complaint about this place is that it does indeed feel cramped and you hear pretty much all of the conversation next to you.The menu is very interesting with prosciutto stuffed squid, bone marrow, and various pig parts. Some of the decisions were outstanding and others were just good but all in all quite the tasty experience. The chorizo stuffed olives were very good but wish they gave you more (I'm sure not the first one to complain in the history of food about not having enough of something you like), bone marrow was really interesting and amazingly tasty, squid stuffed prosciutto was good but honestly felt like the flavors combatting with eachother instead of working together.Thinking back on it eating the bone marrow was interesting because you get two big bone halves where you scoop out the marrow, which has kind of a fatty gelatinous consistency to it. The accompaniments (salt, capers, oily parsley salad) are perfect to bring the whole thing together.Lots of different options and much more to try in the future. Pricing is ""reasonable"" in that things range from $5 to $15 or more. Broad range though so really up to you to choose.Also was impressed with the waitress as she was very knowledgeable about the menu - we ask her to describe the various cured meats and she was able to rattle off what each o the 12 or so were."
I was there for a quick vacation last year and I still can't forget the amazing food. Their calamari and fregola pasta is amazing. I was lucky to find the recipe online... But the experience at the purple pig cannot be mimicked. I would go back any day. If you are in Chicago make sure you visit this place. It's worth every penny!
Friendly staff really good food. Hard to get into as there is almost always a queue but worth the wait. We went in around 6 pm and got a communal table fairly quickly. Good atmosphere. If you can get in do it.
"At 11:25 AM, five minutes before the restaurant was set to open, there were already 25 people in line. At 11:30 AM, as the hosts began to usher the hungry guests into the restaurant, there were about 50 people. By 11:35 AM, there were about 70 people. By 11:45 AM, there was no line because the Purple Pig actually managed to accommodate everyone. Nice! Everyone's happy :)Here's the breakdown!Salt-roasted beets and goat cheese (+++) - Amazing. Just delectable. It's a wonderful pairing made incredible by the unique combination of taste and texture. The saltiness just makes everything taste better.Bone marrow (++) - Really good, but also incredibly greasy. The accompanying toast are also buttered up, so it's one big fatty dish. Definitely worth a shot if you haven't had marrow before. Loved the capers and salt too.Pork blade steak (+) - A fairly typical piece of pork, to be honest. Try something else.Pork presca (+) - Can't find this item on the menu anymore. Same as the steak; nothing too fancy here so try something else.Foie gras (++) - I've never had foie gras before, and so this was a special occasion. The foie gras had that typical livery taste, but it wasn't strong at all. It was also sweet and paired well with bread! This is a great place to be with when you have friends who aren't afraid of trying new things. Our waiter was very well-versed on the menu and was very helpful!"
"As a guy who doesn't eat pork, because its a fckng disgusting parasite-ridden animal (pigs eat sh*t, literally, and you eat them?  Please explain that to me, nobody's exactly starving here), I really enjoyed the non-swine options.  Roasted bone marrow (cow) was flavorful and succulent.  Tuna with quail eggs had the perfect lightness and salt content.  Topped off with the barkeep's recommended glass of red wine really sealed the deal, unifying so many of the interesting flavors at work.  So, my fellow anti-porksters, you may eat here in peace."
"Ooooh Purple Pig, I was waiting for you all day. I was literally jumping in my seat as the food came out. We ordered:-JLT. Pork jowl! -Pork shoulder-Roasted bone marrow-Tessa (their house made cured meat)My favorite was definitely the Tessa. Everything else was really, really heavy. All that fat. It was my first time having bone marrow - it was like slathering butter on my bread, haha. So rich. But it's really a dish for the senses. The crunchy bread with buttery marrow, topped with herbs, finished off with the crunch of the sea salt. Yummmkfksjfbdbdh. Also, it just LOOKS stunning. Very pretty dish!I loved the ambience of this place. Super trendy, very fast-paced, and they were playing 70s music. Hehe."
The Waygu sirloin was to die for and so was the fried brussel sprouts. It would take several visits to try everything that looked enticing on the menu!Would highly recommend it to anyone.
"The Purple Pig does nothing but impress with everything that is swine. Nestled in a small and quaint space in Miracle Mile, the Purple Pig serves the greatest in tapas in Chicago. The bone marrow, pigs ears, and the swine & tripe dishes are what I recommend.Each of these dishes engage you into a new out of your mouth experience of what you never would have expected with each bite... unless you were expecting amazing... or more lipitor.This truly is the best tapas restaurant I have been at in Chicago, not too many others can remotely come close to the original creations."
This place is a delight! The food is creaive and interesting. It's not TOO expensive (or it doesn't have to be)The small plates aren't super small.The vibe is really plesent. I'd go back a million times if I could. We had a leasurly lunch of 4 small plates and a dessert (why not?).Enjoyed everything. It's a bit loud but it's trendy and cool and we ended up talking to people next to us and it was simply a lovely time. I'd do it all again.
"Wow!  Best food I've ever had.  Seriously!  :P  I actually went in January, so my review is a little late.  But I'm still talking about it to almost everyone I meet!  And it's very reasonably priced.  My husband and I ended up with a bill of $42 (and change) for the evening, and we were stuffed and even had leftovers!  (We don't drink, though, so that's probably also a factor.)  But seriously, AMAZING!  Also, don't let the name fool you ... there are way yummy options for the vegetarian in your party as well.  :)"
Patience creates hunger.... Patience tested   Hunger fabulously satisfied.  Morro if you're lucky.   This place is a reason to come to Chicago
"I cannot understand giving this place a bad review. The food is impeccable. Staff was great.  The roasted bone marrow, fried devils egg, JLT, pork shoulder are insane. You won't find anything like it anywhere else!"
"If you're in Chicago and you don't go here and have the pork shoulder you have done yourself a disservice. Seriously. It's that good. Here's the deal, they don't do reservations and people know this place is good (plus it's right in the heart of tourist/Chicagoan central) so there's probably a wait. Try and grab a spot at the bar, it will ease your pain and your eyes will thank you. Why? Because you get to watch the masterful chefs cook in what appears to be a 4'X4' space (and there's at least 4 of them) and turn out some of the best dishes you've experienced. In addition to the pork shoulder we had the chicken sausage, very tasty and the meatball slider, very very tasty. I think we'll try a smear if we go back. Those looked fantastic. Overall, I'd consider this a must visit restaurant in Chicago."
"Ok, right after my friend and I tasted the bone marrow, he regretted ordering it. It was too much fat. Of course, we obviously forgot some biology commonsense--yellow marrow is mainly made up of fat cells. On top of that, the bread that come along with the bone marrow was also greasy. So if you ask me how is the combination of bone marrow and greasy bread? Too awesome to order again in the future. Definitely, different ppl's taste buds have huge different preferences. Two gentlemen sitting close to us finished all the bone marrow and kept praising how awesome it tasted. How do I know? Tho prefer not hearing what they said, I sat only ten inches away and his word kept interrupting my thoughts. Anyway, If you are not a fan of food with too much fat, stay away from ordering the bone marrow. 2nd dish, fried pig ear(can't recall the exact name)? Prob give it a three star. Too crispy to tell the ingredient were pig ears. My own philosophy is that if u can't tell what the food is made from and it has only an OK taste, then trying once is enough. I do like the hint of sour combined with the oily crispy things. You know, it just makes the dish taste so much fresher! 3rd dish, an egg with some salad? Lol I can't recall. It did not surprise me at all. So that's it. Finally comes to the dishes I DO enjoy, turkey leg and pig shoulder with smashed potatoes!!!! The best!!!!! They are the must try! I finished them all cuz my friend could barely eat a thing after he finished one bone marrow. Lol! Go early on Friday. We went there around 6 and waited an hour and fifteen minutes to get seated."
"What I find most important about this place is that I cannot stop thinking about it.We had the pork ears, charred cauliflower, JLT and turkey leg.  With the exception of the JLT, which was still fine but I wouldn't order again, everything was unique, super flavorful and actually quite filling.They went a little heavy on the salt on all dishes, especially the cauliflower, but even that doesn't earn a star knock from me because, like I said, I can't stop thinking about it and a restaurant that leaves you drooling into the next day means their doing something right.4 tapas & 6 drinks was less than $90 too.  Not too bad for the quality and location.  And yes, this place is a little douchy, but the food is worth it.  Oh, and all this coming from someone who doesn't eat much meat!"
"So everyone who's everyone eats here cause it's that's good but it's only an experience and only an experience with Colin Jones, a server in particular, no not the manager, the server who's hot quite a tongue for lip service and good food not just at Purple Pig but around the world.... @cojones320 for twitter Say HelloSo be nice and be interesting or just be human...Say I'm ThirstyHave him pick the wine for you... We had the Rose, and a Vintage...Say I'm HungryHave him to pick what HE wants for your to try WITHOUT telling you till it actually comes to the table, tell him to keep it coming and tell him two dishes before you start getting full.. Tell him any food allergies and restriction so you don't end up at Northwestern.Say You're DoneTell him to pick your desert, 2-3 is safe :) for a group ... But don't miss the Affogato and the Sicilian Iris"
"The Purple Pig may very well be one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  It is very similar to Bestia in LA.  We shared numerous small plates among three people and one large one.  I really liked the Octopus with fingerling potatoes and salsa verde.  I loved the acidity of it.  I also thought the Bone Marrow with herbs was amazing!  Here is my list of dishes with the most favorite on top:Octopus with fingerling potatoes and salsa verdeBone marrow with herbsPigs' ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg (The top 3 were a must, and I would order again)Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta (very good, but a little too rich for me)Fried chicken with aioli (new to the menu and delicious)Chorizo stuffed olives (probably wouldn't order again)Cheese for dessert (I liked sheep cheese, a soft cheese on the sweet side)I am in LOVE."
"I've waited years to try this place since they don't take reservations and I have not felt like waiting hours in line on previous Chicago visits just to try it. On my recent visit, there was only a 30-min wait on a Thursday night, so I figured this would finally be my chance. We ordered the octopus, pig ear, pork shoulder, fried olives, razor clams, meatballs, and Nutella crepe for dessert.The ingredients are quality and the food is cooked perfectly, I'll give it that, but the flavors are just so bland. When I started writing this review after leaving the restaurant, I gave it four stars because the quality of ingredients and preparation is indeed excellent, but after eating at Girl & the Goat the next night, the Purple Pig pales in comparison. I was reminded how flavorful quality food can still be, and the Purple Pig just does not meet that same standard. Plus, the service was only so-so. After finally getting to try the Purple Pig after years of wanting to do so, I've decided it's only ok overall and not worth returning to."
"One of the best meals I've ever had. I'm not usually a fan of tapas style restaurants, but this one blew me away. I felt completely satisfied after leaving and felt like I had just attained a new level of food nirvana. Highly suggest the wagyu beef, it changed my life.Only downside is no reservations, leading to possibly long waits (ours was about an hour for a table of 4 on a tuesday night), and ""social"" seating. Otherwise, amazeballs."
"Excellent food!! The Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers was really good and creative way to have a deviled egg. The Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula was amazing - you only get one per order though. The bread they use must have some kind of crack in it...it's so good! The Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki was the best plate in my opinion. All the flavors and different textures really complimented each other.  And the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes melts in your mouth. They cook it to perfection. This place is fantastic! Not to mention the good looking bartender. Not only easy on the eyes, but makes one of the best Old Fashions I've had."
"Good food at a reasonable price equals long wait.  Now, take that plus prime location and tiny space equals very very long wait.  We waited over a hour for 2 seats.  However, the wait was worth it at the end.  The food was very good.We ordered:Prosciutto di Parma - goodFried Brussel sprouts - so so goodRicotta and Pork Neck Gravy - delicious, very flavorful, my hubby's favorite of the mealSquash and Ricotta - this was my favorite of all dishesRazor Clams - very goodPork Shoulder - very tendor"
"Come hungry!This place is small and packed. There are communal tables or you can just sit with your party. We had the roasted bone marrow, fried octopus, blade steak and fried pig ears. All were very tasty."
"We ate dinner here on a Wednesday at 5pm and were seated right away! We started off with the bone marrow and the fried pigs ear, both tasted amazing and I encourage you to try both of these dishes if you haven't before! Our server was great and brought out 3 yummy cheeses (per his recommendation) we finished dinner with the lamb which was jam packed with flavor. We will definitely be back for more!"
"We came here around 6pm on a Sunday night and managed to score a seat at the bar with no wait. The staff is incredibly friendly and know the menu inside and out! After asking for some recommendations and what was popular on the menu, we ordered the bone marrow with buttered toast and salt; pig ears with kale, egg and pickled peppers and pork shoulder with gravy and mash.All were very solid dishes. You can't go wrong with the bone marrow - which comes in a healthy portion. Additionally, while watching the cooks prepare this several times, I can say for a fact that the slices of toast that accompany the bone marrow are soaked in butter - making this quite the decadent treat. With a sprinkle of greens and salt, it had amazing flavor.The second dish, pig ears with kale was quite salty but had a really good texture to it. With the egg on top, it really adds the finishing touch to the dish to prevent it from becoming too overwhelming. The pork shoulder was very tender, flaked right off and had a delicious gravy poured all over it. The mash was fairly generic, but overall... just solid!Speak to the bartenders and they'll give you some really great recommendations on drinks based on what flavors you like. Try it! It's worth the hype."
"Too noisy I can barely heard my friend as well as the waiter...food is nice, but not impressive. Some are too cheesy..."
"Words cant express how awesome this place is. Milk braised pork shoulder, oh dear, Ive said too much."
"The food was great but the service was ridiculous. We went with a group of 4 and were told we'd be seated within an hour. An hour later and it was 5 more minutes, 5 more minutes, 5 more minutes for about another half hour. When we finally were seated and ordered we split up deciding dishes between 2 and 2 as we had a vegetarian in the group. Well they ended up bringing out all the vegetarian dishes first and none of the meat so we had dinner in stages. Then they totally forgot one of our dishes. I liked the food enough to come back but was really disappointed by the way they handled our group. Unfortunately, group dining is part of what makes small plates place so fun so that is a let down."
"Don't waste your time here! We showed up at 6pm to put our name in as Purple Pig does not take reservations, and we were quoted a 1-1/2 hour wait. We thought that was reasonable for a Saturday night but we weren't seated until 8:30. That a full hour after the quoted time. Totally unacceptable.Once seated, our waitress ignored us for another 15 minutes. By then I was starving. All told, the first round of little plates didn't arrive until after 9pm. Ugh.As for the food, thank God that the Purple Pig has a good wine and cheese selection because the rest of the food was horrible/too weird for me. Frankly, I was too hungry to try chewing on bones or to find chicken on the itty bitty pieces of food. Do not eat here if you like to eat somewhat heathy food. You won't find anything on the menu. Yuck!Our experience was chockful of tourists referred by their hotel concierge. Not a single local and we talked to no less and right other couples/groups. I smell some collusion with hotels going on here. This place does NOT live up to the hype. AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
"The only thing good about this place is the wine list. Period.The hostesses are awful and rude and will lie to your face gladly. We are from out of town and got sat outside by the front door. With wind blowing. At 40 degrees. The heat lamps kept getting turned off around us. So we asked to move us. AFTER waiting for this cold crappy table for an hour. The hostess from hell said a 2 top behind us was reserved.. A 2 top?!! Really now? Her hell assistant says he will look for a table. All it takes is one glance. What are you looking for? Your own ass?? After 2 complaints we finally got moved to this ""reserved"" table. How rude is this?!!!? I mean really. It was the WORST experience. The food. Is ok. At best. You're in Chicago. Go somewhere else. I wish I had."
"Another stellar review for this place, though don't go during dinner time or weekends, unless you want to wait for 3 hours.  Pretty expensive, so I think it's worth trying, but not something you'd have all the time.Highly recommend the Burrata!"
"Because of the high review, I came and tried this place. I ordered the two of the most popular entrees. Pork shoulder and wagyu steak with bone marrow. Not very impressed..the pork shoulder is very plain and wagyu beef is so salty.. I also ordered pig ears. To be honest, I can't taste pig ears but some fry flavor. The atmosphere is good here and is really close to notdstorm."
One of the best restaurants I've been to. Came for lunch and had the best steak of my life. My wife who is picky also had an amazing experience. This is a must try!
I really love this place - great atmosphere off of Michigan Ave. and a super creative menu.  I stopped in looking for a small late night bite after getting into town and had a Foie Gras Torchon with crispy lentils and pomegranate.  Definitely recommend it - especially if you are a Foie fan!
"Got here around 6pm on a Friday evening and was seated within 20 minutes! Awesome. While waiting in the outside seating area, I was able to place a drink order and my drinks were transferred to my servers tab. Awesome awesome! Ordered the quail eggs app and bone marrow salad, amazing! Milk braised pork shoulder rocked my world! Everything was awesome and amazing about this place!"
"Went there a few weekends and it was a great experience. The food is so creative and so yummy, I was blown away. The beets are still my fave thing on the menu. The mortadella with the arugula and balsamic was great as well. The manchengo cheese with the membrillo was a bit greasy but I got over it. The thing I didnt like was the bone marrow. I usually love it and that is one of the reasons I keep going back but this time they had changed the bone which was supposed to be easier to eat but it seemed impossible to eat. The reason this place is getting 4 stars from me is the fact that it doesn't take reservations and the wait."
"5 star food and wine, restaurants like this set the bar for the others.I tried to limit the number of plates I ordered, as our little group racked up a pretty big bill for food and wine, but each dish was as delicious as the last and left us all ranting and raving about how good everything was!Attentive service, fine dining atmosphere and an amazing wine selection with knowledgeable a sommalier make this restaurant complete! Enjoy!"
Omg so delicious!  Found this place by semi accident on visit and what a score!  The service was slightly snooty so they lose a star there but overall a wonderful and yummy experience!
Amazing place with great food and great music. The turkey leg and the pork shoulder The best. Very extended wine options which I apreciate.The place is very cool. Modern and people are nice.
"Always a safe choice to bring out of town guests to. The food can be over salted sometimes, but overall it's great"
"Yeah, it's better than I remembered. I came here for lunch on a weekend day, and that made the rest of my day wonderful.Bone marrow smear - bone marrow sounds weird as food right? Actually it had a very smooth, creamy texture. Definitely worth a shot!Pig ear with crispy kale - a very crispy dish, but not greasy or heavy at all. It felt like eating a better version of chips.Pork blade steak with honey - yeah it sounds delicious and tasted even more so.Strongly recommend!"
"After several attempts, I was finally able to get into PP without a 2 hr wait! Yay! Loved the airy brightness of the interior...I thought it was just gonna be another darkly-lit bar where proper food pics are impossible. It was still hopping at 9pm on a Monday, no wonder I could never get in during peak dinner time. Friend and I shared pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder, roasted beets and bone marrow. Really loved the for tender pork shoulder and sweet beets with tangy goat cheese dressing. The pig ears were nice and crispy, but had none of that textural contrast between cartilage and collagen that I've always associated with pig ears. Everything was aggressively flavored, so I think I'd have enjoyed the dishes more with alcoholic drinks (which mute the palate). The only misstep for me was the bone marrow: it was unbelievably greasy. The oil covered bread it came with did not help. Next time I'll steer clear of the marrow and try other things on the menu...if I can get in closer to normal dining hours. Please expand!"
"The food at Purple Pig is out of this world! In my opinion you can order anything off the menu and leave a happy camper. (Side note my friends did not enjoy the prosciutto filling of the stuffed squid as much as I did) I recommend stopping by an hour or so before you are ready to eat to put your name down since they do not take reservations, and they will call you to let you know when your table will be ready. The replenishment staff is amazing, promptly filling our cups with water before we could even consider refilling the water ourselves with the water jars that stood at the ready of every table. The wait staff is great as well responding to my numerous inquiries of what would make an ideal selection. But why four stars and not 5 you ask. Well I am someone with sensitive teeth and water filled with ice can be uncomfortable. So rather than asking for another cup I ask for a straw, but I had to ask three different people before a straw actually came my way. And for those who carry purses, there is just no convenient location to place your purse. Hooks under the tables would be such a simple and much appreciated fix. And nothing against the establishment itself, but be prepared to be surrounded by pastel dressed yuppies, Purple Pig attracts them like donuts attracts Homer. If you made it to the end of this review I congratulate you, because I myself rarely read past the first two sentences."
"I had a generally good experience here! I wanted a bar seat, so it was a bit if a wait. I lucked out and got the Chefs counter.Knowing a fair number of chefs, I was impressed by the professionalism of the kitchen (minus a couple people) in such a small space. The chefs were obviously keeping a close eye on the food that went out - making adjustments and sending stuff back that wasn't perfect.FOH were all very nice. My waiter, Colin was SUPER helpful. I ordered the Octopus and a fried chicken special.  Colin convinced me to go with the octo - and I was not disappointed! It was tender and perfect, and the veggies were a great touch (though some of the fries could have been crispier). I was disappointed because the Fried Chicken special was 86 ed :( I was looking forward to chicken feet!!I replaced it with the Fried sardines - which were unfortunately bland. The pesto/caper/cranberry combination was awesome - but overall the dish lacked.Wish I had come with more people so I could have tried a wider selection on the menu!Edit: they could have used a bigger beer menu. There are AMAZING beers in the world, sometimes beer goes as nicely with dinner as wine."
"I have been to the PP twice now. I've went later on on the evenings so there wasnt much of a wait. Food is alright, overpriced obviously. I had bone marrow, brussel sprouts, cheese and apple jam, meatball sliders, chicken wings and the lobster and sausage. We shared these among 3 people. Wings were good, so was the cheese. Everything else was unpalatable in how salty it was. Sausage and lobster was so salty, two tiny pieces of lobster $20... ridiculous. Both times ive been there everything was over salted and i usually like salty. Wouldn't go back there, not worth the price."
"After carefully considering a place to eat for our anniversary dinner, my fiancée and I landed on The Purple Pig. It was a place that he had wanted to try since before we left the west coast to move to Chicago. We came in on a Tuesday night and were seated almost immediately, although not quickly enough to avoid having to shift back and forth to dodge servers and bussers pushing past us with plates. Overall the ambiance is laid back and very unpretentious.  We were lucky enough to score a small two top table rather than squeezing into one of the communal tables. Our server was quick to come and describe the menu and ask if we would like any drinks. We asked for a few minutes to decide, and our server did leave us to check out the drink menu, but it seemed like for every 30 seconds he was gone someone else came and asked what we'd like to drink. Very disruptive for a first time diner. We eventually settled on two signature bourbon cocktails. Both were excellent. Then we moved on to the food. We started with the pork fried almonds which came in a small bowl filled with almonds and whole cloves of roasted garlic. We knew we had picked the right place to eat with one bite. Fantastic. Then came the bone marrow accompanied by toast, a cilantro based salad, and coarse sea salt. We both agreed that although the bone marrow was excellent, the whole cilantro in the salad was a bit overpowering when combined with the other flavors. The fried manchego cheese arrived just as we were finishing up the bone marrow. The cheese itself was melty and delicious, but the breading on the outside seemed like it was not seasoned at all. We both ended up sprinkling some of the salt from the bone marrow on top of the fried cheese which did help a bit. The penultimate dish was the wagyu with bone marrow vinaigrette. It was cooked to the perfect med rare and served with a delicious horseradish. We were not  disappointed. Finally came the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy. I think that the cooks here must be practicing black magic because there is no other way that I can imagine making a pork shoulder that tender. It fell apart at the lightest touch and it seemed almost easier to eat with a spoon. It was seasoned perfectly and the accompanying mashed potatoes added the perfect amount of flavor to the dish. They almost tasted like there was sour cream or cream cheese whipped into them. We devoured the whole thing despite being full before it even hit the table. After we finished our dinner we ordered a half bottle of wine, Alexakis I believe is what it was called, and sipped for a few minutes before we were able to even consider dessert. The wine was one of the best I've ever had, and possibly the first wine I've tried from Crete, Greece. By the time our food had settled we had already decided to share the olive oil soft serve ice cream. It came out drizzled with olive oil and topped with a tiny sprinkling of flake salt. One bite and I was in heaven. It was sweet and strongly flavored with a delicious olive oil. And every crunch of the flake salt was better than the last. We left feeling full and satisfied, although if we make it back I think we would skip on the manchego and the bone marrow. Unless they do something to improve the bone marrow's accompanying salad (perhaps arugula rather than whole cilantro leaves?)"
"Loved this place. If you're a fan of small plates this is a perfect spot on the Magnificent Mile. Recommend the following:1. Fried pig ear, crispy kale with cherry peppers and fried egg: love the crunch with sour component from cherry peppers. The fried egg made it more awesome2. Foie gras smear; MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! Thing was butter. Comes with toast and a type of orange compote/marmalade/jam. 3. Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: everything just fell off of the bone. Just felt like comfort food at a hopping busy Chicago restaurant. If you're a foodie. This is the place for you."
"We stopped by on a whim around 7 on a Saturday night and were told it would be a 2 hour wait. We went somewhere else but returned around 11 because we were dying to try it out. We were seated immediately. Our server was very excellent - he made a few recommendations and explained the menu options. This is a pub style tapas/small plates mainly serving cured meats, cheeses & wines. The wine is price by the glass, quartino, 1/2 bottle & bottle. We ordered the bone marrow smear, blue prawn & sweetbread sausage, & our server recommended 3 cheeses. The food was absolutely incredible - may be the best i have had! We felt very comfortable spending time with our food while the weather wasn't so great. Wonderful! I can't wait to come back!"
"Such a cool place! The food is a bit out there, but delicious!! The roasted bone marrow and just about any of the sandwiches are great to try. Very crowded and a little overwhelming but, worth the trip :)"
"The owners and chefs of The Purple Pig have created a trend in the Chicago restaurant scene that has become a benchmark for urban dining. Do not be afraid to expose your palate to something unique and leave your palate comfort zone behind. Prepare yourself for a gastronomical party of a life time! To eat pork or not to eat pork? That is the question. We came with a group of friends and we started with the following: Catalonian Fuet, Jamon Serrano and Prosciutto di San Daniele. These cured meats were all excellent and bursting with freshness and wonderful flavors. Of course, the idea behind ""The Purple Pig"" is to share with the people that you come with and enjoy the experience. We also ordered their house made veal mortadella sausage with black Kale, fresh chickpeas and preserved Cherry tomatoes, the pork blade steak with 'Nduja and honey, meatball slider with parmesan and arugula (this was my favorite one) and prosciutto crusted cobia with Manila clams and sea beans. All of these were worthy of 4-stars, while the meatball sliders and pork blade steak earned 5-stars.Most dishes at ""The Purple Pig"" are made with pork, however, there are many other non-pork options. The menu is divided into several sections: antipasta, smears, fried items, cured meats and a la plancha. We have been to ""The Purple Pig"" several times, especially this summer. Their menu tends to stay the same with the exception of a few items that are offered during different times of the year (depending upon what time of the year it is in Chicago). This restaurant used to be filled with Chicago locals, but eventually Chicagoans tired of it and have moved on to other restaurants. Now, The Purple Pig is filled with visitors from all over the USA. The only negative is that the menu is way too extensive, but nevertheless, it works for them.If you are visiting from out of town and staying any where in the Loop area or any where close to the Loop, this is a ""must"" for your Foodie Bucket List. I don't understand all the hype about bone marrow -- why not just suck the marrow out of a pork bone or chicken bone -- whatever. Tables are very close together (actually, they are crammed closely together), and it tends to get very loud at the height of lunch and/or dinner time. If you suffer from claustrophobia you may want to skip this place all together! If you want to have a conversation with your friends, learn sign language, because you will not be able to hear each other in this joint. PRO-TIP FOR ALL:  Either come early to beat the busy lunch crowd or come well after 2:30 pm to avoid a long wait. If you plan to come for dinner come a bit before 5:30 pm and join the blue-haired crowd for dinner -- even if it means eating earlier than usual. Otherwise, you will have a long, long wait and may pass out from hunger while you're waiting. Please do not refer to Chicago as ""Chicagoland"" or I will find you and slap you upside the head. It is just plain ""Chicago!"""
"My husband and I decided to eat here for lunch because we didn't want the long dinner wait. We arrived around 11:00 a.m. thinking we'd be the only ones there. Wrong! There was already a wait. In the 17 degree temperature, it was brutal. The doors opened shortly after 11:30 and we were seated. The tables are EXTREMELY close together and you almost feel that you are dining with the people next to you. As a matter of fact, we were all discussing our dishes. The atmosphere is very busy and fast-paced. The menu has so many enticing items, and we were both starving, so we just began ordering dish after dish.  Our server finally stopped us and said, ""Umm, let's just start with those dishes for now."" Because there are always people waiting for tables, I did feel somewhat rushed. Looking back on my meal, I wish we would have taken a little more time to look at the menu, watch some of the dishes coming out of the kitchen, and order maybe two things at a time.In any event, we had a great meal and there were many more items on the menu that I would like to try."
"I have been trying for 3 years to eat at this place.My friends and I finally succeeded this year and made it happen while we were visiting Chi-Town.The place has a ridunkulous wait normally... we were luckily ushered in within 20 minutes. (Previous times they've said anywhere between 90 minutes - 3 hrs).The place is small plates style and meant to be shared. And trust me, you'll want to share because everything looks amazing.My favorite was the bone marrow with its juicy, decadent richness literally oozing off the bone. We also had the calamari which was plump, tender and well flavored. We also shared the foie gras which was very rich and decadent and delicious as well. We also had another big hunk of meat (pork shoulder?) that was tender and the meat just fell off the bone... although our shoulder wasn't as big the shoulder next to us. (We were sitting at a communal table and they got a much bigger portion).They have an extensive drink menu.Would like to go again next time I am in Chi-town... as long as I don't have to wait 3 hours."
"This was my second time visitng Purple Pig. My number one suggestion would be to gather a larger group so you can try as many dishes as possible, yes that is how good this place is.However, I am only giving it 4 stars, because of the bad service during this trip and a couple of dishes that weren't a hit for me.Food:1. Fried Pig Ears and Kale - this is a dish I hadn't tried before, it was really good, especially as an appetizer, but it probably wouldn't be at the top of my list if I went back. (Not a must-have)2. Octopus with fingerling and green beans - This dish was light and refreshing, but I guess when I go to a place that is all about wine and swine, I'm not looking for light. The flavors were all there, but I just did not think the dish was worth the $16 price tag (definitely would skip this one next time)3. Chicken Thigh Kebobs with Smashed Potatoes - I've had this dish before, and it was just as good as I remembered. The crispy skin on the chciken is perfectly cooked. The thighs are tender and juicy and the sauce works perfectly with the chicken and the smahed potatoes, which are perfectly crispy. (Not sure if I would order this one again, only because there is so much more to try)4. Milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - This is probably my favorite dish here. The pork is so tender, and the mashed potatoes and gravy work so well with the dish. Do not skip this one! 5. This is not a point on the dishes I had this trip, but for ones that I had last time and I think are worth trying. The turkey leg confit is really good, but it's really big, maybe too big for two people to try. Also I really liked the fried deviled egg, the pork blade steak, and the bone marrow (we got a double order of it!)I understand that this place is busy, but our waitress definitely put a damper on our meal. She would check on the tables around us and avoid our table like we were the plague or something like that. She only began to feign interest when it was time to give us the bill, to try and secure her tip. It took over 30 minutes from the moment we sat down and ordered our drinks for her to even get our drinks to us, she actually had to send over a manager to give us our wine, after the long wait."
"The Purple Pig was not originally on my itinerary of places to visit in Chicago although 2 of my friends had suggested it.  After chatting with a girl on our shuttle she also suggested we check it out.  Finally another friend posted on my FB that we should check out the Pig.I am so happy we ended up going here as it was easily the best meal we had in Chicago.  We stopped by during lunch on a Friday and it was slammed.  Of course no reservations but we just ended up hanging out at the bar for some wine.   It only took 15 minutes although we were quoted 30 so already things started on a good note.  Small plates are the name of the game here.  Pretty large selection, you can go as adventurous (tripe) or as safe (meatballs) as you want.  We tried a bunch of stuff on the menu, but here are my faves:Milk Braised pork shoulder - HOLY MOTHER OF GOD THIS PORK IS TENDER!!   Soooo succulent and delicious!   I hear Cleopatra bathed in milk, I want to dig up her corpse and chew on her leg now.Bone Marrow - WTF??!! I have had marrow before but never this good.  The cilantro and capers were the perfect complement to this rich, buttery, spread.  I was absolutely tempted to suck on the bones if I wouldn't have looked like a neanderthal.Manila Clams & Merguez Sausage - This dish absolutely electrified the pallate.  The sausage brings a perfect amount of spice and aroma to really bring out the flavor in the clams.  My favorite dish.Sepia - Google this fish and you will absolutely not eat this.  It looks effing disgusting!  However, it tastes similar to octopus or calamari, and this light, citrus dish was the perfect complement to the other super rich and decadent dishes we had.Overall an amazing lunch, will definitely come here again and try some other items."
"Yum! Crowded at lunch time but got seated at the bar right away. Loved all the small plates we ordered...braised pork shoulder, house made gyros, grilled olives w shaved fennel, + a root veg salad."
This place is exactly what this weary traveler was looking for. Good food. Good drinks. Good service. I'm sure I was the nightmare diner bringing in all sorts of people to my table of one (sorry server) but I think I was a decent tipper. The special was amazing...something like a baked runny egg with potatoes and truffles with fried oysters.
"Stop reading and just get your ass to Purple Pig, like NOW.  The food is absolutely RIDIC.  The menu is extensive with so many varieties and the preparation is gourmet, top knotch bam to the 9th power.  The space fills up ridiculously fast so good luck getting in.  I showed up at 11:50am and it was already 80% full.  I would eat at this place til I die.  Oh hell yes."
"This place has over 2,000 reviews for good reason.. you definitely need to try Purple Pig! I came with a party of 5, (Leanne's review is below, here's my take on it) Here's what we had:Pork Neck Bone Gravy and Ricotta cheese on toast: my 2nd favorite! Savory, and full of flavor.. we had to ask for more toast! Salted beets and whipped goat cheese with pistachio vinaigrette: This taste was hard to describe..no one else in my party liked it. I liked how unique it was, plus I've never had beets before.Pig's ear with kale: crunchy texture, you get to mix the egg into the dish.. tasted great, but overshadowed by the other dishes.Roasted Bone Marrow smear on toast: My favorite part of the meal! The marrow was like butter.. so soft and goes so well with the bread..Get the cilantro and a pinch of the kosher salt they provide and you will be in heaven.. I don't usually order anything I can prepare at home.. so this was a treat! We also had to ask for more toast again and we scraped that marrow clean! Pig tail braised in balsamic: Also tasted great, but overshadowed by the others.Milk-braised pork shoulder: it doesn't get any better.. so tender and delicious. You gotta try it! Service here was friendly, the wine selection can be pricy, I honestly would have been happy without the bottle of wine and saved $30. This could make a great date place with the ambience if you sit outside.. inside was too noisy, and it's great for small groups. 5 stars for sure. I'd love to come back!"
ONe of the best meals I have ever had!
"Some of the best moments of my life have happened while eating here. In all honesty, this is the best place I've ever eaten. Every time someone visits I make it a point to take them here, and they consistently agree it's the best food-related experience they've ever had.I would argue that trying to pick which menu items to order is as difficult and important of a decision as they come. You thought naming your child was tough? Try picking only one item out of the shmear section. I will, however, offer a few suggestions:Turkey leg confit- this is everything right about turkey. The agrodolce is the perfect accompaniment and I'm a sucker for those lentils. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale- I mean, it's pigs ear. It's like the best bacon and eggs you've ever had. But it has kale...so it's healthy right?Salt Cured Greek Yoghurt- super interesting dish. Really awesome texture from the pistachio and great summer flavors from the preserves. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder- just shut up and order this one. This brings meat and potatoes to a whole new level and will probably ruin your life it's so good."
"Went there on a Saturday around 11:20am.. There was a pretty short line already (even before they open).. We ordered the bone marrow smear, pig ears & the pork shoulder... Everything was pretty salty and heavy!The bread that came with the bone marrow was so greasy... Needed to wash it down with my beer... The pigs ear wasn't so bad but I'm not sure what the big hype is! The kale chips were initially nice and crispy but got soggy pretty quickly.. and the pork shoulder was salty as well... Am I miss something? The place itself was very cute ... It was packed! I'm glad I tried bone marrow and pigs ears but will not be eating here again..."
"Food was great,  bartender wanted to be anywhere but were he was, or so his attitude seemed."
"Came here for a really early dinner with my brother who was bugging me to try the place.Its a really interesting place, seating is very tight, menu is unique and its pretty trendy.We ordered a bunch of different things I had really never heard of, including the bone marrow and house cured lard spread, which to my surprise were quite tasty. I opted for a more traditional ham Panini as my entrée, which was also very good.The service was great, friendly and knowledgeable server.I really like the tapa style of menu, it allows you to share and try many different dishes.I would definitely go back!"
90 minute wait was WORTH IT! We wondered around and they called us via cellular technology. What a concept! Great area to shop and explore. The waiter conducted the meal for us. We went with most of his suggestions and he liked our choices as well. Sooo tastey! We will seek out this place again for sure.
"We loved this place! Had the fried olives, eggplant Parmesan balls, meatball slider, ribs, and pork shoulder! Everything was sooo good! Loved the meatball slider and eggplant balls! Looking forward to next time! Ps we also ordered the foie gras smear... Not something we would get again"
"Cons:Tourist trapExpensiveLoudNot enough food for the pricePros:Good cheeseThis place has decent food, but we were really disappointed with the amount of food we ordered for the price - and the fact that our waiter was miffed that we only came for drinks and appetizers. We ordered 1 beer, 1 glass of wine, 2 meats, 3 cheeses and olives and the bill with tip was $80. The pancetta was $9 for 5 small pieces. It's completely absurd but a great business model --- get the tourists in for overpriced food after a day of shopping. That's all this place is. We are locals and we are not the target customer for Purple Pig. So, we'll take our $80 and go somewhere else for an actual dinner. So sad :("
"Nothing special.  It has an extensive menu, but I wasn't particularly impressed with the food.  For the wait and the food, I'd say not worth it.  Decent eggplant.  I liked the steak, but not amazing.  eh..."
"My co-worker and I were in town for business and accidentally found this place. Not knowing anything about it, we walked in and were able to get a seat right away. The odd thing was everyone we encountered that worked there asked us if her heard about them from the internet. The staff, was...eh...other wise I would give them 5 stars. Nothing bad, odd vibe that we had never heard of the Purple Pig. The food!!! Was to DIE for!!! We got Chicken Thigh Kabobs, Whipped Feta w/Garlic Toast and Calamari. All of it was amazing and we ate till we couldn't eat anymore."
"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile but kept hesitating because they don't take reservations and I knew from the reviews that the wait would be awhile.  Then a friend visited and we foolishly didn't make dinner reservations anywhere for Saturday night, so I figured what better time to wait for Purple Pig?They had a very nice patio for waiting that had full bar service.  We ended up drinking an entire bottle of Malbec during the 2 hour wait.  I was starting to feel a bit dubious about whether it was worth the wait.Finally time to get to the food.  Between 3 of us for dinner we had:-Proscuitto escarole bread balls-Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta-Scallop spiedinin with chickpea aioli-Wagyu sirloin tip with fingering potatoes-Guinea hen cooked under a brick-Fried brussel sprouts-Cheese selection (waitress picked it out)Dessert (yes we're gluttons, whatever):-Lemon panna cotta-Sicilian IrisFood wise everything had great flavor.  Prices, despite not being listed on the website were extremely reasonable.  Usually, if you have to ask what the prices are, you can't afford it.  Not so here.The standout for me was the jam/olive thing that came with the cheese plate.  I wanted to buy a vat of it to bring home.  I also really enjoyed the fried brussel sprouts and the pork neck gravy.We were hoping to try some of the more exotic dishes like the pig ear (I love pig ear, I'm Chinese!) and the pig tail but they had run out.  I guess we'll have to wait another time :-/The Guinea hen was just chicken basically.  Roasted well and tasted great, but at the end of the day, just chicken.Everything else was cooked perfectly with great flavor.  I would say that Girl & the Goat is superior, but just by a smidge.  Presentation wise Girl & the Goat has them beat though.  If I've learned anything from Next Iron Chef re-runs, it's presentation can be just as important as taste.The dessert dishes were also very solid.  I was intrigued by the Sicilian Iris as it was chocolate chip and ricotta (? I think) stuffed into brioche and fried.  I wasn't sure what fried brioche would taste like, but for me it almost tasted like mochi.  Despite being stuffed, we ate every bite. I would definitely love to come back, but the lack of reservations will mean that I'm not likely to be a frequent repeat customer."
"Salt-Roasted Beets.Pig's Ear.JLT. (LOVED)Roasted Bone Marrow. (Caveman Sized)Octopus. Pretty good, but a lot of food! Oh how I wish we ordered the Pig Platter... Sigh..."
Awesome awesome food....so many flavors in such basic ingredients. It's small though...so not a place for a first date or a fun hater.  I have too many recommendations....so the 1 is secreto pork. Do it!
"The food was absolutely phenomenal, the service was near perfect, atmosphere was flawless; over all one of the top 5 favorite meals in my entire life. Everything we ordered was amazing and every plate that came out was beautifully made. Absolute two thumbs up and a congratulations to the staff there. Highly recommend it to anyone that truly loves food. You will see me back in Chicago to have dinner here again you can count on it."
"I loved this place! It's small but the food is worth the wait.  There is indoor and patio seating.  I had the chorizo stuffed olives, kale and pig ear salad, the octopus and also the corn bread with cheese and honey and it was all amazing! Great for sharing to maximize the food experience. Very reasonably priced."
"I've just been back to the Pig and want to add a few more notes:Brad was a great server.  He is also cute and my friend seriously contemplated leaving her number.  Brad, if you read this, you let me know.  But he's a good server and if he's ever around and it's not a busy night, ask for him.  He was very friendly, and though service wasn't always fast, he consistently acknowledged if something was slow.  Like, ""sorry about that espresso, I haven't forgotten it"" - just makes you feel better to know he remembers.  Also there were a few tiny gnats in our wine - not from the get go, just after an hour of drinking outside - and we were cool about it so later when he brought us new glasses, he gave us very generous pours.  Thanks, Brad!Buffalo mozzarella appetizer with housemade coppa and fresh tomatoes/corn was pretty bomb.  Veg tasted straight from the garden.  Soft cheese and lovely porky coppa.  Served with toasted bread drizzled with olive oil and felt totally authentically Mediterranean.  Next - crispy pigs ear with kale, pickled peppers, and a fried egg.  This is a fantastic dish - the pigs ear is served in crispy little strips that are addictively savory and crunchy.  The pickled peppers are a great acidic foil, and the runny yolk on the egg made it super luxurious.Next - fried deviled egg with arugula salad, which I've had before, and still enjoyed - whatever is in the middle of the egg is very creamy and runny so just be aware of that when you cut it in half.  Finally - sepia with celery, almonds, and fried rosemary.  Sepia is not only a reddish brown color for you to use as a filter on Instagram, it's also a cuttlefish (like squid and octopi).  It has a pleasantly chewy texture and mild flavor.  This dish was pretty big - we couldn't finish all the fish - but I enjoyed the toasted almond taste and the fresh celery leaves - just wish there was more of it!Oh just kidding about the ""finally,"" the real finale was the Nutella panini again.  SO GOOD.  Sticky, messy, and freakin' glorious.  I'm determined to replicate this at home.  My friend got cheesecake and really enjoyed it.  Come get a patio table here while it's still warm!  The inside is cramped and noisy but the patio by the river is a delight."
Superb smoked tenderloin tapas dish - I can't remember when I had a pork dish quite this good.  All dishes were very good.  The stout beer (can't remember the name) was a nice surprise as tasted fresh and as good as any Guinness that I've had lately.
"Fantastic pairings and extremely well-balanced flavors, but the service was disorganized and painfully slow. 16 minutes from seating to having our order taken, 12 minutes from finishing to getting our check, and nobody (aside from water refills) checked on us. All this at 1:15p on a regular Monday.In a word, forgotten."
"My first bad review, after many great visits to this place. Not due to the food, which is great, but the arrogant attitude of the manager Brock Banko who kept my group standing (after almost 2 hours waiting!) while the table was available, just to make a point and prove himself the ""man in charge"". Ridiculous...."
You have to come here if you're in Chicago. That being said the difference between your meal being fantastic and dumpy is entirely contingent upon what you order. Definitely go for the fried pigs ears and taramousalata (not sure if I spelled that right. It's the Greek fish roe spread).
"I've tried to go to the Purple Pig on several occasions over the years during my trips to Chicago, but it's never quite worked; too long of a wait, too little time on my parties' schedules, or too many people in my group. With some downtime to myself, in between the normal lunch and dinner peaks, I figured then was as good as ever of a time to try and grab a seat at the bar and treat myself (it was my half birthday after all!).  Arriving just before 4PM on a Saturday, I had to wait about 15 minutes before a seat at the bar opened up, which I quickly snatched up, eagerly awaiting my meal.My experience from the perspective of the food itself straddled between great and really great, depending on the dish.  I started with the fried brussels sprouts, which were highly addictive and I would immediately order again.  The texture and crunch-level to which they were fried was absolutely perfect.  The next dish, the calamari offered a nice contrast to the sprouts, with a rich palette of flavors in every bite stemming from the calamari itself, along with the radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios; however, compared to each of the other dishes I had, this one did not stand out as much.  Many of the dishes on the menu (at least, in theory, as I only tried four total), have bold, stand-out flavors; while the calamari was certainly not flavorless by any means, it was overshadowed and a bit out of context with my other choices.I had originally ordered the bone marrow, but decided to nix that and not fall victim to my eyes being larger than my stomach.  Due to the frequent mention of the dish in other reviews, I fully intended on having it; however, I must note that this dish seems to have changed recently (it is not even reflected on the website) and is a much larger portion (which comes along with an increase in price).My final dish (until I was easily convinced into a dessert) was the PLT, the Purple Pig's interpretation of a jowl-based BLT.  Given the heavy focus on the use of all parts pig, I wanted to try at least one dish that starred the animal, and ended up here.  In my opinion, the spread (which I cannot remember exactly of what it consisted) slightly overshadowed the star of the show (i.e.; the pork jowl) and threw the balance of the dish slightly.  There were certainly bites were everything meshed quite well, but more often than not I found my taste buds fighting their way through the spread to find the other flavors in the open-faced style sandwich.I never expected to have dessert, but the small amount of room I had from skipping the bone marrow coupled with a recent craving for mousse that stems from who knows where led me to order one last dish.  Don't quote me on certain parts of this description, as I can't seem to verify the exact ingredients anywhere, but this recent addition to the menu features a chocolate mousse atop a hazelnut crust, topped itself with a cherry (if I'm remembering correctly) Sicilian-style granita (or something similar) and a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds.  The dish was a perfect ending to the meal, with my only wish being a slightly larger emphasis on the hazelnut crust.I was fortunate enough to seat myself at the farthest stool at the back of the bar which luckily comes with a perfect view of the action in the kitchen.  Being able to marvel at the chefs working frantically to meet the onslaught of dish requests was worth the price of admission alone, especially for a budding foodie like myself, the food seeming like an added bonus at times.  While I've always envied chefs across the globe, this experience truly made me appreciate their art, while simultaneously realize that I wouldn't survive ten minutes in a professional cooking environment without being hospitalized by a panic attack.A few other brief notes: -The wine selection is quite extensive and the highlight of an otherwise more-than-adequate bar.-The servers and waitstaff are as efficient as the rest of the establishment, which may come off as a bit unfriendly at times, but it is just the pace the restaurant demands; however, they are very helpful with recommendations and knowledgeable about the menu when asked.-The prices were extremely reasonable in my opinion.  Compared to similar restaurants in New York, the prices were lower and the portions larger.I hope I get the opportunity to come back to the Purple Pig next I'm in Chicago and can explore the menu a bit further (hopefully with more people, as more people means more dishes to share).  While I may have been slightly disappointed with some of my personal choices, the food is still quite excellent and worth multiple visits."
"I understand I am in the minority here however, this place is loud, crowded, with lousy service.  It is particularly disappointing when you overhear waiters talking down about customers and bragging about the amount of tips they receive.  This does explain why you feel rushed once you are there.  More turnover, more tips.A perfect tourist trap and I fell in it :)"
We had high expectation for it since it has most reviews online and cannot make reservation. It took us almost 2 hrs wait on a weekend night however the food was a bit disappointing and too oily. I think Girl and the Goat makes better dinner. The only thing I like about this restaurant was turkey leg and I would consider coming in again just for the turkey leg if the wait is not that long.
"Good meal but be prepared for a wait! We came at around 2pm on a Saturday and the wait for two was about 40 minutes. Larger groups were waiting much longer. The nice thing is you can order a drink or bottle of wine while you wait. We have the shaved squashed salad with mizithra cheese, the pork shoulder and the Italian iris for dessert. Of the three things we ordered the pork shoulder was the standout item followed by the salad. I liked their unique wine list and they offer many wines by the glass, third of a bottle, half bottle or full bottle."
Went here while on vacation and absolutely loved it.  I think it was my favorite meal of my trip.  The family ordered a bunch of dishes.  Favorite dish was the pig ears with kale and egg.  Favorite dessert was the peanut butter one.  We didn't really know what kind of cheese to order.  The chef picked them out for us and we were very happy with the selection.  The server was even nice enough to write down the names of the cheeses because we liked them so much.  Fantastic dining experience.
"Loved the Purple Pig!!  I loved the variety of dishes!  They were all awesome.  I'll agree with other reviews -- the communal seating was not ideal.  It was really close quarters!  Having said that, the food was great and I will return when I'm next in Chicago."
"Came for an early lunch when it was raining, and found an open barstool which made me excited. I also saw how the line worked and they were rocking dishes out. The meatball sliders are always delicious.  And I tried the kale and romaine Caesar.  It seems as if they didn't 'rub out' the kale well enough because it was gritty and chewy.  Also they dowsed it with lemon, which overwhelmed the 'Caesar' part of it.  Service rocked as usual.  Wine list is amazing.   Overall not bad. Worth 3.5 stars if you can find a seat."
"The area around the Magnificent Mile is filled with tourist trap restaurants like CPK, the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux, and others, but tucked away right off Michigan on the south side of the shopping strip lies the Purple Pig, a fantastic Mediterranean-themed restaurants that was doing small plates before small plates was the thing to do.   The Purple Pig squeezes a lot into a small space and a one page menu, but for the most part, they do it all pretty damn well.My only complaint is crowd control and pacing - with the tight space and the business of the joint, I've usually found flow here to be a bit of an issue.  Getting a table is the first roadblock - they don't take rezzies and with it's location, wait times can be a bit ridiculous - but hey, if there's a wait, feel free to do a little window shopping (or real shopping) - there's plenty around.  Thankfully, on Sunday around 5pm there was surprisingly no wait, so we sat right down...We started with an A La Plancha dish of veal flank steak, slice into long thin pieces topped with radishes and paired well with a mild cucumber yogurt sauce.  The veal itself was extremely tender, but just a touch overcooked, which I think has to do with how small they slice the flank.  The salad on top had a bit of a sour vinegary taste that overpowered the veal just a bit, and overall, the portion size was a bit small for $18.  A decent dish overall, but missing a few elements.The next dish, however, didn't - a smear of smooth avocado hummus which balances the best of both worlds, sprinkled with some pepper and each slice topped with a pair of cured anchovies that had a meatiness to them that contrasted well with the creaminess of the hummus.  The anchovies were also a bit sour, but gave a nice pop with the crostini and hummus.I remember the first time we got our next dish, crispy chicken thighs, smashed potatoes and tzatziki, a few years ago, on a recommendation from our waitress.  Our thoughts were probably the same you have - ""chicken, really?  But there's milk-braised pork shoulder on the menu!""  But we trusted her, and you should trust me.  This dish is a keeper.  Perfectly seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika, and seared on the plancha, this dish keeps the wonderful tenderness of the chicken thighs but sears the skin to a perfect crisp to create the most wonderful contrast of textures.  The smashed potatoes create a similar contrast of textures with the skin burnt to a near crisp and the meat of the potatoes creating the same effect as the chicken.  Serve that all over a bed a rich tzatziki sauce that has more flavor than the cucumber yogurt sauce.A quick word about pacing - our last dish, an antipasti side of charred broccoli with anchovy vinaigrette, came out last as we were finishing up the chicken thighs - it would have been nicer to have it out earlier in the meal, but this is one of the issues with eating at a small plates restaurant when things come out as they're ready.The dish itself, a mixture of florets and shaved broccoli stalks, was ok.  The anchovy vinaigrette, like a lot of the meal, was just a bit too acidic.  It balanced well with the last little bit of chicken, but on its own, it's a bit strong.For dessert, Sara forced the issue and ordered the Sicilian Iris.  The Sicilian Iris is a fried brioche filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate topped with a healthy amount of powdered sugar that forms a thin glaze on the warm brioche.  The pastry itself has a nice firm shell that reminds me of the beignets at Cafe Du Monde, but while those beignets are unfilled, this pastry is nicely stuffed with a rich ricotta and a mild chocolate sauce.Like places like Avec and the Publican, the Purple Pig has found it's niche as one of the pioneers of the small plates movement in Chicago. It's location and size makes it a little tough to get into, but like I mentioned earlier, there's no dearth of things to do while you wait. It's a great spot for tourists and locals and one that I'll be going back to for (hopefully) years to come.   Pics and more at - eatinginchicago2014.word…"
"Casual dress and loud crowd. High top, communal  tables add to the fun atmosphere. Dropped in to this restaurant after the Wendella Architecture boat tour. It was crowded and were told the wait was 30 minutes but we could grab a seat at the bar which we did. Had the salt roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette, razor clams with oregano, lemon and olive oil. The people next to us had the roasted carrot, avocado, quinoa, citrus salad and they said it was very good. This restaurant is a foodie's delight, small plates encourage sharing and the menu is varied and interesting."
Simply my favorite Restaurant in Chicago!
"Was recommended by several locals, so we came here when it opens for lunch. It is a very popular place! There's already a line before it opens, and once we were seated, the restaurant was pretty much full already. The restaurant is small but with cute decor, the seating are a bit tight, so you can see what your neighbors are eating! :D Which work to first timer's advantage, sometimesWe ordered: the famous bone marrow: The bread was very oily, so overall delicious but oily. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg:  very saltyMilk Braised Pork Shoulder: very tender, fall of the bone (though there's no bone), the mashed potato is really creamy...and 2 more dishes, though I could not remember at this point.We underestimate the tapas! We thought the portion are small--they are very small at first glanced, but in the end we couldn't finish two of the dishes, and unfortunately could not take them togo (traveling woes). I think partly because we do not drink beer, and these tapas are designed to pair with beers/drinks. They are very salty (except the milk braised pork shoulder), so we can only eat a little bit of everything. Food are definitely delicious and live up to it's fame!"
"This restaurant is adverstised as small portions/tapas on this site.  However, if you are thinking this is a tapas place, nothing could be further from the truth.  It is true that some of the portions are small, but each item on the meny (save desserts) is meant to be shared.  Now...ask me about the best part.  The food is wonderful.  Such an amazing combinations of tastes.  I think the best was one of the least expensive tiems on the menu, the cornbread with feta and honey.  I'm not a big cornbread fan, but this was like a good cheese is to apple pie.  The pork rib tips we're sitting on top of a bed of fava salata, which produce a sweetness I could not fully discern (I get the rosemary, but there was something else).  Amazing combo.  We also the foie gras with a compliment jelly which I think was very good, but could have worked better if the foie gras was a pate or a seared foie gras instead of a paste.  The paste and the jelly were too close as cousins consistency wise, but the combination of taste with a sauternes produced the desired result for the pairing.  We each had a dessert which were okay, but somewhat pedestrian to the rest of the meal."
"The feel here is built for a family style table and you'll be close to your friends or strangers. If you're not a fan of a group table, this might be a place to avoid in the winter when the outdoor drinking area is out of commission. The reviews here were mixed, but if you live in Chicago or are visiting, it's worth the hour+ wait. From the large selection of wine by region, to the dramatic food selection, you can't go wrong.  My wife and I went out on a date night and had the eggplant and goat cheese bread appetizer, and shared the chicken thigh entree which was perfectly cooked (we're simple so this was up our alley - potatoes and chicken over a Greek sauce) I may have tried the bone marrow or the octopus if I wasn't feeling more adventurous. Highly recommend!"
This is our favorite place to eat when we are in Chicago. Kids love it also. Jeffrey knows how to make you feel special. I sit at the kitchen counter and watch him work his magic with the staff. No reservations so get there early. I grew up on a farm and pork was never this amazing or variety filled.
Wonderful food!!  The beets and goat cheese with pistachios is amazing. It's almost dessert!  Adam is awesome! You should be so happy to sit in his section.  Highly recommend this place!
"AMAZING! That is the only word to describe The Purple Pig! We've heard that the wait is ridiculous, so we went pretty early on a Saturday evening and only had to wait about 20 minutes. They even take your cell phone number if you decide you want to go walk around while you wait. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and we can't wait to go back and try some more! We ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, eggplant parmesan balls, pig's ear with crispy kale and a fried egg, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, and the chicken thigh kabobs with smashed potatoes and tzatziki! Everything I just mentioned was superb...the only thing I would maybe skip next time is the chorizo stuffed olives. They were good, but nothing special. The pig's ear w/ kale and the milk braised pork shoulder were phenomenal!!!! I crave the pig's ear and can't wait to go back to get some! :) Your tummy will definitely leave happy! :) The only downside is that the place is a bit cramped. We sat outside at a table with two other parties. The food is soooo good, that sitting with others didn't even bother me! ;)"
"They get busy so make sure you have time to wait but I'd definitely say its well worth the wait. Great atmosphere, great service, great drinks and great food! I always recommend The Purple Pig when people are going to be downtown and want to try something different."
"Fantastic.  Incredible food and service, fair prices.  The mussels were some of the best I've ever had.  Great pig ears, mortadella spread and pig heart panini.  Only the calamari was average."
My wife and I have visited Chicago twice in the past couple of years and both times we have gone to the purple pig. I cannot imagine coming to Chicago without going to the purple pig.  My favorites are the crispy pig ears with kale and the roasted cauliflower.  We have done the bone marrow each time too and it's worth trying just to say you've had it.  This place is amazing
Visited twice as tourist. Love the food there especially the bone marrow and pig ear !
"BEST MEAL EVER I cannot say enough good things about my experience at The Purple Pig. I called at around 5 to see if they took reservations (they do not). I wound up arriving at around 6pm and was greeted with a 45 minute wait...understandable. We went and had a drink at a tavern down the street and waited for our call. When we arrived we were shown to a spot at a communal table, but we wanted something more private, and were super lucky to score the last table set for two. We checked out the wine list and took a suggestion from our server...absolutely incredible red wine, and not too expensive either. We ordered the garlic broccoli, bone marrow, milk marinated pork shoulder, and razor clams. All were absolutely to die for. The bone marrow was something I would have to go back for...it tasted like heaven, and I'm not even a huge meat eater!The food was incredible...the service was superb. It was fancy food without all the pretentiousness that comes with similar restaurants.A must try if you're in Chicago!!!!"
"I was happy to bypass the line of people waiting outside for a solo dinner at the communal table.  I had the pigs ear, octopus entree, paired with a very bold, big glass of pinot noir.  Food was excellent.  Service was very very slow, considering it was relatively a slow night.  After a wait of 5-10 minutes,  I had to flag two other waiters for a set of utensils after my food arrived. Felt a big ignored as a solo patron but otherwise pleased with the quality of food."
"Been dying to go to this place forever and finally did. We had the scallops special, short rib, pig ear, and bone marrow. All amazing!! Been to a lot of tapas places and this is definitely one of the best. Huge wine selection. Food came pretty quickly. Service was impeccable. Would definitely come back."
"I love Purple Pig. It's one of my favorite places to come for Happy Hour with friends.  Unfortunately for me, PP is also listed as one of the top restaurants in Chicago on Trip Advisor, and it's on Michigan Ave... so that leads to very long waits and extreme crowds.However, when you can forge through the crowds and deal with the long waits, this place is amazing! Especially in the summer when they have the outdoor patio open.Some of my favorite dishes..Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - A must get here, so tastey, so good, so worth it.BONE MARROW - You HAVE to get it, most of my friends freak out when I tell them we are ordering it, but after they spread it on some bread and sprinkle some salt on it, they are sold!Pig's Tails - AmazingTurkey Leg Confit - VERY BIG PORTION, if you are hungry order this for the table!The menu is very vast, and very carnivore friendly, I haven't had anything from here that I didn't like.  Can't wait for it to get warm again so I can go back here in the spring."
"Top four best restaurants to go in Chicago, Pork Shoulder, Turkey Leg, Pigs Ear, Sicilian Iris with vanilla ice cream or the Panino con Nuttella and ice cream as well.. Awesome!"
"This place is like the Barley Swine of Chicago.  That probably makes sense to very few of you but trust me, it's definitely a good thing.  With a beautiful spot on Michigan Ave near the water, this is a definitely a cool place to be.My group came here for lunch and I was impressed with the long line of people right at opening time but also relieved and happy to get seated immediately.  We ordered entirely too much food but it was all pretty great.  My favorites were the pate, the eggplant parm balls, and the carnival-sized turkey leg confit. One warning: The service was kind of super-duper frustratingly slow for lunch, I'm glad I had absolutely no where to be afterwards."
"Amazing Amazing Amazing! Wow. Highly Impressed. It's like all the top chef's in the world got together and created this excellent menu. As an appetizer, we had the ""Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers and Pistachios."" It was probably one of the best and most flavorful dishes I've ever had. As my entree, I had the ""Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes"" after reading tons of positive reviews and was far from disappointed. It was tender to perfection. Seems to be one of the most popular dishes. I wanted to try everything on the menu! I saw someone next to us having the ""Eggplant Parmesean Balls"" which looked delicious. So why give this place a 4 star and not a 5?  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food and it came at different intervals. I was done with my meal and someone in our group hadn't even gotten their dish yet. Also, someone in our our group ordered the ""Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki"". I tried the chicken and it was drenched in grease and was flavorless. I don't blame them though, this place specializes in 'Swine and Wine' not chicken and personally I don't think people should order chicken at restaurants. That's just me though. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! MUST TRY!"
"Great service, very nice wine selection, and food is delicious. Portions are not very big, but enough to share if you are getting few. We had milk braised pork shoulder, the meat was soft and tender. Pork fried almonds was a great pairing for red wine and glass of beer. We highly recommend this place if you are looking for relaxing atmosphere and great vibe place."
"Catch the show of a lifetime at the very end of the bar. Sit all the way down the bar to your right if you can. Chef Jimmy and the amazing girl at the salad station are a sight to be seen and ARE in plain sight at this open kitchen concept restaurant. I spent my entire meal not only loving the food, but absolutely amazed at the professionalism, cleanliness, wit and calm with which this open kitchen is run.Thank you everyone at The Purple Pig for making this one of the best eating experiences I have had in months."
"Tragically, the Purple Pig was a location that did not live up to the hype. With a seating arrangement that leaves very little room to maneuver, and with waitresses who, due to the restaurant's navigational difficulty, are scarce and hard to find, the Purple Pig is a miss on several marks.First of all, I'm a huge fan of fusion. It can be fun, it can be creative, and it can be memorably delicious. However, fusion is not just about exotic ingredients, but also proper seasoning. In the case of the Purple Pig, the creative use of ingredients is unfortunately ruined by the misapplication of spices and seasoning.Overly salty. Overly sour. And overly one-dimensional.I will, however, give the Purple Pig high marks for presentation. Those dishes looked pretty, and photographed well. However, at the end of the day, taste is king, and so the Purple Pig is an easy pass."
"My second time here and it was even better than the first.  I had the beets w/ pistachios & goat cheese, the shaved brussel sprouts, the deep fried deviled egg w/ arugula & capers, and the sweetbreads w/ fennel & apricot puree.  Everything was fantastic.  The atmosphere is hip, the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality you get (if you stick to the ""small plates,"" anyway), and the care put into each dish is truly first class.I have no idea what Pete C. is talking about below, the service is amazing given how busy they always are, the staff is phenomenal, and I've never felt rushed one bit.My only complaint is that I wish they had a wider beer selection (they've got 6-8 beers on tap and ~10-12  bottles, but all are European, they don't offer any American microbrews).  If you like wine (which I don't) their offerings are vast.Haven't tried dessert either visit (been too full/satisfied after my meals), but their dessert menu looks delicious!Even though it's right on Michigan Ave., I believe it's one of the best that Chicago has to offer."
"I think for the pig ear. If u look for the""pig ear flavor"" I think you going to the wrong place, it's only fired flour thing. And other like pork shoulder and pork and beans things was just like too much spices. It is definitely not worthy long time waiting."
Many fun things to try but not so good if you don't want to try something new. Was pretty crowded and on the loud side. Waiter was very helpful.
"Everything was amazing. Service was top notch. Food was quick and absolutely amazing. We started off with the Foie Gras Smear and the Chorizo Stuffed Olives. Followed by Bone Marrow Salad, Pig Ear Salad, Razor Clams, Chicken Loin with Tzatzki, and finished with espresso and the Sicilian Iris, which is basically brioche bun filled with creamy and melts ricotta cheese mixed with chocolate chips. Best meal I have ever had."
"Woah. This place is out of this world. We knew it would be busy, even on a Wednesday night, and were thrilled when we only had about an hour wait for a party of four. The wait is most definitely worth it here. I know they describe themselves as a Mediterranean tapas place, but I'd add the caveat that it is also distinctly American in the size of the portions they serve. (No complaints, but a good note when you are deciding on quantities of plates to order). Wine list was so huge - thank goodness the servers are able to speak to the varieties and help you choose!Overall, a great experience, and the set up, albeit tiny, allows for great interactions with the strangers you are sitting next to. Loved it."
"This can't be 5 star because of the prices. The food alone probably deseves 5 stars, but the prices are just too high and the sizes too small.The idea of tapas is to be able to enjoy a number of small plates, but what happens at Purple Pig (and all to many other tapas places) is that they shrink the plates but then don't shrink the prices so you end up paying just as much for noticeably less food. Tapas has almost become similar to an overpriced fad within the restaurant industry. That being said, the food is superb. Had the milk braised pork shoulder, sepia, and porchetta panini. The pork shoulder was very tender, phenomenal flavor and there was a bit of a sweet sauce on top that was superb. Highly recommend. The sepia was very good and had an interesting flavor that I could never quite pinpoint. But the dish was fairly oily and the other accompanying bits of nuts and vegetables didn't offer much. Good dish, but the worst of the three.Lastly was the porchetta panini. This was superb, the salsa verde on top was the perfect complement to the rest of the sandwich. Not quite as good as the pork shoulder but the panini was the most food and it was the cheapest. Overall, I'd definitely go back, but not for a casual lunch or random happy hour."
"Loved the ambiance, felt neutral about the food. From the moment you walk across their balcony terrace up until you reach the door and step inside, you get the same consistent bustling, energetic vibe of the servers and the patrons. I ordered two unique dishes that I had heard a lot about, to go. I got the bone marrow spread appetizer and the pig ears and kale. The bone marrow itself wasn't very flavored, but still tasted good. The also came with generous slices of garlic bread to spread on top of. It definitely go extremely messy and the marrow didn't spread too easily. Ended up with very drippy greasy fingers.the pig ears were so fried that it diluted the actual taste and texture of the wars. I felt like I was just eating crunchy chips. But the kale chips were done very well.Overall, decent food. Just a little too greasy and oily for me."
"Solid tapas affair though I thought several of the dishes were a touch too decadent. The bone marrow and burrata are definitely worth getting but the star of the meal was undoubtedly the Sicilian Iris (fried brioche filled with ooey gooey ricotta and chocolate). That said, if you're an out of towner planning on doing a food tour of Chicago, definitely make sure you hit this place up before Girl and the Goat or Alinea."
"If you want a free show, come by yourself or with a friend and try to get counter seat #2 or #3. These are probably the best seats in the house - you get to watch the chefs cook. It's such a show because they're so busy but so precise.Calamari salad: so refreshing, especially on a hot, summer evening in Chicago. Just simple yet amazing. Hit the spot. Milk-braised pork shoulder: just divine - so tender. Beautiful combination with mashed potatoes and gravy. Hit my other spot.Very good wine list, though I don't get why a ""half bottle"" is more expensive than ordering two separate glasses."
"Love everything about it but it is not for everyone. Unlike the Tardis, it's a lot smaller on the inside especially for a Chicago restaurant.   The food selection is so different than anywhere else you may go. Here you are forced to try something you may not also pick but take the chance you will love it."
"AMAZING FOOD!!!! My mouth still waters thinking about the charred califlower!!!! It's worth the wait! The staff was attentive. It started raining when a girlfriend and I went and we were seated outside, but thankfully they had traps, they put over. So, we were able to remain seated outside. Be warned, there an 1 1/2-2 hour wait on weekends, but worth it!"
The best spot for wine and tapas! The wine list is very extensive but the waiters are very knowledgeable. The menu is eccentric and has a lot of options to chose from. A great spot for a date. The fried Brussel sprouts are a must have!
"I tried to come here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, but when we visited at a 7 pm on a Saturday night the wait was 2 hours and 45 minutes long! Too long.  This past weekend, we cleared our schedules and prepared to wait. We put our names on the list around 6 pm and were told the wait was 45 minutes.  We only ended up waiting 30 minutes instead! Way to set the bar low and then overdeliver :).  When we were on our way back in, however, I overheard the hostess tell people that the wait was 2 hours again.  So. Come early unless you feel like waiting until 9 or 10 to eat dinner.Onto the food. Just wow. My boyfriend and I got the octopus, the bone marrow, the milk-braised pork shoulder and the turkey leg (a very protein-heavy meal, yes, this is what happens when you allow your carnivorous boyfriend to pick all the dishes. no regrets though). Everything was amazing.  The octopus was so unique-- I'd never had octopus cooked like this before! The meat was cooked so perfectly- chewy without being springy and tough. It was lightly flavored with what I'm guessing is butter and lemon... damn. And it was light-- perfect that it came out as our first dish!  The bone marrow came next. This one is more fun than anything-- you get a plate with three huge bones on it, with a gelatinous, fatty looking paste in the center of each (for those like me who have never had it before!).  It comes with some grilled bread, a little dish of salt and a mixture of parsley, capers and other spices to put on top. We spread the bone marrow onto the bread like butter (except there is so much bone marrow that we slathered it on) and then sprinkled salt and spices on top.  Tastes good.  I would definitely recommend ordering it to have a fun new food experience, but I don't think I would get it again-- there are better things to be eaten at the Purple Pig! Next was the milk-braised pork shoulder; it's so tender that they serve it with a spoon! The mashed potatoes that come with it is more like a creamy soup that covers the bottom of the dish.  Next was the real star of the show: the turkey leg. Who even knew that turkey's were that humongous? The leg was gigantic... there was so much meat! It was fall-of-the-bone tender and was served with an amazing tangy sauce and vegetables.  If only Thanksgiving turkeys tasted like this.  My boyfriend told me at the end of the meal that this was his favorite restaurant we've been to so far in Chicago. We go out to eat all the time, so this is a huge statement.  After the entrees we had a peanut butter semifreddo and a fried brioche roll with ricotta and nutella in the middle.  It was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  A Chicago must-try!"
"Walked in here by chance while staying at The James down the street.  What an incredible little place.  Excellent food and wine.  We tried as much as we could.  Only drawback is the accommodations, you are kind of packed like sardines at the table tops.  My wifes Birkin has been given its own seat at the best restaurants across the world, not at the Purple Pig...hold it in your lap so they can squeeze another person next to you.  I will forgive them the insult because the food was good enough for me to give it a very rare 5 stars."
"I loved it here! We were in Chicago for my birthday and didn't have enough  stomach and time to enjoy all the food available so we had to narrow down our choices. On my birthday we went to Randolph street where you find pretentious restaurants with long wait times too!!! This was way better at the way they handled a wait time. They call you when your table is ready and they serve you wine if your willing to just wait outside! Umm that's catering to the amount of people that want to see you. We had flavorful food, much better than what we had on Randolph street. The sauces actually flavored and covered the food and as my husband said it was balanced. After you were done eating a plate you didn't have to wash down your palette because the flavors lingered too long or over bearing. There were so many options in the menu for having small dishes. We actually had some non pork options on the menu that was packed with flavor, like the octopus. Seriously have what sounds good and I'm sure you will be pleased."
"Tip: Trying the famous bone marrow for appetizer. MUST. TRY. You wont regret. Buttery texture, taste like bacon and perfect spread for the bread. I had this place on my bookmarks. On our second evening in Chicago, we were unsure where to go for dinner. I mentioned this place to my boyfriend, I wasn't sure if he would like it. He was willing to try this place and we both decided to have dinner here and again it's very close to our hotel.I ordered the bone marrow which we both really liked. The cured tongue was definitely something for me, my man is brave enough to try it. I didn't like it that much, not 'cause it's a tongue, It's just too sour. I also had the octopus, mediocre for my liking. My man ordered beets with goat cheese, I don't like beets but this one was really good. He also ordered the sausage stuffed olives and the pork blade chops, we both liked it. I guess I made poor choices and he did better. lolAlthough this place was packed, we were seated almost immediately and our orders taken right away. Food came in fairly on time too!"
"Honestly, I was expecting a lot better. I felt very underwhelmed. I got all the items that people recommended based on Yelp reviews and the waiter's recommendations. I got the pig ears, bone marrow (too fatty), and fried brussel sprouts. The food was more greasy and heavy, which I feel took away from the quality. Also, it was a 2.5 hour wait, which kind of worked out because we were just able to eat first dinner at another restaurant closeby. Overall, I would not return here."
I have always enjoyed dining in here. I even do take out. I love the chicken kabobs and the milk braised pork shoulder with the compressed apple pecan with pomegranate molasses salad. Aw let me not forget the Turkey leg and smashed potatoes. I can go on and on. The host are very nice and helpful when it come to suggestions. Let me be real some foods I'm not comfortable eating but there is always an alternative. I've never had a compliant.
"I went there on a July 4th weekend so the waiting line was long.  The good thing about it is that the staff will give you a call if your table is ready.We were not sure what to order but the very helpful waiter explained the menu to us very well.  We ordered Pig's Ears and Milk Braised Pork with Mashed Potato.The Pig's Ears didn't taste like pig's ears at all.  Coming from a country where eating pig's ears is normal, I really like how they put a twist into this dish and make it not revolting to other people.  This is a perfect appetizer.The Milked Braised Pork with Mashed Potato was also very good.  The meat was tender and the sauce was creamy.  The mashed potato's quantity was small and if it would have been bigger, the pork would;ve been complemented very well.The star of our meal though was the dessert.  The Lemon Panna Cotta was heavenly that I actually wanted to order more."
"For someone who never ever tries new food. I loved it. Especially, the fried octopus. That is a must try along with the fried goat cheese! Also, he staff is suspect friendly and right on point. So if you want to try something new, like Mediterranean food, this is def the place to go."
Let the waiter chose our wine and food selections.. All was amazing! I will definitely go back soon!
"Amazing! Great place for small plates or tapas. Favorite dish was the scallops & chickpeas allioli. Also, they have an outstanding wine selection. Don't miss the Rebeiro (only one in the wine menu) or a red Rioja (Seis) from a small vineyard in Alava near Elciego; both were truly fantastic and very reasonably priced. When in Chicago, a stop at the Purple Pig is a must."
"It's my first time in Chicago and this restaurant is one of the best ice ever been to. Great food, great service and great atmosphere!! I highly recommend it. The location is also pretty amazing. Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. Highly recommend it."
"I really wanted to like, even love, this place because of the reviews and its nearby location.  Unfortunately, I found the experience mixed.Firstly, there is a consistently long wait.  No reservations are taken and the wait for our party of 2 was 45 minutes - 1 hr.  You can walk around and they will call you when your table is ready, but it is still a long wait compared to area restaurants.Secondly, the service.  This place is very busy.  Purple Pig uses family style seating placing several parties on the same large tables.  This causes the restaurant to have even more people and be even more busy than a typical layout.  The result is a very busy, almost chaotic dining experience.  Expect at least a 3 person wait at the bathrooms.  Additionally, with the many diners, the servers a rushing table to table and seem to not have the time to properly serve you. When I asked for a recommendation for an appetizer, the server at my table responded ""depends what your in the mood for"" and then offered no other suggestions besides the pork shoulder.  We saw the water refiling person more than our actual server.  And the water refiller was more polit too.Finally, the food.  It is flavorful no doubt, but very very SALTY.  We ordered the pork shoulder, scallops, broccoli, and stuffed peppers.  Most restaurants are able to balance the strong flavors and saltiness of their foods with a blander base (such as bread, mashed potato, rice, pasta).  However this place does not offer such balance.  Each dish was way oversalted.  We had the soft serve ice cream for dessert and it was nothing special.Overall, a decent place, not fantastic."
"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the two+ hours we spent here. We wanted something nice, but also casual and tasty. We couldn't have picked a better place. Bowled up just before high noon on Saturday. Very busy, but managed to get a seat at one of the shared large tables. The place isn't very spacious and did feel a bit cramped, but all adds to the atmosphere I guess. Wasn't overly impressed with the decor, but that's just me being picky.The draw was the fact that Fois Gras was on the menu! A personal favourite of ours. Although the waiter explained it was of the pate variety, it really did pass for close to the the real thing. Something was added to it that I wasn't overly keen on, but it was good enough for us to order a second helping as soon as it had been polished off.I was disappointed with a poor wine recommendation (rose wine really doesn't come from Greece) But moving along, another draw was the fine charcuterie on offer which was paired with an amazing cheese board. I really must stress at the quality of both of the boards, the meat and cheese were truly some of the best I've sampled. After ordering a proper bottle of rose, we ordered another round of meats and cheese. Thinking about it now, I can't recall at the moment when I've had better meats and cheese. We like meats and cheese if you hadn't picked up what I'm laying down. Pretty pricy bill $200+ if I remember, but I really wasn't complaining. Really good food!The bone marrow that everyone has mentioned is a full on dinosaur bone, ala Flintstone style.Would I go back? 100% Do I wish we had something like this in Phoenix? I would probably walk there if there was. Phoenix is huge and hot as hell, so that says an awful lot in my books.Well done to the Purple Pig."
"Only my second time here, but it is one of my favorites.  Obviously Chicago is a great city for foodies and this restaurant is a prime example why. The wine selection is outstanding and then there is the menu. The fried stuffed olives are such a treat!  The salt roasted beers with whipped goat cheese!!  Finally, crispy kale with pig ears, with cherry peppers."
"This place is seriously amazing!! Cheese, swine and wine is the motto here and I have to say that all three were truly amazing. We started with the prosciutto di parma and a cremon cheese. This went great with the Spanish Chardonnay that our waitress recommended. The scallops were delish, as well as the carrot salad that was topped with sesame seeds and toasted quinoa. I wasn't in the mood for bone marrow so instead got the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta cheese spread. Although I didn't like this as much, it had a good flavor and was definitely a unique dish. If you're from out of town like me, go early to avoid the crowds! We were seated immediately without reservation around 5pm but when we left around 7pm there were at least 20 people waiting outside. This restaurant is a perfect stop along magnificent mile and the Chicago river. I can't wait until my next Chicago trip so I can come to this restaurant again!"
"I work blocks away and had been wanting to trying the place out for months but the wait is always SO FREAKING LONG! So we came here for lunch, just after they opened and they were already starting to run out of tables.Bone marrow smear -- so famous right? But it didn't taste like pork at all, like slightly herb-y oil... disappointing. My mom makes tastier marrow. The JLT and milk braised pork shoulder, however, were really good. Sumptuous, even. The dishes look kinda small but they're so rich we were stuffed sharing these 3 for a quick lunch. We'd definitely come back to try some more porky goodness!"
"I can only assume this place isn't at 5 stars due to the price or meat heavy selection or the wait or possibly the 90s hip-hop, because the food is an easy 5 star rating...and trust me on this, I had most of the menu.Keep in mind these are all small plates to be shared.For the non meat the beets with goat cheese and squash were way better than I could have ever imagined....I'm not sure I'm really even a fan of beets in normal life but this should be on your table.The chicken kebabs and turkey leg were probably the two most flavorful items on the menu but I don't think you could go wrong with anything.For me, the wine selection was perfect and they had some good beer selections as well. And although it is in the Gold Coast, it's not really a fancy, get all dressed up kind of place which is always a plus."
"I loooove the Purple Pig.We went there for lunch and were somehow blessed with the chance to sit at the chef's counter :o  INCREDIBLE. It was a million times better than having an actual table here because we were able to watch the action and see ALL the cooking happening! The particular part of the chef's table that we were located at allowed us to see every single dish that was coming out! It was a cool way for us to decide what we wanted to order, what with being able to see what every menu item looked like and how it was prepared.I ended up ordering the octopus with fingerlings potatoes and green beans and that had such a good flavor to it and was very fresh. My only complaint is that the portion size was VERY small for the $16 they charge you for it and it didn't exactly fill me up. Chef's counter or not, the ambience of Purple Pig rocks in general. You definitely feel like you are on Mich Ave - very hip vibe to the place. It was soooo packed when we got there, but we were in and out in less than an hour (for 2 people mind you). It was an efficient meal - though we didn't feel rushed at all.Overall, very good food. small portions. and a tad $$$"
"We literally stumbled into this place as a last-ditch attempt to find ANY place to eat after a late flight into Chicago, but let me tell you, that moment of happenstance turned out to be one of the most enjoyable dining experiences we had that weekend.It was (expectedly) packed on a Friday night, but they found our party a spot at the counter by the chef so we could see everyone in action.  Our mouths could NOT STOP WATERING as we watched dish by dish pass in front of us, but yet never to stop and find their way onto our plates.So what to order? More like what NOT to order - it was ALL good.  Highlights for me were the pig's ear with crispy kale (watch out, Battersby!), milk braised pork shoulder, and octopus.  We had a pile of other food as well (including antipasti), and I don't think there was a single dish that did not elicit a heartfelt sigh of content with the first bite.Sitting where we were, we also had a chance to meet and chat with Jimmy Bannos Jr.  It's always such a pleasure to meet the chef in person, especially when you see how excited and passionate they are about their craft, and how that translates into just absolute deliciousness on the plate.A great spot that we are very happy that we unexpectedly stumbled upon.  We'll be back!"
"TOP NOTCH. My girlfriend and I went on a Monday night at 9pm and it was jammed (great sign). We sat right in front of the cook line, which at first seemed like a bad spot but the further into our meal, the more we loved it. It felt like we were previewing a cooking show.Whipped Feta and Cucumber = HEAVENDrinks were reasonably pricedWaitress was a bit slow but the atmosphere more than made up for itWell worth the visit...all of the food was so well prepared"
"We stopped in for a late lunch on a Monday. Our server, Adam, was very friendly and attentive. The place was busy but not packed and they were filming for Road Trip with G Garvin, so that was kind of cool. We ordered the feta and mizythra corn bread (I'm going to try this at home, the flavors come together really well), fried deviled egg (egg was amazing but the arugula and capers were delish too), a cheese plate with three pasteurized cheeses (yes, they identify them, which is great if you're dining with a pregnant wife!), chorizo stuffed olives (with an amazing white sauce) and the chicken kebabs (these came with wonderful fried potato slices and fresh tzatziki sauce). We finished the meal with the Sicilian Iris, which is a pastry stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips - it was phenomenal. Overall, a great value in terms of the quality of food and location of the restaurant (right off Michigan Ave). I will definitely be back."
"Came here on my first time to Chicago a couple months ago. As usual, yelp is my go-to when it comes to finding great food places and I was not let down! Wondered into this place at 10pm at night for a late dinner with my coworkers. Luckily it wasn't packed since it was late and a weeknight. We ordered the bone marrow, foie gras (since it's BANNED in California -__-), and the turkey leg. Also shared a salad and ordered a bunch of wine. The food was really good! The turkey leg is apparently really popular and it was really moist. If you're Filipino or if you've had chicken adobo, it kinda reminded me of that! The food is served tapas style, so order a lot of food and try everything. It's definitely a great place to share with a group of friends!The ambiance is really hipster ish. It was like classy and romantic on the inside yet they were blasting 80s rap. The music was dope but played WAY too loud."
"Amazing food and good service; keep an eye on the bar to avoid long wait times.Had the cauliflower, pig's ear and iris desert all of which were truly delicious."
"This is the single worst dining experience my wife and I ever had. To start off, we went there without a reservation. The waitress told us the waiting time is 45 minutes and she would call us when it's our turn. No big deal, we can wait. However, after wandering on the Michigan street for 50 minutes, we went back and found out that the waitress simply skipped us and didn't even bother to give us a call. This was only the start. The food is mediocre at best. We had a raw asparagus salad which was just okay. The bone marrow was extremely greasy and the fried pig ear was extremely salty. We simply can't take the way things are cooked here. The food made my wife very uncomfortable later that night. On the service side, our waitress was okay, checked us once or twice during the time period. However, there wasn't even any one filling my glass when I drank all the water (I had to because of the super salty pig ear ). Not to mention that it was very laud inside the restaurant to an uncomfortable extent. These things further exacerbated our dining experience. We had a high expectation before going here. It's just sad that things turned out to be like this."
"This place has an amazing menu and even more amazing food.  We stayed downtown around the corner from this place and by the line out the door and yelp scores, knew we had to give this place a shot.  We had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta.  These are a must, with the pork neck being my favorite.  The portions were definitely larger than we had expected and we couldn't eat much more, especially with a flight in a couple hours.  If you get a chance to eat a the PP, you won't regret it.  Absolutely delicious!"
"Seriously F-ing Awesome!!! No wonder there is always such a long wait, and let me tell you it is way worth it. Purple pig is even amazing if you eat pescatarian! We stuck to all veggies and fish and everything we got was outstanding. I found it similar to Girl & the Goat.Great wine selection. We chose a Chianti Classico. We started with the fried brussel sprouts. They were lemon-y and had a delicious crispness to it. Then we had the goat cheese shmear with eggplant caponata. That was out of this world and a ton of food for one dish. Next we got the cauliflower and butternut squash. Both dishes were so flavorful. From the large plate section we got the scallops and octopus. The octopus was one of the best dishes I have had! The meat was cooked so perfectly it was tender and not too chewy. The scallops also....amazing!I would reccomend coming in a group of 3 as the toast comes with 6 pieces and scallops came with 3. Enough for everyone to get one serving plus a little extra of the other dishesI also MUST add that 1) they have chairs for people waiting (awesome) 2) they play INCREDIBLE music!!! the postal service, welcome to miami, passion pit, such an eclectic, funny mix--we really enjoyed it! I can not wait to come back here!!!"
"Sunday night in summer meant it was busy but the 30 minutes were told reached around 20 minutes when Amber called and told us to come in. The menu was a bit daunting, but our waitress patiently explained it all and helped ensure we didn't over order. We had the deviled egg and arugula and the whipped feta with toast as starters. Simple stuff, beautifully presented and delicious. For main courses we chose the gyro which is pita and taziki. Absolutely delicious. Out other main dish was the pineapple glazed pork ribs. This came on the bone and was very good, but maybe a little more animal fat that in would like. I am not in the least afraid of animal fats, but all things in moderation. I saw various meats on the bone and marrow dishes. They all looked fine. We had a soft serve salted caramel ice cream. This was very nice with pieces of caramel in it. However the presentation would pique the interest of the scatalogical. I am trying to be delicate. The coffee came in an illy cup and was very good. Next time I am in the Windy City I'd go back and try a few more things. Nice to see a restaurant try to be a bit different."
"The rave reviews are no joke.  Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was fantastic!  They require your entire party to be there before they seat you, but the hostess was super sweet about it considering we had to push our seating time back 45 minutes!  We ordered 6 dishes, 1 bottle of wine, and 1 dessert for 5 people and it came out to only $120..for reals!!  This was the best value dinner I've probably ever had.  The food is amazing and unique, good ambiance, good service, and you really can't beat the price tag for this quality! Beets & goat cheese thing:  Had to get it because of the yelp reviews, but it was aightNeck bone gravy: Delicious!  With that bread...o m gPig's ear with kale: So good!! Get this dish!!!  It's a great way to balance out all the other pork dishes...it's crispy perfection!Bone marrow: Amazing!!  With the herbs and the salt and the bread...just perfect!Pig tail in balsamic sauce: GET THIS DISH!!!! This was probably my fave.  So tender and flavorful!Braised pork shoulder: Fall of the bone goodness!!  With that sauce and the creamy potatoes..mmm mmm goood!!!I am now depressed after writing this review because Chicago and the Purple Pig is so far away!"
"Great wine and small plates of delicious food...  What's not to love?  This has been a go to place when entertaining out of town guests.  The location makes for a nice break in marathon Michigan Avenue shopping/browsing/site-seeing.Service is friendly and fast.  It's very cozy seating, so if you require space this isn't the place for you.I will definitely return with or without visitors!"
"Bone marrow, turkey leg confit and milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes. Yup, probably the most amount of meat I've had in one sitting. You will notice a lot of their dishes were inspired by an Italian, Mediterranean, and New Orleans flare which could be attributed to the chefs. Urban dining at it's best!All the dishes are meant to be shared so beware! They have a large communal table with high bar stools for larger parties. The space is kind of tight as I felt the frequent bump from employees and patrons trying to get to and from the kitchen. The bone marrow was very rich. We got 4 bones and luckily, there were 4 of us so we each got one. The turkey leg was cooked to perfection where the meat easily fell off the bone as we cut it it with the knife. All the flavors from the lentils, treviso, endive and agro dolce blended together nicely with a hit of sweetness. Without a doubt, the winning dish was the milk braised pork shoulder. It was almost like eating butter that melted in your mouth. I was a bit apprehensive. Pork braised in milk overnight? Is that sanitary? The creamy sauce gave the pork a curry-esque feel to it. Everything just melts in your mouth. It was amazing. My advice is to come right when they open to avoid a massive wait."
"I can definitely recommend this place. The food was just amazing, totally blown away by it. Doesn't matter what you pick, it's all really tasty. Every bite is like a rollercoaster of flavors."
"Amazing brunch/lunch for six on the Fourth of July.  We waited at the front gate for 15 minutes before they opened and there was a line of about 40 people behind us by 11:30am, so be prepared to wait to sit (even though we didn't have to once the gates opened).  I'm not going to get into everything because I'm sure the other five star reviews cover service and decor and how they are top notch.  Here is what food we got and what I highly recommend:Pig's Ear -Crispy little pig ear fries with a sunny-side up egg on top.  Great start to the meal.Quail -Interesting dish, but it certainly wasn't near the top of my list.Ricotta and Pork Neck Gravy -My favorite dish.  Mouth watering tomato gravy served with crostinis to use as the vessel. Turkey Leg -Huge, fall-off-the-bone portion.  My second favorite dish.Scallops -We were skeptical since we were not near an ocean.  No need to be skeptical.  Some of the best scallops I have ever had (just behind Aqua at OBX).Fried Manchego Cheese -Wow.  Served with honey garnish.  Wouldn't change a thing about it.Milk Pork Shoulder - Tender and delicious; PP's signature dishPig Jowl - Not great, very fatty, but the bites with meat were tasty)Cheese and Cured Meat Platter - Excellent end to the meal with about 10 cured meats and 5 cheeses.Probably the best lunch I have ever experienced.  Highly recommend to anyone who loves pork and is willing to try new foods and preparations!"
"This place is delicious! We ordered a ton, and didn't pay as much as we had expected to for all that we ordered. Definitely try the milk braised pork shoulder, the grilled octopus, and the sweetbreads. Also, there are several options for bottles of wine under 40 bucks, which makes me a very happy eater!"
Got here before six on a Monday night and it was already hopping. Totally packed. Great atmosphere. Very nice staff especially the bartender. The chorizo olives were to die for. Pork shoulder great. Beets and feta amazing. Would love to go back and try more.
"Ate here twice while visiting Chicago and would definitely return.Really enjoyed the following dishes:1) Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. So tender and flavourful! The meat comes apart with a spoon. I could eat this over and over again. 2) Chicken thigh kebabs with potatoes and tzatziki. I know this is a pig restaurant but I love chicken and tzatziki and this dish did not disappoint! The skin was crispy and amazing. 3) Bone marrow. This was my first time trying bone marrow and loved it. The herb mix and the sea salt go great together. Other dishes that I tried which I would skip:1) Pigs ear. The pickled vegetables were overpowering and the fried egg really did not do anything to make the dish better. 2) Some beef tendon fried dish which I cannot find on the menu online. It reminded me of asian shrimp chips except much more crispy and vinegar-y tasting. In general, the atmosphere was pretty relaxing - we did eat outside for our visits though. The servers (not the waiters) were great, very attentive, and constantly refilled our glasses. We had a great waiter on our first visit. On our second visit, our waiter forgot about us and we had to flag down the servers to fetch our waiter so we could order."
"If the Girl & the Goat was my favorite Chicago place, this was a seriously close second.   I was intrigued by their menu of more exotic foods.  Not crazy exotic - just stuff you can't get most places.  Holy crowded though.   There were people piled up outside, people waiting to be piled up outside, full at the bar, and full tables that were pretty close together.   I managed to snag a seat at the bar, but it was a tight fit for sure.   The food is fantastic though.  After much deliberation, I chose the ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg.  So flavorful and perfect melt in your mouth texture on the pork.  I followed that with the bread pudding and a misguided addition of soft serve (the bartender's recommendation for a side of ice cream).   The bread pudding was great.  The caramel and bacon soft serve was great.  Together...they were not so great.  That said, I would totally eat my way through this entire menu one dish at a time.  The food was that good.  Why it got four stars instead of five: - They are trying to make the most of the space, I get it.  But making aisles so narrow that people can't walk past without bumping you is bad form.  - I was a little annoyed that while I clearly wanted a dessert and a small scoop of ice cream with it, I somehow ended up with two full desserts that didn't really go together.  - Two unisex single bathrooms.  Two.   For like a zillion people.  I waited 20 minutes to pee.   Part of that was probably that one of them was occupied by a couple who were doing who knows what in there.  ;-)  But still."
"I don't think I've ever waited as long to eat anywhere as I did here, almost two hours. People who say they were able to get a table right away are liars. Or lucky. Probably lucky. Although some items we ordered were definitely better than others, I can certainly appreciate that this restaurant goes out of its way to create unique dishes such as pigs ear and bone marrow. My favourite was the octopus with green beans as both were grilled to perfection. The service was also a stand out in my books as the servers are very casual but still professional and helpful. Come early to put your name down and shop the Magnificent Mile while you wait. They can also give you a call when your table is nearly ready."
"Very fun place!  Went to Chi-town for my birthday, and this was recommended by the hotel concierge.  I'm a moderate food adventurer, and The Purple Pig offered no shortage of options without any feeling of regrettable commitment. We had the roasted beets with pistachios and goat cheese (very good!) and the octopus with fingerling potatoes and green beans (AWESOME!), in addition to two other plates.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of how crowded it was on that day.  there was some definite confusion on the part of the hosts/servers on that night.  The tables are very cramped together (to encourage the communal dining experience), but we sat on a wall, and the couple next to us were less than outgoing.  Note: as soon as they left, the next tenants became the conduits of conversation for half of the tables on the wall.  We immediately wised we had shown up a half hour later.Visit the Purple Pig! Don't expect to find anything common of the menu.  Even if you do, branch out and try something different.  The changes regularly, from what I hear, and the cooks there somehow handle every bit of it masterfully and quickly.  Take a large group of friends, or have a few glasses of wine and make some new ones.  The more dishes you can try, the more you will be impressed with this place.  Attention Pig Ownership:  You need to come to Indianapolis!!!  This concept would explode down here!"
"Always a long wait, but the food is always solid. My favorite are the pork neck bone rillette and the beets"
"I have to admit, I was really excited about Purple Pig after hearing about it. I was really drawn to the concept and I had heard rave reviews on the food. We lined up early, maybe 15 or 20 minutes before they opened, and got seated right away. Service was a bit slow, but nothing to dock a star over. The food was a tad underwhelming personally. The bone marrow is extremely inconsistent. Our table and the one next to us ordered the bone marrow, however our order was short an entire bone. We asked our server and she explained that we had one extra large bone while the other table had smaller ones. This would have been okay in my book if the one extra large bone that we received had an extra large serving of bone marrow to go along with it. The largest bone ended up having the least amount of marrow! Maybe we got an anemic pig? The marrow wasn't bad, but nor was it great. I think most people enjoy it for the novelty of it more than how the dish actually tastes. Coming from an Asian background, the novelty of bone marrow is lost on me. Cauliflower was well done and a nice change of pace from the somewhat oily bone marrow. The milk braised pork shoulder was the highlight of the meal. Very tender pork, cooked in a rich creamy sauce that leaves you wanting more. Given that most people seem to be in consensus that the pork shoulder is very good, I'll chalk our somewhat over salted piece to inconsistency. Great concept restaurant and serves as a ""big name""  restaurant for out of towners. Worth checking out if the wait is not egregious. 3-3.5 stars for me."
"I've been to Chicago a handful of times and even though there is a lot of great eating to be done there, The Purple Pig is the only joint I have returned to religiously every single trip.If you are easily swooned by esoteric selections, you'll love this place. Fried pig ears, absolutely succulent and sexy bone marrow, beef tendon chips... yay! It is a sharing/tapas style menu so you can sample a few items and the more friends you go with the wider the selection of pickings you can grope at. This place is generally pretty cool. Cool music. Cool staff. Decent wine and beer selection. Outdoor seating even in the winer with glowing heater lamps. My only suggestion would be to update/renovate the interior to match the cool vibe; community seating is enough hip-up the place. Just an opinion; I'm sure if they touch nothing they will continue to do very well.Caution: try to make a reservation on any weekend and holidays. The wait time can be up to 2 hours on a good Friday night."
Great good but there is always a long wait to be prepared.
"Following in the foot steps of Rachel A., I dined here alone and how convenient that Purple Pig was a block from my hotel. The great thing about being a party of one was being seated in less than 10 minutes.. the bad thing was being limited to ordering only enough for one belly. I tried to strategically order things that wouldn't weigh me down which meant no bread, anything overly fried, fatty, etc. At the recommendation of the guy sitting next to me, I ordered the Burrata Pugliese - a beautiful, light start to the meal. What arrived was a mini tower of spring vegetables atop creamy burrata. Delicate and delicious. So I was kidding myself when I thought I wouldn't order fried food because.. how could I have resisted the fried pig ears? With crispy kale and pickled hot peppers? AND topped with a fried egg that with a slight puncture to the yolk would yield the sauce that binds it all? The dish is a meal of its own and better shared. As much as  I wanted to sop up the last bits of yolk tossed deliciousness, there that was a final dish that awaited me. I thought the octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes would be another light option but the generous portion of tender tentacles left no more room for dessert. A nice solid dish. The creative selection of small plates, communal tables, and an extensive wine list encourage long conversations with good friends. Or if dining alone, you'll end up meeting some new ones. After stumbling back to the hotel , I laid in bed drunk from food and wine both. While I was sad to have forgone the bone marrow, smears and cheese, I was already finding an excuse to return to Chicago. Next time I'm coming armed with a few more bellies."
Unbelievable experience. The food was crazy good and the staff was super great. We sat at the Chef's Table and he took incredible care of us. Don't miss this place when in Chicago.
"Creative plates of food.  That's the one thing I've walked away with after eating here.  Pigs ear, quail eggs and fried deviled eggs for example.  My favorite dish by far was the pork shoulder.  I should have ordered 5 of those!The decor inside I have no idea about but the outside seating is great if the temperatures cooperate.  The seating is long tables and the seats are close to other diners so don't expect 100% privacy.If there was one thing I would have like to have been better would have been the service.  It was quick to the table but without a grin or a smile to be found.  I'm from the south, I expect a smile with dinner."
"Let me just start out by saying that the people who think the food here is divine are posers and nut jobs with someone to impress. They MUST have something to prove because I was so underwhelmed by my meal, I had to hit the Wal-greens around the corner to get some chocolate-covered pretzels after we left. I had high hopes for this place. A friend of a friend recommended it, and my friends and I had walked past it the day before  and thought that it looked like a fun place to check out. I have to assume that this friend of a friend is a frenemy. We got there around 4:00PM and it is slightly crowded and that's fine. We waited a few minutes and a waitress brought our drinks out to us. We were seated a short while later at a large table that they deal with family-style. This is fine. As long as you don't have a douche bag 25 year old sitting next you speaking so loudly that EVERYONE on the outside patio can hear. Honestly. Who says, ""I am going to commission a piece from the artist""? Let me tell you who - this guy. We spent the next hour and 45 minutes listening to him talk over his companions, and the other 9 people seated at the table. I know that the restaurant cannot control this situation, but it just lends itself to our crappy experience. Here's what we ordered: Fried olives stuffed with chorizo - I didn't eat these, but the general concensus is that they were fine. Nothing to write home about. Or even to verbalize to the table. It's a fried olive. Fried eggplant with parmesan - They were OK. A gelatinous fried ball that tasted like cheese. Probably one of the better items from our list.Cheese plate - We had three cheeses: a chocolate goat cheese, a leceister cheese, and some gouda something or other. We didn't finish a single one of them. Seriously, I just needed a freaking Wheat Thin to eat with this. The buttered baguette was adequate, but not special.Pig heart sandwich, Chicago style - My friend ordered this and thought the pig heart tasted like roast beef. However, the sandwich itself was basically inedible. The bread was so hard that she couldn't eat it like a sandwich without cutting it. Here's my beef (or should I say ""pork"") with it: If you are serving me a freaking pig heart, make damn sure all the other pieces are good. Don't serve a rock hard loaf of bread with it. Because then, I am having to work my butt off to eat what many would think is offal. Seriously, the hotdog I had Mustard's Last Stand was a more appetizing choice than this.Chicken thigh kebabs - I know, I know... chicken thighs are fatty. But these were the fattiest, least savory chicken thighs I have ever sunk my teeth into. The best part of the entire meal, I kid you not, was the smashed and fried potato hanging out underneath the meat kebabs. The tziki sauce was fine. I've had better and I've had worse. Pineapple crusted pork something or other - Whatever this cut of meat was, it had a nice crust on it. Which was pretty much the only piece of the meat we could eat. As we dug through the meat, we found more fat and cartilege (bone???) than I would have thought possible. The guy next to me (not the DB, some other guy) had gotten it and eaten every bite. I have to ask myself... Did he eat ALL that fatty tissue and cartilge?? Did he??? If so, I am concerned for his health.So there's the rundown on the food. Now, on to the service. Which I think about as highly of as I do the food. Once we were seated my friend ordered the same drink that I already had in my hand. 20 - 30 minutes pass and no drink. Our waiter (who swapped with our original server) asked if there was anything we needed and my friend mentioned that she was still waiting on her drink. He became defensive and said it was at the bar. If it was at the bar, why not go ahead and bring it out? I made a joke about it and he wasn't impressed. I think if you are going to be in the service industry, you should know how to handle a joke. You are working with the public all day, every day.... deal with it! For these servers, it was a job. And you could tell. I've been to places where it's a profession and there's a noticeable distinction between those two roles. Our guy (and even the girl who we began with) are just there. Posers themselves. We spent the rest of our time at this restaurant waiting out the time so that we could go. I question anyone who swears by this place. I guess if you like leftover body parts, poorly prepared, you should check it out. IMMEDIATELY!"
"Possibly the most frustrating restaurant experience I've ever had! This is a highly recommended place for a foodie like myself however it was very disappointing as I didn't even get to try the food. Three of us went in ahead of time to place our name in, after an hour we were called via phone that our table was available. We returned to the place all too late as our table was given away. We decided to wait again, 2 very expensive wine glasses later and an additional hour of waiting outside in the cold, we were still not seated. On top of it, there were seats open!!  Terrible place! I will never go back and will make sure to let me friends know as well."
"Don't be scared away by the quoted waiting time! A friend and I attempted to get a table here on a Friday night in the Summer and were quoted 2 hours and 20 minutes. Your best bet is to linger near the bar and grab a couple of seats when some folks get up and leave.The cocktails and food are amazing. We sampled 5 or so dishes including the chorizo-stuffed olives, the quail, and the milk-braised pork shoulder. All I can say is yum, yum, yum. You've probably never tasted pork this moist and tender.Our bartender was very friendly and very knowledgeable. She suggested two great pairings that my companion and I thoroughly enjoyed.Prices were also very decent for the quality, and a meal for 2 with 4 drinks was just at $120 with tip.CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"
"Been here twice. Never be disappoint great food from t love the beets salad, razor clams and the bone marrow. Will go back again on the next visit."
"Cute restaurant. Friendly staff. 30 min wait even at 4pm on a sat afternoon. Chorizo stuffed olives-4/5 juicy and tasty. Octopus w/ green been, potato, and salsa verde. 5/5. Most tender octopus I've ever tasted! Must try!Roasted bone marrow w/ herbs. 3/5. Bread and herbs over powered the bone marrow. Though the Bone marrow tasted good itself, u can't taste it w/ the bread and herb together. Not worth the hype 3/5. Pork and wagu sugo stuffed pepper w/ rice and tomato. Saucy and tasty like a jambalaya in a juicy pepper. Not bad. 4/5"
"AWESOME HOG!!!  My bride and I had Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette/ pig ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg for start.  Tooooo gooood.  Then had milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and housemade morcilla sausage, poached lobster tail, grilled asparagus with rhubarb and spring pea.  This was very good, sausage was not greasy and lots of flavors. Then dessert was a torta mandola.   A good Tuscany red wine and a double malt doppelbock from Italy finished it off.  David was the server and his suggestions were spot-on.  A place to go!!!"
"The restaurant is cozy and dimly lit but very lively nonetheless. My boyfriend and I dined here for our anniversary and it only added to the already wonderful day we were having.The server was friendly though it took her some time to get our drink order. This was my first time here so I can't really speak generally on the service. The rest of the night went smoothly.We ordered a couple of dishes at a time. All dishes are made to share and have a Mediterranean take. We started with the lingua and pig ears and finished off with the milk braised pork shoulder and the bone marrow. All of it was delicious! The lingua is a good starter served with bread. The pig ears were savory served with a fried egg (I love fried eggs on anything!). The pork shoulder was definitely a favorite of mine. It was so tender and juicy, and was accompanied with mashed potatoes that took the consistency of gravy. I cannot stop saying how delicious it really was. The bone marrow was my absolute favorite!!! Spread the bone marrow on the bread, sprinkle some salt, then top it off with the onion and cilantro mix and be ready to taste the good life. Loved it!Of course, I had to order dessert. I was so stuffed from dinner that I opted for something light yet still sweet, the lemon panna cotta.I plan to return to try the cheese and more wines. This is a great place for a romantic dinner or a girls night."
"First off: reasonably priced, prompt and attentive/patient service, great location, nice atmosphere.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening and our group of 3 was seated immediately.  Others were on a list - or there was immediate seating outside, but it was like 94 degrees so no one wanted to do that, hah.There are indeed only the two unisex bathrooms, so be conscious of others waiting when you are going!They need to update their menu online, it seems like they have some winter items on there that aren't current and they are missing some other items that we just had yesterday.  If this is your first time with this type of food, as it was mine, be open and adventurous.  Trust that whatever they serve you is going to taste good.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Also, when your order arrives you may not be able to identify what it is based on looks.We ordered the summer squash salad, which was light and zesty.  Then we had the nduja smear (it's not on the online menu right now). A bit spicy but in a nice way. We tried the tuna and potato fritters, which were tasty.  The chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes were tasty but a bit underwhelming.  We also tried the Scallop Speidini with Chickpea Aioi, which even I liked and I didn't think I liked scallops.  We had another pork item from a la Plancha but I forget what it was now... drat!For dessert we tried the bread pudding, the buttermilk softserve with berries, and an affogato.  All very very good.Everything was tasty and the wine list was great too.  Would come back for another adventure but I was also a bit out of my comfort zone!"
"Now that I have come here, I can justifiably complain about the Purple Pig in the future.Only 2 of the 5 plates we ordered were really good (pork shoulder and pork jowl), but overall I felt like portions and taste didn't justify the numbers at the bottom of our bill. Also, for the amount of money I gave this place, I'd like a little more elbow room. My buddy and I were basically hanging out with the couple on a date next to us. And lastly, whats with only offering Italian and Spanish beers? It's possible to still be fancy and offer beers from American breweries."
"This is likely my favorite place in town. Despite the sometimes ridiculous wait times, this is definitely a place you don't want to miss. I recommend going very late or very early to avoid a pretty common 1 to 1:30 hour wait.The food is exquisite! I was especially surprised by their vegetarian and meat-free options, considering they specialize in pork. Try the salt-cured greek yogurt smear.Excellent!"
"Ok so this was nice.  I've heard of it and we ended up going last minute.  It's good for tapas.  It's loud. Very loud. And we waited much longer than promised to be seated.  Food was good. Had the bone marrow, cooked clams, and calamari. The clams were the best.Nothing really outstanding but to be fair I'm on a really restricted diet these days so I couldn't try everything I normally would."
Damn good.....so jealous  i don't live close....go get your minds blown
"Place is a little crowded so I usually sit at the bar.  Hit it occasionally for lunch during the week to attempt to avoid the crowds.  Skip it on weekends as it's flooded with tourists (good for the place! bad for Chicagoan's).  Love the fried olives, pigs ear, salt roasted beets, sardines, the smears are all very good.turkey leg, pork jowl and sweet breads are tops.Great cheese and cured meats along with a solid wine selection and usually good beer on tap.  Like the menu, think it's every bit as good and Girl and the Goat and close to Publican however the size, location, and crowds keep me from going here are often as I would like.  Wish they would open another one with a bit more of an off beat location where I could avoid the full blown tourist Mich Ave impact.  How about opening one in Bucktown, Wicker Park, Lincoln Square, or along Clark specifically in the old Le Creperie spot that is about to close.  Bet that location would be mobbed and bring back that little part of Clark that is starting to die.  Looks like the right size and setup as the current location.....I'd like it to open there!  Come on!!!"
"DAAAANG!  What a great lunch!  My BFF and I ordered 6-7 of the plates. Lardo, Pork Liver Pate, Mortadella, Pork Neck Bone Rillette, ""JLT"" sammich, Roasted Bone Marrow, and Pig's Tails. The bread served with pretty much every dish was the same, and very very good. Could have ate a pound of it.... Wait... I think I did. The Lardo was SO FREAKIN GOOD!  Spread a little Pate on that and MMM MMMM MMMMMM!!!! There wasn't a bad dish served. They all came out fast, hot, and yummy. Can not wait to come back for more!"
"How can one say no to a restaurant that was one of Bon Appétit magazine top American restaurant 2010? I know, I know it is now 2013 so does it still hold true? This is a power house of chefs on the magnificent Mile and apparently in this case there can't be too many chefs in the kitchen.I do tend to stay away from overly touristy spots in search of more local eateries when I visit a city but my fellow travelers wanted to try it. The restaurant towards the end of the stretch of populated commercialized chain of American shopping bourgeoisie.  The entrance lined with planting led to the loud, noisy and crowded dining hall filled with banquettes and communal table. The hostess was friendly and our server was helpful with the selection. She was quick to make sure everything was good without hovering.This is a tapas restaurant with plates for sharing. I'm use to when it comes to tapas what comes out is small but in the mid-west 'small' is relative. It is more like Mapas(Meal - tapas). The Cauliflower was really with the conichon and breadcrumbs had the extra crunch and tartness.  We tried the 'smears' of whipped feta and cucumber. The feta was light and cucumber added the crunch and refreshing. The toast was crispy but it was filling. We loved the octopus, which was firm and the green beans was still crisp. Pork Secreto was very good but the roasted red pepper was slightly salty.The experience at The Purple Pig was a good one for our first night in Chicago. The food certainly lived up to expectations. I would certainly say for those visitors who don't want to stray from the beaten path when traveling, The Purple Pig is a great option along throngs of tourists and after work locals."
Amazing food! I ordered 3 cheeses and 2 meats - all so scrumptious!  The food here is being complimented by all around me! Mine is fantastic!!  Wine choices are top notch! Wait staff is wonderful! Repeatable!!!
"A restaurant with the theme ""Cheese, Swine and Wine"".............YES PLEASE!We dropped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  It gets very busy so get there early!  They recommend 2-3 plates per person.  The prices are not cheap to be prepared to drop a bit of dough for a decent meal.  We ordered the following: Cheese Plate (3 for $19) - Our server picked our cheeses, which were all excellent. I was surprised at how large the portion sizes were (see pic)Fried Prociutto Balls - Very good and very juicy!Bone Marrow - A staple dish here, pretty good but I've had better. I don't like how the drizzle the plate with olive oil so the bottom part of the bone marrow extremely oily. On top of that, the toast you eat the bone marrow with is drenched with butter. It's just too much. BLT Jowl - Oh my god, the slice of bacon that comes with the perfectly cooked sunny side duck egg is PERFECT. It's extraaaaaa crispy, which I love.  Scallops Spiedini with Chickpea Aoli - My least favorite.  Nothing special.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - The most tender pork you will ever eat. So good, but the server ruined it for us by telling us they put a whole stick of butter in it!  ....and now I've just ruined it for you.  Ughhhhhh!We sat at the bar since there was a wait for a table.  It's very comfortable and gives you a nice view of the chefs working their magic.  This meal with two beers cost about 100 bucks.  A nice experience and a must try if you you are in Chi-town and you love to eat pigs!!!"
Great vegetables to go with the meat !
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves adventure in eating! Wine list was great! Staff were wonderful and helpful! Food was incredible! Dessert was heavenly!! We ate at the bar and the cooking staff were so interesting to watch ! Like a well oiled machine ! Fun and delicious!
"HOLY !@#$!!!!  Public Service Announcement:  If you are in Chicago, YOU MUST GO HERE!!Where has this restaurant been all my life?  There is a time for expensive dress up, then there is time for down-home-get-your-hands-dirty- dig-in grindz.  This is it!!  Some pointers:  From what I witnessed, there is always a long wait (45 minutes-an hour).  Therefore, your best bet is to come, put your name down, they will take your cell phone number and call you when your seat is ready.  Be prepared to go shopping on Michigan Ave. to pass some time.  My hubby and I were staying at the Marriott down the street, so I made reservations and went back to my room to relax and get ready for dinner. Also it is communal seating.  Which I LOVE.  Being a social butterfly, I started a conversation with a gentleman next to us who was from Paso Robles and we proceeded to order a galore of food together. This is a tapas place, so everything comes in smaller portions (this is totally relative.. I still thought the portions were healthy).  Perfect for trying out a huge variety of deliciousness.  And trust when I say EVERYTHING looks good.  The menu is huge, food is Mediterranean inspired, and the wine list is just as epic.  They boast over 50 wines under $40 a bottle.  Servers are cute, hipster and adorable.  Now, onto the heart of this- THE FOOD!  Between our new Californian friend and us, we enjoyed: 1) broccoli, roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette, 2) deep fried pigs ears, crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and sunny side up egg3) deep fried chorizo stuffed olives4) roasted bone marrow with herbs (Don't believe them if they say one person can finish this.. it's HUGE)5) milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes6) Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verdeIT WAS MIND BLOWING.  Every single dish was salty, flavorful, fatty goodness.  This is not a meal for the lighthearted.  You need to be ready for gluttony without guilt.  Jut don't think, dive in and enjoy.  I mean, I literally ate 2 bone marrows that were 9 inches long by myself.  :D The highlights were definitely the marrow, octopus and pigs ears.  But I would transport myself in a SECOND to try the rest of the menu. If you are in Chicago, DO NOT HESITATE.  Don't be intimidated by the wait.  You will not be disappointed. GO!"
"I went here on a whim with my boyfriend for our anniversary.  I work downtown and always saw people carrying bags around with ""Purple Pig"" written on them and said why not, lets go.I was blown away.  The food was absolutely incredible and the wine selection was to die for.  We slowly made our way through the menu and had the Honey Cornbread, the Pork Tip/Ricotta Smear, the fried Pigs Ear and also the fried Salt and Vinegar chips and well as a  Ham, Swish and Sun Dried Tomato Panini.  It was amazing.  I liked that the food was brought out as it was ready and everything was piping hot and ready to be devoured.  The wine we had was also amazing and complimented to food nicely.The wait staff was incredible.  We had two female servers helping us, one was training under the other and both were professional and friendly and offered great advice on some of the dishes to try.We walked in around 5:45pm and there was about an hours wait, but they took my phone number down and said they would call.  Which was fine.  It was on a Friday we went and I knew it would be busy so we just wandered the mall next door until I was called and when we arrived back we were seated immediately.  The music and atmosphere were a little loud but thats the trend with most restaurants and bars these days so there is no escaping it.  Although after a while you tend to get accustomed to it and not notice.The prices of everything were very reasonable and I'm just sad we couldn't make it to the entree portion of the list.  However judging by the size of those plates being brought out, we might have wanted to have a group of people with us to help chow down.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience something different and unique.  It was a wonderful surprise and I will certainly be visiting again!"
"Just outstanding in each way that I look at a restaraunt.  Allows casual atmosphere, but rests its reputation on great explanations, a changing menu and extreme attention to detail in preparing ingredients creatively.Cocktail specials were good, I saw  3 of them and they mix a nice one thats not over-boozed accordig to my colleauge. Nice blends in the deserts, too. We sampled 4 of them. The pig platter was a cured/sliced meat selection that was terrific. Main plates were portioned beautifully and timing on service couldn't be beat. staff is engaging nad mindful of your pace of dining without rushing you out.Cant recommend this enough. No reservations, which is OK, but be ready to put your name in and spend an hour walking around michigan avenue. no problem, well worth any wait short of 2 hours.Delicous creative food, colorful and thoughtfully presented. Wow. This place will never get old to me."
"BEST food I've had in a long time. Pigs ear was outstanding! Pork shoulder was to die for. Fantastic cozy atmosphere, real food, great drinks and good service."
"I love the Purple Pig I send as many friends as possible! It's very simple...they have unique small plates (which are awesome), and a fantastic wine list! Really what more do you need?? The staff is so helpful and great with recommendations! It's small so you will wait, you sit at long tables with other people... I like you get to see other plates to try and maybe make a few friends along the way!"
"Fantastic food, staff, ambiance, drinks--just fantastic all around. It was packed to the hilt on a Wednesday night, so not a great place for a quiet bite, but if you don't mind the crowd and the noise it's definitely worth the wait."
"A M A Z I N G ! tapas and small plates are my absolute favorite type of restaurants because i love to eat a little bit of everything. we tried the calamari, bone marrow, and bay scallops and were super impressed. the ambiance is awesome and the menu is extensive and detailed. i really can't wait to come back and try everythinggggg!"
"The Purple Pig is a fun, reasonably-priced, and delicious find on the mag mile.  It's a great value for the food quality and completely worth the wait.  Much off the seating here is at communal tables.  At first I felt a little awkward about sharing my dinner conversation with a table of strangers, but it is actually kind of fun.  On my last visit my friend and I ended up sharing a table with a middle aged couple visiting from out of state.  They ended up sharing half their bottle of wine and several small plates with us, how fun is that?Speaking of wine, the list here is huge.  Sometimes that can be overwhelming for someone like me who doesn't know too much about wine.  The servers are helpful without being jerks who expect customers to know more about the menu selections than they do.My recommendations include the beet salad, the bone marrow & the cannoli donut thing for dessert."
Food is ok - over priced in my opinion and most was common place. Bar keep and hostess were rude and pretentious. It's very small and tightly packed. The wait was long both times I went and the hostess the last time actually got in my face to tell me that the wait time she had told me was not actually the wait time she told me. Her words were that she is meticulous and doesn't make mistakes. Uhhh what? I won't be going back. Already put the giftcard I bought for my husband on Craigslist. No thanks!
"Be ready to wait a while! The food was creative and different, but some things were not unique enough to say it's ""amazing"".  I expected something truly different and great for the hour wait and prices."
"My friends and I were vacationing here in Chicago for a few days and one night we chose to come here for dinner.We ordered the Bone Marrow, Milk braised pork shoulder, and the Wagyu sirloin beef. I want to say all three dishes were delicious but the least favorites for us was the pork shoulder.Bone marrow: cooked so perfectly, so smooth, slapped it onto some bread, add some herbs and dash some sea salt on there. My best experience ever with bone marrow.Wagyu sirloin tip: it was just amazingly cooked. Texture and Flavor was just right.Milk braised pork shoulder: I wasn't really sure what to say of it because it didn't really taste like anything. It felt like I was gulping down a lot of cream sauce."
"On a recent trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of eating at the Purple Pig. I had been told by a friend how when they had gone to Chicago, they had tried to go on one of their last nights, but the wait to get a table had been hours, and they alas did not make it. I strategically decided to make this restaurant my first dinner stop on a Thursday night as I figured it would be less busy. I was rewarded with a 1.5-1.75 hour wait at 8:00 pm, which turned into more of a 1 hour and 10 minute wait. That same weekend I couple I knew went on a later night and it was a 2.5 hour wait, so my strategic planning paid off.First off, it was worth the wait. And all we did while we waited was check out some of the clothing shops on the Magnificent Mile. I think this is a restaurant does everything right. (except their beer selection, but they are a wine bar) I love their menu, and the variety on it. Initially we were torn between which smears to get, so we were gonna get two smears for two people. We were warned by the waitress that it would be too much bread, so we got The Wedge salad instead of a second smear. The Wedge (iceberg wedge, beef bacon, heirloom tomatoes, blue cheese dressing) was delightful. The dressing had just the right amount of blue cheese, as it wasn't overpowering. The smear we landed on was the Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda. I highly recommend ordering a smear when you are there, and I definitely enjoyed this one! The mostarda added a nice amount of sweetness, and you definitely don't need too much on each slice of bread. Btw, don't forget to ask for more bread if you run out! It is FREE.For our main, we had the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy, which is one of the dishes they are known for. It was really yummy as expected, but the thing that surprised me the most was the reasonable price attached to it. There wasn't any prices on their menu online so I had no idea what this place would cost, but the milk braised pork shoulder came out to 13 bucks, which to me was a steal. Overall, our meal was totally satisfying and was the most reasonably priced of all the fancier places we ate in Chicago. So I can see why this place is so popular! For dessert we had the Lemon Panna Cotta with Candied Pistachios. The funnest part about it was the candied lemon rind in the panna cotta. If you are looking for something light after your meal I would totally recommend this, as I loved it!If you are planning a trip to Chicago and are wondering where you should eat in a short amount of time, I would definitely say add this place to your list! Amazing."
"Definitely worth a try if you stop by Chicago.  We had 3 tapas/plates and a dessert for 2 of us: bone marrow smear, pig ear with kale, tuna salad, and an affogato for dessert. Bone Marrow is always good, but it's one of those things that you can only have so much.  The pig ear with kale was good, but I am really not the biggest fan of it.  I like the original crispy texture of pig ear without deep frying it, I kind of thought that deep fried version killed it.  The tuna salad is definitely a good balance to the other two heavy dishes.  Affogato was a great finish, after all that hearty food, something less heavy makes it so much better.We went there the first day and was told a 2.5 hour wait, so we decided to starve the whole day the next day and went at an odd ball hour (4:30pm).  Only waited half an hour; despite we were starving, the food was still slightly too heavy for me to finish.  I think I don't mind taking a trip downtown and wait half an hour to eat there, but if I had to wait 2.5 hours for it, I'm skeptical."
"We lucked out with no line on a Wednesday at 1pm! Ordered 12 dishes- yeah 12! We were visiting from Boston and didn't want to miss out! We didn't finish everything but totally tried! We ordered the pork neck with gravy(tomato sauce), pig ear chips, pig heart, squash which tasted like dessert!, fried brussels sprouts, chicken thighs, bone marrow (my bf not me), meatball slider, and a few others! All were delicious!!!"
Delicious food! Very good service too. The morcilla was excellent - so was the pork chop and belly.
"Stumbled in because everywhere else was closing. Not many  restaurants open passed 10 on a Tuesday night and there was still a wait. Inside was a little too loud so chose to sit outside. Everything we ordered was yummy but on the heavy side and served pupu style. Bone marrow, pig ear salad, mussels with panchetta, brussels sprouts and panna cotta that was served in a bowl with a little piggy. Don't get the marrow if you sit outside, lol, or just eat fast before it hardens and gets nasty. Service was great too. Attentive but not overwhelming. Glass never less than half full, and had to fight them trying to take my food away... I want to finish everything on the plate, darn it!"
"Bottom Line: Really good food if you are willing to wait.In a Few Words:     Food: Spectacular!     Drinks: Drats, I didn't partake.     Service: Excellent     Atmosphere: Energetic, eclectic and a little loudThe Details:My friend and I came across this restaurant quite serendipitously.   I was gazing and the sign that said  ""Cheese, Wine and Swine""  just as my friend exclaimed, ""Ohhh, that is the place that is supposed to be really good but I couldn't get into previously.""  We paused and adoring stared at the restaurant.  She noted they don't take reservations and there is always a line. ""See, there is already a line,"" she noted and it was only 11:15am.  Well, thanks to my trusty Yelp Mobile App I could see that the restaurant hadn't opened yet so we got in line and were thrilled to be seated when the doors opened at 11:30am.We were seated at a community table and immediately greeted by or attractive and knowledgeable waiter.  He explained that the menu contains a section for antipasti, salads, smears, fried stuff, paninis, cured meats, chesses and grilled items (aka ""a la planche"").  At this restaurant its customary to just order as your mood strikes you - some of this now, maybe try that later, perhaps finish with that.  It is a tough decision on what to get but most items are a small plate so you can get several and share.  Our first dish fell under the antipasti heading and was the calamari with fregula (Sardinian pasta), radishes, cucumbers and pistachios.  This is essentially a super fresh salad full of Mediterranean flavor.  The veggies were precisely diced and the calamari ringlets were surprisingly tender. I am sure I could have eaten a huge bowl of it and our waiter said the same.  From there we ordered two items off of the fried items heading. First was thinly sliced pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and a fried egg with a beautiful rich yolk to smother on the rest.  The pig ear was delightfully crispy like a potato chip.  And this was probably some of the best use of kale I've ever tasted.  Our second fried item was basque cheese with a slightly sweet membrillo (quince) sauce.  This was just darn right tasty too.  We could have kept eating these unique culinary creations but decided it was time to start walking down the Miracle Mile.The food here and service here were both amazing!  The only drawback for me was the awkward community table and the noise from the kitchen.  The people next to us at the community table consisted of a father, her daughter and what seemed to be the daughter's boyfriend.  The father wasn't really part of the conversation and I felt so bad for him.  It was just awkward.  Also, it seemed like Ms. Gordon Ramsey worked back in the kitchen because there was a ton of noise (e.g. shouting of orders and direction) coming from there and that was a bit unappealing at times.(As featured on Unique Eats on the Cooking Channel)"
"Always a great experience, good food, fun environment. Creative small plates with nice selection of wines."
"So after a long day of shopping on Michigan Ave with my beau, we were hungry and decided to yelp something nearby. We decided on the purple pig because of the reviews. My experience at the purple pig didn't start off great because when the waiter asked me for my ID, I realized that I had left my wallet in a store :( So after a dramatic 30 minutes of looking and wondering where my wallet was I finally found it (the store had it) and I quickly returned to purple pig and ordered my drink. I pounded a few vodka tonics to ease my nerves. So, the waitress was a sweetheart. We basically ordered off of her recommendations and they were delicious. The ceviche was on point. There's also this little vegetable salad that was good as well. We ordered the fried pork ears which comes with a fried egg on top. We ordered some chicken and pork dishes to share and they were so good! Thank you purple pig for a great experience!"
"This Mediterranean-focused restaurant can have a long wait but it's worth it. The service was fantastic - friendly and helpful. The extensive menu was a little overwhelming but our server made excellent suggestions. All the plates are made to share. We had the Charred Cauliflower (amazing), Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. All were perfectly prepared and flavorful. I loved the Greek wine options - there were several reasonably priced bottles available. We were in Chicago in Oct and it was cold but the covered, heated outdoor seating was very comfortable. Casual and fun atmosphere though it can be a bit loud."
"Pigs are purple???? This was the first place I ate at on my trip to Chicago. It was fairly crowded so we sat at the bar. It's not a huge place but it's a decent size. The food is also done pretty quickly. They have people in the back working hard. We ordered the Pigs ears, Pig shoulder, bone barrow, and turkey leg. hmmm Which dish was the best? Surprisingly the turkey leg was the winner of the evening! Oh and these plates are all for sharing. Pigs ears - fried pigs eggs served in a pig bowl with an egg on top. it's not the best pigs ears but it's pretty good. A lot of taste, bold saltiness to it. Pig shoulder - Chunks of meat with mashed potatoes. The pork was very tender but it wasn't mindblowingBone marrow - This was okay Bone marrow with overly buttery toast. It was good and tasty.. extra fatty..Turkey Leg - This was the best dish of the evening. I didn't think there was a better turkey leg than the carnival. This was the juiciest and most flavorful turkey leg ever. The meat fell off the bone! SO damn good. Best turkey leg of all time!Recommedation : Turkey leg, pigs ears and bone marrow."
"Consistently good. My last trip I had fried pig ears, blood sausage, razor clams, fried manchego, and a giant wooden board of cured meats. Bad for big groups. Expect to wait. Good chance you'll be sharing a giant table or the table next to yours will be right up in your face. Great lunch spot."
"First the annoying part - there's no reservations and the wait times can be 2-4 hours during dinner hours, which is kind of ridiculous.  Now the good , it's a nice homey little restaurant on Michigan Ave that happens to be very close to my apartment, it's a tapas style restaurant with small plates that are great for sharing.  The service is pretty good and the selection is good.  My personal faves are the goat cheese and the brussel sprouts.  I wish they had pitchers of sangria but they don't.  Overall, I'd recommend it, it's my 2nd favorite tapas place in Chicago after Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba."
"came here on a work trip by myself. So for those also there for a short stay it's good for individuals to dine at, In fact get a table at the ""Chef's table"" so you can sit at a counter and watch all the awesome food being made. There is nothing in particular I can recommend you must try since I went there 3 times during my trip and everything tasted great.As a single guy dining for 1,  I ordered 1 appetizer, 1 vegetable dish, and 1 meat dish and I was pretty full and stuffed."
"My experience was just mediocre. Food is on the salty side and just average .The place  is pretty crowded and noisy,exactly what you would expect from the location. Overrated touristy spot that  does not leave up to the hype.Not impressed!"
"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? My husband and I have been here about 4 or 5 times. The service has always been excellent. I don't know how they get their servers but I have always been waited on by the nicest people. I realize that the set-up may not be for everyone, but I kind of like the long communal tables. In fact, the last few times we've been, my husband and I have made friends with the people sitting nearby! The wine list is extensive and a little overwhelming unless you are a seasoned oenophile. The servers, however, give excellent recommendations and don't try to up-sell you on a bottle that is out of your price range. Now, the food. I am a big fan of the food here. I mean, cheese...pork....what's not to like? I do find some of the dishes to be a little too salty. Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but I do like to taste the more subtle flavors in my food. That being said, I find the majority of the things I've ordered here to be delicious. The pork jowl sandwich is hands-down my favorite thing ever. I also loved the turkey leg (it's HUGE, btw) and the chicken thighs. You can never go wrong with a delicious cheese plate either. I rarely get dessert here and I didn't find them to be anything special so I would skip it in favor of more booze and pig. :-)"
"A truly genuine experience. The best money we spent on food during our Chicago stay.The menu is highly trendy and my hubby was a bit skeptical but he was won over by the end of the meal.The food: exquisitely fresh, perfectly prepared and seasoned, highly creative dishes. yum, yum, and yumThe service: sublime. you don't even think about the service because it's so good it's not even noticeable. you know?The atmosphere: upscale country French kitchen. super cozy. the place was standing room only but rather than annoying it seems suitable. you can watch the final plating from your seat at the bar, which we enjoyed.There were many more things on the menu I would have liked to try than there was room in my tummy for. We will definitely be back!"
"My mouth is still watering, thinking of the delicious, lazy lunch I had last week. I ate the pork secreto and a peanut butter/chocolate semi freddo over a luxurious few hours, and evesdropped on similarly happen patrons around me. I'm sad to think about how long it will be until I can make my way back here again from Canada.If you're in Chicago, this place is a definite stop to include on your map!"
"I live everything about this place except the wait to get in. They have a phenomenal menu with hearty and inspired dishes. The bone marrow always gets my attention and I ordered it the last time I was there... It's exactly that. A huge bone split in have and delicious rich fattening buttery marrow to be spread on toasted baguette slices topped with a onion/caper/parsley salad. It is delicious if you are daring, but best to share with at least 4 people, otherwise you will feel your arteries start to protest. Everything on the menu is creative and delicious, but relatively small portions and meant to be shared tapas-style. The best plan of attack is to gather a group of 4-6 people who all order different things and that way you can all try a little bit of everything that the Purple Pig has to offer. The place kind of reminds me of Girl and the Goat, with a different edible creature as a mascot...But all of this is if you manage to snag a table... Unfortunately the place does not take reservations, and it is a fairly tight space. The bar is a decent size and in theory would be a great place to sip some wine while waiting for your table, but everyone else seems to think so too and once again, it becomes a space issue with everyone vying for a bit of counter space. Bottom line: come early, come with friends, and come with some patience and be ready to wait. Avoid the 6-8pm dinner rush, especially if you have a lot of friends, but do check it out,"
"Last night my husband and I had dinner at the Purple Pig in Michigan Ave. (visiting Chicago for the week). The service was incredible!!! and every dish that we ordered was phenomenal!!!! All reasonably priced! We ordered the turkey leg as an entree and two appetizers. All incredible!!!  Although the establishment was very busy it was never a problem for our servers, they were on top of their game. Thanks for the wonderful service and the AMAZING food. We'll be coming back for sure!!!"
"I've come here a few times and if I had more disposable income, I'd be a regular. There is both outdoor and indoor seating and it's first come, first serve. Because of it's popularity, your whole party has to be there to be seated. All the servers are very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. So, if you feel lost looking at the menu, you simply can explain what you like and they will make sure you get it. With the small plates, you have to have at least a few people with you. I have tried many things there, but the best thing I ever had was the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The reason it's at 4 stars is because it's a very small space with too many tables. The tables are shared and you sit on top of complete strangers. There is so much staff trying to get everywhere that you are just waiting for a head on collision between 2 of them. It's fun but if you are looking for a relaxing experience, I would go elsewhere."
"Note: this is my partial review for space limitations.....Like the wine list, the food menu is also extensive and rather hard to navigate alone, necessitating some trust be instilled in our server's experience. Mediterranean inspired, and largely conducive to nibbling and sharing, the menu is divided into Antipasto, Salad, Fried, Panini, Cured, Smears, Cheese, a la Plancha (grilled on a metal plate) and Dolci.  Based on some recommendations (and some online reading I had done pre-trip), we opted for:  Peas with Bacon, Parmigiano & Spearmint ($8)The moment he saw this on the menu, he said ""they took my favourite food [him=peas], and your favourite food [me=bacon], and put it together in a dish! It's made for us, we need to get it."" And boy am I ever glad we did. The combination of sweet supple pop from the peas, the salty parmigiano, the chewy bacon, the crispy crouton, and the refreshing properties of the mint was simply divine. He insisted I replicate this at home, and I definitely will do my best.Chorizo Stuffed Olives ($5)Another addictive bite. There is something about salty brine flavours with crispy textures that just turn me on. They actually reminded me a bit of a more sophisticated deep-fried pickles, one of my all time favourite snacks.Salt & Vinegar Beef Tendon Chips ($9)Super tasty. These arrived hot, fresh, light as air but packed a serious crunch that upon hitting my tongue seemed to melt. If you're usually a fan of S & V chips, this is pretty much like the premium version.Pork Neck Gravy with Ricotta ($10)One of my favourite dishes of the meal. The ""gravy"" was packed with meat and brimming with intense pork flavour, that while rich, was cut by the bright fresh tomatoes. The bread was also divine. It immediately brought me back to my childhood at my grandmas house where before bed, she used to make us this thick-cut Italian toast, very well toasted (almost burnt, like here), with lots of butter melted and soaked into the core. This is the kind of food I could happily live on. ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee, & Fried Duck Egg ($13)An awesome way to finish off. Again, starting with that stunning bread, the pork was crispy and salty, made even more luxurious with the addition of the perfectly fried duck egg yolk spilling all over it's glory. And while the combination of pork jowl and egg may be a recipe for a heart attack, the fresh tomato and mildly bitter frisee helped balanced everything out. Very tasty indeed.So for 2 glasses of wine, and 5 dishes at lunch, the bill came to $88 including tax and tip, very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. The atmosphere is fun and laid-back, and the service is considerate yet casual, and the menu has so many tempting options it would take me several calorie-packed visits to feel like I've even made a dent in their offerings. A fabulous meal to kick off our mini food-vacation, and a spot I will definitely want to return to in the future."
"On a recent trip to Chicago to visit one of my BFFs, she brought us here, and it was incredible!  Let me write that again in French because it makes more of an impact (trust me).... The Purple Pig was simply   I N C R O Y A B L E !!!!!!!!!  Being in the know, and living in Chicago for several years now, my friend really brought us to the best spots in The Loop area.  And TPP was probably my favorite.  The food here is so delicious and fresh and creative!  Honestly, look at this menu, and you'll surely get it (thepurplepigchicago.com/…).  The cauliflower was on point, cooked to perfection and and expertly charred.  We had the cheese plate to share and this was too good that it gave my other friend (in her own words), ""a religious experience"".  Our entrees were excellent as well (so many great options to choose from made the selection difficult).  The libations were as fun as the atmosphere and we were able to score a table outside.  They do not take reservations and the wait time is at least 45 minutes, but it was well worth it to dine under the night sky, with my amazing friends, and the fabulous food from The Purple Pig."
"Stopped here for lunch. Reservations are not accepted and the place fills up fast.. Nice outdoor seating area off Michigan Ave. with bustling noisy interior seating. Nice ambiance. The menu is varied and interesting with a focus on mediteranean cuisine and small dishes which belie the name. Anyway we went for the pork. Marrow Bones were amazing, two large halves with toast and salad. We sampled and had it wrapped. Rib tips in Pinapple sauce, Pork Pate and a pork skirt steak (cant remember the exact cut were absolutely superb. Staff took the time to explain the menu and were dead on with reccomedations. We shall return!"
"We found TPP too late during our trip to Chicago. If we had found it on day one; we would have slept on the floor just to try everything on the expansive menu. Sit at the last two bar seats in front of the expo station to get a unique experience and watch the staff prepare some of the most delicious and unique food in town. After every dish, we were toasting the Chef and his team. They've assembled a huge wine menu and the calamari salad, chorizo stuffed olives and pig ears were divine. We thought about skipping a wedding we were in town for just to hang out and plow through the menu.Kelly was a spectacular server/menu consultant and the experience made me yearn for the days when I worked in the restaurant business. A gem of a find and our list of places to visit every time we're in Chicago."
"The food here is unique, and you definitely won't find food like it anywhere else in Chicago. With that said, the food wasn't very good. Everything was pretty salty, and I will say that nothing was spectacular. The service wasn't very good either. I had pretty high expectations for this place, and I was definitely let down."
"Really enjoyed the free flowing atmosphere. Butternut squash was my favorite, followed by fried mashed potatoes."
"Really good. Quick service. Great dishes. Had the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the chicken thighs with smashed potatoes. Recommend it, mostly recommend the pork shoulder. Great for a quick bite or to order a range of dishes. Great for a late night bite. Nice venue. Great ambiance. Prices are fair."
"Good food, but my sister and I are vegetarians so we couldn't find much to eat on the menu!"
"We showed up on a Friday at 4 PM and there was a 20 minute wait.  We elected to sit at the chefs counter so we could watch the action.Ordered the Manilla Clams, Cold Calamari Salad, Beef Tripe and Bone Marrow.  All were great.  The menu is all over the place, for sure, something for everyone.  Even bought a T Shirt.  Would return for sure."
"Bone marrow was freaking AWESOME, very popular naturally! Also had the chorizo stuffed squid which was very good. Wine list is extensive and waiters are well versed in all menu items including the cheeses and meats."
"There are few places I've experienced that are this perfect. The food, music and atmosphere are excellent. This is my second time here, we ordered completely different items then the first time and they were just as delectable.Our waiter was very knowledgable about the wine and recommended a Croatian wine, which would certainly not be my first choice, but ended up being superb. He also brought over two very small tasters of rosé wine, since we scrunched up our noses in disbelief when he suggested rosé as a food wine, he was right great wine to be paired with food and excellent for a warm summers evening.This is the type of place where you will be asking what your table neighbours have ordered because you'll want to eat your way thru the menu. I hope to live long enough in Chicago to taste everything on the menu and drink my way thru the wine list. Great place for a date or any day ending in Y."
"Everything that could be said about their food has already been said. In the words of George Takei, ""oh my my"". We came here early on St. Patrick's weekend, around 6:00 pm, so there was no wait. We ordered fois gras smear, bone marrow, the scallop razor clam, lemon panna cotta and chocolate ice cream with espresso shot. Every dish was spot on and super delicious. Price range is a bit stiff, but considering how wonderful the food is, I am happy to spend every single dime at this place."
Fantastic razor clams and octopus dishes. Also loved the pork secreto dish and roasted cauliflower. Salt roasted beets were ok for us; goat cheese was a little weird pairing. Also the pig ear and fried kale was tasty but a bit over fried. Will definitely come back and try all the seafood dishes next time!
"The price for this restaurant was pretty high, but the amount of food was really small and it wasn't even delicious. Also, the most ridiculous part was that the server said that she cannot split the check. It's a simple job but she was being sassy and didn't do it for us. DONT COME HERE. It is just HORRIBLE."
Love love love the purple pig!They have great small plates and their bone marrow is amazing. Also get the stuff olives and burrata!!You really can't go wrong here. Great outdoor seating! Even in winter they have heat lamps. If you are visiting chicago you must check out the purple pig!
"I was dragged to this place by some friends. It would've been my first option because I'm vegetarian, but it turned out to be a great experience. The encvironment is super cozy and well thought and divided. The solid wood table, dim lights and soft music makes it very comfortable. I only tried two things in the menu, one salad and the fried mashed potatoes, both were so well prepared and full of taste. My friends had the cioccioli, octopus and shoulder, based on their comments and the presentartion it must have been awesome. The idea of sharing is nice, but yeah, you have to eat meat so everybody can have some. The alcohol seems a little bit too expensive even for an expensive place! A bottle of Lambrusco for like $50 is just over the top. I'd say that if you're not drinking the prices on food are so worth it and not even that much. The hand cream in the bathroom was the best cream I've ever had lol. Nice job, and definately a place to go when in town!"
"Sister and her beau was in town, and we were finishing up the sights along the Mag Mile, and looking to eat.  I was pretty skeptical of this place in Tourist Central, despite hearing good things about the food, but heck, since we were playing tourists, let's give this one a chance.  Glad we did.The food I would rate almost 5 stars, and not just cause I was starving, but the service was inconsistent - friendly, unfriendly, then friendly again - weird, and I would rate it about 3, especially after a rough start when they forgot about us (standing in front of them, btw), and seated a bunch of people ahead of us.  Almost left, but didn't want to mar my little sis's pleasant sightseeing, so I stuck it out.  The front desk noticed their mistake themselves, and the manager apologized, so that was better.Thankfully the food didn't disappoint, and this foodie was such a very happy camper, she won't ding the review stars too much for the service.  We tried a whole bunch of things, everything delicious - beets (loved), bone marrow (so yummy with the buttered bread), pate, chicken thighs (weakest dish), eggplant spread (sister and my Hubby loved), cheese plate, and finished up with the affogato and nutella sandwiches.  Everything was designed to be easy to share, so we all got a good taste of everything."
"Upon hearing about this place, I had set a pretty high expectation of what to expect. After visiting, I was actually a little dissapointed\not satisfied. The things we ordered were just ok and nothing great and we apparently ordered right according to our waitress. The more dissapointing thing was that we had no guidance whatsoever on what to order and weren't told of any specials for the evening....this wouldn't have been a problem until we realized that the couple next to us were given more guidance on what to maybe order...."
"I had really high expectations coming to this place as I went here for my birthday and heard great things. Food was fine, but there is always a long wait since they don't take reservations and are in the loop.  The food is also very meat heavy without that much flavor.  Food was tasty, just not amazing.Decor is good, especially for a restaurant pretty tucked away at the side of a building in the loop. I'd come here again if someone else picked it up not great enough to come again with the wait (1-1 1/2 hours)."
"Holy cow. This place really blew me away. At first I was shocked when we were told our wait would be an hour and forty five minutes, but we decided to stay anyway. The food was incredible. Everything was very flavorful, the server made a wine suggestion that was perfect, and the dessert was delicious. The atmosphere is warm and crowded and man, these people know their food! Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, but I promise it's worth the wait. You can have a drink there or at any other nearby spot and they'll call you when your table is ready."
"The food is of fantastic quality with a great range of taste and texture. Went there around 4 pm and was able to sit at the bar. By 6pm it was shoulder to shoulder. There is a great atmosphere with medium noise great for medium sized parties. I'm a big fan of organ meats so I was like a pig in.... well you know. The bartender was very helpful in picking pairings and just in general knowledgeable about the whole menu. After the first selection we had her pick the rest of our meal for us. Great night overall I would highly recommend to anyone feeling like something a bit different and a little more ""old country."""
"I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my fiancee after doing some Chicago sightseeing. This place caught my eye, we yelped, and went on in. Our lunch consisted of:-Calamari Antipasta -- 5 out of 5-Roaster Bone Marrow Smear -- 2 out of 5-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder -- 5 out of 5-Fried Manchengo Cheese -- 5 out 5-Razor Clams Oregano -- 5 out of 5Everything was absolutely outstanding except for the bone marrow. I think it takes an acquired taste and I must've never acquired the taste for bone marrow fat to be smeared on toast. There's a first for everything so I'm not mad but still.. who likes that stuff? hahaAll of the menu items above with one Peroni and a Ruby Rocks cocktail amounted to about $75, which is certainly on the pricier end. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago and hanging out on the Magnificent Mile."
"The bone marrow has the biggest portion I have ever seen, and it taste great. We have to order extra bread to finish it."
"While out & about on MI Avenue, we decided to grab lunch and walked by Purple Pig and remembered we had both wanted to give it a try. I now wish we had kept on walking.I prefer a ""lighter"" lunch but unfortunately, nothing could be considered ""light"" here. Everything is heavily salted and vinegary tasting. I ordered the slow roasted ham panini and my parter got the coppa panini. Our server informed us that paninis take a little longer and encouraged us to get an appetizer for the wait. We took her advice and ordered the braised baby artichokes and fingerling potatoes. This appetizer was watery, vinegary mess. All you could taste was vinegar. It just wasn't appetizing. Our paninis came out next and the only reason Purple Pig gets 2 stars from me is that the panini was somewhat decent. Although the inclusion of the portabello mushroom on my panini seemed odd and very out of place. My partner said one half of his panini was way too salty while the other half was okay. We both had a glass of white wine based on our server's recommendation which was okay.So on top of the sub-par food, we then had to be surrounded by staff drama. The place is small and we sat at the bar so there's not a whole lot of places to go if the staff is not getting along. A simple order of espresso (from another table) sent half of the staff into a bitchy ""discussion"" right in front of us. Pissed off servers were acting pissy with the bartender. Bartender gets bitchy back. Manager gets bitchy with all of them and then when the server stormed back to his table in a huff, the bartender and manager continue to rehash the whole incident right in front of us. It was very awkward and all we wanted to do was slink away with our salt licks...oops..I mean sandwiches.No clue why this place gets such rave reviews on Yelp. Food is not good and the staff is even worse."
"Well, Chicago, you guys definitely have enough reviews for this place but I'm going to add one more. While I don't think this place is a local spot, I was still pretty happy with the quality of the food.Came here for lunch/early dinner (around 3-4pm) and was so happy that I did. I actually didn't get to try any of the pig items so my review won't highlight those tapas items.  I tried the following:- Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley - okay, I am absolutely obsessed with this dish. It was soo good. Tangy and delicious.- Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans - the tuna was super fresh so I really enjoyed it. Taste wise, a bit mild but it was healthy and still good.- Burrata and Rhubarb Smear - cannot remember what the exact name of this dish was but boy, was it delicious. It was a perfect dessert and cheese dish with some carbs which is really what I was looking for."
"This was my last supper in Chicago and it was a good supper.This cute little restaurant is located in the heart of Michigan Avenue. This place doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait. I came in around 5:30 and I had a choice of either waiting 45 minutes for a table inside or getting seated immediately outside in 40 degree weather- I chose the latter.I ordered the following:Deep fried chorizo stuffed olives- delicious. I would have thought the combination of chorizo and the olive would have made each bite too salty, but it was parred down by a tzatziki sauce.Bone marrow- generous slabs of marrow on each bone. Slather some of that on the thick buttered toast, a pinch of sea salt and topped off with the vinaigrette salad- damn, it was good.Milk braised pork shoulder- tender pieces of pork shoulder just melted in my mouth. My table also shared the scallops which was equally as delicious as everything else we had already eaten. In the area? Eat at the Purple Pig."
"I write a lot of 5 star reviews on the theory that a place I love and go frequently--whether 25 or 50 for a meal--deserves that. But THIS will occupy a permanent place in my consciousness as some of the finest food I've ever eaten. And I'm happy this is my 150th YELP review as I'm in love with this place!The wait is routinely 90 minutes to 2 hours (even on a rainy Monday night after the tragedy at the Boston Marathon) but after you eat here, you will understand why. The sign reads: ""Cheese, Wine, Swine."" You enter through a covered patio densely packed with tables and with heat lamps.  Inside, two-sided bar is long but cramped and to the side are communal tables, a la Le Pain Quotidien in NYC and LA. But nothing prepares you for the perfection of the food, from the vegetable starters (the salt roasted beets with goat cheese and crushed pistachio nuts in a pistachio vinaigrette is a must) to the larger plates like the popular turkey leg. The meatball slider on a brioche bun with arugula and some grated pecorino romano is sheer heaven and just 6 dollars. The wine list is intimidating if you're not a sommelier (or a true wine aficionado) and you're a daily drinker of wines under 10 dollars, so I asked my server to recommend a wine which would pair well with my lunch. She suggested one of the lighter reds with an herbaceous and berry finish and since I love grenache, she suggested the Honora Vega. Wines come in four sizes: 5 oz, 8 oz, half-bottle and bottle. This was 14 for the 8 ounce and 20 for the half-bottle, so quite reasonable. My iPhone died and since I came alone after a 3 mile walk by Lake Shore Drive, I had nothing to read. Fortuitously, they had the December food issue of the New Yorker, which furnished two hours of stimulating reading as I sipped my wine and savored every bite of the meal. I liked the shaved brussels sprouts but would not order them again (it's like a cole slaw made out of brussels sprouts)I'd eat here once a week for lunch or brunch on the weekends if I lived in Chicago. I ended up getting another 5 oz glass (which she topped off nicely), so my meal was 44 pre-tip (would have been 40 had I just bought the half-bottle to begin with). My foodie friend about 90 minutes from Chicago recommended the Purple Pig and I will always seek his counsel on future Chicago sojourns. Improbably magical given I have little use for swine--or pork--not for religious reasons but culinary ones. A top-notch pork chop is great but if I could easily do without pork (including bacon and sausage) for the rest of my dining out life."
Can I PLEASE give more than 5 stars? Another incredible discovery: the mortadella smear with balsamic glaze and crushed pistacio.... oh my lordy lord.
"We were lucky to get a table that opened just as we came, there are no reservations and regularly there is a long line so be prepared. We ordered Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette as our salad. I am not a fan of Pistachios with another ingredient but this was amazing! Also the goat cheese was so good because it was whipped making it have a great creamy flavor. We also got Duck Prosciutto and El Bufalet or Water Buffalo cheese. It came with a jam, crackers, and small pickles. The Duck Prosciutto was not worth $9 you got about 6 pieces the size of your thumb and paper thin! Everything else that came with it was good. We also ordered Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. It was our favorite meal of the night. Our waiter told us what to do with the egg, we broke the yolk then mixed it up. And it sure made it taste good. The kale didn't taste one thing like kale. The pig's ears were superb, they were crispy and flavorful. My favorite fried dish I have had. For our main course we got the Seafood Saganaki. It had 3 different seafoods. The only issue was the striped bass which was less flavorful than the mussels, shrimp, and sauce. The service was great and the bill for us was a little over $80."
"This place is amazing. We came here twice in 1 week. That's how much we loved it. Everything was good! Their portions can be quite tricky though.We had their bone marrow and it was good! It comes with bread, so you can smear it right on. Their pig ears are also amazing for a appetizer.We pretty much shared everything. We had the pork shoulders with mash potato (small portion) and the turkey leg (which was huge). They were both delicious! Well I'm a big fan of this place. They're always busy too, so be prepared to wait."
"I love this restaurant.  Chicago is a city that has plenty of excellent dining options, but this one really stands out,  Yes, it is busy and a little noisy, but the food is outstanding (crispy pigs ears!!) and the service is smart and friendly.  They also have an excellent selection of wines by the glass (always important).  Love this place!"
I went to the Purple Pig twice last weekend. It's still my favorite restaurant in Chicago. U can't go wrong with anything here. There should be a place like this everywhere. Every time I try a new restaurant in Chicago I wish I had just gone here
"I have had my share of ""wow"" moments when eating at a restaurant all over the world, the purple pig served some unique and unfamiliar plates. The price is fair, and I would recommend you go with more than 2 people so you can try a bunch of dishes. Must get is the pork ear with kale... Very interesting texture and flavor (=delicious). One think we did not enjoy as much as other dishes was the chicken sausage... And for its price, it was not worth it.  However, Purple Pug won us over again when we got our desserts. The peanut butter one is... Once again interesting texture and flavor (=very good). Pana cotta was as good as others I have had.  I will definitely come back the next time I visit Chicago."
"I had really high expectations for the Purple Pig, but was a bit disappointed by my experience. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 8 or 9pm. We were in town visiting and had been told not to miss this. We waited about half an hour for a table, which wasn't too bad since they don't take reservations. After being seated at the end of a communal table next to two very boisterous italian men, we saw another table get up in the corner and we asked if we could be switched since we were practically falling off the end of the other table (it should have only been one seat and they forced it into two). We got some amount of attitude from the hostess, so we stayed in our cramped seats. We ordered the fried brussels, the pork shoulder, and the bone marrow to start with. The brussels had good flavor but they were shredded up and fried which made them super super greasy. Then came the bone marrow. OH MY GOD. What. Are. People. Thinking?? As soon as I spooned that fatty, chunky marrow onto my bread, I knew it was going to be a disaster. It didn't taste like ANYTHING. I've had good bone marrow before that's well seasoned. This was pure white like fat and just globbed on to the bread. I get that people think it's interesting and exotic to have bone marrow, but honestly if you don't like eating mushy fat, I would probably stay away from it here. Even if it is the most ordered item on the menu.The saving grace was the pork shoulder. It was tender and the mash underneath was nicely flavored. It ALMOST got the taste of hot fat out of my mouth.Overall, so-so service and mediocre food. This place is fine, but seems like a bit of a fad to me."
long long wait!!! They asked us to wait 4 hours. We were lucky enough to grab some seats at the bar. Would really love to sit outside next time I visit Chicago. The food was amazing! We tried Roasted Bone Marrow With Herbs and Berkshire Pork Chop. Loved both!
"Fantastic!Flavor abounds.Beet salad, fois gras, fried sardines, pigs ear, you name it. It's all unique, it's all good.Great international wine selection, knowledgeable staff, casual atmosphere.Hard to find anything wrong with this place except it's too far from home.If you're in Chicago, go."
Amazing food! Love the outdoor area.
"I would say more than 50% of its successful business is contributed by the great location, just off Michigan Avenue. The first time we stopped by, which was a Saturday evening, waiting time was 2.5 hours. That's what's sad about Chicago - it's a seller's market and you need to either make reservations two months in advance or wait 2-3 hours to get a table in a decent restaurant, at least that's what I experienced during my 3-day stay in the loop. We came back on Sunday morning before it opens at 11:30 and finally secured a table. It is tapas style so probably the number of plates you order is number of people times two. Smears are great- we had bone marrow and foie gras. Toasts are too oily though. Among what we orders, I enjoyed: butternut squash w/ pumpkin seed, pan-fried skate wing, pork tail, pork ear w/ kale and egg. I feel the food here is  a hit or miss; some dishes can be really salty and greasy, like the pork tripe.Service is okay. Too many people here so it's is understandable that you don't get much attention from the waiters.19/100 Yelp 100 Challenge"
"I really had high hopes for this restaurant, as our day was planned around going here, and I was thinking 5 stars. Well let's see, they will most likely be a wait BUT they do ask for a phone number which is really handy when it is a long wait. We where seated outside, and it was a truly lovely day so no complaints there! There was a gentleman that delivered us water after sitting quite quickly which was nice. But after that we waited without meeting our server for 20 min I finally asked for him and her arrived. We ordered drinks, appetizer/calamari(meant for 1 person), and entrees I had the milk braised pork shoulder because everyone on yelp recommended it. It was in fact delicious. My husband has the sirloin tip with a bone marrow vinaigrette it was decent but we both loved mine. So let me go back to when our good came out, mine came out...... Yes just mine, I'm not going to be rude and eat mine while he watches. So I wait and wait and wait and finally after 10 min it's cold and I ask the waiter to take it back and that I would like to be served at the same time as my husband. His response was ""his takes longer and we serve what it ready"" I told him it was cold and I wasn't going to eat alone. ( the whole point of a ""dining experience"" is to do it with company) he snapped that he was taking it back to the kitchen. And that was the 1/3 times we ever saw him. Great food poor service."
"First of all this is a great but small location right off Michigan avenue. It will be even better during the summer when the patio is open and you can sit next to the river to eat your meal. I also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant very cozy sleek. We got very lucky after a long after of shopping by walking straight to the bar and sitting down at 5:45 PM. I must stay that no more than 10 minutes later the entire place packed however. They have a great spirits and wine list which I always appreciate to accompany a good menu. We started off with the Eggplant Caponata and the Fried Cheese. The eggplant spread was amazingly flavorful with capers, tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins. It was paired perfectly with thick cuts for freshly toasted bread topped with whipped goat cheese. The fried cheese was hardly what we expected. I mean how can you go wrong with breading and frying something so good. Somehow it was just band and very dry because it was served with about a teaspoon of sauce. Disappointing. I got the Roasted Heirloom Carrot Salad and my date ordered the Scallops and Pork Jowl. My salad lacked the caramelized roasted carrot flavor I was really looking for. It was good texture but needed a zazier dressing if the roasting wasn't going to be the focus flavor. My date loved the Pork Jowl but was surprised by the simplicity of the scallops. All and all, we both stated that we would go back for the Eggplant Spread alone! So... no fear vegetarians! You can enjoy the Purple Pig too!"
"OH YUM! Thank you for making some delicious dishes!  Sat at the bar, and had a great view of the kitchen, and the chefs, as they weren't too harsh on the eyes either ;)  I ordered the fried pigs ear, squid dressed with salsa verde, and the fava & leeks.  My, what flavorful dishes.. The bartender/server was awesome.  Great personality, and always kept checking on it! I will definitely be back when in town!"
"If you know me, you know this restaurant has exactly everything I love:- Pork - Pork belly- Pork shoulder - Everything related to pig (cheeks, ears, feet)- Fried kale - Fried everything What a great find. All the tapas were enough to share."
"Came here on a Wednesday at 10:10 and waited 10 minutes before being seated (FYI bar is first come first serve).Ordered all at once - Braised Pork ShoulderPig EarsPig TailOctopusUPDATE - I forgot to add that fact that ordered desert, the IRIS, just get it, very very good, this alone should give my review 3.5 stars but we know that is not possible.2 Glasses of the RieslingThe Pork Shoulder came to the table Faster than a bowl of pho, seriously.  Tasted great, very moist - mashed potatoes  a little too salty.Next was either the O or PEBad part was we received the second item BEFORE our wine & water came....  Pig Ears - great idea, good flavored (several salty, tangy etc..) - they were deep fried, super seasoned and could of passed as the Frenches Fried Onions in a can (assuming they were hot and fresh). As a wanna be Foodie this dish is a -10 on the foodie scale.  Wouldn't be bragging to the friends about this one.I offered a taste of the PE dish to some new friends and in return tasted their Pig Tripe dish.  In this case the tripe was totally hidden within the sauce (pigears the seasoning).[ As a reference - Animal in LaLa is a much better foodie/adventurous meal ]Octopus (chunks of meat you need to cut)comes out with wedged potatoes and asparagus.  Mix all the items up, Octopus was Awesome and the other items went well.Pig Tail (again going for the Foodie score ) -  The portion of tail I received had a lot of Fat, understandable, but was a little sweet and a whole lot of salty.   The garnish/tangy sauce on top... tried separate AND together.  Not sure what they were trying to acoccomplish with this dish but is was just WEIRD.I would come back and order different items - taking into consideration the actual meat dishes, braised pork, octopus were cooked perfectly.  The Chicken Dish (literally 1/2 of a chicken) looked AMAZING."
"The food here is so good that I could not stop cursing....yes that F#CK%N GOOD!!!Didn't come here with high expectations...and they far exceeded my expectations!!!!Came here for dinner on a Sunday night and it was PACKED!!! Wait was about an hour...so decided to wait it out and maybe grab a drink. Lucked out on a couple leaving at the bar and grabbed a seat at the bar.Bartender/waiter was Dominic....hella cool guy and was very helpful on our food choices and wine choices!!!Food:- BONE MARROW: Love that fatty-buttery goodness..smeared on toast and sprinkle that sea salt to seal the deal!-  Grilled Octopus + green beans: skeptical at first but recommended from Dominic...and tried it. So glad we ordered it, mighty delicious and packed a lot of flavor. We even topped it on top of our Bone Marrow + toast ...haha- Pork Blade Steak: Another skeptical plate...but we took another recommendation from Dominic and 2 for 2..this blade steak was so effn good!!! Tender, perfect fattiness and savored in flavor!!!!All of these plates are highly recommended and if you can, sit at the bar...you can see the chefs prepare the food and I think it makes the experience much more fun!We also paired our meal with Spanish Wine (Bobal)....went perfect with our meal!Thanks Purple Pig and Dominic for our unforgettable experience! Bucket list - Check! Highly recommended! You'll make your friends jealous....haha!"
"Have tried this place three times since this January, the latest one yesterday.  Generally the wait time is 2-2.5 hrs on weekend nights, so make sure you plan to have some walking around or shopping.  Another advice from our experience is that they are usually good with entree than appetizers so concentrate more on that.Some recommendations:- Porkchop: oh my god, one of the best you will ever taste.  Never miss this one. - sirloin: very well executed dish with balance with sauce- chicken kebab: very tasty- quail dish: very well seasoned and executed with the stuffed rice- lemon panna cotta: subtle sweetness works perfectly with pistachio crumbs.My wife put purple pig above Avec and Girl and the goat.  by the way, late congrats to the chef for the nomination at the James Beard award"
"Yep, it's a bit pricey. And yep, there will probably always be a wait.  But this place is an EXPERIENCE!  Have been for both lunch and dinner and was not disappointed either time.  I was with a few adventurous eaters on my first dinner visit so I tried the Pig Ear and a couple of meats and cheeses I probably wouldn't have otherwise- and everything was awesome!  This is definitely a place to step outside of your comfort zone and try some different things.  They also have an excellent wine selection to complement their different meats and cheeses.When it's busy, it's loud and crowded, which I usually hate, but for some reason I didn't with this place.  The communal seating probably has something to do with that- it's all part of the experience. If that's not your bag, I would visit during lunch (if it's warm I would suggest sitting in their outdoor area which is really nice!).  Love this place and will definitely be back when I am back in Chicago."
My first trip to Chicago and was told I had to come here. Food was amazing!  Had the beet salad and chicken kebabs. Both equally as good.
"Almost didn't stay bc it was crazy busy at 2pm and we were late for cubs game. Hostess said they are always busy. Now I know why. Awesome food. Pork panini, fried deviled egg and pork shoulder were amazing. Would love to come back!"
"Amazing food! Great service! Good music! Great price! It was my first time to Chicago and we were looking for a late night place for dinner and this did not disappoint! Great staff, very accommodating and fresh, healthy food! I would 100% recommend it!"
"Solid 4 stars. Great value. Excellent food with super service. Nice space. Was there on a chilly night and sat outside. Though there is a canopy, it doesn't go all the way down and leaves one of the most important things (one's feet) exposed to the chill below. Taste profiles were all right on and as good as any small plates I've tasted anywhere. Bravo!"
"Very good food.  Worth a 2-hour wait?  Maybe not, but go between 3 and 4 pm or after 11 pm and you'll be seated in no time.  The brioche dessert is quite delicious as are the various cheese selections.  The pork shoulder is also very tasty."
This place is incredible.  I'm from out of town and was in Chicago for just two nights.  It was So good that we almost ate there a second time...wish we had!
This was the first stop of our foodie tour and we were hungry and ready to gobble some good Chicago eats!Wait on a Thursday night was about 2 hours! This place is small so beware and they do not take reservations. We opted for the bar (first come first serve) and we literally stalked the area until we got a seat about 30 minutes later. Food:Roasted beets with whipped goat cheeseFois gras spreadDeviled eggWaygu sirloin tips (Sooo good!)Fried brussels sproutsFried BriocheService was great and gave us a lot of great suggestions for more places to eat!Def a memorable dining experience here :)
"OkI was really excited about the possibilities hereCute environment Hip clientele and staff Interesting mix of food and libationsPork, wine, cheeseHow could you go wrong?The Pinot Grigio I ordered was very goodThe wedge salad was beautifully displayedThe feta and cucumber smear served with tasty toasted bread looked deliciousSomehow there was an underlying tone of bad water flavorIt was in the lettuce so I did not finish itThe whipped feta smear was great until I added the cucumber into the mixMaybe it was a bad dayThis place looks so promising It's something about the vegetable washing I think( hmm hopefully I won't get ill?)Anyway I would come BackI saw lots of wonderful things pass by from my vantage point at the barThe staff is very engaged in what they do that's refreshingI toyed with a 3 and 4 star ratingEnded up at 4 because of the bad veggie taste combined with a ""would I come back here"" question, I would!The whipped feta and Pinot Grigio were fantasticTwo days later....I did not get sick. :-)"
"I think this is a case of a restaurant being overhyped for me, especially as I make it my goal to eat fantastic meals at well-hyped restaurants as much as possible.  I think my mistake here was not realizing that it was meditteranean inspired food until our server mentioned it, and I don't really like meditteranean food.  My experience really made sense when I put it in this perspective, and I realized why many of the entree items didn't really appeal to me in the first place.The small plates, however, and the various other non-entree options, all looked freakin' fantastic.  The rundown:-The beets & goat cheese w. pistachio - wow wow wow wow.  If you like beets, and you like goat cheese, this dish is heaven.  Definitely get it.  It's also a ton of food for two people to share (appetizer-wise).-The pork liver pate - I was eating with a friend who was up for trying new things, and she had never had any kind of liver, whereas I absolutely LOVE foie gras and chicken liver pate.  I asked our server to describe how the pork liver would be different from chicken liver, and not only was she spot on in her description, but it was absolutely delicious.  A big portion, again, for two people, with perfectly crusty and soft bread to go with it.  I ate what was left after the bread was gone with a knife straight out of the bowl.-The beef tendon salt & vinegar chips - they sound weird, but get past it.  They're amazingly crispy, pork-rind like, beefy, salty, vinegar, crunchy, tasty chips.  Definitely something to try.  I almost inhaled the whole serving by the time my friend was on her 2nd chip.  I'm a pig.  Or a cow?-Chicken Thighs w/ smashed potatoes & tzatziki sauce - we ordered these at my friend's recommendation, and here is where my lack of taste for the meditteranean style came in.  The chicken thighs were perfectly cooked, but they just didn't impress me that much.  They didn't have much flavor outside of the sauce, which I liked, but didn't love.  The smashed potatoes were pretty awesome though.  It's a good dish overall, it just didn't stand up to the dishes above.-The roasted garlic broccoli with anchovy vinaigrette - I was really excited for this, because I love garlic, and I love broccoli.  I like caesar dressing, too, so I figured the anchovy vinaigrette would be good, and it was, but it totally overpowered the dish.  The broccoli was soaked in it, and I couldn't taste garlic at all.  I was kind of sad.-Wagyu steak, roasted potatoes & pickled things - this was really good, but honestly, we were so stuffed at this point I didn't eat much of it.  I'd recommend it though, very tasty.Overall I would recommend PP, though personally, it wouldn't be a spot I would go out of my way to go back to because most of the other entrees didn't interest me.  Though the small plates...maybe I would, cause there are MANY more of those I would try."
"After our first time here, we couldn't wait to come back. Tried the calamari, chorizo stuffed olives, eggplant shmear, and pork secreto this time and everything was delicious!!  The place was packed on Saturday afternoon but we were able to get a couple seats at the bar and service was perfect!! This is our new ""date day"" spot."
KOPretty interesting dishes. I like bone marrow with bread! There are still so many to explore! I'll come back again for sure!
"Food, Atmosphere, and SERVICE!  Everything was amazing, but what really made our night was the Sommelier's wine recommendation.  She absolutely nail it as far as our own personal tastes are concerned and also how it paired with our meals.  We can't wait to go back!!!"
"Ok so I thought this place was really good, but I would have liked to see more private tables instead of sharing a table with random people.  We had the short rib and calamari, I thought they were delicious but the short-rib is missing a starch on the dish.  I'd come back here, and when I do, I will try other dishes..."
"Crowded, pub-like scene. There's limited space to sit and always loud. If you can, make sure to make RESERVATIONS, but from time to time, they don't take reservations. I think this place is a cool, real chill place to hang out. It has a medieval feel to it because the tables, chairs, and decors are made of wood. It's definitely, calories packed, homey, comfort food:Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - WOW! Very delicious, it was so tender, the meat just literally melt into your mouth. The mash was buttery and smooth! I loved the salty, savoriness of this dish and the cute little pan it was cooked/displayed on.Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraîche & Marjoram - I LOVE MUSSELS, especially from this place. The sauce was so delicious, I loved using crispy pancetta to soak the it in, and WOW, the wonderfulness fills my mouth!Service was okay. It's always a busy place but I think they should be more considerate about their customers' orders and refill the drinks or waters."
We ate everything and it's all the tits!!  Special shoutout to the meatball sliders and the turkey leg!
"This place always has me dreaming of my next visit!  Great vibe and great dining experience!  Fantastic wine selections!  I'm obsessed with the Burrata Pugliese and the Pork Blade Steak with Njulda and Honey I was a little disappointed with the desserts, but that's not stopping me from coming back when I'm in town again!"
pork liver pate and pork shoulder are impressive.
"Was in Chicago on business last month and forgot to give my review of this amazing place! The Purple Pig is the epitome of delicious, the menu is really interesting and clever, and some dishes reminded me of mama's home cooking. I recommend everything on the menu, we ate a ton of different items and every single one was better than the last."
"This place exactly matched my expectations. I like the idea of having a variety of small dishes, each having unique taste. A hint: have young people in your company who are brave to order foods that you never knew about. Have fun of your feast."
"Great place to try if you are looking to try something new!  Be prepared for a very long wait...we put our name in at 8pm on a Friday and did not get seated until almost 10pm.  The service was great, definitely try the Turkey Leg, Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta, and of course the Bone Marrow--make sure you ask to bring the bone home for your doggie!"
"I don't live in Chicago, and we all know there is no shortage of great restaurants in this city. However, I've been here three times due to atmosphere, great cocktails/wines and of course, the novelty of the food.This place is a bit hard to find, but is essentially at the intersection of W Illinois and Michigan, right near the water.The pork roasted almonds with garlic are a great palate cleanser as you move through your animal parts filled meal (assuming you eat like I do). Yes, I do recognize the ridiculousness that I'm using almonds soaked in pork fat as a palate cleanser, but it works, I swear.The salted beets with goat cheese is interesting, but not my favorite.Let's talk about some of my favorites. BONE MARROW, as I'm sure plenty of other reviews mention. Fatty, creamy, simple, novel! Definitely get this if you have someone to share with, but try to put down more than a few bites and you'll be sleepy in 15 min.Pork shoulder with milk gravy is to die for. Texture, a little salty but I like it that way, and the gravy is smooth, creamy but not thick, and a perfect accompaniment to your meal. I wish they would bring it out earlier in the meal because it's usually the last course, and by then I'm a little full so sometimes I can't even finish the entire plate. Usually I just push through, I'll just do an extra 10 situps later.I've had the crispy pork ears, and if you've never had them, I'd recommend it. Probably not something I'd get every time, but definitely worth trying. Can't wait to come back!"
You will need to wait for a table and the best way to do it is to go there and leave your name and number. Walk around and look and stuff until you get a call. It took nearly 2 hours for us. Intimate setting but not as snobby as I expected for a wine bar. Hostess was very accommodating.The food.Pork neck bone rilette smear- this is served minced and resembled canned tuna. too salty for my taste. Turkey leg confit- the best thing we had. A huge turkey leg in a sweet agrodolce sauceMilk braised pork shoulder- a bit too much sauce but definitely tastyPork secreto with red peppers- average pork dishOctopus with green beans- sauce was delicious but octopus itself was overcookedI was bummed that they ran out of bone marrow. To sum it up:great atmosphere and service but so-so food.
"To start, we waited an hour and a half to be seated when we were told that it might be about a 45 minute wait. Just as some other reviews have said, this place is chaotic. I understand that there are fantastic reviews for this place, but I have to disagree; I would much rather sit at the Publican even though it's communal seating there (which I'm not totally a fan). But, when it comes to the food, I think I've definitely had better. Sure, there are one or two great dishes on the menu out of the 8 we all shared... Our mixed drinks were nothing special (Violet Hour and Longman & Eagle blow this place away), and the service - horrendous.I think the worst thing about this place is that right after work, it's so loud that everyone's having a shouting match. We couldn't hear one another talk, and we all agreed that things could be so much better here.I think there's a hype about this place, but that's all it is for me. Hype. Don't believe it. Save your dime and your time for another restaurant. Oh, and no reservations. sucks."
"The Purple Pig is a little difficult to find, but once you find it, get ready to wait for awhile to get seated. And, there is a good reason why it takes a long time...the food is absolutely delicious! Also, it's kind of a unique dining experience. The tapas are colorful and certainly flavorful in a very pleasing way. My favorite two dishes there are the bone marrow spread (which comes with capers and crusty bread) and cripsy pig ears. The restaurant itself is a little crowded, but it doesn't cause much discomfort. It actually  kind of adds to the fun. I look forward to going back, and trying their other dishes!"
Got lucky and grabbed a bar seat in less than 30 seconds while others waited 90 minutes to eat. All I have to say is this was my first time and the food was so delicious I would have waited the 90 minutes. I had their bone marrow smear I have never had bone marrow in my life. Let me tell you ..Sooo good. Then I had the Lamb steak blade. I thought OK my marrow was good this can't be better than my marrow..guess what?   It was the bomb. Very happy will go back before I leave Chicago
"Stunning vibe, loved the experience. Waiter was fantastic. Food was real tasty and lots to choose from. Highly recommend this place as a top gastro pub in Chicago."
"If you have a chance to go here, do it.  SERIOUSLY.The key to going here as to not have a long wait it to go at an 'OFF' time... what's an off time you ask?  It's not your typical dining times.  Like for instance, don't go at 12-2 because obviously that's the lunch rush and then you don't want to go from 6 o'clock on because really, you'll be waiting an hour plus here.  We came at 4pm on a Sunday and for a group of 5 ladies we had a wait of only 10 mins!!!  SCORE!  Chicago was having an amazing weather day and we got to be seated outside so it was perfect!Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- OH MY HEAVENS!!!  I literally wanted a whole bowl of this to myself.  Actually, after my gfs got their share I basically had the whole thing to myself.  My gfs knew how much I was enjoying every bite and let me have it.  I wish I didn't have to share it in the first place.  SIDE NOTE:  a group of older ladies sat next to us and didn't know what to order and this was one of the dishes we suggested they get and when their order came out they couldn't be any happier with the decision.  SO YES, ORDER THIS.  Don't be afraid of the name- get it!Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano- delicious brussel sproutsRoasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- eh, I could have done without this.  Nothing flavorful stood out for us.  They are pretty big though.Quail with Trahana & Porcini Stuffing, Salsify & Pomegranate- you have to eat everything together to get the right experience with this dish.  Once put together the palate is amazingCharred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs,Cornichons & Parsley- pretty flavorful.We ordered some cheeses at the recommendation of the waitress and she did a pretty good job at filtering out what we did and did not want in the cheeses.  Ordered a few more dishes as well that I can't seem to place right now.By the time 6 o'clock came around there was quite a long wait of people waiting to get in... so again, listen to my advice about going at an 'off' time."
"Is it crazy to say that I wasn't amazed by this place?The staff were great...very friendly and helpful, but the food was just decent to me.I guess based off of reviews I was expecting heaven in my mouth, but everything was good...but not anything to rave about. I ordered the feta spread and mussels...both were good, but again...didn't stand out. My brother and sister got the bone marrow and were slightly disappointed. My sister also got the scallops, which she did love.My brother ordered the milk pork shoulder, which he liked as well. My friend got the wagyu sirloin..and didn't think much of it.  The steak was cooked well, but the flavors just didn't pop out. It's a nice spot to check out, but not a place I'd return to over and over again."
"Even the most scrupulous foodies will appreciate the Purple Pig...at the top of Chicago's best.   There couldn't be a better seat than up at the right side of the bar right in front of the chefs whipping up everything.  The place is always packed but I just hovered behind the people at the bar for a few, and voila...I quickly get my seat.  Be adventurous...do get the bone marrow as touted by other yelpers.  Scoop and sweep on Texas Toast...hmmm, hmmm.  I got a full spread.  Pork shoulder that is so tender and may be the best dish.  Also taunted by the stuffed quail, instantly another favorite.  Ooh, and next, the most succulent scallops that have ever pursed through my lips.  All the while, spying on the steam and cast iron skillets zipping around, eyeing every dish that passes it's way through the head chef's final scrutiny before it is delivered.  Then, he sees us ogling everything...oh lucky us!, we get the extra treat of hearing stories on where he finds a certain pepper or just a little extra history--oh yes, the food bar is truely the best seat.  This is on my must go list whenever I am in Chicago."
"I had high hopes for Purple Pig but alas my visit was a far cry from enjoyable.  I disliked both of the small plates I tried.  I ordered the oil poached tuna.  Big mistake.  It was like eating a mouthful of vinegar with no other flavor being able to shine through the overwhelming acidity.  I tried some of my husband's feta and honey cornbread next and found it even less palatable.  The cornbread was way too dry and had an off note.  All in all, I found Purple Pig to be a very disappointing experience."
"This place was pretty disappointing for me in comparison to the other places my bff and I ate at during out Chicago foodie tour... I was good, but it wasn't nearly as good as the other places we tried!There was no wait when we arrived. We got here around 11:30am on a Friday so we were seated immediately indoors. The space was a bit cramped, but nothing I can't handle from the dining scene in SF! We ordered:1. Feta and Cucumber Smear - This was actually one of my favorite dishes here.  The feta and cucumber was really light and fluffy, the taste of it was subtle and perfect with the bread it came with. Since this was one of the first stops on our trip, my bff proceeded to tell me how she DREAMED of this smear in the days following our stop here! Definitely recommend!2. Bone Marrow - This was probably one of the most disappointing dishes I've had in a while. Mostly because it was so incredibly hyped on Yelp and it was sooooo not good. The Bone Marrow itself was on the greasy side, but it was easy to carve out and had a good texture. HOWEVER, when you add the bread that was disgustingly over buttered and greasy PLUS the grease from the bone marrow, it felt like biting into a giant doughy ball of oil. Literally, every bite would fill my mouth with grease..blehhhh it makes me a bit sick to think about it. Either don't saturate the bread in oil or don't grease up the marrow..it really shouldn't be both. really really.3. The braised pork - This was dish was pretty good. The meat just fell off in bits, but I honestly didn't think I could stomach very much after the bone marrow. If I come back here, I might just stick with the feta and cucumber."
"Yum yum. We came here because of the yelp reviews and were pleasantly surprised. We went with the servers recommendations and ordered the pork fried almonds with Rosemary and garlic, marinated olives, the meatball slider ( it only comes with one but it's yummy), and the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Everything was pretty good but the pork shoulder was the best we've ever had including Germany's pork shoulder which they are famous for. It literally fell off the bone and melted in our mouths. It's worth going to just for that. They Serve incredibly small portions and if the service is just okay but as I said That pork shoulder is worth it."
"Stopped by on a Monday night around 9:30pm...still crowded, but we were seated immediately at a large table shared with other diners.The food was amazing! Ingredients are fresh and full of flavor...we tried about six different dishes, including the ""JLT"" (Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg), Mussels (with Pancetta, Crème Fraîche & Marjoram), and Wagyu Sirloin Tip (with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette). Everything was fantastic!Keep in mind portions are purposefully small, so each person will need 2-4 items to make for a solid meal. Pricing is about average for a tapas-style restaurant. Service was prompt and friendly. I love trying new restaurants, but next time I come back to Chicago, I may have to have a repeat session at Purple Pig...it's that good!"
"Great wine selections from all over the world,except the US. Being a California Winemaker it takes a lot for me to accept they don't want my wines but the list is dynamic and the food is great. My server is Chris, nice guy."
"I went to Chicago on business a few weeks back, and everyone recommended the Purple Pig.  I was extremely impressed with the restaurant.  The food was spectacular and the service was on point.  We decided to share a few items from the menu (6 total for 2 people).  The highlights include the beef chips & milk braised pork shoulder.  The beef chips were light, fluffy and full of flavor.  The pork was falling apart tender. We also tried the calamari. Not your typical calamari since it was not fried. Instead, it was served like a couscous salad with fresh herbs, cucumber and radish.Overall, I had a a wonderful experience.  I will warn you, be prepared for a wait. Luckily, you can leave your number and they will call you when your table is ready."
"A memorable place for many reasons.First of all, a very very long wait time. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and oh boy was it crowded. We sat out on the porch and ordered a bottle of champagne to wait around and while the champagne was great, I thought I would turn into the ice bucket that it was in.After waiting for an hour or so we were seated indoor next to a bunch of people and it was a bit loud. The atmosphere was well-decorated though.We had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Roased Bone Marrow Shmear, Pork Chops, and the Nutella Panini. I believe we ordered more but I don't remember.The Pork Shoulder was tender and it was just as great as all the reviews. The Bone Marrow, I'd have to say, was a bit too oily for me but my boyfriend really like it. The Pork Chops was great - flavorful and good-sized. Nutella Panini was like little fireworks going on in my mouth.I admit the food was great but I feel like they could do something about the efficiency of the people waiting. Since they have so much business, I hope they could expand in the near future!"
"It's the place to go if you want to have bone marrow. However, I find it too greasy. The taste was amazing though. Its more than enough for two people if you are ordering food. We also ordered calamary which was the best I ever had. Nothing like an ordinary calamary dish you get elsewhere. We also tried Italian sausage was also juicy and delic. However I'm very disappointed in the fried chicken. It was undercooked and nothing special. Loved the environment and vibe. Staff very nice. Always line up. It tales at least half an hour yo get it."
"If you put down your name first and have someone check out the bar area, sometimes you can catch someone as they're leaving. If you do, it's first come first serve so I would highly suggest doing that because waiting in a 45 min-1hr line is just ridic! With that said, that is exactly what I did.We ordered their bone marrow- which I thought was good, but very heavy and would share it among 3-4 people.Their pork shoulder was way to salty for us and we returned it because it was almost uneatable. fried pigs ear was good, esp with the kale! I'd say this is a must get! But after eating this and then ordering the chorizo, it was too greasy for me. I'd suggest ordering that when you have a small little group going."
"Everything you hear and more! Believe the hype. Worth the wait. Sat at the bar and had the most knowledgeable, friendly server/bar tender. Knew the menu to a tee. Cannot wait to return and attack the menu!"
"No reservations, so the wait can be insane. Stop by early and put your name down. THEN go and do something touristy while you wait. They'll call youThe service was terrible. Our waiter couldn't be bothered to help us and only showed up once or twice leaving us quite confused.The food was ok. Pig ear was awesome. The ocotpus wasn't that great. The JLT was ok. The braised pork shoulder was tender but extremely salty.I heard you are suppose to mix and match food so you can mix flavors. We got each dish one at a time and everything was super salty.Wasn't worth the 3 hour wait."
"Fun place on the mag mile, and plates aregreat for sharing.  It wasn't the kind of place that would be a go-to repeat but worth trying out.  We sat a high table and space was a little cramped."
"Went with a friend on a whim! They don't take reservations, so we put our names down and wandered around for a bit. It only took about half an hour for them to get to us, though, which is totally reasonable for a Friday night on Michigan Avenue.We ordered the butternut squash, mussels, blade steak, and milk-braised pork shoulder. Of those, my favorites were the mussels and the pork shoulder - both must-orders. The pork shoulder just melts in your mouth and the mashed potatoes that come with it are delicious. Our server was really friendly and helped us navigate the menu (since it was our first time there).Came out to about $30 per person. Probably couldn't make this restaurant a weekly trip, but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
"This is my all time favorite Chicago restaurant.  The atomosphere, food, wine choices and pricetag (hello!) cannot be topped.  Of course, this comes with a wait, but I don't mind this... I check in, leave my number and mosy over to Sable for cocktails before hand.  What I like most is that there is something on the menu for everyone... the veggies are as delicious as the pork dishes!  Keep it up, PP!"
"Great portions, excellent flavor, fair prices, and accessible wine options. I'm always impressed and leave with great memories."
"This is a perfect place for when you see to many ""must try"" on a menu. Portions are smaller but thats a good thing. Allows you to try more than just one splendid meal."
"This is my favorite spot in Chicago.  This is the 4th time I have eaten here and keep trying different items.  This time we got to meet Jimmy (Chef) and he was so nice and down to earth.  He assumed we did not know who he was, so humble.  We paired the fried manchago with 2 different meat options and that was perfect way to start.  I loved the eggplant spread with the goat cheese toast but my wife did not as she thought it would be warm.  We had the Pork Blade Steak and Wagu Short Ribs and both were GREAT.  You cannot go wrong with ANY dish."
"ah-maz-ing.The Purple Pig is a fantastic tapas bar.It's constantly packed and the smell of all the great food is intoxicating. If you go, you must have the bone marrow. It is so decadent and buttery. I'm drooling just thinking about it."
"MORE THAN JUST PORK!  For starters, Roasted beets with ricotta and pistachios were divine and the marinated tuna very innovative.  Grilled halibut was perfectly prepared with flavorful, but not overpowering, olive tapenade style topping.  Friend had lamb and was very pleased.  Desert of Sicilian iris, a brioche with cheese and chocolate filling was a winner, as was the peanut butter concoction.   Flavors  and textures are to be savored...would like to give the food a 5 and the slightly ""campy"" seating and order of food  service a 4 ... Wait staff and hostesses were  quite helpful, but I would echo other reviewers that the system of no reservation  and food served as ready is not quite in keeping with the quality of the food.  Overall this was far above average food, good service and a very good value.  Vegetarians would not have a problem and there are plenty of entrees in addition to tapas .   I plan to return!"
Get there when it opens at noon. Each dish more likes tapas than a main dish. But you can always add anything you want. So lucky to have razor clams which is not on manu. It tastes so so so good! And I love crispy pig ear! Bone is famous and worth to try. Everything is good and it's definitely a good end for our Chicago trip! Thanks.
"Mehhh. I don't get what the big idea is here. Long lines, no reservations. I think it's because it's been on Food Network, but the food isn't all that great. It's a cute place to get dolled up for with a big group, but not worth the money, really. Fun atmosphere, I'll give you that. I've had better tasting small plates though. Only go to impress by location. Pick another spot if you want to impress by taste. - Ham Panini- Espresso- Chicken Kebabs"
"Went here for an anniversary, The atmosphere was fun and service was good. The food itself was all very salty and all seemed to revolve around the same flavors."
Some of the most unique food combinations I've ever had. Everything was very tasty. I highly recommend the beets.
"Great Tapas, great food, great atmosphere. Come here with a large group and try everything out and you will be impressed because every single dish I had was very delicious. The only downside is that sometimes service is hit or miss and there are communal tables here as well.."
"Valentines Day, and after a long day at the Art Institute trying to understand much of the modern art, we decide to go back to something more comfortable and natural... delicious well made food.We walked in without a reservation around 2 PM and was seated immediately at a communal table.  Service was fast, friendly, and had great suggestions for us being first timers here.  Here's the meal:Beets and Goat Cheese:  Salt roasted beets that were so sweet, you could practically sell this stuff to a sugar addicted kid on Halloween night.  Combined with a whipped goat cheese (making it extremely fluffy and airy) along with diced pistachios, this was our my favorite dish of the night.Roasted Bone Marrow:  Six slices of toasted bread, and two huge bones slices in half with oozing marrow to spread over the bread.  Succulent, heavy, rich, and delicious... personally, the perfect amount to eat is 1-1.5 pieces, so ideally shared on a double date, but a couple could easily finish this off based on flavor alone as well.  We did.  Pig's Ear:  So thinly sliced and then coated and crisped perfectly, this is practically cheating in my opinion.. having grown up eating real pig's ears that have been braised for hours, there was no chew or bite to the ear cartilage.  This was basically like eating calamari (albeit VERY good).  The crisped kale added great texture, and the egg on top brings the dish together nicely.  Delicious dish, even if you really don't get to taste the pig ears for their true nature.Milk braised pork shoulder:  Per the waitress, a three day process.  Super tender, great flavor.  Had I not have had great pork shoulder before that was comparable, this would've blown my mind.  Delicious dish, but others on the menu were more eye opening and inspiring to me for new techniques to learn.We decided to try a couple desserts as well, since we're not likely to come here often... but left somewhat disappointed from a price to ingenuity ratio.  Here's the info:Nutella Panini - Just what you'd imagine.  Melted nutella with marshmallow creme and bananas.  If you've ever made nutella or PB banana sandwiches at home on the frying pan, this is comparable.  Very tasty, but not awe-inspiring.Peppermint soft serve - I'm not a soft serve fan, so I'm not even sure why we got this... I think we were just so caught up in how amazing savory courses were, we ended up losing our mind on the dessert portion.  Softserve flavored with peppermint, with crushed peppermints throughout.  Clean, refreshing, but again not awe-inspiring.To be fair, my wife and I definitely have experimented a lot in the dessert realm, and we always like to check out restaurants for things that we cannot produce at home or haven't tried before.Verdict:  Seriously, a phenomenal place to eat... the dishes are well thought out, well put together, and delicious in every bite.  Even though we tried the ""favorites"" by recommendation of the waitress, we look forward to coming back to try some of the rest of the very EXPANSIVE menu."
"Waited about an hour for a table but was able to get drinks while sitting outside. Just started ordering lots of food and realized we ordered too much, but that was part of the fun. The Jamon Serrano was wonderful as was the calamari."
"I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to try The Purple Pig. My friend and I had a fantastic dinner, and I'm already planning when I can return to explore more of their menu.My favorites of the night: Chicken Thigh Kabab with Fried Crispy Potatoes and Yogurt Tzatziki (definitely not a boring chicken dish).Roasted Marrow Bones (better than Longman & Eagle's).Sicilan Iris (fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate). I would order those dishes again. Really exceptional. The skewered scallops with chickpea aioli were great as was the nutella banana marshmallow panino, but I would try other dishes next time. Many rave about the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy. In my opinion, tasty but overrated. There are more intriguing menu items to be had.The room is lively and energetic. The tables (individual and communal) are close together. The noise level is more loud than quiet. Reservations are not accepted. (My friend and I waited 90 minutes when we arrived on a Tuesday at 7pm). Casual dress code. The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient despite the restaurant being full. The servers and bussers worked at a brisk pace, but we never felt rushed during our meal. Prices are very reasonable given the portion size, quality of the food, and location of this restaurant. $125 pre-tip for two half bottles of wine and six dishes. The kitchen is doing a superb job. Highly recommend. The Purple Pig reminds me somewhat of Avec."
"The menu is insane. Which is to say, there's a lot going on.  In a little way I feel like it's trying too hard, but more than that it is impressive.  Still, the night started with a discussion of the rather rough deal the de-cocked cock, served as an entree for two got, a process that supposedly makes the chicken more tender.  I imagine it'd make me bitter.  At that point our emcee / waitress / bartender for the night Jamie, figured this was going to be fun and casual.  And it was.  It's an upscale wine bar that played Xzibit as we walked in and started off with chat of castrated chicken and only got stranger from there.  I could do much worse.  The cocktail menu is not less strange -- with discussions of a liquor that's like this, but not really, really it's not like anything else you should try it or a suggested drink that was clear across on the other side of the drink spectrum.  Still we had faith and were not let down.  Weeks later I still crave the rilette (I could have eaten a full sandwich's worth) and my biggest problem might be the somewhat cheesy logo / branding.  But honestly, I'm making a rilette this weekend... Before leaving we asked our now partner-in-crime Jamie for advice of other spots in the neighborhood.   She listed off -- Pops, Clark Street, a few others... Snicker's she said, ""well, it's something.""  Which leads us to... Snicker's!"
"One of the best meals that I have had. We tried this place out based on the many many great Yelp reviews. When we got there it was quite crowded we were told it would be about an hour+ wait; luckily we found a place at the bar. First we tried the friend brussels sprouts - they were excellent, I loved the crunch with a touch of lemon. Next we had the carrot salad, also very delicious, it tasted very fresh and the toasted quinoa was a great topping. We had the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - I HIGHLY recommend this dish. The meat was very well seasoned and so tender. I would have ordered it again if my husband would have let me. We also had the chirozo stuffed olives which my husband thought were okay and we finished with the JLT - which we also thought was delicious. If I could afford it, I would eat every meal for my 3 day stay in Chicago at the Purple Pig."
"My new fave place in Chicago.  Came for a small lunch bite, but wished that I had tried more.  The JLT was superb. I'm not exactly sure what a jowl is, but it sure is tasty.  I expected the sunnyside duck egg to be gamey, but it wasn't.  The yolk complemented the whole dish.  The hubby had a pork blade steak that was very well seasoned.  The little side salad was a tad over dressed, but it was more of a decoration than a salad so who cares.  We shared the roasted califlower that was packed full of these little gherkin pickles. They also had an extensive wine list, but we did not imbibe.  I will surely visit the Purple Pig again the next time I'm in town.  I'll also bring a bigger appetite.  Yum."
"If you can get a seat, I'd certainly do so because the tapas here are creative and phenomenal. As our waitress told us, just go with what you think tastes good because the menu is very large. I'll give some suggestions though on what I thought was good.1. Bone Marrow Spread2. Quail3. Pigs Ear4. Panino Con NutellaLarge groups can be a hassle here, so come with 1-2 people and don't eat for the whole day :D"
The food was fabulous and the service was outstanding!  Went with a vegetarian and we still easily found enough different things to try that we both left absolutely stuffed.
"My experience was superb, my group got there late from an event and the staff was so accommodating! Not to mention the exceptional service we were given!!! That was icing on the cake because the food was to die for!!! Milk braised pork shoulder!! Heavenly and the salt & vinegar beef tendons!! Amazing. I'm from NYC and this restaurant sold me on Chicago!!!! Five stars!!"
Only time for a quick tip the palace is not to be missed for foodies great service great wine we had no wait. I'll be back. Great music as well.
"Ambiance was great and I really enjoyed the vibe.  However,  the meal was just ok and way to expensive for what was served.  Each dish is expected to be shared but the plates are so small that between two people you are likely to only get one bite. This wouldn't be so bad if the average cost per plate wasn't $17.00. We spent about $150.00 and still left hungry.  Nice place but I won't be going back if I can help it. For some reason this place has pretty high reviews. .don't believe the hype!"
I can not fathom why anyone would give this restaurant less than five stars....Every single thing I have consumed from this place has been unbelievably delicious. So they have waits.... Yup So the service is not always on par.... Yup It's because the quality is undeniable. Period
"OMG, it's like a beehive in here. Lots of activity, and staff buzzing purposefully around. The place is quite small, and there is a large L-shaped bar that hugs the kitchen. Folks sitting here can watch all of the cooks fighting for space while whipping up their delicacies in the kitchen. I did this for quite some time while sipping a glass of red wine and waiting for my friend to arrive. They move intelligently. Every footstep has been choreographed, like a dance. They have to, otherwise they'd probably be tripping over each other. The best way to describe the overall vibe would be ""Controlled Chaos"".I was in food heaven, and here's what I tried:Chorizo Stuffed Olives 3/5 (meh... Good, not great)Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese 5/5 (I would fly back to Chicago for this!)Butternut Squash with Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Ricotta Salata Cheese 4.5/5 (sweet and delicious, melts in your mouth, unbelievably good)Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula 3.5/5 ( wasn't loving the crumbly bun)Salt Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette 3.5/5Turkey Leg Confit with Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agrodolce 4/5 (the turkey was sooooo tenter, ever mouthful literally melted in your mouth, chewing was optional)Unfortunately, by the time we'd eaten our way to the beets and turkey, I was too full to be able to really enjoy it the way I would have liked to. Dessert wasn't even an option.All of the staff were very friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable. Many could even explain the specific techniques used to prepare the food (confit, for example, we learned is a style of cooking where the meat is cooked often in its own fat, but in the case of the turkey, pork fat, and it is cooked for about 15 hours ""low and slow""). We had a great time, and ended up being in the restaurant for over 2 hours. The entire dinner was not just a meal, it's an experience, and I highly recommend it!"
"Come here.  D e l i c i o u s.  Five stars hands down for the food. I thought that everything was spiced and seasoned to perfection. We had charred octopus as our main, and finished the meal with mousse and espresso for dessert. Yum : )"
"I have had a couple dining feasts here, and love all the food. The meat and cheese plates are of course, impressive. The pork belly is delicious. I once had a citrus corn salad that was awesome. The toasted breads are really yummy. Everything is good. It gets pricey, but it's not too bad.The big community style tables get super crowded, but that's my only complaint. One time I barely had room to eat. The outdoor seating is cute.Basically, really good place to eat lots of kinds of meats!"
"I am having hard time understanding the fame of this place. Seriously what is it? Is that the wait? They told me it's 2 hours and 45 minutes for the next table when I went there at 7pm. Never heard such thing before.Is that the service? They called after 80 minutes and told me that my table is ready. I was nice enough to tell them that I will do my best to come as soon as possible and that would probably take half an hour since we just opened up a bottle of wine somewhere else thinking that there is more than an hour for my table to be ready. Guess what? They said I will either come in 10 minutes or they will give my table to someone else. I chucked a bottle of wine so that I don't start restaurant hopping on a Saturday night.Food?? Seriously guys, what did you like about the bone marrow? It tastes good but all the flavor is from the toast not the marrow. Dip your bread to butter and add cholesterol at its finest along with +800 calories from the marrow and there you go. Rest of the menu is only okay though they have a nice wine selection.Could give 3 stars only for food. Overall 2."
"2 hr wait turned into only a 50 min wait . BIG win for us!Pro - superb maître d . Nice friendly & on the ball. Called us table is ready and will wait for us to gather our group of 12!Food - fantastic ...ordered purple pig platter ... Great selection of charcuterie Mussels ...  2 toast about 12 musselsPigs heart panini Lamb Blade steak - great even for non-lamb loverPork shoulder - a bit salty but yummy w breadSecretoRib tips - yumPigs tailSquid - yum QuailBiG FAIL - the server Ulises sucks ... He needs to b trained .. Bad serviceHe does not like to talk ... And the little he did ... Did not like to b interrupted ... Just stood there when we told him each person was going to order an item .A well trained waiter or server would 1) go to each guest and ask what he/she would like2) ask if the guest would like bread and explain that it would take a few minutes since toasting the bread takes time3) bring out at least 12 pieces of toasted baguette for 12 people not 8 ..  Better yet, bring out 204) ask or recommend wine when he/see guest try to decipher wine list5) would not have an arrogant attitude.I would go back and specifically make sure I'm not served by him!Busboy should learn to go around the guest to wipe the table, not go over the guest and reach to the other side of table in attempt to wipe table.Oh .. Have a little more lighting under the tent would help ... Would have loved to order more food but Ulises was not interested in taking additional orders .Great experiences minus ulises !I'm going to rate Purple Pig based on the restaurant, not b/c of an idiot obnoxious waiter."
Not sure why I skipped out on reviewing this place. I really enjoyed being at The Purple Pig but it's not a restaurant I would visit again unless taking people from out of town. The setting was very comfortable but unfortunately the food was good; I was hoping for great.The borrow marrow was enjoyable. Braised pork shoulder was nice.Would pass on the calamariWould pass on the clams. Unique dishes with great flavors all around. Service was excellent. Price is what you'd expect going to an establishment with their reputation. I'd recommend going at least once for the experience. 3.5 stars.
"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We were visiting from New Hampshire, and we went there based off internet suggestions and were completely satisfied. The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, and extremely knowledgable on the food selections. They had a very large selection of speciality wines and cheeses, as well as impeccable swine meat choices and quality. To start with, we got a olive oil marinated tuna with roasted red peppers, green beans, and quail eggs which was to die for. My boyfriend got a JLT which came on thick bread with pig jowels (aka bacon), tomato and cheese with an over easy egg open faced sandwich. I got the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Everything was perfectly cooked and incredible. Definitely go!!!"
"Terrific dinner. Loved the good and wine list. I chose it for the wine list and it did not disappoint. Had an Alsace Riesling and Greek Assrytiko. Both great wines. Bar staff knowledgeable about wines. Enjoyed beet salad w goat mousse. Mussels w pancetta were some of the best I've ever had. There was a long wait but since I was a party of one, I slid immediately into an empty seat."
"Very fun place to go with some friends! You're going to have to wait a while - I think our wait time was about 1.5 to 2 hours, but they take your phone number and call you so you can go walk up and down Michigan Ave while you're waiting - but it's worth the wait just for the experience. Even waiting in line for the bathroom everyone talks about what they're eating, and making recommendations about what you should try. If you're looking for a fun place to grab a meal, this should be high on your list.Once the cold weather hits they have sort of tent seating with lots of heaters. This is good, as the actual restaurant is tiny, but I do recommend bringing layers so you can take off your jacket but still be warm if you're sitting outside (or inside, really, since the door opens often enough that there is a consistent cool breeze going through).As far as the bone marrow - while fine, it's not something I would personally order again unless someone in my group had not had it before. The presentation is fun, and it's neat to say you've had it, but it just didn't do it for me as something that is a go-to item on the menu. Everything else we had was absolutely delightful, though!"
"The food here is absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I visited twice and the first time service was good, but the second time the service was terrible. There was something floating in my water and I couldn't get anyone's attention to get a new water. By the time we wanted to pay we couldn't get anybody's attention either (we were at the bar so we found this ridiculous that there was only one bartender and a bartender who had seemed to leave, for an extremely busy bar). We will be back eventually, but there is no urgency like after the first time."
Rude rude rude rude! Food was okay to decent but ambiance and service is atrocious. Wouldn't recommend or return.
"I went here for my mom's birthday on the 4th of July and they didn't take reservations. The wait was over an hour but it was well worth it! We ordered a few things from every section and the only ones I wasn't really a fan of were the antipasti. The wines, cocktails, and food were all amazing. Our server knew a lot about the menu and spaced out our items very well. I can't wait to go back!"
Great experience  Good for groups and worth the wait - especially if you can have a drink outside while your table is being prepared.Staff was very helpful with wheat/gluten allergy.
"This place is for tourists.  The pork shoulder was overly salty and I generally like my food on the salty side.  The egg plant balls were flavorless, the heirloom tomato salad was average, and the breading on the sweet breads was heavy.  The service was below average, if not border line rude.  The only plus was they have a decent selection of sub $40 bottles of vino.  There are plenty of more creative and better places."
"The wait was about 30-40 mins but they call your cell phone versus giving you a pager to carry so we actually walked up and down the magnificent mile while waiting for the call. Ordered the pork shoulder, the salt and vinegar pork tenderloin and the pork secreto. The portions vary, some are smaller than what you would expect for an entree but they are full of flavor. The server said that two people usually split 5 plates, but considering the food is a bit on the heavy side we were good with 3 plates. I would definitely come back and try other plates."
"Delicious! I have been here twice and it is always a pleasure. The first time I had the sepia, and it was probably the best I have ever had. Unfortunately, they do not have it on their menu anymore, so I opted for their octopus and it was great! My friends also had the bone marrow which they said was delicious and the fish, which was very great too! Basically, everything on their menu is great! The seating is very close, but you are still able to carry on private conversation. It would still make a great date place. :-)"
"This place is awesome, and always crowded for a reason.  They deserve five stars as the food wine offerings are excellent.  I've been at least 5 times, and never had a bad experience.  Sitting outside is fine, but I prefer to be inside.  This is a lively atmosphere, and tables are close together.The menu is fairly complex, with tons to offer.  If you've never been, talk to your server for recommendations, and how you should structure your order.Yesterday's grades are as follows;Calamari app = goodchorizo stuffed olives = very goodpork neck bone w/ gravy = very goodLamb = nice taste, but a lot of work; fattychicken thigh kebabs = excellentRed Wine (Babic; Croatia) = very good, earthy w/ slight fruit taste In the past I've had the pork shoulder, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, beets, cured meats and cheeses, mussels, and others.Everything I've had here is good; you really can't go wrong."
"I hate to say it, but I feel like this is one of those spots that you might like only if you don't eat out much or if you're merely into eating out to cross off token adventure items (nothing wrong with them, just should be done well). It's a bit loud, rather touristy, and while it's not always bad to get into (especially later dinner times), it's also not really somewhere I'd send someone from another big city to get a taste of what Chicago's great at doing, food-wise. The menu is pretty heavy, and in my experience, it seems that the flavors are sacrificed for the sake of novel ingredients (whether it's less than ripe tomatoes or slightly off-tasting sauces)."
"Came here for a late brunch. We came a bit too early before the store opened and got seated quite quickly. The roasted bone marrow is awesome, especially the toasted breads. Highly Recommended!!!! The downside is this place is very packed."
"Wow. Yes to the following;Butternut Squash BeetsOctopusTurkey LegPork Shoulder with GravyBut I must admit, many of the meals here are very, very, very....very salty.I eat out all the time. I spent more than I would've like and ashamed to admit last year on eating out alone. And trust me when I say that these meals are overly salty, especially the pork shoulder with the gravy. The pork steak was equally so. Some other dishes we got were forgettable. Especially, I would have to say, MEHHHH to the Bone Marrow.Good place overall. Long wait. At least an hour wait for dinner. But why not run across the street and grab a drink at MJ Steakhouse Lounge while you wait?"
"Just a wonderful meal. Very busy place but we managed to get a spot at the bar.  The pigs ears were excellent!  Also enjoyed the bone marrow.  The broccoli was perfect!  I ordered the sweet breads but was not that impressed with them.  Overall, this is now my favourite restaurant in Chicago!  Will definitely return there next time I'm in Chicago and will recommend this place to everybody!"
"Shit taste. Had four dishes, pigs ear, milk pork, bone marrow and squid. Everything is sinked in oil. Have no idea how this restaurant got so many good reviews."
"You can't beat The Purple Pig. The pig is always my first choice to take family and friends visiting Chicago. The servers are amazing and always offer the best dish combination recommendations. My favorites are the Petit Basque Cheese with Membrillo, Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli and the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta. For dessert, the Sicilian Iris is an unbelievable piece of fried chocolatey heaven! If you're lucky enough to meet the Sommelier, make sure to seek his/her wine recommendations for the perfect pairing. Casual and comfortable, the social atmosphere offers bar seating and communal tables.There usually is a lengthy wait time, but if the weather is nice you can always sip a glass of vino outside where seating and heated lamps create a cozy setting. You're also in an ideal location to shop along Michigan Ave after you dine like European royalty. Relax and enjoy!"
"Cheese, wine an swine! Great selection of European wines and tapas dishes, great for sharing."
"Went here during our vacation to Chicago. It was right across from hour hotel, I was able to get seated right away without a reservation for lunch. Great service, great food."
"I could live in Salt...Holy sodium bomb! Brought the Sisters to PP during their visit to Chicago. Service was great, super loud place....I was yelling at my Sister across the table most of the meal.  I like the idea of mediterranean small plates but salt was the dominant force here. What was the line from that movie,  you can always add it, but you can't take it away... Hour wait to get in which was fine for a Friday.  The atmosphere is fun and lively and it's cool it has an open kitchen but that's where you can see the food crimes in action. The ""salt guy"" was back there throwin' the stuff around all over the place. I think that was his job in the process. Too bad because masked the flavors on most of the dishes, meatball slider, chicken kabobs and calimari with radishes.The best options were the ones they had to leave alone.... cheese. Deserts were inventive and who doesn't love nutella fried sandos right? Overall, fun night and I'd go back. The communal seating is a good way to dine but c'mon guys... lighten up on the crutch and let the food speak for itself. Sure, as Americans we love it. McDonalds has been training us for years and we know it sells more booze and tastes great but it was too much. I noted the prices were pretty reasonable as I signed the check with my swollen fingers..."
Get the bone marrow app!!! You won't be disappointed. The milk braised pork shoulder and the JLT pork bowl are also must-haves. This restaurant alone was worth my trip to Chicago. Do yourself a solid and try this place- it holds up to the hype.
"Went with 3 other girls and we ordered the following:Service was decent. The hostess forgot to let us know it's an additional 15 minutes if we added someone to our reservation. That annoyed me. Then our waitress was ridiculous! She kept telling us to basically stop ordering and we are ordering way too much. At this point we had ordered 2 out of the 6 things we ordered. Seriously? We played a joke on her and pretended like the menu (which is all basically plates to share) and asked her ""we are all done with appetizers, can we please have the dinner menu now"" lolHere is some feedback on some dishes: Bone Marrow was a great price point compared to other restaurants and was great. Eggplant Parmesan Balls - great and unique but nothing amazingly special. I probably wouldn't order these next time but worth trying. Whipped Feta with Cucumbers - loved! texture is a little weird but taste is greatEggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE! obviously you have to like eggplant but amazing! so so good. This is def a fun experience. Cool, hip, trendy environment. Great for a no pressure date. Tip on reservations - well, they don't take reservations and there is usually an hour wait so what we do is we walk over, put our names down and give them our cell. They call us and we have 15 minutes to show up or we get passed up. Great thing is you can run next door to Nordstrom!"
"We sat outside under their purple umbrellas. I liked trying out a variety of their tapas. Everything was delicious. Some things seemed weird, but I liked it! Too bad some of the items I found on Yelp weren't available that day. We started with the bone marrow and I didn't know it was a smear. Next was the panini, then we just kept ordering more and more food till we were full. The fried brussel sprouts was yummy! I don't remember what everything was called. You won't be disappointed when you come here. ;)"
"It seems to be that you need to start any review of the purple pig with what you ate and how you liked it, so here we go:Charred Cauliflower - a little salty but overall great texture and taste; Crispy on the outside, flavorful on the inside.Beets with Goat cheese - very disappointed. Many people recommended it but I couldn't get past the texture... It could just be that I hate beets. However, they did come in handy for one of the dishes I will be mentioning soon.Fried Brussel Sprouts - An interesting taste and texture. I'd have to compare it to soggy potato chips, which I know sounds disgusting, but I was pleasantly surprised. A good choice to balance out all the meat you will undoubtedly be consuming.Roasted Bone Marrow - Not for everyone but for those who want a soft, creamy, almost-like-butter spread for the toasted bread that accompanies the dish, this is a must-try. Don't forget to salt your bone marrow for maximum taste efficiency.Milk-braised Pork Shoulder - The pork is extremely tender and pairs perfectly with the beets I mentioned above. Because the beets are so sweet, it almost reminds me of the cranberry+turkey combination that's become famous during Thanksgiving. Definitely one of my favorites.Scallops Spiedini - I don't think I can ever write a negative review about scallops... and I'm not about to start now. Perfectly cooked and it is perfectly complimented by the aioli it is served with.Overall, it's a great meal and I'd give it 4.5 stars if it could. The only half-star dock is for the price, which I think is too high for the quantity of food. If a meal for two ends up being close to 80 dollars without wine, I'd consider it a little on the high side. And as I mentioned before, the food is excellent, but it's not a transcendent experience.A few other notes:- be prepared for communal dining- try not to come in large parties as you might have to wait a while- casual really means casual. I wore basketball shorts and a hoodie"
"This is probably the worst places I have been to in chicago. I ordered a negroni and this is my first time ordering a negroni. I knew it had a lot of liquor but it was probably too much for me to bear. After ordering it, after a sip of it, I felt like throwing up. It was incredibly strong for my taste and I wanted to switch my drink. I did not expect the server to exchange it for me, I only expected him to be sympathetic and just tell me that it happens and it's okay! Instead, the guy got back to me and said that it's all liquor, and what else will you expect expression! No joking about it and outright charging me for it without any clarifications! I wanted to eat something there but I chose to avoid the place because of their attitude and behaviour. I also felt the guy was racist and he did not attend us well cause we were Indians! I am sorry to say but this place made me feel unwelcome in the states and I would never ever recommend this place to any of my friends.  He told others his name and when it came to us he just took the order and gave us the drinks. Only business you see!  I don't know why would you make someone feel so unwelcome. Negative stars from my side! Avoid it at any cost if you are not white!"
"There's a reason this place has 2 hour wait times. It's just that good. Put your name in, leave your phone number, and go get a drink elsewhere.Get anything and everything, but you can't go wrong with the corn/arugula/pesto, pork neck bone smear, turkey leg confit, or the roasted pork shoulder."
"Yummy place!  Everything was great. Must haves are kale salad, cornbread and halibut. Do the cheese platter and let the chef pick the cheeses!!"
My friend & I happened to spot this place while walking down Michigan Ave & we were so glad we did! Love this place!! Not only did they have our favorite wine but we also enjoyed a fantastic appetizer...fried cheese! Delicious!
"We had the turkey leg, roasted cauliflower, chicken kabab, eggplant goat cheese spread, and summer squash salad. All of it was amazing especially the turkey leg! It just fell off the bone and was super juicy and perfectly seasoned. Wine selection is also great! Would definitely recommend eating here but be prepared to have a drink and wait about an hour, they don't take reservations. Can't wait to go back!"
"Worth the wait every time. We went twice on our recent trip to Chicago. If you have a chance to chat with Jamie at the bar take it! We had a bunch of vegetarian options- Whipped feta ( a little salty and make sure to ask for extra bread), charred cauliflower, fried deviled eggs (my favorite), fried smashed potatoes, and burrata- there might have been more but those were the highlights. The best choice we made was to have a peanut butter dessert with ginger whipped cream.  Try lots of different things. ASK QUESTIONS- All the servers were incredible in helping us decide what to order. If theres a long wait- grab a drink on the patio and enjoy people watching."
"Was in Chicago for work and dined solo, but had a lovely meal. I'm vegetarian, so while drawn by the great reviews, was a bit worried about finding enough to eat at a place called The Purple Pig. I had a delicious summer squash salad to start and an eggplant ""smear"" (okay, not a great name, but friggin amazing). I'm an eggplant-aholic and this blew me away with its rich flavours and texture (beans, stewed tomato, large chunks of eggplant, served with goat cheese on toast)"
"I saw this on Yelp and took 3 colleagues with me to dinner. We called for a reservation and they don't take any. They said the wait was 30 minutes at the time so we went right in at 6:15. We were surprised to see how small the place was and were packed in while waiting until we were seated at 7:45pm.  We would have been seated faster if we were just 2 people since there are few tables for 4.  We got our menus and noticed right away that our server was not in a good mood.  She wasn't a bad server, just not pleasant.  Having never eaten in such a place, we go the chef's choice on cheese and meat appetizers. Cheese was very nice and the meat was italian cold cuts other than the Testas, which was PIg's Head that was basically a Pate. Everything was tasty but salty.We each ordered another appetizer Salt & Vinegar Pork Tendon chips, Bone Marrow and something else which were all pretty tasty but salty and surprisingly greasy/oily.We each ordered a main dish. Chicken Kebabs were tasty but salty and oily. The Beef Tenderloins were very tasty, prepared medium and very juicy and flavorful. I got a Pork Steak, which I thought was my beef tenderloins, it was VERY salty and Greasy, but tasty. Overall, the service was mediocre, the ambiance was interesting but way too packed for my liking and the food was tasty and greasy. I couldn't get the salt taste out of my mouth all night and still tasted it with breakfast the next day. At least I didn't need to add salt on my eggs at breakfast :) I am really not sure how to rate this place. It was fun to try new foods, but overall I was not that impressed. If you are 20 something with an iron stomach and want to be seen, then this i s a great place. Otherwise it's an experience to try once."
"I admit it, there isn't a ton on this menu that I'll eat. I'm not a big meat-eater and I go here because the manfriend loves it, but of the things that I have eaten, I have to say all have been really good. The scallops with the chickpea aoili are delicious, and they are my go-to fish option on the menu. My other favorite item on the menu is the shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino... so good! We recently had the whipped goat cheese with cucumbers on toast, and wow. I'm not normally a huge goat cheese person but this was delicious as well. So that is about the list of things I'll eat willingly here. Things I've eaten non-willingly include the pigs ear (I admit, it was great, and I now understand why pig ears were always my dog's favorite treats), bone marrow (Nope. Not gonna do it again.), pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (This was OK, but still not my cup of tea). The main reason for a 4-star review is 1) I've always had pretty exceptional service here, the waiters know their stuff whether it be about wine, cheese or the food... and 2) the manfriend loves this place more than life itself. He has a self-admitted pork addiction and if that's all it takes to keep him happy? Then sign me up.The wait times here can definitely get out of hand... I personally wouldn't wait for an hour or two, but 15-20 minutes? Sure, why not. Go early and you'll get seated much more quickly."
"What says Chicago cuisine better than a restaurant that is dedicated to pig? The Purple Pig honors this succulent beast by using all of the parts from the ear, neck, tail, and bones.  This place gets packed fast. We arrived 20 minutes after opening and there was already a 45 minute wait. Luckily for me, we got the best seats in the house - right in front of the preparation area. Many people criticize that the dishes are on the salty side but it's the flavor profile of pork. The portions are small but you can order several dishes while trying different parts of the animal. We went with the pig ears, roasted bone marrow, and parmesan eggplant balls. The pig ears reminded me of a twist on cracklins served with a runny egg and fried greens. Some hot sauce or Tabasco would have finished the dish perfectly. The roasted bone marrow tastes like a gelatinous oil with a roasted flavor. It paired well with the crusty bread, greens, and lemon vinaigrette. The fried eggplant balls were mini bites of traditional eggplant parmesan in tapas form. Not particularly outstanding but a good filler. The Purple Pig brings out true porky goodness with innovation. Mr. Oink does look better in purple."
This place is overrated and not worth the trouble.  Waited over 1.5 hour just to be offered a commune table outside.  They should have told us that at the beginning and not wasted our time shivering on the bench outside while we waited for a table indoors.  IMHO a great restaurant with high rating means they also have great service and this isn't the way to treat your patrons.
"Don't really imagine this glorious restaurant needs another review to get them to 3 grand reviews but ill do my best...service staff phenomenal which is always a highlight. Food fantastic, thank you kitchen staff for being consistent and well seasoned at all times, it's difficult when my piece of shit puts my order in on a Sunday while I'm on Vacay at 12:05, (restaurant closes at 12), strictly appreciated and well received on this end 'Purple Pig'!!! 2nd time being there and yet again completely enjoyed...keep up the good work, forget the nonsense that is having a book of reservation lists, this Restaurant runs perfectly well on a walk in basis."
"Yelp brought me here, and I am eternally grateful. I don't think it's fair to knock down a restaurant for having a ridiculously long wait, because it clearly means that the place is amazeballs. Luckily, my manfriend and I got there early, because our wait at 5:30 ended up only being about 45 minutes. By the time we left, it was at 3 hours. The food is great, but be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you come hungry. I would recommend this place solely for the bone marrow. I don't think there was a single group there that didn't have it at their table. Our waiter was so helpful and friendly on top of it all that I have nothing bad to say!"
"Considering this place has really good reviews, I was expecting a solid dining experience. However, after ordering the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Chicken Thigh Kebabs, I must say the meat was salty and the portions were teensy! I managed to fill up on both but if you're sharing with someone like I was, you'll have to get more than 2 a la planch's. I will say that the server was nice, and I'd go for the kebabs again as it was the more filling of the two dishes."
"It was pretty amazing to try something new.  Had the pigs ear, octopus, cornbread and chorizo stuffed olives.  All were amazing. The wait time was not as amazing. The waiter passed us by and never offered to take our drink order like he did to everyone near us.  Overall great experience and friendly people."
"First time here. Came here after seeing ""Chef"" so the pannini was in my sights. I hate to so plug a place I liked so much because I hate to see it become so crowded. That said, these guys are doing something fun, novel, and delicious and they deserve the business and lines. Had the tuna antipasti, taramosalata, and the pork brisket pannini. All were excellent, and the price ($36 with tax) was a steal. 2 of us shared this and were full. Service was great...fast and friendly. Please bring your next restaurant to Motor Row."
"The food is average, but way too salty.  I couldn't  stop drinking water after the dinner.  Food portion is on the smaller side.  The service was not good.  Waited a while for waitress to come by after seated, not mentioned we had been waiting two hours before to get a table.  The staff kept coming by to clean plates while we were eating and having conversation.  That is truly annoying while we were trying to enjoy our meals.  After the dinner, the waitress couldn't wait to give us the check, and stopped by at least three times to say ""take your time with paying"".  I will never return for the experience!!!!!!!!"
"Despite being a touristy spot, my husband and I love it here. The wine list is extensive, the food is creative and delicious. Some of my favorites include the taramasalata, the milk braised pork shoulder and the chicken. They don't take reservations so you can expect to wait a couple of hours though."
"The lemon pannacotta was amazing, the Silician Iris not bad, but very filling. The pannacotta was super creamly like creme brulee but with out the crunchy glaze. Cute little drinking hang out spot, would come back if ever in Chicago."
"Farmers and scientists must've put their noggins together and found a way to genetically mutate all pigs into the color purple.  Surely that is the reason why so many things at the Purple Pig tastes so fuggin delicious.  To my disappointment, two items on my to-try list (pig's ear and bone marrow) were sold out.  I am told this happens regularly, so hopefully you will have more luck than me.A question that has always been asked in a guy's life:  are you a boobs or ass man?  As it pertains to the anatomy of a pig, my answer is definitely ""ass.""  I'm not promoting bestiality, but the pig's tail here is one of the best things I have ever experienced.  The rump (not an actual spiral tail) is the perfect blend of fats, juices, and flavors that would have Sir-Mix-A-Lot raving and rapping.  It is topped off with scrambled eggs and bathed in drippings.Other items that were done well were the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the turkey leg.  The meats were all succulent and taste bud pleasing. The charred cauliflower was a nice surprise since it normally is not on my list of favorite vegetables.  The Lardo Costini smear was a compliment to start off the meal.  The bacon fat pork belly confit with peas and carrots could've used more pork belly because you can never go wrong with more pork belly.  The homemade sausage was just average, so I would stay away from that.  The prosciutto bread balls weren't very memorable.  After you had meat that just melts in your mouth, you don't ever want to spend another second of your life masticating.  This unfortunately was the case for the Wagyu Sirloin Tip.  The energetic atmosphere is a reflection of the food.  People from one table were conversing with other tables.  When you have good food and good wine, good things will follow.  Come to Purple Pig and chase some tail."
Awesome service and food. Highly recommended for Chicago visitors! Braised pork is the shiz! Everyone was super attentive and I loved the atmosphere.
"I hate hype. I really do, because I'm always disappointed.My mother and I ordered and loved:Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios. It was fresh tasting, a little too salty, but delicious.Roasted bone marrow with herbs. The bread was super delicious, and the bone marrow was oily and tasty.Manila clams, house made merguez sausage, manzanilla sherry and tomato. This was the best item we had. The clams were a little sandy still, but the sauce was awesome, but heavy on the sherry. Ask for more bread to mop up the sauce!Now for the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. It is not as good as everyone says it is. Super overhyped. The mashed potatoes were good, and so was the gravy, but the pork was a little dry but good quality."
"Wow, what an amazing place! A friend and I met for dinner last Friday night and I was in love with the place the whole time. First, I arrived a few minutes before 6 p.m. to put my name down for a 7 p.m. dinner because I had heard about the long wait. They estimated about 45 minutes, but we were seated by 6:30!We started off with the Pig's Ears and a portion of goat cheese, both were delicious. I especially like the Pig's Ears, mixing the fried goodness along with an over easy egg and kale made it to die for, savory and crispy at the same time. We each had a glass of wine also, and the list was very extensive with several different size options.We shared the pork shoulder for an entree, which was also amazing. It was very tender, and the mashed potatoes and gravy made it perfect.We had the chocolate mousse cake for dessert, and this is where the restaurant lost a star for me. The texture of the cake was fine, but it had something frozen on top that wasn't a great match with the chocolate, and there could have been a bit more of a crust.The atmosphere was so fun. We sat at one of the large tables with several people, but we were still able to have an intimate conversation and we didn't feel as though our tablemates were too close.A great experience, and I'll definitely be back!"
"I've been twice and both times I've had the same impression.  Great atmosphere and the food.... well it's as good as it needs to be, based on the location.  Not calling it a tourist trap, but it is fair at best.  Simple dishes executed poorly."
"Really good food, but be sure to go with a good-sized group of people so that you can order lots of different dishes to share!Notable must-try dish: Purple Pig platter"
"I'm still thinking about the braised pork shoulder and gravy. ohmygawd the gravy.Probably won't be saying anything else that the other 1400 reviews haven't said (ie get there early, milk braised pork with gravy, SO GOOD etc). Just gonna reaffirm that all the good things said are definitely true."
"Hands down, one of my favorites restaurants in Chicago!! The wait is absurd (over 1.5 hrs), but it is definitely worth it!We had:- Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & HoneyMy favorite dish is definitely the pig's ear.  Deep-fried pig's ear with crispy kale and topped with a fried egg.  You break the yolk and mix it into the dish.  It is delish!  The salty taste pairs well with beer.  The sweetness of the beets was nicely balanced with the goat cheese.  However, after 10 bites or so, I thought it was a bit overwhelming.  However, you can always wash it down with a nice glass of wine!Bone marrow was ehhhh.  I like my bones packed full of flavor, so when this dish came out with a side of salt that you can sprinkle on the bone, I was not a happy camper.  Without the salt, no flavor.  With the salt, it was just salty.  Not a fan!The pork shoulder fell apart in my mouth and went nicely with the side of mash potatoes they serve with the pork.  Overall, I 'twas a great experience and I will be back!"
"Been here several times and while the wait can be CRAZY long, its worth it.  I highly recommend doing a drive by in a cab and put your name on the list then head to a bar to wait it out (eno is a great wine bar that's conveniently across the street!) as you can be waiting for two hours!  The food is delicious and they're served family style.  Everything we had was delcious but my favorite has been the razor clams and the grilled octopus.  Service here is great as well.  This place gets packed so if you don't like communal seating or want something more intimate, pick somewhere else and come back here another time!"
"Quite the gastronomic experience. I arrived at noon on a Saturday, and it was packed. Luckily there was a seat at the end of the counter, so I was promptly seated. The counter seating is a sweet spot. The kitchen is open, so you can see them preparing everything, calling out orders (and all the swearing!), and sending food out. It was busy and crowded with tickets, waiters, and food by my seat, but at least I didn't have to wait. My server recommended I order 2-3 plates for myself. So I had the fried pig ears and the milk braised pork shoulder. Both were fantastic. The pig ears with kale was unique, though I wish my egg yolk was a bit runnier. The pork shoulder was so tender and moist. Really delicious, but I wished they gave more mashed potatoes for the amount of pork given. I ended the meal with affogato, which you can pick your ice cream. Pumpkin was delish. $35 including tip for myself. It's definitely pricey, but worth a try. Definitely a memorable meal."
"I was down in the area one day and I was hungry.  I looked up and saw the sign and knew it was a place to check out (I am on Chowhound.com and Chicagoans recommend it), so I got a table for lunch just for myself.   And I ordered just the ""Butternut Squash, Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Salata"".   Damn was it good.   And I happen to love squash.   This was absolutely wonderful (but considering Candice G's comment - I would have loved to watch the kitchen make my snack).  I don't think a better little dish can be made.   Hopefully I will go back to try the other items at some point."
"Portion size to share between 3 hungry girls was an adequate amount.  We came on a rainy day during lunch on Monday. Get there before 11:45am as it can get pretty packed!We ordered the following:Salt roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinagrette - YUM! I'm a huge fan of beets so I really liked the flavors infused in the dish.Roasted bone marrow - doesn't sound appetizing but if you don't think about it, it's actually pretty delicious! Very greasy but slap that bone marrow by scooping it out with the tiny spoon onto the toasted bread and viola, it is darn tasty!Milk braised pork shoulder with mash potatoes - not a huge fan of the mash potatoes as they were a bit dry but the pork shoulder was very tender and moist. Overall we had a good experience. The waiters were very attentive especially since we were sitting in the outside area under the tents and it was raining outside so there were several leaks here and there."
"I advise you train your employees to NOT pick up their tip until after the customers leave. Had a bad experience on May 5th.  We had a guy server, I forgot his name. He was very awkward. I was getting up to leave & he literally stepped in my way to grab his tip.  So rude."
"What a great dinner!!  Can't give it  5, but one of the best meals I've ever had (cons at the end). A friend and I decided to eat as many dishes as possible. Most of them fried (God bless America). Here's what we ate:Fried Brussels sprouts: This was my second favorite dish of the night.  The sprouts were fried yet light, a miracle of science.  What a great balance of sweetness from the sprout and acid from the seasoning. YUMDeviled egg:  Meh. It was good, but not great.  Like a scotch egg manqué.Pig's ear with crispy Kale: THE WINNER! I could eat this dish every day.  A perfect portion of kale, and the ratio to crispy pig ear was spot on.  Never had pig ear before and now I will dream of it. Go and eat this right now!Pork neck bone rillette: Good but not the best rillette ever. Personally, I prefer a rabbit rillette. Overall a solid dish, good texture, nice seasoning.Pig tail:  This was the least successful dish (IMHO, my dinner companion loved it).  There were large chunks of cartilage in the dish, this was unappetizing. Granted, I've never had pig tail before, and for all I know it's normal.  Also the cold shaved egg on top meant it was all soft, squishy textures (aside from the inedible cartilage).  Did not work for me.Octopus:  beautifully cooked, thicker cut than I'm used to seeing (that's what she said). Crispy and tender, perfectly seasoned.  The potatoes were meh. But two thumbs up for the octopus!  Pork secreto: perfect ending to our meal.  Beautiful slices of pork, a little rare (yay!) and pickled somethings on the side.  Solid, delicious dish.Sicilian Iris: dessert!  Like a giant Zeppole stuffed with everything good in life: cream and chocolate, sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Delish!!The cons: Two things: First, the restaurant is tiny and no reservations.  That said, it's worth the wait.  Second,  there's some serious menu confusion.  What's the deal with the Greek dishes? They seem weird with the Spanish tapas/Nose to tail vibe."
"This place is designed to wow your taste buds, but not necessarily fill you up.  The flavors on each plate are spectacular and very delicious, but the portions are small and each plate is a bit pricey.  It's that kind of place where there is at least one thing on every plate that you've never heard of.  If that's the kind of place you like, you'll love Purple Pig.Recommend the Butternut Squash (we almost ordered 2 of them).  The quail was well put together with the sauces and stuffing.We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place; it's to the left of the Bank of America ATMs, along the side of the building (Black canvas warming room entrance)A bit high class and hipster for my tastes.  I don't really have any major complaints, but I wasn't in love with the place.  It was ok to try once, but I won't be coming back.  I like good food, but this was a little over-the top.  I felt like I couldn't fully enjoy each plate because the portions were so small and we shared each item."
Great for tapas and a nice get together with friends.Very busy so I would suggest calling in a reservation or expect to wait a while for a table. Food come out very quickly and was delish! Definitely worth visiting while in Chicago.
Sausage with lady apples- 2 starspork shoulder with potatoes- 4 starsbrocolli- 2 starsbeets- 4 starsThe waiter was very nice and helpful in assisting us with the menu. I thought the food was mostly over priced but enjoyed the beets and pork shoulder. I probably wouldn't return here. I think this place is over rated. But I will give it 3 stars because I'm glad I at least tried it to see what the hype was about and wasn't left feeling too disappointed.
This is a must for everything salty fried and creative. The Purple Pig mixed rich heavy flavors with creative lightness that results in an out of this world experience. Particular recommendation - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale. Surprising mix of crisp and moist ingredients for a true indulgence.My only complaint is that they do not take reservation so a dinner here is hard to arrange. It's a great place for a quick bite for lunch but not outside of that.
"The environment is good but the food is very salty, oily, and expensive. For me I think it is not worthy."
"The food?  The wine? The service? Excellent. To date, I've eaten here four times, each time at the bar, and usually because the tables are full.  At this point, I'm not sure I'd want to sit somewhere else.  This place has great ambience.  Chef Jimmy and his team bring these tight quarters alive.  While there are restaurants I've enjoyed more in several corners of the globe, I've rarely experienced such a seemingly content and customer-oriented staff than what I've experienced and witnessed there.  The menu is great.  I'm a far more selective eater than I would prefer to be, and this place makes it easy to push myself beyond my comfort zone.  If you're tired of the chain restaurants -- and you should be (even at the top end of the price range), treat yourself to a meal or twenty here.  And wine.  By the bottle."
"My most memorable meal in Chicago consisted of beets, brussels sprouts, bone marrow, pork, mussels, burrata, and a turkey leg. Each and every dish was equally amazing. I would recommend to others and return in a heart beat."
"The place opens at 11:30 am, we were there at 11:29 and at 11:45 the place was full and for a good reason - the food is just out of this world. Innovative, modern, delicious, not small portions - foodie and John Q Public paradise. 2 blocks from the Bean on Michigan Ave - MUST VISIT!"
Excellent food and the staff is very friendly they seem to be enjoying theirselves which makes for a great experience. The wine list was thorough and well organized. I love the chorizo stuffed fried olives! Also the panini is great. The menu is as unique as the restaurant itself. Small and busy but worth a wait.
This may seem like a tourist trap but it is not. It's an excellent tapas place by a renowned chef. Very good wine choices to accompany this. The wait may take a while but its well worth it.
"I love pigs.  I want a pet pig.  But what I would love more than a pet pig is a great pig dinner!  So we went to a restaurant that celebrates the pig from ear to tail.    We started off with the fat  with their House Cured Lardo on crostini.  I was told that this wasn't the best of their crostinis and the lardo was a bit bland.  We also got the Fried Pig Ears with kale and egg, which tasted like the fried onion strips you put on Thanksgiving Green Beans.  My favorite was the Pig tail - it was very flavorful, very tender.  Tastes like a smaller oxtail.   To round off our meal, we also got the roasted cauliflower and iris for the dessert. My biggest complaint about The Purple Pig is that it takes way too long!  While we got seated pretty quickly, it took about 15-20 minutes per dish to come out, which ended up being a 2 hour lunch."
Nice and different. We were seated really quick however it was Thursday early evening. The scallops were to die for!!! Get ready it's pricey 2 people 192 with tip.
"This place is definitely worth the 1 hr 45 minute wait. They have amazing service. TIP: If you are in the general area and you are not hungry yet come here and put your name down. They take your number so in 2 hours when you are hungry they will give you a ring. Wish we knew that. We came back after 90 minutes when they gave us a call. We were given a corner table for three. It was by their door (not revolving). Too cold so we asked to switch to another three person table and they were very accommodating.Prosciutto Escarole Bread Balls - Got this because of all the yelp reviews. Frankly, I thought it was alright. Nothing special. You can hardly taste the prosciutto. Butternut Squash, Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Salata - Pretty good and I rarely eat squash. Definitely something you want to share. It is too sweet to eat all by yourself. We also ordered two types of cured meats. They come with bread and it was surprisingly filling. I think out of the two we loved the one with the truffle oil. The service was absolutely amazing even though it doesn't look like a fine dining you get fine dining service. Every time one of us would get up to use the bathroom someone will come over and fold our napkins. Even though it was busy we didn't have a problem getting serviced. There were two bathrooms in the back. Multi-sex. If you are unlucky there could be a long wait."
"Maybe I over hyped it, and as delicious as it was, it wasn't as yummy as I hoped. Maybe it was the snacking before the wait.. After checking in, we were told tere would be a 1 hour 45 minute wait.. we waited 2 hours and 10 minutes, which was fine cause I went shopping next door. The space was tiny, luckily I am not huge! We asked for recommendations as soon as we sat down. The waitress only recommended vegetables. That was a sign I should just ignore her altogether. Who eats only salads?! We ordered the Foie Gras spread & the bone marrow spread to start. The membrillo was so yummy, someone in our party literally ate all of it leaving the foie gras left over by itself. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs was really good the onion thing really brings out flavor to otherwise bland bone marrow -- maybe they should've just added a pinch of salt. Jamon Serrano and Prosciutto di San Daniele was average. im not a huge fan of cured meats so it didnt attract me too much. Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil!! is a must. I could eat like 5 plates of this by myself!! It was so good. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes was real tender but the mash didnt really compliment the pork, it felt like two worlds colliding in my mouth.. of course I ate it separately and then it was awesome!  Manila Clams, House Made Merguez Sausage, Manzanilla Sherry & Tomato.. The clams weren't too great but the sauve for the clams was what made our breads all disappear! Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette WAS THE BEST EVER! The meat was cooked to perfection! Wine was great, that help move my food along. Service was okay considering the fact that they were uber busy. The pumpkin tart pie cake thing was okay and so was the gelato... They did put a candle in and sing happy birthday though!! :) If I only ate two things it would be razor clams and WAGYU Sirloin Tips!"
"This place is amazing. I was in Chicago with a friend and we lucked out on hotels by getting one across the street from the Purple Pig. We dined there for lunch and tried as many things as we could possibly stuff into ourselves. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. As we struggled with picking a wine, the waitress patiently explained the different wines they had and allowed us to taste whatever we wanted before making a decision.The following dishes are AMAZING and must be eaten immediately (provided you can find seats - go when they open or suffer a 2-3 hour wait for a table):Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano ReggianoDeviled Egg with Arugula & CapersPork Neck Bone Gravy with RicottaMilk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesYou really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, but the above will leave you dreaming of when you can visit the Purple Pig for more delectable delights!"
Came here for the first time in July . The place was super busy but we got seats at the bar right away.Drinks were hood and they have a interesting menu. The bar tender did not stir us wrong. All his suggestion were amazing dessert was great. Will be back
"I keep writing something and then deleting it because no matter what I write, it doesn't seem to do justice to how awesome Purple Pig is. So, you'll have to do with that mediocre opening statement.I called the restaurant at 4 pm on a Saturday and was told to come by around 6 pm to put my name on the list for a dinner table for 2. I came to the restaurant as directed at 6 and asked how long the wait was going to be. 2 hours. I turned to my friend (a Chicago local) and asked him if we should just eat elsewhere. Because really, 2 hours? He allayed my concerns by suggesting we get some drinks nearby while we wait (you can also order wine in the patio area of Purple Pig if you choose to wait there instead). We sat outside in the covered patio area. The tables are pretty close together, which was actually kinda cool, we got to talk to our dinner neighbors and met some really interesting folks. This is what we had for dinner:Wine: Languedoc, La Violetta. (I've been on a languedoc kick lately)Food:- Cheese plate: smouked gouda, delice de bourgogne, and cave man blue with quince and Marcona almonds- Butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, brown butter and salata- Salt-roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette- Hearts of palm salad- Winter squash arancini with sage and cocoa nib pesto- Eggplant caponata smear- Herb marinated Greek yogurt labne smear- Sicillian iris (brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips) for dessert!Yeah. It was a lot of fucking food. I know. Between my friend and I we finished everything mentioned in that list. I'm pretty proud of us. Also, with tax and tip, the whole meal worked out to $150. I think that is completely fair given the quality of the food, the quality of the waitstaff and the quality of the overall experience.I broke vegan so hard with this meal, but I enjoyed every single bite. I hope you go and have just as great an experience! (:"
"We're fans of gastro-pubs, and that's the only way I know to describe this place. The Purple Pig is about interesting food and matching drinks.  I ate here a few months ago on a business trip, and the food and service were super.  They don't take reservations and it has always been busy, so build this into your plan.  They serve drinks out on the sidewalk in the warmer months, and this made the wait easy.  This is now one of our favorites in Chicago."
"This was my second visit, which was just as good as the first.  Sat at the bar last time (recommend it), this time was ""out there"" with the people and while I enjoyed our table for two (since it was my wife's first visit) the bar seating is more interesting as it allows you to see the chefs at work and eyeball their creations.  It could be the difference between ordering something you otherwise would not (the Pigs ear for instance) and not.  Seeing it is much more appetizing than reading and trying to imagine what it's all about. This is a place to explore your inner foodie and graze.  That's why the waits are so long, but that is also why it is so worth checking out if you are one of the few who hasn't already.  My biggest regret is I haven't gone with larger groups of people because sampling a little of a lot and pairing it all with the interesting libation offerings (wine list has very reasonably priced offerings) would be the ideal.  Was pleased to see some couples with kids, but this visit was lunch, not sure it would be a good place for kids at night, given the waits, cramped space and reality that a child's tolerance for lengthy dining is different than an adults."
This place is sooo good!!!! I stopped by when I was in Chicago.  I had the bone marrow which was like butter on steroids delish... My fave dish was crispy pig ears with kale salad yummy recommend it to anyone
"Went here in August with my sister. I'm a vegetarian and she eats everything. We had a lovely wait on the patio (over an hour, but we were able to sit and drink wine). When we finally got a table, it was in a nice outdoor location. We tried four or five dishes. The most memorable was the beets! Utterly amazing, and how often do you rave about beets? There wasn't a single dish we had that was good. I will definitely return next time I'm in Chicago and have time for a leisurely wait."
"Best meal of the week in Chicago, for sure. Walked in at 1145, and place was already half full. Service was a bit patchy, but the quality of the food really couldn't be faulted!I was by myself, so was limited in terms of what I could order. Got the:a.  pork rillete: creamy smooth, if that's the sort of texture you like. The sweet condiments were a really nice counter-balance! b.  wagyu beef tips: perfectly cooked!"
Five star food but our service was very slow and limited so we left after apps (2 hrs later) awesome food!!!!
I come here every time in Chicago. This is by far the best eclectic food I've ever had. Their wine menu is amazing and the food changes every time I go! I'm always looking for Illinois Ave between Michigan Ave just for this place!
"I went to Chicago for a work trip and wanted a nice dinner on my company's dime, so I did some research and settled on The Purple Pig. I was dining and traveling solo. The location is really convenient, on Michigan Avenue right down the block from the DuSable Bridge and the river. I got there around 7 pm-ish with a few bags in hand, which was probably a mistake since the place is TIGHT. I sat at a communal-style bar table with stools, but there was enough room for me to sit and eat, and some room underneath for my bags. If you're coming here, travel light. There were some regular tables and booths in the restaurant as well as out on the patio, and inside the restaurant there were people sitting at the bar. There was also a long line of people waiting for a table - I got in right away since it was just me, but if you're coming in a pair or group then give them your cell phone number and take a walk around the neighborhood. (I had honestly thought there'd be a wait and I'd have time to drop my bags at the hotel first.)I started with a nice cocktail, the Il Saggio (something with a fresh sage leaf, and gin, maybe?), which the waiter had suggested. Patrons next to me enjoyed several kinds of wine with their plates. The waiter suggested that I choose one dish from the left side of the menu and one from the right side, so I chose the ""Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette"" and the ""Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes"" since a blogger I like had raved about both. The beets came out first. This was actually my first time trying beets, and these were tasty. However, I think the texture was too much for me (which is not The Purple Pig's fault, of course) and I couldn't finish the plate. The whipped goat cheese was absolutely wonderful, and the pistachios were a nice touch. Then the pork shoulder came out. SO tender and delicious. The gravy was terrific. The mashed potatoes were very very tasty as well, but I wish they had been a little thicker. I had some room and some money left for dessert, so I ordered a chocolate tart with a raspberry granita (like a shaved flavored ice) and a strawberry compote. The tart was pretty good, and the compote was delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the granita. I've had it elsewhere and also didn't care for it, so I'm thinking that I just don't like shaved ice. I also had a cup of coffee. The party next to me enjoyed the pig platter, several kinds of cheese, a gyro, and some other items, all of which looked delicious. Everyone at the table was raving about the food. The final bill was about $47 before tip. Service was excellent. I actually enjoyed this meal so much, and I was so eager to try other plates, that I decided to come back again the following day for lunch. I mean, why not, right?I got there around 12:30 and the place was still pretty crowded, but there was more seating available than there had been the night before. I was offered a choice between an inside table and one on the patio, so I chose the latter. They had a tent up to protect diners from the rain (which kicked up at one point and made some people near the tent ""door"" have to move), and large heaters were brought in as well. I was pretty comfortable the whole time. They quickly seated me after ensuring that my seat and table were dry. I got a Summer Sangria cocktail this time, which was really good. I ordered the ""Burrata Pugliese, Grilled Kohlrabi, Apples, Mustard Greens, Crispy Speck & Beer Agrodolce"" and a Wagyu beef dish (the website menu lists it as a ""Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette"" but I think mine was a short rib plate). Both were delicious. The burrata was creamy and the accompaniments were delicious. The wagyu was nice and tender and had a lovely seared crust. I didn't have any appetite remaining for dessert this time around. And I reached my work-imposed limit because the two plates plus the cocktail cost around $47 again. Again, service was excellent. The Purple Pig is sophisticated enough where you feel like you're out to a fancy dinner, but it's also reasonably priced and casual enough where you don't have to dress up or spend a fortune to have a nice meal. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who's visiting or living in Chicago."
"This place was really awesome, I ended up literally pigging out with a friend of mine here. The plates are small, in a tapas like tradition, and everything is made to be shared. Unfortunately Chicago can get cold, and the seats we were in fell prey to a terrible draft, that coupled with the heaters above the tables, our torsos were warm but our legs and our junk were perpetually cold.- Fried pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg: This dish was a little bit underwhelming. I grew up eating marinated pig's ears (Chinese style baby) and I thought the deep frying ended up drying them out. I love fried egg atop anything though. The little piggy bowl they came in was a nice touch though.- Fried brussel sprouts: I love brussel sprouts, and when they're crispy and tasty? More please.- Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta smear: Get some kind of smear for sure! The thick, crusty bread rocks! The slightly spicy pork gravy paired so well with ricotta and I could eat a lot more of this. Yes. Smears.  - Pork sweetbreads with fennel and apricot: This was very good! I'm a bit new to the sweetbreads world, and I've had some that give you that disgusting organ-y, metallic, offal taste. These are crispy, delicate, and light. Quite delicious. - Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verder: No rubbery octopus here. Perfectly flavored. - Wagyu sirloin tip with fingerling potatoes, red onions, olives & bone marrow vinaigrette: Cooked to our liking (rare). These generous chunks of wagyu were delectable. All in all a good place to go. Try to get a table inside if you don't want to be cold. Oh. And. Smear."
We went to the Purple Pig for lunch on the Friday of Lollapalooza weekend and it did not disappoint. The chicken kabobs were absolutely delicious and the milk-braised pork was probably the single-best dish I've ever had. The wait staff was attentive and had a great drink suggestion. I will always stop at the Pig when I'm in town.
"Ok, so I may have been too harsh on my previous review. I've been back to Purple Pig twice since my last review, and I have to update to reflect my two good experiences (food-wise)--even though that's just going to make the damn wait even longer to get a table at this place. But oh well, here goes:Bone marrow--still amazingBeet salad with goat cheese--excellent, my new favorite dishRoasted corn--excellentSummer squash salad and heirloom tomatoes--both goodSicilian Iris--a pastry that looks/tastes like fried dough with pudding on the inside--out of this world.Service is hit or miss. I still HATE that they don't take reservations and have a horrible system of seating people and constantly bump up the wait time over what you were quoted. We were quoted 45 minutes and when we checked with the hostess she lied and said she quoted us an hour. Also, still hate the cramped, communal seating."
"Cheese.  Swine.  Wine.Yes, this is my kind of place.  A bit small and crowded, reminiscent of NYC.  This is a tapas place with a Mediterranean flare with tons of wine to accompany everything.  They have some house made charcuterie, various dips, tons of pork dishes, and also stuff for the non pork eaters.  It can get a little loud and crowded, but its a small price to pay for the stuff you get here.  Some of the notables, head cheese charcuterie, fried pig ears with kale and a sunny side egg on top.  The taramusalata was meh.  The pigs tail entree was pretty great.  Wish I could fit more in my belly!  Also they sell wines in various sizes so no worries if your partner or SO doesnt drink.  Would definitely come back if Im back in town."
Visited this place when I went to Chicago.  It's probably one of the best eats I've had in the country!Milk braised pork shoulder will make you wet your pants!I only wish I lived in town so I could go here all the time.  I love the concept of small portions that you can share.  I had 3-4 things and all of them were divine!
"Food: too salty in general-Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta, don't ask me why but it reminded me of deep dish pizza, but good-Pork liver pate, super savory and tasted great on toast, the best-Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, overrated, tender meat but too salty-Turkey leg confit, still a little too salty but was the best entree, meat also fell right off-Chicken thigh kebabs, wasn't bad but would rather get something like this from a middle eastern restaurant to get better bang for my buck-Pork sweetbreads with fennel and apricots, way too salty, and we completely misunderstood the concept of ""sweetbreads""-Sicilian iris, I think it was good but at this point I was too full from all the meat and salt to fully register this-Salted caramel soft serve, good with little crunchy butterscotch pieces sprinkled on top in a cute little asian piggy bowl, but tasted more like butterscotch/espresso rather than salted caramelService:-A little slow because the place is so crowded and they only had so many servers-Super quick busboys tidying up our table after each round like mexican ninjas-Who's that cute token asian waiterSpace:-Cute and cozy decors-Claustrophobic atmosphere-Only 2 single restrooms in the entire restaurant, better off pissing somewhere else on the Magnificent MileAftermath:-Might've grown a triple chin-Felt fat and disgusting for days"
Fantastic. Put your name in and then go shop. They will call you when you can sit.Excellent. I will be back.
"Dive into this exotic restaurant with delicious and strange food and a free-for-all wait. For me, tapas bars are usually reserved for dates because they are smaller ( and more $$)dishes, but it is very good, however...I wanted to try this place out for their off the beaten path menu. Where else could you get bone marrow, roasted beets and a pig heart panini all in one sitting?** Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - definitely their most famous dish, I'm not sure if its a meal of acquired taste, but like any protein shake. It has way too much flavor. For the price and proportion, you will definitely be eating more bread than bone marrow with this dish. For those willing to try something new, I give it an A-, for taste, I give it a C-.**Roasted Beets - Wonderful and the aroma is deep and the nut flavors really reach deep into the pallet. I found the goat cheese too empowering in this dish, but that is just my take.**Swine heart panini - I thought this was actually very tasty. The pig's heart was shredded and had this dark red brick color. I was pleasantly surprised and thought the meat was very tender and the proportions perfect. In conclusion, I would definitely come back, probably with a date."
"Visiting from California, my friends and I were encouraged to dine at The Purple Pig by multiple people. And so our first day in Chicago, we chose this establishment for brunch.The waitress gave us her recommendations, and we ordered every one of them. Verdict: good, tasty dishes, but small portioned. The good: pork shoulder with mashed potatos, maple glazed pork chop-thing, giant turkey leg, bone marrow.The bad; octopus, fried pig's ear, chicken kabobs. These were not as great.Great place to eat at for out-of-towners! Our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful."
"God, the bone marrow. The pork shoulder. The small dishes. Even though the wait time is sometimes ridiculous, it's all worth it when you eat here! It's tapas styled, and mostly serves, as the name hints, pork. However, their spreads are oh so delicious, and I have YET to taste anything just so-so. It's best for you to take at least 2 people with you so that you can order more dishes. Each portion is enough for 3-4 people, if you order a lot and don't get greedy.Sometimes, I'll come at an odd hour just to eat their food without the wait. And if you're lucky you might spot a celebrity in their sunglasses eating here. I can rave for longer, but you should go and try it for yourself. So delicious that I'm craving it now..."
we loved our meal at the purple pig. great small plates in a fun atmosphere. each dish was artfully crafted. the service was attentive and prompt. our severs made many suggestions and took excellent care of us. would return again
"Great experience and interesting concept. The menu is focused on unique flavors served in small plates. The portions I had were small in comparison to the other small plates I've had in the area. Flavors are consistently good with a few items that a great. My favorite to date has been the liver pate. The menu is constantly changing so new flavors can be experienced with each visit.  The majority of the tables at this restaurant are long tall tables where you will be sitting with other customers not in your party.  This is a great way to see the variety of dishes that the Purple Pig offers, but good to know if you are opposed to being seated with others.  The wine selection is quite extensive and the staff is knowledgeable about proper pairings.  I would suggest that if you are interested in getting lunch to arrive before 12:30.  I arrived at 12 and had no problem getting seated immediately, but after 12:30 many potential customers left because the wait was too long.  I was on my way to the train station and the staff was willing to accommodate my luggage (no small feat for a busy restaurant on the Miracle Mile)."
"I will review my experience in Purple pig, I will talk about my experience with service and the food, as well as my over all experience in the restaurant. Purple Pig is one of Chicago's top restaurants, after visiting for several times it deserves a review for both their service and their food. The purple pig is a Mediterranean restaurant that serves ""tapas"", meaning small plates that you can share. This review will target all of these sections, and it will also give you an idea, of how my experience at this casual dining restaurant was.The service at purple pig is very casual; it is a sit down casual dining restaurant, with a very young and contemporary ambience. This restaurant also offers server that are knowledgeable in wines.  Servers at Purple Pig tell you about their wine menu, and they are able to describe the flavors and what foods pair well with the wines. They also have a great variety from all around the world. Another important reason why I visit at purple pig is because they are you feel welcome, the hosts treat you well and when you sit the servers become your friends. The food at Purple Pig gives you a once in a lifetime experience. When you enter the first thing you see is the open kitchen and you can be part of this ongoing cooking emotion by sitting at the bar, while all the cooks are in action. This gives you a great thrill before your food comes our. There Extensive menu that they have can fulfill all kinds of clients. The menu is very extensive, it offers flavors from all around the Mediterranean. The plates that are served are bite size and sharable, this gives you the opportunity to have a good time with your loved ones. Two of my favorite plates at The Purple Pig is the foie gras, which is enlarged dusk liver spread, serves with crusty bread. This just melts in your mouth and goes awesome with red wine, the other was a three way chicken feet that was crunchy and soft at the same time. They also serve very simple desserts that have very simple preparations. I had the nutella sandwich and this was perfectly sweet and salty to end the meal. As I have previously stated, purple pig is a Mediterranean, tapas style restaurant. They offer an extensive varieties of wines and food, their main idea is to have a table order several plates and let them share so that is does not become a typical American style diner, where you order, eat, and leave. Food always tastes better when you eat it with loved ones, and having servers that are able bring you a service that deserves a tip, will always be a must go place."
"Too crowded, no elbow room.  No one acts like they care if you are there, the bartender avoids making eye contact with you.  It takes ages to get a drink!  It is expensive for this kind of simple food."
"Not customer friendly! I did not even get to try their food, talking to them on the phone was enough. I wanted to reserve a table to meet an out-of-town friend for dinner on a week day.  they don't take reservation -- OK, I'm getting used to that in Chicago land.. So I asked for the estimate of the wait time at 7 pm on a Thursday night. She said they don't do estimates either! Seriously?! no statistic at all?! will drive to downtown in terrible traffic with no idea of how long the wait time can be? that's not considerate! so thank you, but no thank you! plenty of great places around that are friendlier."
"Well we went here based on all the rave reviews.  I have to say it was probably built up in hype too much for me.  That and the Bone marrow was just pretty yuck.  I think people get that in their review to share the pain?  Delish?  sure if you have 3rd degree burns on your tongue...  Just not a fun food to eat as a smear, best saved for a nice Bordelaise sauce!  That said, the other dishes were very good!  The Pork neck with ricotta, the milk braised pork shoulder, the calamari, the eggplant cheese balls, and tuna dishes...  All unique and tasty!  Great wine list and awesome location.  Would I go again?  Probably, but I would definitely skip the bone marrow!"
"Is it just me or did their bone marrow get HUGE?It's like they are using FEMURS now or something. AND I LIKE IT.In addition to the norm, we added on:""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - holy smokes this was awesomeTurkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce - if you've got several stragglers that almost there in terms of fullness, order this in anticipation and watch the dish put a nail in their coffins...'tis big my friends.Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda - lovely, but if you're already ordering anything with some bread i'd probably avoid thisPork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - pretty good also but a tad salty today - must find the salt monkeyAs usual, add on wine to raise your fun to the power of three."
"This place was outstanding all around!!!It was my last day in Chicago and my cousin couldn't make it out that day so I ventured out on my own for more yummy food in this city.  I found myself at The Purple Pig after a few friends recommended it.Ambiance and decor: 5 stars - simple, modern yet not quite, but just a beautiful place.  No snobby feel to it which I really like.Wine selection: 5 stars - Wines from all over the Mediterranean, extensive, and the tempranillo I had was great!Service: 5 stars - Alan Is probably one of the best servers I've ever encountered!  And not just in Chicago!  He was very knowledgeable, checked-in with every dish that came out, very friendly and awesome all around.Food (my favorite part): 5 stars - Yes, for a solo meal, I had a lot, and I practically ordered a heart attack, but a foodie's gotta do what a foodie's gotta do.   Don't judge me!Foie gras and membrillo (quince jelly) served with toasted bread - Delicious!  Since California has deprived me of my foie gras, I have to have it when available.  The foie gras was served pate style but so much lighter, smoother and creamier, and the membrillo was a perfect complement.  Although, I have to say that the foie gras was so good that at times I didn't want to cut the fattiness and richness with the membrillo, and i just piled a mountain of foie by itself on the toast.  Definitely ate all of it.  Is that bad?  Then again, not like I care.  LOLRoasted bone marrow- Take a slice of bread, smear the bone marrow, add the cilantro and capers, sprinkle a little sea salt, and bite.  MmMmm.  The only thing I might want to change is the bread.  Given that the marrow was already so rich and fatty, I would have preferred the bread to be plain toast and not buttered up.Milk braised pork shoulder - This is hands down the best pork shoulder I have ever had!  The pork was so tender and juicy, the sauce was out of this world, and the mashed potatoes underneath was so light and creamy.  Get this!Salted caramel soft-serve ice cream - Creamy, not overly sweet, delicious flavor, and salted caramel crunchy bits on top...I'm so I glad I didn't skip dessert.  Yum!If only I wasn't by myself, I totally would have ordered the rest of the menu.  You have to try this place if you are ever in Chicago!"
"I love this place, it has everything I love. I took my girlfriend here on are first official date and it worked out perfectly. Its a great place to impress a girl, especially a foodie. We went on an off day so the wait was only 15min. The drinks came out fast and the food was perfectly timed. Not rushed at all. Just the other day we went back there to remember the first date because I proposed to her. We were able to get our favorite things there, BONE MARROW! I strongly recommend it, even if your a little scared. Other things I recommend the Mussels with Pancetta, great salty flavor, perfectly cooked."
"Loved it! Our wait was not very long - about 15 minutes. We were promptly seated inside at one of the large tables. Our waiter, George, came over quickly, explained the menu and concept and answered our questions. We ordered a couple of glasses of Manzano Pinot Grigio (reminder to self: find a couple of bottles of this! Very refreshing!) We also ordered the meat platter, cheese platter and pork fried almonds. The almonds arrived first. Holy moly!  I could live on those babies!  I'm drooling thinking about them! The meat and cheese platters arrived at the same time.  I tasted a little bit of everything which is quite extraordinary for me because even though I am a foodie, I tend to shy away from eating things I can't identify.  Three of the meats on the platter were house made and cured.  The rest were typical - prosciutto, mortadella, chorizo, etc. Of the three house cured, one was a head cheese. (I only ate one bite as I am not a fan) but the other two were phenomenal. Wish I could remember their names. Two of the cheeses were very good, but the other was...funky. Neither of us could eat much of it.  After watching food come and go from the kitchen, hubby decided to add some of the milk braised pork shoulder to our order. It was very, very good. Since hubby didn't enjoy the meat platter as much as I did, I let him eat most of the pork shoulder while I finished the rest of the other selections. It was a split decision. I loved it, hubby not so much.  I'd go back without hesitation but he will likely avoid it like the plague.  Different strokes I guess but since this is my review, the Purple Pig gets 5 stars!"
"This is a fun tapas place. In my opinion the best time to go is during the summer. You can order a glass of wine to drink outside with a wonderful view of the river and Michigan Ave.They are very busy, especially during the summer, be prepared to wait 45min to 1hr+. But, they have staff that will bring you wine or other drinks while you wait.The bone marrow is fantastic, so is the pork shoulder! They have a wonderful selection of cheese and wine. I've always order several small tapas plates to share among the table and have yet to find one that I disliked."
"One a very cold night, on 11/25/2013, we walked to Purple Pig. With the temperature in the low 20's and on a Monday night this place was full of people (which seems to be a regular thing in Chicago). Packed that it was inside we accepted a place outside! It's a bit enclosed, they have heaters outside to help with the freezing cold, still it was a bit chilly, but nothing that couldn't be dealt with. Purple Pig was a great experience especially for my wife and I, as even though we have lived in Florida for the past 15 years, we are Italian and we found food and wine from our area, the north-east region where our hometown Trieste is. Trieste produces a red wine called Refosco which is rare to find even in other Italian regions. Imagine our surprised when I see it on the menu in Chicago!! And you would think the price would be outrageous instead it was greatly priced at just over $ 30 per bottle. This alone made Purple Pig a winner in our book.Add to it an attentive service, in spite of the place being filled with people as if it were a stadium, and great food and Purple Pig is a place I will definitely go back to next time I am in Chicago. After 45 minutes of wait we were seated by a nice waitress who was very attentive throughout our dinner. We started with chorizo stuffed olives: good way to start! and as mentioned a bottle of ""our"" Refosco wine (Refosco Palmadina, $ 36/bottle, great value!). We shared the next two plates.The first one was the amazing Roasted bone marrow, served in two big bones where you have to dig in to get the precious spread, to lay it on their good bread and go into flavor-high mode.  Came with some rucola (fine, I'll say in English, arugola) with capers and vinagrette, perfetto!Next we shared the Porchetta sandwich, another classic of Italy and well known in Trieste. Came cut in two, which actually made it two sandwiches, and it was, well, we thought it was great but maybe we were a bit romantic about it because of the link with our hometown, but I do believe it was really well done, tasty and strangely light for a sandwich based on pork. Came in salsa verde, a pesto-based sauce they make at the Purple Pig. Finished the night with a good espresso and a couple of grappa shots to help us go back out in the dark freezing night and continue our dialogue with the windy city! Huge value, as quality was great, service on par with it and prices very reasonable, I would almost call them low for the offerings, setting and location. Put this place in Boca Raton or West Palm Beach and it would charging you like you are Donald Trump. Another gem among the many of Chicago."
"One word... SPECTACULAR! Compliments to the Chef; he did a phenomenal with the bone marrow, beef tendons, poached tuna, and cured meats! I've been to a number of world class fine dining and michelin star restaurants, but the purple pig just has something else going for it! My Favs:Bone Marrow, Salt & Vinegar Beef Tendon Chips, Olive Oil Poached Tuna and in-house cured meats (Prosciutto and Mortadella), and the Neck Gravy with Ricotta... but truthfully everything was exceptional! I wish I could visit more often, but definitely on my list next time i go to Chicago!"
"Good food and a bustling atmosphere, you will not go thirsty as you water will not go below 3/4s without it being refilled"
Excellent!!!  We went late on a Saturday night and got seats at the bar.  I'm still dreaming about the eggplant caponata with goat cheese toasts.
"My first time at the Purple Pig was our 1 year anniversary last weekend.  We walked in and sat down instantly.  I suppose we got lucky on a rainy Sunday afternoon during Lollapalooza. Pigs ears were surprisingly excellent! Menu is extensive and we found several dishes we had to try.  Charred Cauliflower was outstanding, scallops were good (not a huge fan of scallops anyway), meatball slider was good also. Atmosphere was fun, except the people sitting next to us at the big table outside were a bit loud so if you're looking for an intimate experience...this is not it.  It's a fun experience though so I highly recommend for foodies young and old.  We played it safe this time but next time we will take more risks with our taste buds."
Being the foodie that I am and the amazing reviews this place had I had to go check it out for myself. The setting and ambience is nice though service leaves a lot to be desired but the stars lost are not for thatI ordered following things.1. Bone marrow with herbs - It was just Ok . I have had better..My fav is from Au Cheval and I couldn't help comparing. Many reviews spoke about the lack of consistency for that dish so maybe it was one of those days for ne2. Brocoli and garlic - it was nice though I dint understand why they had to put that much oil in it.3. The milk braised pork shoulder - now this was amazing. The meat was so tender and it was well complemented with creamy mashed potatoes4.chicken thigh kebabs - my favorite part of this dish was not the chicken but the fried potatoes and tzatziki 5. For dessert we had the soft serve cinnamon ice cream  which was perfect since the pecans help that awesome crunch .WARNING : food is pretty heavy on the salty side so people with low tolerance to that should skip this place. It is also natural to feel bloated and sick after consuming that much saltOverall I am glad I came to check out the hype but will not be returning again
"Chorizo stuffs olives, Milk braised pork shoulder, Squid stuffed with prosciutto & bread crumbs and Pork blade steak. Delicious!!!! Enough said :)"
"Bone marrow smear: marrow itself is nice, but the bread on the side is soaked in oil.Fried pig's ear: not recommended. Basically they just deep fried the pig's ear, which, i know, sounds fancy and yummy but when you taste it you are mainly biting into batter. If you come here with a large group for a booze then this may be the perfect side dish to share.Dessert menu does not impress me. The waitress highly recommended a donut-like dessert which is fried dough filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate. It's not bad if the other tapas are lighter."
"I was really on the fence between The Purple Pig and Girl & the Goat on my trip to the windy city.  My girls and i wanted to dine at a nice place for dinner and had to choose.  The two sounded pretty awesome and  had great reviews so i relied on the photos as food porn to decide.  Thank you yelpers!  We were not disappointed in our choice to eat here.  The pig ears was a delicious start, crispy with runny yolk.  The pork shoulder was definitely the fave for everyone,  ridiculously tender, we couldn't stop ourselves.  The turkey leg was so flavorful.  We were too stuffed to try anything else!  Definitely try to get here at the start of the dinner hour.  Having no reservations, it wasn't long before we were seated."
"Delicious and original.  Eggplant cheese balls, rib tips, lamb flank steak, all perfectly done and not too heave on the seasoning and sides.  Really well done and sized perfectly for a dinner for 2.  Loved the communal seating too - lots of fun."
"Reading through my first review from 3 years ago, I feel so terrible! I've been back to the purple pig at least half a dozen times since then and each time the experience has been wonderful and I can't believe it took this long to write an update!  I literally work next door to PP and every day I walk underneath the walkway to go up to my building and I am smacked in the face by their delicious prep smells.  I've come here with co-workers, friends, my bf and everyone I've brought here has loved it.  I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and my absolute all time favorites are the JLT (who doesn't love pig jowl?!?!?!), the pig ears, pig tail and the rillette.  When I came here last week I really wanted my BF to try their bone marrow.  Sooo sad but they don't serve bone marrow during lunch and they were out of crispy pig ears. Super sad...but that just means we have to go back again very, very soon!Also, for the quality of food, it's really quite inexpensive.  Last week, we ate and drank to our heart's content and it was under $150.  I've been here with friends when we decided not to drink at all, and it's literally only $20/person for a ton of great food. LOVE LOVE LOVE the purple pig."
"5 stars for food, service, atmosphere. Cons, if I have to name some: It was busy, crowded, loud. Our table of 7 sat at the end with 5 others rounding it off. Pros: wonderful food, amazing wine list, reasonable prices and comfortable atmosphere. Would recommend the Smashed Potatoes and goat cheese smear, Cornbread something or other? Octopus, Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (a house favorite that melts in your mouth!). All of the desserts we ordered were fantastic as well. I ordered the Sicilian Iris, a ricotta and chocolate chip stuffed dessert that is fried, ate half and got to take home a whole new one since it was dropped when traveling to get boxed up. It was delicious right out of the fridge for breakfast!"
"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent wine. The family style dining on long vineyard tables enhances the experience and makes you want everything your neighbor has. If I ever find myself back in Chicago I will definitely be at the Purple Pig."
"happy fun crowded loud warm friendly unusual helpfulWhat a great place on a cold winter night! It ain't cheap, but it isn't expensive either. After all, you ARE just half a block west of Michigan Avenue and the owners ARE all-stars in the food industry.Get the marrow. Haven't had it before? Get it. Had it before? Get it. Get the marrow.Drink some wine. Order a whole bottle and squeeze into the bar and eat there. You'll have more fun than you would out at a table.Talk to some people around you and find out what they've had and what they love. Many have been here before and all will have recommendations.I think our server was Jamie. She works behind the bar and knows EVERYTHING about food ingredients, prep, presentation, and pairing (good alliteration, eh?). Have her recommend some wine. Have her recommend some dishes. Have her talk about how it is prepared. She's a rock star foodie.Don't skip dessert. Don't eat the whole next day if you must, but don't skip dessert."
"Just came back on a Saturday evening expecting to have to wait for long lines or slow orders. Let me just say that it went above my expectations even after reading the outstanding reviews.The overall vibe of the place was very European pub style. The place was dimly lit and was mostly filled with tables and high stools with a row of booths on one side.Our waitress, Molly, was lovely and very helpful. The menu was indeed very unique and a bit overwhelming so we followed her recommendations. The food is served tapas-style, which provided a great deal of variety for those who like to try new things. We had the famous bone marrow, wagyu sirloin tips, and mussels.The bone marrow was excellent and was flavorful with a unique gelatin texture to it. The sirloin tips were tender and had a nice, sweet vinaigrette sauce to accompany it. Lastly, the mussels were steamed in a white wine and were absolutely incredible. Our meal was also complimented by a Scottish beer and White Ale which were also fantastic. Make note that their menu is seasonal, providing a constant variety and variation of their items."
"Expectedly the place was super busy! Fun environment but be prepared to wait to get a table. We sat at the bar since it was just two of us. We had to wait to get to our seats as the bartender was crazy busy...we accidentally let it slip that we were just there for a light snack before dinner (elsewhere!). I think the bartender didn't like this because he didn't offer any recommendations (we asked for reco's!) and he didn't come back once our dishes arrived. It was obvious that he could have been nicer since he seemed jovial with other customers. The food was great and it was fun to watch the kitchen in motion but the bartender was sort of a downer. Next time, we will wait for a table in lieu of the bar."
Tried to go but the wait was 4 hours on Sunday
"I've only been here for drinks, but I want to return for an actual meal! We went to the Purple Pig around 10:30 on a Saturday night and had a nice time. The space is loud and crowded but not obnoxiously so. The servers are very nice, and it's the type of place where multiple people will ask you how it's going. The communal tables seem annoying, but they actually didn't bother me too much - maybe because I was with just one person. My date got a thick Scottish beer, which he liked, and I got a nice Spanish red wine. FYI the wine selection by the glass is not very wide at all, and it's definitely on the pricey side. Then again, with a well reviewed upmarket restaurant right off of Michigan Avenue, I can't say I was surprised.The restaurant seemed very cool for two reasons. One - By the time we left (about 11:30), people were still ordering. Love it! Two - Jimmy Bannos Jr., the acclaimed head chef, was hanging out and asking diners how they liked their meals. This man has been written up in Food and Wine cookbooks and has received significant acclaim, but he is down-to-earth, and I really respect that."
"Lizz K recommended The Purple Pig so I knew it would be good but I thought my friend that I was visiting wouldn't be interested as she's vegetarian. Fortunately, my friend heard plenty of great things about this place and knew there would be some vegetarian options so she was up for it.At around 6pm on a warm Monday evening, The Purple Pig was packed. We were told there was going to be an hour wait but we could mill around the bar area til somebody left and eat there. We were in no rush and not starving so we put my name down and sat in their outdoor patio to sip on some wine. We were lucky that it was a lovely balmy evening so sitting outside on their benches was lovely but I can imagine how horrible it is during the winter time!The Purple Pig is basically a tapas style restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Both their food and wine menu is impressive. My friend and I shared the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans and Whipped Feta with Cucumbers Smear. All them were scrumptious but our favorite was the Whipped Feta with Cucumbers Smear! That on their crusty bread kept our dinner conversation minimal for a long time!For ""mains"", she had the Shaved Raw Summer Squash, Hazelnut, Arugula, Opal & Lemon Basil and I, the Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin ""Bread Crumbs"". Her salad was a huge portion and was really good - I never had hazelnut in a salad before and I liked it! My Pork Tripe was unbelievable good but I did expect the pork skin to add more of a crunch, which it didn't. Nevertheless, it was very tasty and I like that it came with more bread! I wish we had space for dolci but we were full to the brim. I'll be back but next time with a meat eater and space for dessert!"
This place was a happening restaurant. It definitely lived up to its hype. Lots of people waiting and very crowded. The food was good but somewhat dainty. You'll definitely want to come here for quality and not quantity. The service was excellent. They attended to you from the moment you start waiting for a table.Must eats:Roasted Bone MarrowMilk Braised Pork ShoulderWagyu Sirloin Tip
"We went to Purple Pig around 3pm on a Monday so there was no wait whatsoever.  We had the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios and it was awesome!  We also got the squid stuffed with prosciutto but the entree I am still drooling about is the JLT! It is pork jowl, lettuce and tomato with lemon aioli and sunny side duck egg.  Pork jowl is definitely the new bacon with the right balance of meat and fat!!! Can't wait to go back again!"
First time here. Amazing food great service. Great recommendations from the servers. A most stop place for foodies.
"Pork o copia...    Just down and dirty swine prepared  exactly as it should be.  Highlights were the bone marrow and the pork jowl BLT.  Also, of note they had a Portuguese wine from a winery we have visited, Esparao, that we very much enjoyed.  First time we have seen it in the states.I have tried to come here a few times, but the long waits have always pushed me elsewhere.  This time it was a primary focus and we got here at 2pm. I will be back, regardless of the wait, as we now know it would be very much worth it."
"I was really excited about this spot... in fact, I had heard about it a few months ago and everytime I mentioned it to somebody they would say.. yes, it's good!  I was prepared.. no reservations are available.  So we stepped in on a Sunday and yes, it was an almost 3 hour wait.  Luckily we waited by the bar and seats opened up so we snagged something quick.  This place really isn't group friendly or family friendly.  Most of the seating is high table (communal) seating or bar seating.. otherwise, you'd probably be in for an even longer wait.Now onto the food and drink...  the drink is okay.. decently priced.  I didn't see any cocktails on the menu so be happy with beer and wine.The reason why this place mainly scores just an a-ok with me is that.. the good things are really good but the other items I tried were really salty or bad... or really mediocre.  I would have ordered the bone marrow but I just had it at Guilt Bar an hour ago before I got here and I know that bone marrow costs about $3 for a whole bag at an Asian market and they charge about $15.The winners were:- Milk braised pork shoulder.. yes, this is amazing.  The mashed potatoes were a tad too salty.- Pork Jowel... that's the cheek.. really good after you dig under the egg.- Pork Osso Bucco... not amazing but good.  I don't know why everything on the menu has an egg on top.. maybe for the presentation.  Risotto was good too.Okay were:- Pig Ears with the Kale... I dunno.. I have had lots of pork ears as I am Asian.  I would say.. they didn't taste like anything except fried bits.  I didn't think this was very good or bad.- Smear on toast... it tasted like fat on toast.  - Desserts... both chocolate cake and panna cotte wasn't anything out of this world.  Tasted what you'd expect.Bad bad bad:- Cauliflower.. bad.  In fact, it was hard and dipped in vinegar which wasn't a good combo.  Not good.- Mussels were just way too salty.  I have no idea why this is a top item.  Totally covered up the flavor of the dish.I would go here again if they started taking reservations.  But there are a lot of places to eat in Chicago... I am sure the hype will die down.  If you do go.. order the winners."
"Pig Heaven!  Bring some friends and get ready to smear and pig out.  I recommend the assortment of meats and cheeses, pork neck bone gravy with ricotta (my favorite!), milk braised pork shoulder (a little salty), fried pig ear with kale, and the razor clams (best I've had anywhere).The wait is long but well worth it and the service is top notch!"
Totally worth the wait. We checked out nearby Eataly & waited for our phone call for open tableEverything was amazing.  Try the pigs ear!! The Greek cornbread was such a surprise and soo wonderful. Pork shoulder & octopus were small portions but totally worth it It was my birthday dinner and was perfect
"It was a Saturday night around 7pm and there were already a ton of people waiting to get a table here! They were all sitting outside, wine glasses in hand. I walked past  everyone, went inside, and got two seats right away. How? BAR SEATS! I always ask if bar seats are first come, first serve and they were! Got really lucky or else we would have ended up waiting for an hour.FOOD: Their cured meats are delicious- get  the coppa. Two other star dishes were the broccoli and milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. I would skip the chorizo stuffed olives.Would come back."
"Solid place for a unique and fun meal downtown. Tons of uncommon dishes on their menu, all wholesome and fresh. The deep fried deviled egg and goat cheese beet and pistachio bowl were exceptional. This place isn't an absolute favorite of mine but a great place to at least try as I thinks the options are so unique, this one is really ""to each is own"" type deal. I'd definitely go back!"
"First negative was our waiter at The Purple Pig. he could not understand for some reason that we did not want to eat red meat, chicken or pork because he kept pushing this tapas. We finally decided to only have a drink (glass of wine) & 2 appetizers....nothing especial! Marinated olives and calamari. My guess is that if you like meat you will enjoy The Purple Pig.Ambiance was good!"
"6 drinks, 10 dishes, 3 desserts, 5 adults. what can i say? my friends and i can eat and we love trying new things.Alot of the dishes were quite salty to my friends and me and they were sold out of their bone marrow.Pork Neck Bone Gravy and Ricotta - this was good. it was a warm thick sauce that you spread on bread and hits the spot on a cold day. The pork was shredded inside a tomatoe sauce.Pork Liver Pate - was delicious. Foie Gras & Membrillo - Was interesting. I dont think I would order it again.Pig Ear with Egg and Kale Chips - This was good. The saltiness of the deepfried pig ear goes well with the egg and kale chips. It was quite delicious.JLT - was good. Razor Clams - was delicious. the sauce on top of the clam was perfect.Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - the pork shoulder was very tender. i enjoyed this dish as well.Chicken Thigh Kebabs - the chicken skin was crispy, the chicken was tender, and it was delicious.Pork Sweetbread - this was recommended in place of the bone marrow. It was interesting. I wouldnt recommend this dish. It had an interesting tart after taste that didnt go well for me or my friends. This dish was left unfinished at my table.Pork Blade Steak - was tender but too salty. i felt the need to have some type of carbs while eating this.For dessert we had:Lemon Panna Cotta - this was very delicious. it was sweet and tart. the lemon pieces was bitter but my friends liked it.Affogato - was delicious. Everything went very well together.Apple crumble - was nothing different. Its your basic apple crumble with ice cream. Theres usually a wait to eat, so go in, put your name down, give them your number, and go site see around the area. Theyll give you a call when your table is ready. :)"
"Tough to get a spot, but a great place to people watch and get great food and drinks. Josh was very helpful at the bar providing suggestions. The calamari and peas both were amazing. The brioche dessert was worth the long wait. It's fun to watch the chefs in action. Can't wait to go back!"
"When a celebrity chef says ""Go here"" you go here! I am not a big fan of the ""We do not take reservations"" but it is a pretty big trend these days. The wife and I waited for a table for about 35-45 minutes outside on their little patio and enjoyed the nice weather, scenery, and their great beer selection. The staff was so friendly and accommodating to those waiting for a table.We took our seats eager to try as many things as we could since the menu was so delicious looking. As a point, the portions are fairly small so be prepared to order a few things, I actually like this style because you can affordably try many different things. The wife and I split 6 different dishes, and they go as followed:-Deep fried green olives stuffed with chorizo. We did not like this because everything just got lost in itself, it was all salt and little flavor, I expected a kick from the chorizo but could not taste it at all, however, it was only $5, so not that big of a deal.-Calamari and Israeli couscous. This dish was amazing; my only complaint is it wasn't never ending! There were a couple of bites that had too much salt stuck to it but as a whole the dish was great. It was a perfect blend of textures and the calamari was amazingly cooked. A total win for me.-Foie Gras. Now this was not real Foie gras, rather, it was more like a mouse but it was still delicious, and it was great with their accompanied fruit relish. I would order this over and over again.-Neck bone gravy/sauce. I was sooo excited for this but it was the biggest let down of the night. I think whoever was salting the dishes this night got a little too excited; this dish was almost inedible due to the sodium level. The fresh ricotta helped cut the saltiness a bit. The meaty neck pieces were good when stripped of the sauce; it was juicy and very tender.-Charcuterie and cheese platter. This dish was decent, however, in comparison to other local platters the purple pig is far behind in quantity and quality. Nothing amazing, but also nothing bad. The pork Agra Dulce was my favorite.-Sweetbreads.These sweetbreads were cooked perfectly and had an amazing breading; the biggest downside was the sauce that was served under it, complete salt lick. We had to remove the sweetbreads from the plate to salvage them; once we did that they were spot on! I was a little bummed because I wanted to try one of the more overrated dishes in the culinary world... Bone marrow, do not get me wrong, it is a good dish, however, as a Asian I have a hard time paying for something that previously you could get for free at the butcher. It has become a very trendy item in the foodie world which in turn increases the prices for a dish that should not just be glorified for its flavor but mostly for its sustainability and versatility. It is interesting to see the food of the ""poor"" become a coveted item for the higher-end restaurants. The peasant food has risen against its oppressor and is now king, I am excited for this since growing up eating mostly the things people would never eat, the downside is having to pay an arm and a leg for it... no pun intended. Long story short, they were not serving marrow this weekend. I really had to give this place 3 stars because it was A-OK, would I go back? Sure, would I give my first born up so I could come back, probably not..... Give this place a try and get several things, be careful though, it can add up, but be sure to try as much as you can, especially things you have never tried before, because  you never know when you will find something that you have been missing your whole life!"
"OMG! Did somebody say porchetta and bone marrow? Yes please! This joint is absolutely one of the best places I have EVER been to!Even with a wait time of 50+ minutes at 2pm, don't pass on your chance to see how pork should be done. They have some of the most unique, interesting, and the best tasting pig I have ever had in my life.You start off with a nice wine and paired cheeses or the gigantic selection of cured meats, OR just go right for the pig like we did. The plates are sized for sharing which is perfect because you're gonna wanna try everything. We started with the Prosciutto Escarole Bread Balls, and Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale and Pickled Cherry Peppers with a Fried Egg. The pig ears were so amazing once you stir in the soft egg yolk, and then it finishes with the perfect touch of acid from the peppers. The Porchetta with Salsa Verde sandwich was like that of the Porchetta in Rome, cooked perfectly and served on crispy bread. Then for our smear course we ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. At first there was disappointment, we were told they were out. But shortly after,coming to our rescue, with the first plate from the kitchen was our waitress to saved the day! This was the  most anticipated, delicious, and fun food I've had in years. You're served the bones with the roasted marrow inside ready for your dining. Messy, yes, but soooo worth it!"
"Ordered the beets, morrow, and shoulder.  The beets were really good. It wasn't what I expected and the marrow were tasty.  The marrow comes with capers, sliced onions, parsley, and sea salt on the side to eat with bread.  The shoulder was a little salty but it was good."
"I felt like oinking on my way out as I grabbed my newly distended belly, waking up this morning and heading directly for an extra long gym visit. Calorie counters beware of this place! But my goodness, they are meaty, delicious calories.A few comments about the place. 8 on a Monday night is still packed and an hour wait. However a friendly wine sommelier/server offered to get us a cocktail while we waited outside on the numerous benches. I don't understand, if they are allowed to do this at these benches, why can't they have more tables out here? They certainly have the crowd for it.Only 2 WCs, unisex. Beware those with small bladders! The quarters in there (and in the restaurant) are a little tight. The decor is nice though.The Milano Manhattan cocktail is quite good, and strong. Quality ingredients were used.The pig ear with fried kale was excellent, and interesting. The ear parts were like little crunchy french fry things, and kind of tasted like a rich, salty pork rind.The goat cheese with beets and a pistachio vinaigrette was delicious - the pistachio was an original way to present this and complemented the rest perfectly.The bone marrow is more textural than anything - the best part of this is how they grilled and prepared the bread, added some salad, and the dash of sea salt. It melts like butter, the bone marrow. You really have to scoop it out of the bone.The pork shoulder, while amazing, was not the pork shoulder at Next for Sicily. Nevertheless, it was delicious and a decent portion.The turkey leg was huge and the accompaniments made it extra tasty.The hazelnut and banana panini is TWO SANDWICHES, perfect for two people, and was absolutely fantastic. Our service was perfect. The explanations were very high level and we asked some tough, Yelper-level questions about ingredients and taste pairings.They have excellent red wine selections and will help you pick pairings if you ask.Oink oink oink oink. I'll be back at off times for a bite or a drink. Followed by a 6 mile run. And then a second one."
"What an amazing place! Great service, with a lovely hostess. The wine/beer list is impressive (my husband had a tasty abbey beer from France). Tapas-style food all gorgeous. Try the fried brussel sprouts! Down to the tiles in the bathroom and the excellent soundtrack (Queen with dinner is recommended) it was a fabulous night."
"The food was fabulous.  I was there with a friend while visiting the city & this place came highly recommended.  We ordered the cauliflower & that was super yummy.  We also had the cheese plate & that was fab.  The eggplant spread with the goat cheese was delicious, too.  In fact, all the food was top notch.  I'm giving it a 3 because of the service.  It took almost 1/2 hour to get our first glass of wine & then we had to order everything twice.  At one point, we even asked the server if we had ordered something & she said no & then when we ordered it AGAIN, she repeated it back to us.  That's when we finally got out food quickly.  Once again, fab food, poor service."
"Delicious! My boyfriend and I had been talking about going to The Purple Pig for months and we finally decided to go for a early dinner to try to avoid the long wait. We arrived around 4:45 and were told the wait would be 45min-1 hour, but ended up being seating in 20min which was lovely. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and he made sure we had everything we needed. We were probably the ideal customers because we ordered far too many dishes and continued to order anything that was suggested, but we wanted to taste everything! The only issue I had was the rude couple next to us who repeatedly complained to the staff about the customers being too young and not ordering wine...I'm not sure what they expected the restaurant to do about the clientele! They even went as far as to specifically complain about my boyfriend and I drinking beer and cider instead of wine! The staff handled their ridiculous complaints well and were very apologetic to the couple (despite doing nothing wrong). We will definitely be returning and recommending The Purple Pig to friends."
I absolutely loved their bone marrow. I was visiting town and stopped here for a quick bite to eat before heading off to adventuring. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and truly enjoyed the selection of foods. I will definitely be coming back here when I visit Chicago again!
"Solid food and very comfortable atmosphere. Dishes are great to share.Chorizo stuffed olives - fried and salty the way you expect it to bePigs ears - super crispy, must getMilk braised pork shoulder - Favorite of the meal, super comforting.Sweetbreads - I wish these weren't breaded and deep fried, but good consideringFoie gras spread - generous serving of ducky fattynessBread pudding - passable"
"Heard the lines get crazy so we came here for an early dinner around 5pm and didn't have to wait at all.Food was definitely amazing! We had the raw corn, grilled octopus, and bone marrow - all delish!The hype is justified."
"Awesome tapa place!  We will definitely come back!We ordered the Bone Marrow, pig platter, and the brussels sprouts!!!I have to say the pig platter was AWESOME!@!!!!!!"
"The best tapas restaurant in Chicago!This restaurant is friendly to both vegetarians and non-friendly. I love eating the crunchy pistachio together with the sweet beets and soft cream. The peppers were colorful and the spice was brought out by the garlic. Finally, I had the best cauliflower dish in Chicago at Purple Pig. Most restaurants cooked cauliflowers with cheese, but Purple Pig cooked two types of cauliflower with salt, which brought out the freshness of the vegetable.I heard that the fried eggplant is also great at Purple Pig, and would love to try that next time. My friends also mentioned the amazing flavor and texture of the bone marrow and the pork cheek. Although the food at Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat are very similar, I like the food at the former more, since the quality is more consistent.I love the food and the service of Purple Pig, and would definitely come back with friends.Food: 5Service: 5Decor: 4"
"I recommend you come here hungry in the mid afternoon with a group of friends, grab seats at the communal table and stay until you can't eat or drink any more. Everything we tried was excellent and the wine selection was overwhelming but well curated. Meatball sliders were a hit with the kids and we couldn't pass up the foie gras as usual. Didn't have high expectations but were blown away. We'll be back."
"The Purple Pig had been recommended to my friend during a recent trip to Chicago and we had a great dinner here.  This is a popular spot for locals and visitors to the city, though, so get ready to wait for a table if you head here around dinner time.  They do have an enclosed outdoor seating area (complete with heaters!) which did not have a wait, so we took our chances.  It was actually pretty packed inside, so I liked the extra elbow room we had in their outdoor area.  They do have mostly communal seating, so you will likely be next to other parties at a long rectangular table.  They have all sorts of interesting food combinations, so if you are looking for a place to experiment with some new cuisine, this is the place to do so.  We weren't extremely hungry, so 3 plates and some drinks were plenty for us.  To start, their beet salad with goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette is to die for.  The goat cheese is light and the beets are perfectly cooked.  We HAD to try the pig's tails (partly because I don't think I have ever seen something similar on another restaurant menu) and I wasn't super impressed, but that might have been because it just wasn't my thing.  The flavor was good and I enjoyed trying something new, but it was quite fatty.  The lamb steak was really tasty and a great choice if you like lamb.  It came with some delicious greens that were flavored perfectly.  The service was good, I enjoyed trying something new and with all the tables bound to be full, there is some great people watching to be had.  A great dinner spot indeed!"
"They don't take reservations, and they are always packed!  Come early and expect a wait.  I came alone so it was pretty easy for me to snag a seat at the counter.  I had the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the mussels, and the cheese plate.   I also ordered the banana, marshmallow, and nutella dessert sandwich.... OMG, so delicious!  I don't particularly care for desserts, but this was really good stuff!  Yum!  Everything was so delicious, I really want to go back! Since I was sitting at the counter I got to watch all the chefs at work and it was very interesting to see how they prepared everything.  It runs a little bit saltier than i'd like, but overall very good.  Service was good and atmosphere was nice too.  It's crowded and a bit loud, but it's a good vibe."
This is one of the Michigan Avenue restaurants that you must hit. It may take a few moments for a spot to sit but it's well worth the wait. I've always had a great time there and amazing food. If you can sit at the bar it makes the experience all the better.
"The Purple Pig has a delectable assortment of platters served tapas style. If you're looking for innovative takes on your typical meat dishes and are looking for a place where you can try a bunch of different plates family-style, I highly recommend coming here.TIP: This place is insanely crowded on the weekend. I would recommend stopping by at 5:30ish to put your name in (the wait can be an hour to an hour and half), then going for a walk along Miracle Mile and browsing the shops before coming back to eat dinner around 6:30-7:00pm. That way, you won't be frustrated by the long wait.We ordered (for two, this was plenty):- Calamari appetizer - This one surprised us, since we're used to more traditional calamari. It was served cold and tossed in a light sauce along with fregula, radishes, cucumbers and pistachios. Light and flavorful.- Roasted bone marrow - Absolutely delicious and decadent. You spread the marrow on chunky bread along with an herb garnish.- Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg - This one was pretty good, but not overwhelming so. The pig ears are tasty but you don't taste the ""pig"" very much and it ends up tasting somewhat like thin, crunchy onion rings. Still worth a try though and the crispy kale is delicious.-Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - I think this was my favorite. The pork shoulder is suuuuper tender and just melts into the buttery mashed potatoes.-Fois gras - I'm not a huge fan of fois gras, but my boyfriend liked it. If you like fois gras, you won't go wrong ordering it here."
"Amazing food, stellar service, casual yet classy ambience, decent prices, and awesome wine selection. Calamari and beets were wonderful and surprising. Never had anything like it, they were both really tasty. The beef wagyu was delicious and light. The pork shoulder was suuuuper scrumptious but note that it's a little on the heavy side. The bread pudding was tasty and while I didn't have any room for it, I definitely made some. The iris dish, which our waiter was bummed to admit, was not available. Boo. Our waiter (had a sleeve, nose ring, plaid shirt and rockin' personality) recommended pretty much everything, including the wine. Excellent service, our waters were always filled and our wine glasses full. Lunchtime (2ish) on a sunday seemed like the perfect time, not very much of a wait. Highly recommended for anyone traveling through or living in Chicago."
"I will keep this short.I went there in November 2013 so maybe things have changed since then. Probably not. The place is overrated and over priced. Worst of all it's over salty. And I love salt. I'm the kinda guy who will pour salt on my plate before tasting the food. I like to gurgle with sea water. You get my point. So if I find the food to be too salty... Chicago, we have a problem. Bone Marrow - fatty and tasteless. I have no idea what I paid for with this one.Pigs ear - salty and nothing special.Olive oil poached tuna - oily (I guess that's expected) and not delicious. Probably was salty but I can't remember. Charred Cauliflower - might be good but I didn't appreciate the chopped pickle in itCheese platter - tastyNutella Toast dessert - F####ng awesome. Only really worthwhile thing we hadService wasn't really great. Took ages to catch the waitresses attention which I hate, especially in a small place. Oh yeah, and the wait is about 90 minutes."
"First time here at this restaurant.  Got high expectations.  Sure didn't let me down.+amazing view of the city with live music nearbyvast variety of dishesvery fresh greenslove all the pig dishes-the only dish i didn't really like is the rabbit salad...just a little gamey, but some people like that. just not me.definitely come here again next time i'm in Chicago."
"FantasticGood service, excellent food that is very creative with a lot of flavor!"
More than 2 hours waiting.Extremely chaotic ambience because of crowded tourists.Aweful GREASY food.Nuff said.
"HOLY CRAP! So glad we came here for dinner!If you like Tapas, then this is the place to check out in downtown Chicago.  Unique flavored pork tapas that will blow you away!Great looking spot.  I'm not a fan of shared tables as it doesn't allow for any privacy but  peeps are friendly and you get to check out other people's orders. Be prepared a very lively atmosphere.  This place gets SUPER CROWDED, LOUD, and CRAMPED. Definitely not a place for romantic first dates.Our top faves on their menu: bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, pig earsOur server was fantastic! Great spot if you enjoy tapas!"
"As always, amazing. Long wait, so worth it. They offer to call you!  Every meal is worth a try. One of our favs!"
"Best meal my husband and I have had in recent memory!!!Definitely get there early because there will be a wait. When we arrived, we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes (this was at about 5:40pm on a Friday...). We were told to put down our name and number and they would call us when our table is ready - awesome because we were able to go to a nearby cafe to grab a drink and sit while waiting, or if you want to, you can do some shopping on Michigan Ave. We were seated by about 6:15pm. (Note: by about 8pm the quoted wait was up to about 2 hours.)This is what we ordered...Salt-roasted beets, whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette: This was a great start to the meal. Neither of us had tried beets before, and just by themselves, we probably wouldn't have enjoyed them very much, but the combination of the beets with the creaminess of the goat cheese was incredible! Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: This was probably our favorite dish. Extremely generous portion of bone marrow roasted to gooey perfection, complimented by refreshing herbs, all of which can be piled onto delicious buttery toast.Mussels with Pancetta, Creme Fraiche & Marjoram: Mussels were huge and the soup was delicious.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: The pork shoulder was so incredibly tender - no forks or knives needed, we used spoons to eat this entire dish. Another aspect that sets this place apart is the service we received. For dessert, we were debating between the Panino con Nutella and the Sicilian Iris. The server recommended the Sicilian Iris which is what we proceeded to order. When we got it and sliced it open, my husband noticed that some of the dough was still raw. When we asked our server about this, she immediately apologized and took it back to the kitchen. She promptly returned to tell us that that had happened because the dough hadn't been proofed enough and that it would be a long wait if we wanted another one. Instead of having us wait, she said that the chef was willing to give us the Panino con Nutella on them. This was a solution we were more than happy with. (The ""Panino"" was a full size sandwich filled with nutella, melted marshmallow and bananas.... YUM!)Delicious food, great service, an amazing experience overall!!!"
This is a good place for late night hang out. Great wine and beer selections. But the food?? I don't know if I wanna go back there for food. I went there with my two other friends.We ordered 8 different items on the menu including pig ear and squid legs. Most of the dishes were SALTY!!!! I ended up drinking a galon of water that night.But I will go back to try their beers but not for food....
"Heard from a few friends that this is a ""must-go"" place in chicago. I'm glad that i got a chance to check it out after visiting this place 3 times!I knew they don't take reservation, but i had never thought the wait could be so CRAZY! yes.....extremely CRAZY! I would totally avoid to go on weekend, especially when you have a group of 7. This is why we visited THREE times:-We tried to go on a friday at 9pm, the wait was at least 1.5 hour. -We tried again the next day (sat) at 8pm, the wait was 3 hours. -And finally we decided to go on the following monday, which was our last night in chicago, at 7pm, the wait for a little over an hour. Even thou food was good, i don't know if it's worth it to wait THAT long.....Food was good, but on the greasy side. I like the foie gras mousse and bone marrow spread. They are a must! The pig ear is also an interesting dish. As for main course I like the wagyu sirloin tip the most. The steak was so tender and juicy. I would NOT recommend the mussels. I love mussels, but their mussels were so tiny and portion was quite small. Milk-braised pork shoulder was nice too. I would recommend to try out this place, but if i have to wait for 3 hours.....just forget it!"
"Another yelp fail. I mean, with 1700+ reviews this seems like the place to try, right??? No problem grabbing two seats at the bar, which helped us avoid the long wait on a saturday night. We decided to try the Eggplant Parmesan Balls and of course the Bone Marrow, since it seemed so popular. The balls were good, not great, at least has some pretty good flavors. But the bone marrow - WTF??? We literally ate fat off bones. The garlic bread they serve it with is good, but overpowers any taste of the bone marrow - which had none! It tasted like pure fat, you know, the stuff you tear off the side of your steak. Such a waste of $14. Their beers are unique, but a little pricey, and an extensive wine list of only foreign wines. What irritated us the most was the service. The interaction with us and our server was great (you know, the fake show they're putting on to try and get tips), but we just happened to be sitting next to the server hangout at the bar where they could be overheard talking crap on guests. Even a manager (I assuming it was a manager since he was wearing a grey shirt instead of a black one) said ""Are we closed yet?"" to another server. Seriously!?!? Fine. We'll leave. We didn't know we weren't welcome. Take my advice and don't give this place a try, no matter how appealing it seems on yelp."
"I went here on Thursday for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We went to the Bose store while we waited for our table. It was a 45-60 minute wait, which wasn't so bad. When we got our seats, we were seated outside by the door. At first I was hesitant to take off my jacket because it was quite cold and I doubted I would be warm enough in my tank and cardigan, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It probably helped that we had 2 bottles of wine to keep us warm. Haha.We had a variety of dishes to share amongst the 4 of us.-Braised Artichokes with potatoes - not a fan. Hardly any artichokes. One bite and that was it.-Bone marrow - I absolutely LOVE the bread that comes with it. The bone marrow was very soft and melts in your mouth. I HIGHLY recommend that you sprinkle a generous amount of the salt that they provide you or else it just tastes like fat and bread. The salt gives it some character. -Pork shoulder - so tender, but a little bit too salty for me-Prosciutto bread balls - nothing spectacular, but still tasty with the sauce on top.-Pig jowl - I've never had this piece of the pig before, but I was surprised at how tender it was.-Scallop spiedini - huge scallops! But pretty standard.-Manila clams - one of my favorite dishes of the night. I ordered a side of bread just so that I could dip it in the juices. It had a kick to it, which I absolutely loved.-Veal mortadella sausage - I was a little disappointed because I thought I was going to get a pounded piece of veal meat, but I didn't read the menu clear enough to see that it was a sausage! Either way, I liked the dish a lot. You had to put everything on top of the sausage! The cherry tomatoes were sweet and tart. Perfect.-Prosciutto crusted cobia - I wish this dish was a bit bigger since we had to split it 4 ways. But it was a nice clean fish. -Meatball sliders - this meatball is little bit bigger than a golf ball, so it was a little difficult to eat, but very delicious.-Lemon pana cotta - probably, one of my favorite dishes. It was perfectly cool, smooth and silky with the lemon flavor while the crunchiness and saltiness of the pistachio gave it this great crunch. I want to look up a recipe and learn how to make it!-Nutella panini - nothing spectacular. Just bread, nutella and banana together. I'd rather try their salted caramel ice cream!All in all, we had a great time. The bill was about $300 including tip for 4 people. I wasn't as cold as I thought I was going to be. The service was good and it never felt like we waited an excessive amount of time. One thing that I would like to point out is to perhaps close up the holes in the tent and make sure the food runners know where they are going with their dishes. A couple of times they ran to our tables with food that we never ordered and left, only to come back and snatch the dish away. Thank you Purple Pig!"
Love the bone marrow and milk braised pork shoulder. Great place with good wine selection and tasty food
"After reading all the good reviews I picked this place to have my birthday lunch. The food is mediocre and the service was awful.We had the pigs ear which tasted just like fried pork skins.The bone marrow didn't have any marrow in it.the octopus was the only thing that I was happy with, it was actually tender and flavorful.skip the pork fried almonds since it just taste like almonds with grease. we had a couple of other things and Most of the food was just salty and fatty. To top it off one of the waiters spilled coffee on my sister and wasn't very apologetic at all, nor was the manager. They only knocked off 8 dollars from our bill LOL!!! AWESOME service!!!!!!!!! Save yourself the time and money and go to bandera which is across the street, the food is so much better and actually worth the money. HELL NO, i would never EVER come back here again!"
Do they get their salt for free? It is so salty.... I drink half cup of water after every single bite! I just want to finish this ASAP and run back home and cook for ourselves.
"Was in Chicago for business and had heard the Purple Pig was a must, so went last day and so glad I did! I want to have the Purple Pig come to Costa Mesa! The energy is great, amazing service, vast and interesting wine list, great menu. I had the stuffed olives, they were good but a bit too salty for me, the pork shoulder was killer!!! And the panna cotta was melt in your mouth delish!! The person sitting next to me was in town on business too and she had been 3 times that week.My plea once again... Open a Purple Pig in Costa Mesa CA!!!! Pplleeaaasseee!!!!"
"So being new to Chicago, i'm trying to find all the gems in a hurry. As i'm walking through the city, I notice their tagline ""Cheese, Swine & Wine"" and my first thought is ""Hey! I like all 3 of those things."" So I ventured in and i'm so glad I did. Now first off, they don't take reservations and were told it would be a 2 hour wait (Saturday night @ 8:30pm). We ended up getting lucky and grabbed two seats at the bar that opened up halfway through our first glass of wine. Once we sat down we were looking right into the kitchen and everything being prepared in there looked amazing. The wine list is extensive as well as expensive but there are some very good alternatives if you're on a budget. We started with a cheese plate that made me smile like a kid on Christmas morning. I'm not telling you what to order from this list but get the delice de bourgogne, you will thank me later. We also ordered the Chorizo Stuffed Olives (I know right?!?) and the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (succulent). We were eyeing the Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive, & Agrodolce or the Pork Osso Bucco with Soft Polenta & Gremolata which were both big enough to share. But since the place has swine in the name, we went with the pork. Boom!Overall, you won't be disappointed with any part of this place. From the view (right by Michigan Ave) to the great wine and delectable food, it's all that and a bag of chips. (chips not sold here)"
I used to love this place but they took the pig's tail off the menu which was my favourite thing. When I said they took the best thing off the menu. The response I got was rude. Not sure I'll be back.
"No wonder this restaurant was voted ""rising star chef of the year, 2013"".  This place was fantastic.  They do not take reservations but were able to walk in on a Tues afternoon around 1:30 and get 2 seats at the bar- a table was approx 30 min wait.  Our server/bartender Brendan was very knowledgable and very friendly.  He was able to recommend several wines for us to try.  We ordered several food items, many based on fellow yelpers reviews.  To start, we had the almonds fried in pig fat, tossed with roasted garlic and rosemary.  I am pretty sure I could eat these all day every day.  We then moved on to a cheese and cured meat pairing which was also delicious- the bleu and brie being the standouts.  And then the meal that had me a little hesitant to order but as stated before soooo many wonderful reviews about the bone marrow had this foodies taste buds curious.  It came out and was wonderfully presented in the bone.  Spread it on a toast slice, drop a little bit of sea salt and top with herbs and you have a buttery piece of heaven in your mouth.  I can not say enough good things about this place, it really was a real culinary treat."
"I was in one of my favorite cities, Chicago, last month and stumpled upon the Purple Pig.  If you like chartcuterie and cheeses, look no further!  I was staying at the Intercontinental and the Pig was right across the street so for convenience sake we wandered over after we checked in.  The place was hopping and lively.  We took a seat at the bar and had the bartender recommend wine and beer and a cheese selection.  Now, any time I have a great glass(es) of wine and a fabulous cheese, I am in heaven, so it was not difficult to please me.  My partner in crime for the weekend, has some food and gluten allergies and they were more than accomodating and went out of the way to make sure she was happy with her beverage and food.  I would recommend this spot for dinner, or just some snacks and wine if you are in the area.  If you love meat and cheese, get the Purple Pig Platter!  It is a huge variety of everything and is served on a large cutting board.  Oink!"
"Let me preface my review by saying I am asian and I LOVE eating every part of the pig. I grew up eating the ears, intestines, and many other parts that my mom still has not told me what they are...On that note, I have to say this place was AMAZING! Even my boyfriend who was not too happy about going here and is extremely picky, loved it here- even the ears and bone marrow.They told us the wait would be 1 hr and 40 min, but ended up only being 1 hr. If you just hang around, most people leave before they call the name so the wait isn't too bad. On to the food... 1. Pig ears: The best appetizer of them all. Crispy and didn't taste like ears at all! So good! I highly recommend this. 2. Bone marrow: I love bone marrow, but this just tasted like spreading butter on bruchetta. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. It was just fun to say I ate ""bone marrow."" 3. CalamariSaw the other glowing reviews about this and ordered it. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. This was just marinated with what seemed like lemon and herbs. 4. JowlOrdered by recommendation from waitress. Basically like a slab of bacon on bread. It was good, but considering the long wait and how much fat was on that meat, I wouldn't order it again.5. PORK SHOULDERThis is a must order! So good!!!! This was the best by far. Moist and tender with a gravy that perfectly complemented. I've never had pork shoulder so tender or yum before...Overall, if you haven't been here I definitely recommend going. The wait is well worth it and once you're seated, there was no wait for the food. It came out fast."
"I am not a person who branches out into exotic or unusual foods, but I love tapas restaurants so we gave it a try. Yes, there is a crazy wait time. Expect to wait at least 90+ minutes. But, they call you via cell phone when your table is ready. Brilliant!I'd recommend the bone marrow pork smear. Excellent! I would go back for that dish alone. Definitely try the chicken thigh kabobs/potatoes--It really had a classic Mediterranean flavor! Although I thought thought the pork sausage/peas was decent, I felt the flavor combinations were conflicting and probably wouldn't order again. Last but not least, you definitely need to complete your meal with one of their many delicious desserts!All of the staff work VERY hard and run their tails off. Excellent food, excellent service!"
"Yelp! Yelp! Yelp!  It's as good as it gets.  From the ambiance to the servers and food, this place has it going on.Love it when the staff is so knowledgeable of the menu.  From the salads, smears and other apps.  This place offers a plate of deliciousness. My beautiful partner ordered the 6 oz. steak and he loved it.  He said that it was cooked to perfection.  We ordered the grilled cauliflower, along with the tomato smear and eggplant smear.  It was outstanding.  Warning....if you do order one of the smears I do have to say that the toasted bread slices that they serve are pretty thick and filling and did I mention delicious.This place is doing everything right.  Their kitchen stays open til midnight and its always packed.  We arrived around 11:30 a.m. yesterday and the wait was only 20-25 minutes.  Evening I heard that the wait is about 1 - 2 hours long.   The place is pretty epic. I would recommend to put your name and number on the wait list, and go shopping or have a cocktail at the bar if there are seats available.  We did decide to grab some open seats at the bar.  When they did call us to let us know that our table is ready, we were too comfortable at the bar area chatting with the staff.  We decided to give up our seats and eat at the bar.This place does not disappoint.  Check it out.  It's a must.  Although the restaurant is not big, it is however, big on flavors.  You'll love it."
"Food is amazing! I wasn't a big fan of the bone marrow but everything else was over the top. We stopped by one evening and were told it would be a 2 hour wait, um.. no thanks but boy did I need to know what people were waiting 2 hours for. We returned the very next day and planned ahead to wait (1hour for lunch). It was well worth the wait. Delicious food, busy but friendly place, and will in fact be returning when i visit this beautiful city. Its a must do for any visitor AND local!"
"Overrated hipster central with salty and greasy (in a bad way) food.  You must be out of your mind if you're willing to wait 2+ hours to sit in cramped shared tables eating this food.Food: 2/5- Salty & fatty.  That seems to be the theme here.  Usually when you say salty and fatty, one thinks of delicious glorious bacon or similar items.  However, this place served salt and fat without other flavors to balance out each dish.  Everything tasted the same.  Ultimately, the food was not impressive and left us queasy and thirsty.  Service: 4/5- The staff was nice.  Environment: 4/5- If you're looking for a hipster joint, this place is for you.  Cool, small, cramped, shared tables, etc.Value: 2/5- Overpriced for what it is with small portions.  You're paying for the location and environment, not the food.Return?  No, just go to Girl & The Goat if you're craving new american food at a hipster joint."
"Purple Pig is a nice neighborhood staple. I first started coming here in spring of 2011. We had a salad of beet and goat cheese that was heavy on the beet and light on the goat cheese, with a lovely pistachio vinaigrette. We also tried an amazing dish of eggplant and goat cheese. There were also delicious chicken kebabs, fried smashed potatoes and tzaziki. To finish we gorged on a panino con nutella. Overall lots of fun flavors and tasty bites. The line and lack of reservations made it a huge deterrent to return frequently though."
"Stopped here for a late afternoon snack and wound up ordering enough food for a light dinner instead.  We had the braised pork shoulder, chicken kebabs and and the three cheese platter.  I was with two very non-adventurous eaters and they were a bit skeptical about coming here.  They were thrilled with our dining experience and even though they weren't very adventurous, they feel like they were.Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."
"I really loved this place as evidenced by the amount of food we ordered.I think it was 12 dishes for 4 people, which included the Meat Platter.  And we left no dish uncleaned.There are so many things I recommend here - meat platter, truffle goat cheese, octopus (very soft, but without losing the texture), roasted cauliflour with pickles, and the smears.  Oh the Smears - basically different combinations of meat/cheese/sauce that you mix up and spread on thick crusty bread... we tried one that was like the most delicious bolognese you ever had, soft tender pork, flavorful chunky tomato sauce, and the creamiest, softest ricotta.  It was so delicious.I highly highly recommend the Purple Pig if you are in Chicago."
Purple Pig has a butt load of reviews so I'll just try to keep this short n' sweet.  If there's one thing on the menu that you gotta order it's the JLT.  This mother f*cker has pork jowl on it which tastes like the most delicious bacon in the world crossed with ham... and did you say fried duck egg?!?  Yeah yah did b/c the JLT has one of those too!  If you don't like this dish you're a horrible person living a miserable life.  Just remember Purple Pig is popular because it's awesome and since they don't take reservations you're probably in for a bit of a wait.  To put it in perspective we went on a Friday afternoon at 1:00 and had to wait 30 minutes ...so you do the math as to what a Saturday night might be.
This place is always pack but the food is good! There are always a line starting in the morning. It is a very small inside so be ready to sit next to somewhere you don't know. Full bar. Good food. Small portion. Expensive
"Visited based on a recommendation a server gave us while dining at the Sanford in Milwaukee.  Great tip.  Fun lunch.Sat outside on a gorgeous summer afternoon for lunch.  Lucked out and were seated immediately.Very friendly service helped us navigate the menu.Ordered pig ears, olive oil tuna, and Greek caviar smear.  Plenty of food for the two of us.  If we did it again, we would likely just do two dishes for lunch.All dishes were great.  The pepper and egg accompaniment on the pig ears made the dish.  Smear was good but would have preferred much thinner bread.  Tuna was a great summer dish with excellent quail eggs.For dessert, we had lemon panne cotta.  It was a superb palette cleanser.  Light and just the right sharing size.  Lemon was not over the top lemony.  Server recommended a wine from Slovakia.  Great tip."
"At first, I was extremely annoyed that they did not take reservations. When I got there (15 degrees out), I had just arrived at the airport, cabbed to my hotel, cabbed to The Purple Pig, and then was told the wait was about an hour and a half. Since this was my first night venturing about Chicago, I decided to take a brisk walk... Unfortunately, it was about 9:30p and everything around had already closed shop... The Magnificent Mile was still magnificent, though. Adds a bit of romance to the city when you pass by Cartier in freezing weather while starving your bottom off... (o_O wtf? I know...)When I got back to the restaurant, I was promptly seated, my order was taken the moment I was ready, the food was perfectly timed so there wasn't too much food sitting on the table getting cold. This is the type of establishment where you order 2-4 small plates per person and share amongst the table. It's a great way to nosh on a little of everything. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - SPLENDIDLY served in the cutest little pork shaped bowl. The textures were amazing and the pop of the salt in the pickled peppers mixed with the crunch of the crispy kale and richness of the runny fried egg was mouthwatering to say the least.Potato and Speck Croquettes with Calabrian Chili Aioli - I don't quite remember this dish as one that stood out, but it wasn't bad...Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Eggover Grilled Bread - I love anything with fried egg and bread, so I had to order this... Again, amazing, but if you were to get just one fried egg dish, I'd go with the pig's ear.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - buttery, creamy, awe-inspiringly tender pork, fluffy clouds of mashed potatoes... I loved it.Now I realize why they don't accept reservations... If they did, I probably wouldnt be able to get a table until 2015. It's worth the wait. Trust me."
"It pains me whenever my dining experience does not match that of others at an esteemed restaurant... but here it goes.The good: - Very friendly and helpful staff: We came in around 6 pm on a Sunday and it was packed. We found chairs in front of the bathroom and the hostess came around twice to make sure she got our names correct for when our table would become available. The speculated hour wait turned out to be 45 minutes instead. Our server was also attentive without being overbearing and came to check up on us multiple times. - Wine list: The choices are expansive, covering both old and new world wines. The prices start from $10+ for a glass, which is competitive with prices at other popular establishments.- Menu options: The different and creative dishes on the menu are so interesting. I think the name of ""The Purple Pig"" really fits with what the chefs are doing here with twists and whimsical surprises in terms of what you could serve up with a pig. I have never seen pig's feet on a menu until dining here.The not-so-good:- Pig ear with kale: Too much fry and not enough pig ear. I couldn't taste the meat at all and there was so much fry compared to the kale. That paired with the fried egg rendered this dish to be quite heavy. We didn't finish this dish.- Mussels: Be aware of the cilantro in this dish! I have never had it prepared with cilantro before and the addition of this vegetable gave the mussels and its broth a fragrance that I couldn't warm up to. Plus, the mussels were so tiny!- Bone marrow: I wish the salad wasn't so heavily dressed given the super buttery bone marrow and the super buttered toasts. I felt that there was nothing to cut through the fattiness of the dish. We didn't finish this dish either.I would come back to try other dishes besides these three but I recommend ordering one dish at a time to check with the level of heaviness so that you can balance it out more rather than ending up like us with three heavy dishes."
Come for a late dinner- 10:30pm or later and get seated in MUCH less time than if you come sooner.
"O.M.G. The food is AMAZING. I almost gave this review four stars because it is very crowded, loud, and if you have more than two people, you are more than likely have to share a table. Then, I had to food. WOW. Don't be fooled by the ""tapas"" style plates; the food is rich and filling. I almost erupted!My 8 yo joined us for dinner and he had the pork blade steak with honey. My hubby ordered the turkey leg and a fava bean salad, and I ordered the scallops and the foie gras with membrillo. First of all, I have been eating fava beans cooked wrong because this was the first time I had them and they were delicious! They went so well with my scallops plate. The foie gras was smooth and buttery and my son's pork blade was a large cut and so juicy. But I have to say the piece of resistance was the turkey leg. OMG. Never had a turkey so juicy, and smoky and falling apart from the bone. Yep, a turkey leg was that good. These meals are perfect with an Estrella (Spanish) beer. That's how they eat in Spain...tapas that include lots of pork everywhere so the crisp taste of the beer hits it perfectly. I love the eclectic crowd too. There's no reservations so either go when it opens or after 8pm. I can't wait to go back!"
"To start, this would be a 5 star rating if the price wasn't so (relatively, I'll explain later) sky high.This is located off of Millenium Mile on Michigan Ave.  If you're walking by, you can actually miss it.  Purple Pig is a nice socializing type of a restaurant.  You can share a cheese plate, charcutery (sp?), bottle of wine, or some tapa-type foods.Recommendations:- Milk Braised Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes..... as tender and juicy as it can get.- Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce (see my picture).... YES YES YES!!!  And this one is huge (allllllmost Disneyland huge), so this portion size is sharable w/out you thinking ""UH Uhhhhh, this one's all mine YO!""- Lamb w/ goat cheese (see pic)..... this was absolutely tastey.  If you like lamb, you're gonna really enjoy this.I say this place is ""relatively"" sky high in price b/c, when you see it, it's a swanky type of atmosphere where you'd think people are conducting schmoozing type lunches with clients, guys trying to impress their dates, or just some wine & cheese snob who wants to show off their intelect.  Don't get me wrong, LOVED this place and I'd definitely go again.  Prices are just higher than you'd think.Didn't get around to trying some cheese, but I will next time.  If you can, eat outside under the heat lamps."
First rating is always the service.  We sat outside and Alex was our server.  We had never been here so we asked him for recomendations from wine to desert.  He picked each course for us..and he did not choose the priciest.  The food was amazing and we believe we can cook and typically cook at home.  We had lunch and considered going back for dinner but thought that might be weird.  We will absoluety be back..We had the Mortadella Smear.. Pork Blade Steak. Tangarine Cake eith Olive Oil Gelato.  We eat out a bit and believe Alex is in our top 5 servers.
"On a Tuesday evening at 9:30pm, there was a 30 minute wait.  I love Chicago!I was a bit apprehensive since their sign is right on Mag Mile (= touristy) so may be able to take advantage of foot traffic and skip the attempt at quality service or food.  Thankfully, I was very pleasantly proven wrong.Just me, so I sat at one of the high community tables when a seat opened up.  Friendly folks sitting there were kind enough to let me join :-)Server was right out with a wine list and a menu.  I could have looked for an hour through that wine list!  Stuck with a glass of rose cava was very pleased that it was a dry and crisp as recommended.  Service was kind, unpretentious and efficient.They have a dozen + small plates to choose from, and I chose the duck salad to start.  An amazing mix of herbs and flavour and the duck was fantastic.  Excellent!  Cheese plate with a truffle goat that was heaven came next as I didn't have enough room for another small entree and dessert, and figured a cheese plate could meet both desires.Atmosphere is incredibly lively and loud, so go with that in mind if you want a serious conversation with anyone :-)I only wish I lived closer (as CA is a bit far to go for dinner) to try out their other fantastic looking dishes!"
"Holy Moly.  We ordered many small plates and I was incrementally impressed with each one!   And by incrementally impressed, I mean the first thing we ordered was amaze-balls.BTW, I am still having dreams about that pate.  It was amazing.  I'd fly back to Chicago just to eat it again."
"This place has awesome, original and delicious food but it's so busy that the experience can also be hard to enjoy. They don't take reservations so if you come for dinner be prepared to wait for a long time (up to an hour or more on a busy night)...which can be a bummer. This place is soooo good and has such a prime location that invariably it's just packed  and you spend the majority of the time crammed in between people and waiting. I think the best way to enjoy this place is to come at around 2 or 3 in the afternoon (in between the lunch and dinner crowd). Honestly, if you have brunch at 10am and then do a bunch of shopping on the Mag Mile...its a good time to grab a bite. And this place fits the bill exactly, small plates of meat, cheese and bread with some wine or beer...yeah, it's heaven.As the afternoon wears on you can keep adding a few more dishes and even dessert....but it's a fun place to hang out with plenty of good music and a vibrant scene to boot. The only problem with eating at that time is trying to figure out what to do with dinner! You either have to find a place to go late night (after a show perhaps)...or just skip it altogether...either way, it's a lot better then waiting for hours on a table and feeling hungry and frustrated once you finally sit down. Cheers!"
"The first time we tried to come here on a Friday night the wait was 2 hours.  TWO HOURS! We abandoned that plan that night.This time, we were on our way home while passing by, so we put our name down, walked home, did some stuff, and came back an hour later--just in time for our name to be called (they can take your number and text you as well.)Worth it? YES. We didn't even feel bad for the hoard of people still waiting outside when we left, because we knew they'd leave happy in the end as well. This place is FANTASTIC.  EVERYTHING we got was delicious, and I don't think it was because we have good taste or luck in ordering.  I'm pretty sure we could've randomly picked a bunch of dishes and would still have been blown out of the water.Just for the sake of completeness, this is what we got:bone marrowpig ear/kale/fried eggprosciutto stuffed squidmanila clams with merguez sausagefried manchego All were AMAZING. Every dish had the most unique flavor, in a way that we wouldn't even imagine trying to recreate at home without some serious culinary training.  Yes the place is cramped, and yes they don't take reservations...so we're hoping to come back someday in the future when it's -70 degrees windchill and 10 feet of snow when the wait will only be 40 minutes or so."
the people I was with loved it but I was really hungry so it was totally wasted on me. I would rather have pizza.
"Nom nom nom!   We had the chicken fries, scallops and calamari.  Soooooo delicious.  The calamari was so unique and awesome and refreshing.  My friend and I each had a glass of Moscato which was perfect for the food we had."
"This small-bites place is perfect for the pickier palette, though I wasn't blown away overall. A great comparison might be...Traif in New York, although they nailed the concept a little better. Ideally, you're ordering multiple plates to share, though we found the plates a bit hit and miss. The chicken kebabs were great for instance, but my friend's salad was so drenched in bleu cheese there were whole sections she couldn't eat. If you're a salt and meat fan, you'll love it, but considering how little space we had to maneuver (I took more elbows to the back than I care to remember) and the quality/quantity of food for the price, I wished for a little more."
A very nice place to have a relaxing lunch by sharing Mediterranean style small dishes. Worth a try.
"My meal here was perfect. The food and service were spot on!I'll start by saying that as someone in her early 20s who loves good food and dines out quite often, it's rare that I encounter AMAZING service due to my young age. I was very surprised by how friendly and informative our server Heather was. She suggested we order 2-3 plates per person and even validated my choices by saying ""EXCELLENT choice!"" which I appreciated lol.To start we had the crispy pig ears, which were served in the cutest little piggy dish that ironically was missing one ear! There was a sunny side up egg on top of the thinly sliced pig ears and kale which the busboy instructed us to break and mix up. I'm not a big fan of fried food but the runny egg helped cut the ""fried-ness"" of the dish.The turkey leg confit is .... the size of my head. No joke. This baby is HUGE. If you order this, you can subtract 1 dish from the ""2-3 dishes per person"" rule. The turkey leg has a slightly sweet sauce offset by the capers. Perfectly moist and fall of the bone tender.The dish I was looking forward to the most was the bone marrow spread. TO. DIE. FOR. Spread it on the toast like butter. Soooo rich. But top it off with some greens, capers, and a sprinkle of sea salt and you have the perfect balance of flavors.At this point, my boyfriend and I are about to burst at our seams. We still had one dish (milk braised pork shoulder) remaining but it hadn't appeared even 20 minutes after the last dish was served. We ask Heather if perhaps the kitchen forgot about it. If they did, then it'd be fine and we'd like to cancel the order. But if they were in the process of making it, we'll take it. She came back to us and told us that it was on the way but since we were so full, she'll take it off the bill. But she said she REALLY wanted us to try it since it's one of their most popular dishes so she was going to bring it out for us to taste FREE OF CHARGE. HOW WONDERFUL WAS THAT?!!??Loved my meal here. Will return if I'm ever in Chicago again."
Yum Yum Yummy...enjoyed the goodness in my tummy.  I have eaten here previously and have enjoyed my experience every single time.  I recommend the pork shoulder and the pig ear with crispy Kale but would pass on the fois groie (?sp) next time I go.I have to mention this: The one thing that was a little gross for me that ruined my experience-- the restaurant floor!  DISGUSTINGLY slippery!  I was tempted to knock off a star for this reason but elected not to.  They really need to do better on this regard.  I would go back for sure!
"So let me tell you my story. We were visiting Chicago for a few days and we had to jam pack all the sights and places to eat into 2 days. So on the 2nd day, we were hanging out at the Navy Pier since we had a boat tour (Shoreline Sightseeing Skyline Tour) at 5:15pm and the Cirque Shanghai show at 7pm. So between 5:45-6:55pm, we'd have to catch a bite to eat. I found the Purple Pig on yelp and judging from the number of reviews, I knew this place would be packed at 6pm on a Friday (no doubt about it). But I just had to try it since it was rated as a top restaurant to eat at in Chicago!So what we ended up doing was power-walking to the Purple Pig from the Navy Pier (~10 min walk) and ordering food to-go at the bar. We were in and out in less than 20 minutes! Amazing service. Ended up getting back to the pier at 6:25pm and eating everything we had ordered:-Bonemarrow spread and toasted bread with capers-Milk braised Pork Shoulder on mashed potatoes-Wagyu Beef Sirloin Tip with potato fingerlings and red onionsAll are recommended by me!! Delicious! And ordering to-go at the bar definitely helped us beat the clock and allowed us to try some amazing food. If you have a time-crunch, perhaps you might consider doing the same!"
"We had a quick lunch here so I would love to come back and linger... and also eat more... But what we had was stellar!  I was a little scared at first, when we saw a huge line before the place had even opened and thought it might be a bit too touristy... but all the reviews were pretty good and it was recommended... Salt-Roasted Beets withWhipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette... ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg... Prosciutto di Parma.  Mmmm!!!  Great service... comfy... love all the communal tables."
Wow ! I'm so disappointed!  I work a block away and we came here late night with a date ... The waiter (Mario ) literally walked away from us mid sentence ! I'm so upset because I entertain clients here all the time and this guy treated me like I was inconveniencing him! Sorry I just ordered 150 bucks worth of food is that a bother ? Well the guy that was training with him (Tim) actually tried be a nice waiter and helped us out even though e was clearly embarrassed :(
"Every time that I have been here has been a pleasant surprise. But it will warrant me coming back to try more and more things that are on their menu as I can't really hold back on any place that has the word 'Pig' in it and makes use of various 'alternative' parts that are not typical in American cuisine. Being Filipino, I am used to this and loved seeing their menu wanting to explore everything!  This time, I played either the Pork Neckbone Rillette & Mostarda - spreadable meat at its best! A bit tight in terms of seating and there can be a decent wait as they don't take reservations but it's worth it once you've done some exploration with your taste buds."
"One word review: overrated. I spent 50 bucks at this place for three plates of food and a glass of wine, and I was still hungry when I asked for the check. Portions are very small and the food is not tasty at all. Has one of the worst quality/price ratios. But it has good ambiance anyway."
"Disclaimer: They claim to be small plates, but the portions aren't that small at all!Disclaimer 2: The wait is pretty long regardless of when you come. I came with my friend at 2:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon and we weren't seated until 3:15.This place is pretty amazing! They have some really creative dishes and bold flavors that make everything an adventure for the first time. And for the most part, these are some of the best dishes I've ever had.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - 5/5 - Oh my. I wasn't sure what to expect and it was just amazing. The bone marrow is so fatty and soft and juicy and rich. Paired with delicious fried bread, it's an explosion of oil in your mouth, but in a good way! Every bit of oil and grease contributed to the flavor and the  The capers are nice to offset all the richness of everything.Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - 5/5 - I'm not the biggest fan of goat cheese to be honest, but this was amazing. The strong flavors of the beets and the goat cheese offset each other perfectly. And to top it off, they was a nice layer of pistachios to give some crunch to an otherwise soft dish in additional to the nuttiness.Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce - 4/5 - THIS THING IS HUGE. The turkey was soft and almost melted in your mouth. The one thing I didn't like about it though was that the flavor was too focused on being sweet. I kind of wish there was still a bit more savoriness to it.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - 2/5 - If you've had pig's ear not fried, you know how soft and gelatinous it is. They've deep fried the ear as strips and they taste a bit bland. I feel like the point of the dish is the crunch but the ears are just a miss for me. The crispy kale however was spot on and saved the entire dish for me.tl;dr - Bone Marrow and Beets all the way!"
"First of all, I have to say that a lot of the food on the menu isn't really my ""style"" of food. I'm a little pickier than, you know, octopus and weird animal parts. THAT SAID, everything I had here was delicious and it made me feel like I should be a little more adventurous. I met up with a friend here on a very brief work trip to Chicago. We arrived around 7pm and were told the wait was at least an hour, which was a little frustrating. But then we realized that we could order wine while waiting outside and then all was right with the world. Unfortunately, I forget what the wine was - only that it was one of the cheaper red options and delicious. We may have had many glasses.As far as the food goes, my friend got the pig ear to start and I had the baby artichokes. The artichokes were good - they came served cold with potatoes, salami, and cheese. All of my favorite things! I was a little apprehensive about the pig ear because, well, it's PIG EAR, but... truth be told, it was damn good. Kind of like bacon! It was served on a bed of kale, egg, and peppers. We also shared the olives because olives are amazing. These ones did not disappoint.At that point we were mostly finished eating, but decided to eat some pork shoulder, too. Again, it's something I wouldn't typically pick for myself but it was delicious, especially since it was served alongside mashed potatoes (are you noticing a theme here?). The best part of the night was dessert. If you go to the Purple Pig, you NEED to eat the Nutella panini. It'll change your life. Seriously: Nutella, banana, marshmallow. On a panini. I'm practically drooling just writing about it. Dinner was definitely not cheap - I think our total ran about $105 for the two of us - but it was worth it for my one major meal in Chicago."
"Eggplant Parmesan Balls - Great, but so small as to be difficult to eat.Poached Tuna - With fresh, tasty cherry tomatoes, this reminded us of ceviche.Pork neck gravy - Good, but did not live up to expectations.Smashed fingerling potatoes with goat cheese - DivineOnly downside was that our waiter spilled some of our wine, and we would have liked to have those two ounces we paid for."
"Saved the first yelp review for a fantastic place. Although an inevitable wait, do not be discouraged; the food is worth it.Atmosphere is noisy and communal, ideal for a group of vocal friends.Food: unbelievably satisfying. My companions had the blade steak, roasted bone marrow, meatballs, pork shoulder and the razor clams - all were fantastic.The server was excellent and provided wonderful selections of wine to pair with each plate. It's busy, it can take a while to get food prepared, just enjoy more wine.When I'm in Chicago, this is a place I seek out."
"Super yummy dining experience. We arrived to a packed house and no reservation. The hostess was outstanding and seated us within minutes. Our waiter was personable and really attentive. The menu was exciting and I would highly recommend the fried Brussel sprouts and the deviled egg. For dessert, the Affocato was out of this world."
Everyone told me to try this place!  We went to this place about an hour before opening and there was still a long line!  It was well worth the wait!  There are soo many choices.. Come with an empty stomach!
Loved every dish I tried!
"Decadent!!Bring your appetite, and your patience.  It gets busy.  Great for a late lunch if you don't want to wait for a seat/table."
"You know that saying ""There's always room for dessert""? Well that's how I feel about everything on the menu at Purple Pig. You'll find room.So, in one sitting I found room for all this:Marinated OlivesSalt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio VinaigretteOlive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima BeansWhite Bait ""French Fries of the Sea"" with Lemon AioliWhipped Feta with CucumbersEggplant Caponata with Goat CheesePanino con Nutella- A Sweet Sandwich filled with a Chocolate HazelnutSpread, Marshmallow Cream & BananasSicilian Iris- Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried BriocheOkay, I did have some help... but my help also had room for: Chorizo Stuffed OlivesRoasted Bone Marrow with HerbsOh, and there were a few drinks along the way. Some red wine (naturally) and then a lil Italian stout with a bit of chili pepper in it to go with dessert. So yeah, we defo fulfilled the piggy part of our dining experience. My boyfriend considers this the end all be all of all his dining experiences. I'll say that it's defo up there in the top 10 for me. We were lucky enough to sit 'Chef's Side' at the end of the bar, facing/connected to the kitchen area. We saw how every dish was prepared and got to see what the rest of the restaurant was ordering- and that kept us ordering more. It's amazing to see what they can do in such a tiny kitchen area and how all the chef's (who are all insanely smokin' gorg... seriously- they so hot, they don't even need an oven up in this piece) work together to make everything come together. Of the 9 different plates I had, I remember saying ""this is the best thing I've ever eaten"" after 8 of them, with the only exception being the Sea Fries- which weren't bad but I'd say they were like a 'Black Cat' when the rest of the plates were full blown fireworks on the friggin' 4th of July. Will we be back? Well, I'll put it this way: Does the Pope sh*t in the woods? See you soon, PP!"
"Everything I tried was very flavorful and tasty, but everything was also soooooo greasy.  I did enjoy the food while I was eating.  I felt pretty gross afterwards.  The Bone Marrow was huge.  The dish had three huge pieces of bone.  The waiter told me to treat the bone marrow like butter and smear it on the toast, add a little salt, and then eat.  It was tasty."
"Didn't know what to expect with ""modern european"" and ""pork"" and ""pub"" descriptors floating around in my head, but the Purple Pig is basically a fantastic gastropub that's more about the gastro than the pub. We arrived during Friday lunch hours (without a reservation) so it was super busy, but we were able to snag 2 seats at the bar within 10 minutes. The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana were delish.Bloody Mary's were alright but they didn't taste like $10. Go for the beer.With 3 plates and drinks it came out to about $40/person for lunch - triple what i'd normally want to spend on lunch, but I didn't feel like the food was overpriced, if you know what i mean. Would definitely come back for the food. note: 3 plates got 1 boy & 1 girl VERY full. We couldn't finish. Food comes out pretty quickly so you can order more as you go. Also, you should come here to eat, not to hang out. It was surprisingly small inside and there's probably always people waiting for a table so it'd feel rude to linger."
"Came here for a 2pm lunch and it was only a ten minute wait. No reservations for this place. Now the question that everyone wants to know. Is Purple Pig better or Girl and the Goat better. They both are good and different in their own way. It's hard to pick, but if I had to pick...Girl and the Goat is more my type of menu. Purple Pig, the portions are alot smaller. Fried Deviled Egg w/ Arugula and Capers-I never had a deviled egg fried. It was super yummy and sad that you only get one. The Arugula was over dressed with a sour dressing. That I did not care for. Got 3 cured meats and they were all goodRoasted Bone Marrow-They give you a decent amount, but it got way too fatty for me, so gave it all to the hubby.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes-Super good and tender.For dessert: The mini donuts: too sticky not a fan, but the Lemon Panna Cotta was so good. I'm not a dessert person, but I can just keep eating the panna cotta. Love it."
"This place doesn't take reservations. Expect a wait about an hour on a Tuesday evening. They do have a cocktail waitress outside taking drink orders while you wait. Unfortunately, it took 30 mins for the waitress to bring me a beer menu. Ended up getting my beer delivered to the table. We were so hunger that we ordered everything that looks good.-roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachio: this is a delicious dish where the components complement each other very well.-roasted bone marrow: too greasy and not enough other elements to balance the dish.-fried pigs ear: this dish needed a sauce on the pigs ear. All the flavor was on the veggies.-uni scramble egg: I would stick to raw uni over cooked. I felt like the egg was overpowering the the great flavor of uni.-fried sweetbread: This was likely one of my favorites along with the beets. It came with a nice apricot jam/chutney.-Milk braised pork shoulder: the meat was tender but the sauce was very rich. I was also so full from the other dishes.There's definitely more thing on the menu I would try."
"Just moved to Chicago, the Purple Pig is my favorite place to eat in Chicago so far, if it weren't for the wait I would give it 4 stars.  Also, for all you white wine drinkers out there, I know we are not as popular ad red wine drinkers, but I had a glass of white wine last night at Purple Pig and unfortunately it came warm.Other than that, the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes is delicious as always, and I personally like the turkey leg!  Despite the countless swine options.  The cauliflowers were also delicious and the gravy smear was great to share.Will always keep going back.  Thursday night 8pm wait for dinner for 2 was only about an hour and 10 minutes."
"What a treat!!  My husband and I met one of my best girlfriends at the Purple Pig a few weekends ago for dinner.We arrived around 6:00 and were expecting the long wait we encountered...in addition to the usual dinner wait, we were a group of three, which is a little harder to seat with the communal seating.  However, the evening was absolutely beautiful and we found some seats on a bench with the Chicago river behind us.  The cocktail service while we were waiting made our wait much more tolerable and the three of us split a bottle of wine (reasonably priced at $35 and DELICIOUS!).  While we were waiting the chef also sent out some toasted almonds to snack on...I could have eaten a whole bowl-full, and I don't even like nuts.After a little over an hour we were seated.  The atmosphere was cozy, and the three of us immediately dove into the menu, throwing out names of dishes to add to our order.  Our order became so long, my husband ended up typing it into his phone ;)  Our server was helpful, funny, and very accommodating, he even set the dessert we wanted aside because they were running out when we got there.The food came as it was ready, which we really enjoyed.  We all dove in to a Cesar salad with sardines and quail eggs, pork jowl with a fried duck egg, sweet breads with an apricot sauce, peppers with garlic chips, bone marrow smear with toast, and mussels in a delicious broth.  We polished all of it down and my husband probably could have kept going!!For dessert we had a fried donut filled with ricotta and chocolate chips, also very, very good.We had a really good time at the Purple Pig and a really good meal, we will definitely return!"
"This place is really good. The food is carefully prepared and quite exceptional, especially the pork shoulder. Decor and environment is great too. Only downside is the long waiting time."
With more than 1900 reviews there's not much more that needs to be said. It was an unforgettable culinary experience. Layers and layers and layers of mouth watering flavors. I'd give five stars but we were told the wait would be 45 minutes and it was actually two hours before we were seated. Get the pheasant!
I usually hate these Neo-American restaurants however this is truly the exception.  Everything and I mean everything is incredibly delicious my only complaint is that i couldn't try anything else.  It is a tapas style restaurant where one orders a bunch of small plates but the portions are still a good size. (And if you a non pig eater like me there are still plenty of options on the menu)Be warned it is a cramped restaurant and always packed.  You will prob be placed at a community table or very close to another party but it WORTH IT for the great food experience.  And I have to give it up to yelp for recommending this place with the nearby option!!!
Fantastic. My friend had it as a bucket list item. He was NOT disappointed. Truly exceptional.
"Not bad but a bit overrated. For one thing food is somewhat salty which makes paired wine taste off. Second, even for all the porking larding greasing etc. they could make things less prone to blood thickening by adding more imagination. Still, it's relatively inexpensive off Michigan Ave. and pretty novel in concept. BTW, this place has an amazing crew of busboys and wait staff."
"Over rated. was good few years ago. now food was way too salty, too crowd, long wait."
"Service was pretty impressive considering how busy this place is.  Came in with a party of 5, tried many of the recommended dishes by our waiter, my favorite was the chicken kabob--crispy skin, eggplant was nice --light, balanced and surprisingly bright flavor despite its drab color. thought the addition of bacon to the peas and peppermint overpowered the light spring promise of the dish.  The panini was a waste, the soft shell crabs ok, but just ok."
"Not just a local favorite, but a must have experience for any visitor to Chicago.  Sit your pork butt directly in front of the kitchen. You'll not only have the opportunity to try many of their decadent dishes they serve, but you'll think you witnessing a reality cooking show.  It's fun,  yummy, exciting and memorable.  But trust me on the seating.  Cheers!"
"Our experience here was just average - but probably can be attributed to timing and selection. I would go back here again. The restaurant setup is an awkward one because it's part-patio and part-indoors while attached to a retail center. It's way too small for its following and hopefully it will expand at some point. We arrived at 3pm on Labor Day and it was a zoo. The upside to this is that we put our names on the list and they said they would call my telephone when the table was ready. This was nice, as it allowed us to maximize our time with more shopping in the nearby stores as we waited. As an aside, they don't take reservations. Within a half hour, our table was ready -- but it was two seats as part of 10-top at the bar. They force you sit at a table with strangers, which isn't a bad thing normally for me...I like meeting new people and enjoy the camaraderie of big table dining...but we had a lot of shopping bags with us and so did everyone else. And it was the afternoon and we were feeling rushed anyways, so being squashed into this table sort of added to all the discomfort.The restaurant is built around a Mediterranean theme of wine, cheese, charcuterie, small plates and sharing. We tried some charcuterie, which was outstanding -- the best part was the char-grilled bread, which carried such a delicious olive oil-infused and smoked flavor, I wanted to take it home with me! The fried smashed potatoes with a side of creamy house-made blue cheese were also great. They were a nice nod to the potatas bravas I fell in love with in Spain. Our quail dish was a wonderful mix of sweet cranberry and savory dark meat mixed with creamy polenta. Wonderfully balanced, I'd re-order this for sure. The big letdown was the sweetbreads dish. ""Sweetbreads"" are essentially the thymus gland (over the neck) of a young pig or calf. Usually they're totally delicious, but the preparation here was confusing. Covered in flour and then pan-fried, they were served alone, without any sauce or any seasoning. More like chicken nuggets. There was a tasteless squash puree on the side that came with them, but what it needed was a cream-based or buttermilk-based sauce and maybe a few more greens to break up the texture of the sweetbreads. I wouldn't order this again.Overall, some hit-or-miss dishes, but a few moments of real deliciousness that made me think we probably got unlucky with our seats and maybe didn't choose the right things. That's okay, I'd definitely go back to do more sampling from their massive menu! The service and hospitality were great."
Since the wait was over 30 minutes we decided just to have a glass of wine on the patio. Great ambiance and a very helpful waitstaff. My group wouldn't consider ourselves expert wine consumers but we have some experience. For what we ordered we felt it was a little underwhelming and overpriced. I think we would like to come back again and enjoy a meal and make another drink selection.
"Chicago restaurants have yet to disappoint me and The Purple Pig is no exception.The menu is big, long, and extremely impressive. It is filled with small plates, charcuterie, and cheese. I happen to be a die hard fan of all three, so it was like heaven on earth for me.I absolutely enjoyed and recommend the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta and the octopus dish. They are insanely delicious. The octopus has acquired a coveted spot on my favorite seafood dishes everrrrrr list. But be prepared to wait for a seat. Not like 30 or 45 minutes. Not even an hour, but HOURS. Plural. It is balls to the walls busy and packed! Is it worth the wait though? Totally. Just have a small snack beforehand, grab a drink, and bring good company."
Cannot rate the good as we never got in. We tried to get a table and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We gave our cell number an went shopping on Michigan Avenue. After not hearing from them in almost two hours we went back and were told it would be an additional wait of at least 40 minutes. The hostess had a pretty bad attitude and never apologized. Do not tell prospective customers that there is a 90 minute when you really have a 3 hour wait. The food has to be better or they would be out of business.
"We ordered pretty much everything the waiter recommended on the menu - the bone marrow, pork neck, pork tail, as well as other dishes. Everything is very salty! Not matching up with the hype and pork is kind of greasy although we each had four refills of our pineapple juice. Not worth the 1 hour wait."
"I heard about this place from Check Please! Chicago. I had a friend visiting from out of town, so I thought it would be neat to take him to eat on Mich ave. If it was good enough for being on a TV show, it must be an experience. We got there around 3pm on a Friday and the place was packed! That's usually a good sign of the food, right? We put our name down for a 45 minute wait and took a menu to go so we could be ready to order once seated. I'm pretty sure that menu was in a different language as most dishes were difficult to decipher. We went with the bone marrow spread, fried pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder, and scallops. Personally, I thought the first 2 dishes were a bit too salty and greasy for my liking. I did like the pork shoulder. It was so tender and cooked just right. And lastly the scallop dish was probably the biggest disappointment. $16 for 3 scallops on a stick with decorative aioli on the plate. Portions are not very big (more like expensive tapas).Service was friendly. They did offer more bread for the marrow spread (I don't actually know if they charged us for it, though). Atmosphere is pretty casual yet trendy. Location is good but the space is pretty tight. I'm not sure if I'll be back to be honest."
"This place is amazing. I still dream about eating here, only to wake up and be disappointed. I had the pleasure of dining here on my recent trip from California. I'll admit, I was a little skeptical at first but my taste buds were, without a doubt the most satisfied they have been in a very long time. Must try:- Roasted Bone Marrow- Pig's Ear- Pork Liver Pate- Charred Cauliflower- Deviled Egg with Arugula & CapersThe portions seem small but somehow the amazing flavors satisfy you."
"Wine and swine! Perfect combo, if you ask me.Enjoyed a delicious late dinner here. Yeah, we waited for about an hour for a table, but it was definitely worth the hype. The food was phenomenal. We ordered meat cuts and enjoyed all three of the different cuts that we ordered. As far as the main courses, we got the JLT and the chicken kebabs, and the flavors were so unique and complex. The only downfall to this place was the guy who was taking our drink orders, when we were waiting outside, seemed rather pompous. He also served other people that got there after us. Other than that, would definitely come here again, even if that meant we had to wait for a while."
"Ask anyone who lives in Chicago or who has gone to visit. Where to eat? They will surely recommend The Purple Pig. It will surely be on one's eating itinerary. Eating itineraries! They do exist!The Purple Pig was on our list for dinner but we just never got around to it. We were too tired out, side tracked, and other Chicago staples (pizza, gasp!) took precedence. Imagine, on our last day in Chicago the faces of my friends and family when I texted them, ""I am at The Purple Pig"". Without them! And by myself! Yes, I am cruel! And smart.There are advantages to dining for one. First, no wait for a table. I walked up to the hostess and she pointed me directly to the bar. Second, being able to flirt with the cute bartender without anyone cockblocking. Third, being able to get exactly what I want without compromise. The downsides? Not being able to try more things and not being able to share them with my loved ones, who were in fact super jealous of my whereabouts.I had no idea The Purple Pig was open for brunch. I was just walking by and it looked open so I went to check it out. Sure beat eating a burger at Marcus Samuelsson's marc burger on top of Macys.With the help of the really nice bartender I settled on an appetizer of Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago, and Salami Toscana , a main course of Mussels with Pancetta, Creme Fraiche, and Majoram and then for dessert the Lemon Panna Cotta. Amazing! It is no wonder why The Purple Pig gets so many rave reviews and awards. It was one of the best meals I have ever had. There is a lot on the menu and while what I got may not necessarily be the most novel or inventive, the dishes were done really well, simple, and infused with flavor. I was in a foodie bliss and giddy. The Lemon Panna Cotta was the icing on the cake. I have had bad panna cotta before but this one was far from it. It had a new twist and totally un-frou-frou. The panna cotta was set in a ceramic bowl and topped with crushed pistachios. As I got to the bottom, the dish unveiled a cute little piggy design on the inside of the bowl. What fun The Purple Pig was! And full of surprises too. You heard it was good. Visit and taste for yourself. It's even better than all the tales."
"TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. So. Delicious. Carnivore Heaven.We ordered a bottle of rioja (Ramirez de la Piscina) and we LOVED it. Great recommendation by our server!We got the following dishes:1) Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - one of the best beet dishes we've ever had! The cheese was whipped light enough so as not to overpower the taste of the beets.2) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - crunchy goodness.3) Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive, & Agrodolce - succulent and juicy goodness, especially for a meat that is typically dry.4) Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette - cooked to absolute perfection.To finish off, we got the Panino con Nutella {Sweet Sandwich with Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Marshmallow & Bananas} for dessert. I don't think anyone can go wrong with nutella, marshmallow and bananas all in one dish. Even though we were so stuffed, we certainly made room for this dessert.Can't wait to go back!"
"Four hour wait for just okay food? No thanks. Save yourself some time and go somewhere else.We were originally told the wait would be 2.5 hours and we figured that would mean more like 2 hours since restaurants generally over estimate. Boy were we wrong. 3 hours later we were told they're running an hour behind. There's barely any place to wait. The place itself is tiny.My friend had ordered half a bottle of wine thinking we'd only be waiting 2 hours. 3 hours later, she ordered the other half of her wine. Of course we were charged with 2 halves, which is absurd.We got here at 6 and were finally seated around 10:30. The food was served quickly. We ordered many different things, but only truly enjoyed the fried cheese. I guess after 4 hours of waiting, nothing really tastes as great.They did give us a free half a bottle of wine, but after 5 hours of being at the restaurant, we were ready to leave. We gave our wine away and left around midnight.If you have to try this place, put your name down and LEAVE. Call them around the time they told you it would take to make sure your table will be ready. Then come back and enjoy your meal."
"Such a cute, trendy, and affordable place to grab a quick buite in Chicago.Was recommended the Purple Pig the last time I was in Chicago on business and I couldn't have been happier with the experience. No reservations... but the hostess recommended getting there before 6:00 to avoid a wait. We arrived at 5:45 and were seated immediately in their cute outdoor area.Huge selection of wine and good beers to choose from.On to the food..I really wanted to try the bone marrow spread. However, because of the new (horrible) ban of Foie Gras in California, I HAD to get the Foie Gras spread. O my god. So fluffy and delicions. Came with a fruit paste that paired so well with the creamy, rich Foie Gras. Everyone on yelp recommended the Pork braised in Milk with mashed potatoes. This dish was good, and definitely filling. Unfortuantely I found the pork a little dry :/ However, it was still a 4 star dish.Definitely come and check the purple pig out. Good food, good times, and amazing service."
"Food tasted good. Only reason it's getting. 2 stars. Service was super slow, we sat for an hour and was barely served two dishes and some wine. I feel like for those prices and portions you'd want to be pushing more of that stuff out. Again, it tasted magnificent but I was barely able to get any food."
"One of the best restaurants I have visited in Chicago! In fact, one of the best restaurants I have eaten in. Food is ecstatic, wine is great, service is excellent, and ambiance is wonderful. The fried pig ears, the tripe, and the quail are exquisite. The milk raised pork, bone marrow, the morcilla, olives, slider, turkey leg! It's all superb! But don't take my word for it: check it out!Deserts need some work. I haven't been as ecstatic about these as I am about the food. If only they would take reservations. Still, despite the often-long waits, it is well worth it."
"Dined at The Purple Pig for lunch on our last day in Chicago. The restaurant is located off Michigan Ave, right by the river. It is a relatively small venue with seating for about 40-50 people. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available.We showed about at about 12:30pm on a Monday and were quickly seated. Surprisingly there wasn't a wait. The service was great. Our waitress was kind, attentive and was willing to answer any questions we had on the menu.The food was delicious. This was the last meal we had while in Chicago, so it was kind of a Last Supper type deal. My friend and I had vowed to go on crazy diets once we returned to LA. We had consumed so much yummy food on our trip. Therefore, we had to pay the price once we returned. However, this last meal was a feast:Jamon Serrano (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) -- This what you'd expect. Freshly shaved ham served with bread. Simple but tasty!Artichokes and Fingerling Potatoes (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Delicious. Nice and fresh with a vinegarette sauce.Lardo Iberico (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) -- The fat from a Jamon Iberico de Ballota. A special bread of pig which only eats acorns. It is pork's equivalent to Kobe beef. Super rich and fatty.Pig Ear (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Amazing! Nice crispy fried pig ears with pickled peppers and a fried egg. Everything complemented each other well!Tenderlion (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) -- Good flavor, juicy and tender. However the slices were really thin, which led them to be slightly over cooked. Still delicious though!Quail (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) -- Juicy, served with I believe was pomegranate.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - The best dish of the meal! Super tender and juicy with a rich creamy milk gravy and delicious mashed potatoes. I could have eat 2 orders of this myself!Mussles (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Sweet and perfectly cooked. Very soft, fresh and flavorful.We decided to skip the dessert, because we had already eaten so much food on our trip. However the lady next to me ordered an affogata (coffee and gelato) with a scoop of salted caramel gelato. I was tempted, but decided to be good. Overall great meal. We ended up spending about $37 per person after tip and tax.  I think that is reasonable given the quality of the food. I definitely would love to eat here again!"

"Purple Pig should practically hire me at this point based on all the people I've sent their way! While I only get to visit Chicago a couple times a year, this has been a must-go spot the last 2 years for me, and I literally rave about it anytime I hear of someone visiting the area. Purple Pig has perfected the heart of what I love about any great dining experience... getting to try many different incredible items, a fun and warm environment, and truly exceptional staff. In my opinion, the best way to experience this gem is to dine at the community table with a couple great friends that are willing to share dishes. The last time I was there, the community table accomplished just what it was created to do - give strangers the opportunity to intermingle and discuss the food, etc. Our table-neighbors really added to our experience as a whole, and of course we got to give each other recommendations on what to order. And the most important topic, the FOOD! Usually I try to recommend a couple items that really blew my hair back, but honestly I loved everything here. You can't go wrong with being adventurous and trying a bunch of different items. Since their menu seems to change quite frequently, I would absolutely ask the server for their latest favorite. TIP: Don't be discouraged if you call and can't get a reservation. Put your name on the list and sit with a cocktail in their cute little area outside while you wait for a table. They do a great job of accommodating walk-ins, and don't let the community table option scare you off! But in all seriousness, RUN DON'T WALK... this place is excellent!"
"Bf and I are still talking about our meal here. We were in Chicago for four days and I can't decide if our dinner here or at Girl and the Goat was the favorite.  We wandered in around 7 on a Sunday without a reservation and managed to get a table immediately!I love that they have an inexpensive wine menu and you can order half a bottle. One section of the menu is of ""shmears"" which is stuff you eat with bread. In all honesty, I would be the happiest girl if I could order their bone marrow ""shmear"" somewhere in California. A steal at $9. The milk-braised pork shoulder is just as good as everyone says. You must order it!I really liked the brussel spouts. I wish the portions were larger!Bf insisted on getting the wagyu beef, which I think was the most expensive thing on the menu (He's much fancier than me.) and it was flavorful and tender. I can't remember how much it was, but I think it was near $20.  Still, I would prefer to just eat two more plates of bone marrow. I wanted to try that donut dessert thing people rave about, but they were out. They also didn't have any soft serve ready.  We settled on some citrus bread pudding thing, but the server did not tell us that there were golden raisins in it. WE HATE RAISINS! (No really, I feel like all restaurants need to explicitly state when there are raisins or cilantro in a dish. They are such dividing ingredients, don't you think?)  We ate around them but it was a hassle, and it wasn't that good anyway."
"I don't get the hype about this place, it was greasy & disappointing. My drink (Spanish pantalones) was good. The pig ear & kale appetizer was ok. The bone marrow & octopus dishes were mediocre & so greasy. Portions are tiny; 2 of us ordered 3 dishes, spent over $80 & left hungry & disappointed."
"The Purple Pig was a delightful experience on my recent trip to Chicago. I wish I could have eaten  and drank more, but my coworker who traveled with me on business was not as comfortable or excited at the Pig. I must say, my vegetarian friends back home in St. Louis would love this place. For being a ""pig"", the vegetarian options were fabulous. In fact, I ordered all vegetables for my visit. The Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, was unbelievable. Make sure to have some goat cheese with every bite of beets. They are presented together for a reason and that reason is incredible flavor. My other item was selected from the fried section. It was highly recommended by our waiter and he made the right call. It was the Butternut Squash Arancini & Sage Pesto. When it arrived at our table, I was puzzled, it was six small balls in a bowl. I don't know what I was expecting, but six small balls was not in the vision. However, when I picked one of the balls up and bite into it, all that mattered was the intense flavor that shocked my taste buds. The ambiance, service and food were all excellent. My next visit will be alone or with my partner who is more food adventurous then my coworker."
"Wine Cheese and Swine. Yumm.  As long as you avoid the post work crowd you can find a table here and nosh on some delicious small plates for half of what you would expect out of such a quality downtown Chicago restaurant.Their toasted bread is one of the most addicting things I have ever come across and love the fact that they make it a part of almost every dish.  Getting panchetta mussels served in a mini pig dish made me squeal with joy.  I also had my first introduction to bone marrow here and it couldn't have been more pleasant. They also have Co Bigelow soap in the bathrooms which is a nice touch.  My one complaint is that a distinguishing feature is communal seating at some of the tables.  When you get some crazy lady slamming on the table and rattling the dishes on which your food sits, it makes for both a distraction and annoyance.  I will be back here every visit I make to Chicago in the future because their entire menu just rocks."
"""We're going to the Purple Pig,"" said our friend Mike, when we made plans to get together for dinner when we were all in Chicago for International Mr Leather weekend. I know never to contradict a foodie, so we agreed.The only reason I am giving the place four instead of five stars is the ""no reservations"" thing which seemed to be the theme of my weekend in Chicago this time. I'm always willing to wait a bit for good food, but wary when the hostess says it'll be over an hour. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Without a doubt. I WANT to return there. The food was wonderful - beautifully prepared, seasoned with care, and creatively chosen so that the menu offers complementary options. The only thing that was not a ""wowzer"" was the eggplant, and I suspect we would have liked it more if we had eaten it first. The eggplant balls were surprisingly light, but the one-note taste of eggplant, after sampling the bone marrow, sirloin tips, pork gravy (gravy meaning an Italian tomato sauce with meat) with ricotta cheese, the fava beans, and the grilled cauliflower - yeah, the array of options and flavors was delicious. Also, service in a high-traffic, small restaurant needs to be top notch, and the staff here were great. We ordered a bottle of wine while waiting for our table, and the staff graciously put the bottle in a location unlikely to be knocked over, bringing it to our table when we had one. The waiter gave some excellent advice, and was attentive and friendly without being pushy. We felt very well taken care of from start to finish.We topped off the evening with deceptively simple-sounding desserts: soft service icecream  - one with a salted caramel sauce, and the other drizzled with balsamic vinegar and strawberries - were both amazingly delicious. And the lemon pannacotta - okay hard to believe pannacotta and lemon could actually be made, but the lemon flavor was beautifully meashed through.Finally, with a bottle of wine and a few dessert drinks, the final bill was astonishingly low - just about $50/person. Absolutely worth it."
"I have been twice and havent been disappointed yet. Very good food and great prices.  Jimmy the chef is the man!  I have never been to a place as good as this - total experience - environment, food, prices, etc.  Definitely worth to go at least once."
"Hype hype hype. We went for dinner and the five us proceeded to order a large number of plates.Roasted Bone Marrow: basically butter on steroids. Great, unique, interesting flavor on well toasted bread. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: another excellent dish, the meat was super tender and full of great flavor. Octopus: Pretty good. Nothing really special but solid tasting food. Mussels: Again, pretty good. Tasty but nothing inspiring. Shaved Brussels Sprouts: Meh. Not a fan. The veggies got lost in the cheese which defeats the purpose of having brussels sprouts. Eggplant Parmesean Balls: Again, not a huge fan. Nothing special. Pork Secreto: Solid dish. Was interesting and tasty with the red peppers and pickled watermelon rind. Pan-fried Skate Wing: Big fan of the mint and blood orange balasmico. Pretty tasty. There were a couple others, but fairly forgettable. Literally. I don't remember what else we had. Because of how much each plate cost, we cut our dinner short before we could all be satiated and the bill was quite the eye popper. Needless to say, this is not a place you come to get full without a very hefty wallet. Service was okay. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was incredibly busy, hustling and bustling, so the waiters seemed really busy running around. When available though, they were quite helpful and friendly. Three stars for solid to great food that doesn't carry a whole lot of value or filling-ness. I would definitely be willing to come back because some of the dishes were truly unique but I would plan on a second meal later. Good place to bring out of town friends though."
What a experience!The bone marrow was good for an appetizerPork shoulder was my favorite dishExpensive so I would not go  often but good food for the price
"Pigapalooza! Hype confirmed. 45 minute wait entirely justified. Sure, you have to deal with the staff's ambient aloofness generated by a wildly successful and popular restaurant...but literally no dish was like any we've ever had. A swine odyssey.Couldn't hit all the intriguing options so stuck to the Bone Marrow, Pig Platter, Peas and Bacon, and Chorizo stuffed Olives. As a big pig fan, the entire menu spoke to my inner Porky and all were phenomenal.Wine and beer selections diverse. Chose the Spanish Ribiero. Happy with it.  Just don't expect any domestic options. Napa valley seems to be persona non grata.Wife, too entirely satisfied - with the food, that is.  Must. Go. Back."
"Fresh and creative dishes with unique cuts.  Great social atmosphere, gotta try the pork shoulder!  If you are a foodie, this is must stop in Chico town!"
"This place was packed but we were able to snag a few seats at the bar. The cocktail list is interesting, the wine list is great, and the menu is inventive. The cocktail with the herbs (sage maybe?) was refreshing! The service was attentive and speedy. The ambiance We had the:Beets with Goat Cheese- light, fresh, and delicious! Razor Clams- simply seasoned, a bit over cooked but still tasty. Roasted Bone Marrow, Foie Gras & Membrillo- rich, flavorful, and loved by those who consumed it.Overall a good experience and I would go back for more!"
"I think this place is over hyped , maybe because you don't get pig bone marrow anywhere else (I think).Ambience is really nice though."
"I sat at the bar for lunch. I had a red wine from the Jumilla region (hard to find), fried manchego with membrillo and a summer squash salad with mozarella and coppa. Service was fantastic and the fried manchego is one of the best things I have ever eaten!"
"Shared dinner here with 5 friends last night. We got:bone marrowturkey legquailcalamarifava beanspig ears & a few other thingseverything was so good! best meal I had in chicago, for sure"
"SOLID FOOD!!!!! The Purple Pig has excellent Foie gras, pork sweet breads and pork shoulder. My boyfriend and I ordered these things before heading out to O'Hare and were impressed by the swift delivery of the food, the execution of how tasty everything was, and the reasonable price.Foie gras - as Califorinians, we needed to get our fix before heading back to the coast. The spread was so delicious, especially with the jam they put with it (Membrillo). Also, they offered extra bread when we quickly finished ours!  What a plus!Pork Sweet breads - damn, this was delicious. They tasted like thinly fried pork nuggets. They weren't overfried like chicken nuggets are, but were instead panfried very lightly so we didn't feel disgusting afterwards. My only complaint is that I wish they served just a little more pork. I wanted more! Flavor was delish!Pork Shoudler - sooooooo tender. Melt in your mouth, dripping with sauce, and sitting happily on top of mashed potatoes. This dish was not my favorite but was still great nonetheless.The service kept checking in on us too. I appreciated that - especially since we mentioned we were in a rush to catch our flight. This place also seems like a great spot to go if you need lunch shopping at Magnificent Mile, or a great way to start off a Friday night."
"Not very conventional for Vegetarians but then again it is a Mediterranean restaurant. Maybe we should have looked more carefully at the menu before waiting near an hourly for seating. The fried brussels sprouts, beets and goat cheese, grilled cheese Panini, kale ceasar salad and butternut squash were all very good. I saw a lot of people order the crispy pigs ears and pork belly. They do make a killer bloody mary!"
"It's like coming home and that's how they treat you. I sat at the bar and no less than 3 different guys tended to my gastronomic yearnings. They guided me to the Sicilian white wine, awesome and then it only got better with the ""JLT"". That's J for jowl. Yes, the decadence of bacon is surpassed with perfectly cooked pig jowl. This sandwich topped with a sexy sunny egg and is filled with yellow heirloom tomatoes and frisee. It is essentially the classic French frisee and lardon salad brought to a sandwich.   From there to the octopus of which I have never had better. Chew not, this octopus was nearly fluffy with a crisp charred exterior. The salsa verde of marjoram, chervil was of perfect acidity and portion.     Always packed and for good reason. Try it between 2:30 and 4:30pm"
"milk braised pork shoulder, delicious and surprisingly good.veal steak, good. Juicy but perfect pinkMussel, good. pig platter, Ok but not great.pig ears with kale. Just so so, from a Chinese perspective."
"The Purple Pig is an experience; don't get me wrong. But the food just doesn't justify the prices. The amount you get is not at all what you'd expect given the price. This place could be better, but they have some pretty unique dishes. The Octopus is good, but just too small to call a full meal."
"I can't stop raving about this place. The wait can be annoying, but you probably won't regret it. If you're debating ordering the bone marrow, which we probably witnessed every table around us do so, I say go for it. It was fun to order and fun to eat. Tastes basically like it sounds: rich and oily and bad for you and kind of graphic but super delicious nonetheless. Perfect to have with some red wine, and our waitress was very helpful in terms of selection. The fried brussel sprouts were delicious also, kind of had the texture of kale chips. The bf and I also ordered the milk braised pork shoulder and the scallops - both of which also excellent. And because we're gluttonous we ended with some Illy coffee and the Sicilian Iris - basically a chocolate & ricotta donut thing, and couldn't have left the restaurant happier!"
Really impressed with the food and wine selection! Great place to relax and not get over filled out fried greasy food! Peas and bacon were such a great dish to start with and out server helped us pick cheese to compliment the wine we had. Over all not surprised with the great food since its co-owned by Bannos brothers.... They Always have something special to bring to the city and so glad it was The Purple Pig!
"Roasted Beets and the Bone Marrow are a must. The wine suggestions from the waitress were amazing. I will have to go back soon when I have more patience to wait to try the other menu options with the staff suggested wine pairings. Trust the staff, they know what they are doing."
"Came here on the rec of a couple of locals and was very impressed by the ambiance, service and menu offerings. I'm usually not much on small plates, but there was a diverse enough selection, and great suggestions made by our waiter Steven, that we left happy and satiated."
"Well, well, well. The Purple Pig. Erybody wants some Purple Pig. So after waiting a quick 30 minutes at 2 PM or so on a weekday, we got a table outside. We felt lucky. We heard horror stories of 2 hour waits. Can you imagine? 2 hours to eat? I wouldn't be hungry or I'd have starved to death in two hours...So it was just the two of us, we had been eating like gluttons the last few days so we figure sharing a few plates...to...share and an entree would be just fine. Not so, not so. Whatever Purple Pig makes up in creativity, it lacks in quantity. And I don't eat very much. We got eggplant parm balls. They were awesome but they disappeared way too fast. We got a few other small plates-- I can't remember them, perhaps they aren't memorable. Then we got the fried chicken skewers. That sounds like it'll be pretty hearty, right? Nah, maybe 6 small pieces of chicken thigh on a stick, fried, great sauce. No joke, the food here is awesome. But the price, the wait, and the quantity (and remember, I really never complain about quantity) leaves a lot to be desired. Signed,Fat person from Houston who eats plates and plates of food"
What a great culinary experience. We walked in at 5pm to a completely packed bar and mostly filled tables. Although it was 45 degrees out we sat outside under a covered tent with tons of propane heaters. It was very comfortable and was seated within minutes. The broccoli with roasted garlic was so delicious my husband asked me 'why can't you make broccoli like this?' The smear of pork neck bone was perfect for a cold night. The fried manchego  was so yummy with membrillo (like a fruity apple sauce). Who can go wrong with fried cheese? We finished with the pork ossobuco. The pork melted off the bone and directly into our mouths.
"This is probably the worst places I have been to in chicago. My wife ordered a negroni and this was her first time ordering a negroni. She knew it had a lot of liquor but it was probably too much for her to bear. After ordering it, after a sip of it, she felt like throwing up. It was incredibly strong for her taste and I wanted to switch her drink. I did not expect the server to exchange it for her, I only expected h him to be sympathetic and just tell me that it happens and it's okay! Instead, the guy,  got back to me and said that it's all liquor, and what else will you expect expression! She wanted to eat something there but I chose to avoid the place because of their attitude and behaviour. I also felt the guy was racist and he did not attend us well cause we were Indians! I am sorry to say but this place made me feel unwelcome in the states and I would never ever recommend this place to any of my friends.  He told others his name and when it came to us he just took the order and gave us the drinks. I don't know why would you make someone feel so unwelcome. Negative stars from my side!"
"Amazing!!  We've been eating around Chicago for the last 4 days and this is the best place yet. Try the Calamari appetizer. It's out of this world. Poached calamari in OO with radishes, capers, pistachios, Israeli couscous...."
"This place is just amazingness!! The food is great, specially the bone marrow!!! The waiting time is a bummer. It's usually 60-90 min wait in prime time it can take as long as 2-2.5 hours! We are a regular here, we love it! It's the only place that I'm willing to wait for a table."
Would go back again anytime!
"You can't really go wrong with this DC establishment.  The pannini sandwiches are surprisingly plentiful (I got 2 full sandwiches) for a Tapas place and the food is delicious.They have a nice outdoor seating area in the summers, tucked away just off Michigan Ave."
Great food! Service was great. Like every good restaurant it is always packed on weekends.
"Making our way through Millennium Park I anticipated the long lines, hour plus waits, and loud environment without a system reservations - given its prime location, quartet of well respected chefs, and recent appointment by Bon Appétit as one of the 10 best new restaurants in America I understood the hype.  For a concept that seemed so simple (and something done in other cities prior) to get such rave reviews I figured The Pig had to be something special but in all reality the main selling point for myself and my traveling party was that the full menu was available for lunch and that it was easily walkable from our Saturday visit to the Art Institute of Chicago.  Arriving at the small space on Michigan Avenue the restaurant certainly lived up to the rumors - a line snaked out the door and the volume was audible from the street.Making our way through the nicely heated outdoor seating area to the door we were greeted by a pleasant hostess who told us the wait would likely be 45 minutes ""or so"" for a group of three.  Without further plans we put our name on the list and looked for a place to stand - the restaurant was jammed packed and we essentially spent the next 20 minutes standing/sitting near the glass window watching plate after delectable looking plate emerge from the kitchen.  Twenty minutes at 1:00pm on a Saturday - yes - when a group of 8 stood up from the long center table and multiple persons ahead of us on the wait list had apparently left or didn't hear their name called over the din we were seated without further ado, handed a menu, and water was poured immediately.Kicking things off would be the Open face pork belly BLT with a fried egg.  Featuring Benton's Bacon pork belly sliced and fried crisp over rye bread and topped with artisan frisee, fresh tomato, and a golden fried egg this was designer comfort food - savoriness sweetened by the tomato alone and balanced with the hefty and crusty bread - a tad difficult to cut and share, but an excellent start.Arriving shortly after the BLT would be more delicious pig parts - perhaps the most ""famous"" dish on the menu - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.  Having only had pig's ear twice in the past this was actually the strongest presentation to date with the ear actually less crisp than the intense kale - well done with melting collagen between layers of protein.  With acidic as opposed to hot pepper intermingled and served in an adorable pig bowl the dish was again egg topped and the creamy yolk proved a nice foil for the otherwise contrasting flavors and textures.With the next two dishes arriving as a pair the first would be a cheese course.  Simply paired with toasted bread and quince compote our selections would be Truffle Tremor, Capriole O'Banon, and Manchego - all cheeses I have had in the past and all served in large wedges at a relative bargain price of $17 for the three.  For my sister's choice she opted for the Sepia with Snap Peas and Toasted Almonds and Rosemary.  Served largely unadorned in ceramic bowl the squid itself was tender and juicy with just a touch of olive oil and lemon.  With crunch lent by the almonds and sweetness from the surprisingly fresh mid-Autumn Peas this was a successful dish despite its lack of swine.For our final two dishes more of the restaurant's namesake animal were on the order - the first a ""smear"" of Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio on toasted house made bread.  With the fatty salume ground to a chunky paste and ample with notes of pepper, nutmeg, and coriander the high notes of this dish were without a doubt the crunchy fresh pistachios.  Accented with a tangy and sweet balsamic vinegar the dish was not the most attractive, but it was certainly my favorite of the meal.Our final plate of the meal is perhaps the Purple Pig's most notable; The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes.  With the recipe featured on the website I rather figured this dish would be somewhat akin to my Grandfather's rustic pork-steak and potatoes with a texture similar to Luke's Cochon au Lait - unfortunately while it was quite good it didn't live up to either.  Fatty and succulent to be sure I really cannot fault the pork itself, but rather the lack of nuance or seasoning outside of a heavy handed salt shaker.  Attempting to dissect the protein away from the gravy I personally think this dish would actually be better off without the gravy - or perhaps with a firm starch or vegetable.Check delivered we settled the tab and made our way through the crowd to the street - total meal time from entering to exit just shy of 100 minutes.  Impressed but not wowed I think The Purple Pig is a great concept with good execution - the sort of place it might be nice to pop in for a drink and snacks, but not necessarily a ""destination"" or ""must"" in a city with such great diversity of options - though it is open for lunch when many competitors are not."
"I been in many restaurant in this country and around the world , I like different exotic and I'm very open mind. It is really NOTHING special about food in this place, after 2 hours waiting , anything tast good .Very good wine list with good wine. Food ... Just ok really  fry pig ear... Well pig ear can be cook really good , but this not the case. 2 dishes we want to order out of order, what next... Whatever you give as will be good . They are too busy , not care very much about customer service"
"The Purple Pig made me wait 45 minutes on a Sunday night after I just walked around the city in 90-degree day all day. The wait was nevertheless, rewarding and satisfying. Who doesn't like some wine and swine? The bar scene is vibrant and the wait is well, gruesome. Yet, once we were seated, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress. The wine list is very extensive and to be honest overwhelming! It does have a good range of wine from around the world at different price point. We had half bottle of pinot grigio and it was only $24! We got several dishes to share because this would be our last meal in Chicago and we went all out to make sure we try a good selection of food here since we just waited 45 minutes. The bone marrow is absolutely the best on the menu. It is actually a reasonable price too because they gave us 4 big bones with buttery crispy sour dough and cilantro to go with. I love it even though previously I was a little afraid of the texture. The beets salad with goat cheese was surprisingly delicious. In addition, the 3 cheese platter we picked was great. For entree, we shared the fried pig ears and it was so good! You must try that if you like crispy deep fried dish and who doesn't really?! You might be grossed out by ""Ears"" but trust me, ears are very subtle delicacy. We ended our dinner with Pig Tail and it actually tastes like Chinese pork belly stew. The pork was stewed to such tenderness that it falls apart from the bone with sweet savory sauce. We were so full that we could not get any dessert afterwards."
"Wow! I love the name, The Purple Pig, very catchy! But wait till you taste the food, it'll blow you away!I enjoyed every part of my dining experience here. First, the server, Steven, was very friendly and helpful in servicing my table for the night. Thanks Steven! Second, the food was amazingly delicious. I've tried a good amount of bone marrows in NYC, but Purple Pig takes the award for their simplicity and for maintaining the essence of natural flavors while integrating a few twists. The absolute must-try popular dishes include the milk braised pork shoulder which melts in your mouth, the turkey leg confit that is big enough to feed two, and the sushi quality octopus that is grilled to perfection. Also had the wagyu sirloin tip - cooked just right. Everything came in good portions. Last but not least, you'll be leaving this place stuffed and happy without having to break the bank. I wish there were more places like this in NYC. I'm going to miss The Purple Pig!"
"Food:  We ordered a cheese plate and the smear with mortadella.  Cheese was ok but definitely lacking.  The mortadella smear was good.  The flavors blended well.  The pistachios on the top added an interesting texture.  But would I get it again?  Probably not.    Drinks:  Wine was drinkable.  Some of it definitely overpriced.  My husband asked for recommendations on full bodied red wines.  Server/bartender thought for a bit and recommended one.  It ended up being ridiculously priced.  My reasonably priced wine was much better.  If it is one thing I hate, it is a server just recommending the most expensive wine as the best wine.  Fail.  Service:  Server/bartender was as attentive as he could be on a late Saturday night.  Not sure how table service went though because we sat at the bar.   Ambience:  Trendy but a little more than the digestible amount of tourists (note:  I think any amount of tourists are too many).  This place was packed.  Other:  Would I come back?  Meh.  It really isn't all it is cracked up to be.  I mean if you just want plates and plates of MEAT MEAT MEAT then maybe...but there are plenty other restaurants with meats galore that aren't in this neighborhood."
Excellent food and service. Bone marrow is a must try and the chicken skewers were perfectly cooked and seasoned.
"Wow.  Busy, packed, wall-to-wall people.  But managed to sneak a bar chair over in front of the kitchen line.  Fabulous Manhattans.  Beef marrow did not disappoint.  Neither did our waiter who, when asked, pulled together the best cheese and meat board ever.  Service impeccable for that crowded of a hot spot.  Fun to watch the line coordinate this all in a very, very tiny kitchen space - everybody tasting and the expediter keeping it all running 100% cool.  Good stuff peeps at PP! Thanks for the start of a great night in Chicago!"
"Damn the wine selection is pretty extensive here. Unless you know your wines, you'll be flipping through feeling pretty clueless. Fortunately, the servers here are pretty knowledgeable and will help find you the right bottle or glass. Now, onto the food... they have a variety of shareable small plates which were well portioned and very delicious. I recommend sticking with the smears and entrees based on what we ordered and saw around us. They have cheese and charcuterie as well but I didn't really see much of that being ordered. We got the pork neck bone rilette and roasted bone marrow smears. Both were DIVINE. they come with fluffy but tough toast which are large and perfect for spreading. The pork neck bone rillette is tomato-based. Nice and hearty flavor. The sauce balances with the tender pork perfectly. Smeared on crispy toast, it goes to a whole new level. The bone marrow was well portioned and came with sprinkling salt/parsley. Rich and savory. Our other friend got the milk-braised pork shoulder which was as delicious as it sounds. Came with mashed potatoes which only provided a little starch to go with the melt-in-your-mouth meat.I would go back for the food alone. Though, try to go at an odd hour so you are spared the tourist rush. It's a great spot to mingle with friends as all the seating is close and intimate. Prices very reasonable given the popularity."
We checked out this place after checking out Yelp and saw all the amazing reviews. The spot is easy to find and has very cute décor. We noticed during our 45 min wait that there are some large communal tables. We ended up finding a spot at the bar before we could get seated at a table which I didn't mind. It was actually probably better where we were seated (in the back of the bar by the cooks). We got a front seat of the kitchen and got to watch everything go on as they were happening. It was pretty fast paced and exciting! Now to food...So I wanted to love it but I didn't. It all was quite salty but I can appreciate the uniqueness and variety. - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale- tasty- Bone Marrow- Interesting.. first time trying bone marrow. It was a little heavy for me. It was like oil and bread- Pork shoulder- the tastiest itemsWe were stuffed and wanted desserts but honestly nothing looked that amazing.
"Amazing LATE NIGHT SNACK experience!I arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night to get some dinner before a show.  Unfortunately there was a 90-minute wait (they don't take reservations), so I went elsewhere.After my show got out (SBTRKT killed it !) I rushed back here by 12:50am.  The kitchen closes at 1am on Saturday so all was well.  There was still a decent crowd in there but plenty of open seating.  The first thing I noticed on the menu was razor clams.  I'd had these years ago in Spain and never thought I'd see them again. For $12 we got 5 nice-sized clams (these aren't ordinary clams, google them!).  These were delicious and well-spiced but quite chewy.  I'd definitely recommend them if you've never had em before.Next was some burrata (mozzerella cheese thing) with fennel and peas and other stuff ($11).  It was freaking excellent.Our fun friendly server chick convinced us to get the housemade salted caramel ice cream ($7).  It was a decent sized bowl and the ice cream was super smooth, more of a soft-serve consistency, and very delicious.We had awesome service and the food came out super quick, which is really appreciated at 1am.  Purple Pig rocks!"
"Believe the hype. The food in this place is absolutely delicious. Pros: amazing food. I ate the bone marrow and milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Seriously, some of the best food I've had in the city. Their wine list is impressive too. Seating isn't bad either; I like their communal tables and they have a nice bar to eat at if you're flying solo or looking for seating for two.Cons: It's pretty small. They don't take reservations; finding a table for a large group = waiting in line for awhile, so be prepared.Worth the wait? Absolutely."
"Love the purple pig... the small plates are amazing and each one as unexpectedly perfect as the next.  I've been, gone back, taken friends, and will continue to return"
"The caliber of food in Chicago ceases to amaze me. A perfect place to share Mediterranean/European tapas for a reasonable price. For a group of 4, we shared around 10 dishes with 2 drinks each and came out to just over $40 each! Great value, best money I've spent in a long time on food.Highlights: Milk braised pork shoulder - creamy, fall off the bone meatSalt-roasted beets with goat cheese - never liked beets, but topped with herbs, salt and goat cheese, these thick beets were incredibleCalamari with fregola - fresh, soft calamari with israeli couscousPork neck bone gravy with ricotta - imagine succulent pulled pork in a thick marinara served with toastI'd stay away from the bone marrow smear. Personally, it was a nice to try once in a lifetime kind of dish but honestly it tastes like very rich butter. It's especially hard to discern the taste when you're expected to eat it on buttered/oiled bread. Next time, I'd like to try the charcuterie/cheese platters. Excited to dine on more swine in the future.Addendum: AMAZING patio during a warm summer night."
"This is a fancy restaurant. It is fancy because it has a glossary and because the people eating here look like they like fancy things. But it was good food. Lots of fancy food. And fancy people! I can't remember what we had. Here's my best estimate. I think the bill came over to a little bit over $100.-""Whipped feta"" with cucumbers-Water served out of fancy glasses-3 expensive as hell cheeses that were probably good if it weren't for my poor peasant palate. And some fruit jam that tasted like jam. Mmm jam.-This big pork steak thing, with some funny-named sausage spread and a tiny salad that tasted like lemon and grapes. It was good. And expensive. But, hey.-Some sort of marinara sauce with feta? cheese, and then mixed with neck meat. Of an animal, I'm guessing (human neck meat would be strange and probably illegal).-Chicken skewers, with fried something-potatoes. Like those chicken poppers (that got discontinued?) at mcdonalds and fries, except where everything is much better. The chicken was...really juicy. In a good way. Very satisfying actually, I was surprised you can even do that with chicken. And there was this yogurt sauce thing beneath it, the kind you usually get slopped all over your gyro.-Octopus and potato things. It was good octopus and potato things.-""The sicilian eye of iris in italy"" or something fancy. It amounted to ricotta and chocolate melted inside of this fried dough. It was good but cost $7. It had powdered sugar on top. Hooray.-Some fancy salad with some nut or what not, and then asparagus. Mm.This place is good. But it's out of my budget, so back to McDoubles and McChickens  for me. Pretending to be rich without the existential crises was fun for an hour, though."
"It's been 3 years since we first tried out the restaurant and it seems that the place has gotten even more popular in the last 3 years. Luckily, we creeped around the bar and snatched a couple of seats in less than 15 minutes. Great presentation and the food tasted just as delicious as it looked. The goat cheese and beats dish was superb and I will come back and try the bone-marrow dish which looked awesome."
"WHOA.Four letters can encapsulate your entire experience at most restaurants across the city, however at Purple Pig those 4 letters happen to be W-H-O-A. Having been a two-time reject at Purple Pig (not by their decree) by my own impatience, I couldn't handle a 45-minute and 2-hour long wait.  This time we did the thing right and sent out a scouting group to wait in line while our party of 11 headed on over 45 minutes later.The resulting introduction led us to outdoor patio seating right next to the Chicago River and enjoying the cool breeze on an unseasonably warm March afternoon. Water quickly flowed into glasses on the tables, menus already distributed and the server quickly took down our order. The drink list was deep in libations but light on beer. Beers ranged from $6-$12 and I stuck with an $8 Scottish stout Belhaven which did the trick.At Purple Pig it will take a few plates to get full and all of the dishes are served tapas style and everyone shared. We all took effort to call for something and when the somethings came we passed it all around the table.  I had a Meatball Slider, some tender Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kabobs, JLT, Turkey Leg Confit, Octopus, and Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli.Every meat is tender with the richness that only pig can offer and the food will knock your socks off. Despite all of the heavenly pig that we ate, along with a giant plate of cured meats and cheeses, by far my favorite dish in Purple Pig was the Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli. This scallop by far exceeded all my expectations not only of scallop by of Purple Pig. Never had scallop ever tasted so good with a slight crispiness on the exterior and tenderness on the interior with flavor coming with every bite and flick of the tongue. It was good, it was the best and that's what Purple Pig is in a nutshell.Bon Appetit."
"I struggled with the 4-star rating because there were 1-2 items that were just ""ok"" but overall the experience was really good at Purple Pig. Some must-trys:Milk-braised Pork Shoulder - EVERYONE should order this. It is melt in your mouth delicious, uniquely flavorful, deliciousPig Tail - I've had pig tail at Bristol that was too much to handle. This was the perfect amount and extremely savory. Podda - Reco'd by the server, some of the best Gouda I've ever hadDessert - Panino!! Banana, Marshmallow, Nutella deliciousness!!! Who wouldn't love this :)Other good things to try - Pork Neck Gravy (really just a tomato sauce spread, great with red wine!)What was just OK to meFried Pig Ear - a little to much picked pepper but the egg was perfect on top. I wish the ear wasn't fried, though, it could have been anything that was fried.Fava Beans - a little too salty, but I really liked the leek, mint, flavor mixI can't wait to come back to try the many other things on the list I wanted to try!"
"The only problem with this place (and the only thing that keeps us from visiting more often) is the huge crowds/long waits.  We were fortunate on a recent evening to be walking by when a table for two was immediately available.  We tried a handful of small plates and they were all pretty delicious.  Service was amazing--whenever you were done with a plate, somebody appeared to clear it away. The servers/bus people noticed instantly when you needed water or a fork or new napkin. The small plates came out kind of randomly--when they were ready--which we expected.  Specifically, we tried the shaved brussels sprouts, broccoli, scallops, eggplant balls, and kale caesar. The friendly, helpful waitress commented that we got a lot of healthy stuff (because of all the vegetables), even though very little of this stuff was really healthy--lots of cheese, oil, etc. But it sure was delicious. We might not get the broccoli again because it was just kind of a yummy cheese mess--nice to have once, but we don't need to do that again.  We probably wouldn't get the scallops again either. They tasted great, but the portion was way tiny for the price.  And we might try a different salad rather than the shaved brussels sprouts--it was good, but not knock-your-socks off.  However, the eggplant balls and kale caesar we would definitely do again.We also shared the greek doughnuts with honey for dessert. Awesome!Very recommended if you don't mind waiting for a seat or if you luck out with a table or seat at the bar right away."
"Came here yesterday with a friend after hearing rave reviews about this place. It took a little bit 15-20 minutes to be seated as this place is really busy (even at 3). We were seated on the enclosed patio which was fine except it got pretty cold after awhile. Anyways, onto the food, plates are meant to be shared here so we started off ordering the bone marrow which was unique and a must-try for visitors of this restaurant. We then ordered the pork blade steak which was very rich and a large portion. After that we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder did not last long on our table, it was so tender and delicious. My friend and I surprisingly had room for dessert and ordered the salted caramel ice cream and the loukoumades which both were great on their own, but amazing when they were mixed together. To sum up this visit, I don't know what took me so long to try this place and I will definitely be returning."
"The Purple Pig ranks up in one of my top restaurants in the Chicago area. No reservations are taken, so be careful to avoid the rush crowds at the peak dinner hour.  We have never had an extremely long wait, and have found luck getting at lunch right at opening, enjoying a leisuring mid-afternoon lunch/dinner, or relaxing with a pre-drink across the street at Eno Wine Bar, since the Purple Pig will take your cell phone and call once your table is ready.Once seated, don't be afraid to be daring. We have gone in and often had fun and just asked our server to bring out what they thought would be the top dishes. Every dish is shared plates, and we have yet to experience a bad dish.  Some of my favorites include: - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (A favorite dish in the city) - ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (A classic)The smears are incredible, and many things are seasonal, but experiment, and again, try everything. A few visits ago we had a cold spring pea salad with mint, and while peas are not in my top veggie list, this was incredible!In comparison to many other restaurants, the prices are not steep, so you will walk away satisfied, with money to spear."
It was very good! and I will definitely go back.
"First, it's called The Purple Pig.  The PURPLE Pig!  How can you NOT try this place?!We stopped by since it was the only place open until 1:00 a.m., it was already 11:00 p.m.  And wow, on a Tuesday night this placed was packed!So straight to the food. My companions are not as adventurous as I am and ordered the Pigs Ear and Foie Gras and Membrillo.  They ordered the turkey leg, deviled eggs, and a Coppa Panini.PIGS EARS:  You all know I love my salt, and holy heck I got it.  The pig's ear was sliced super thin and fried.  It basically tasted like pork rinds.  They mixed it at the table with a fried egg sunny side, with fried kale that tasted like seaweed.  It was fabulous!  A must try.  Beware, it is salty.  FOIE GRAS:  I've eaten all kinds of liver, but was told this was the best type of liver to have.  Perhaps it's because they had it moussed style and seemed like they added a bit of honey to it, but I didn't think it was anything special.  I liked it, don't get me wrong.  But I wanted that livery taste.  TURKEY LEG CONFIT:  I'm not a fowl lover, but have to admit the way they cooked this was amazing.  The meat fell off the bone and was so juicy, tender and what a great flavor.  Although I wouldn't personally order this, I would sample it if it came around again!DEVILED EGG:  I didn't try this, cause REALLY?? They served only one.  Tapas/small plates are supposed to be shared.  How do you share one egg??  I was told though, that it was good.  I'll take her word for it.COPPA:  Everyone at the table agreed the texture and taste of the bread was good, but the Coppa was way, Way, WAY too salty.   And that's saying a lot coming from me! All in all, if I ever get back here, I want to work down their menu.  I read a review that said this place served way to salty and vinegary dishes.  Fortunately for me, I like that, but can understand why others would not."
"After drinks and a funny time at the Second City, and more drinks and funny artwork at the Old Town Ale House, we were back in the Loop and hankering for a snack (aaaand more drinks). Yelp pulled up the Purple Pig in all its solid 4-star, 1000+ review glory (oh the joys of being a tourist in a time of technology!). It sounds like people are serious about waiting in line for this place earlier in the evening, but since it was closer to midnight when we arrived, we waltzed in easily (oh the joys of still being on Pacific time!).We went for two of the most-mentioned dishes plus a couple more. We started with the shaved brussels sprouts and the choreezo olives (spelling the latter wrong on purpose so it doesn't tally another vote for it) and found both to be a little boring. More stand-outish was the popular bone-marrow (it's like eating expensive, delicious pork grease...) and the foie gras (it was a decadent evening). But maybe I was just drunk by that time (beer + wine + pig = on vacation fer sure).I'd give it a 3.5 for the food itself, bumping it up to 4 stars for great customer service, a nice setup, and a good location. Probably wouldn't wait in line for it, but would possibly drop in on a late weekend night again."
Delicious small and large plates with varying price ranges.  Cute outdoor seating and the owner/manager was really nice and made sure we were happy.
"No hype, it really is that good.THE FOODOutstanding...at the top of our list...Bone Marrow, Pork Shoulder cooked in Milk, Wagyu beef, and the doughnut stuffed with Ricotta and chocolate.THE SERVICEExtremely friendly and helpful, even for such a super busy place. We went with kids and did not fell out of place at all....and the staff was very helpful with recommendations. No reservations, only walk-in, and the standard wait quoted seems to be 3 hours...you'll probably get in about 2 hours.THE ATMOSPHERESmallish, busy and packed. You may have to share a table. It is a fun, hip, urban place...not stuffy at all.$120 for 2 adults and 2 kids for dinner."
"Love this place! The concept, the food, the wine!"
"The first time we went here there was over an hour wait so we decided to go else where. On our second attempt we made sure to get here a lot earlier since this place does not take reservations. I was super excited to try the food here since I had heard many great things about it & I am a new fan of tapas-style restaurant & The Purple Pig did not disappoint. We ordered:-Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette- I ordered this dish as per the recommendations by yelp users. I have to say I don't particularly like beets, but I loved this dish. Whoever thought to use the pistachio vinaigrette on this dish is a genius. -Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese- this was my boyfriend's favorite of the items we ordered. He isn't a big fan of eggplant, but this dish (& my ordering skills) made him a believer. -Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios- Kind of embarrassing, but I have never had non-fried calamari before! I hate over cooked calamari it tends to get super chewy (gross) - but this was cooked perfectly. -Burrata Pugliese, Acorn Squash, Portobello Mushrooms & Balsamic-  I love cheese and burrata is great= delicious!-Coppa with Provolone Cheese, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Creole Mustard- this was probably my least favorite of the dishes we ordered. It was just okay & we had a lot of food left over so we probably shouldn't have ordered it, but everything sounded great & we went a bit overboard :/The wine selection is extensive. My boyfriend ordered our wine so I'm not sure what I was drinking, but I do know it was quite good. I also loved the atmosphere. Loud, but intimate at the same time, my kind of place. The service was great, however mid-meal our waitress disappeared. So we asked a waiter what had happened to our waitress & if she didn't like us anymore since she didn't end up coming back. Apparently her shift had ended so we were given a new waiter, who was super friendly and attentive, but it would have been nice if someone had told us. All in all I definitely recommend trying this place out, just make sure you come early or be prepared to wait."
"After holding on to this gift card that I had gotten as a birthday gift for over 2 years, I finally got to use it. I tried coming on the weekend where there was a 1 hour and 45 minute wait at 1:30pm. It was beyond peak lunch hour and you'd think it would dwindle but it didn't so we had to go elsewhere. This time around we were here on a Monday 10 minutes before they open at 11:30 so we could be the first ones seated to eat lunch. I am more of wine for dinner kind of gal so we passed on booze, but I'd like to come back for dinner and try some of their bottles. Unfortunately with their busy weekend they ran out of their most popular bone marrow dish which I was bummed out about and wanted to try. We did get the Calamari Anti-pasta, Roasted Carrot Avocado Fennel Quinoa Winter Citrus Salad, Slow Roasted Ham Panini, Foie Gras & Membrillo Smear, Meatball Slider, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, and the Berkshire Porkchop. I did feel a little skewed towards wanting to order more pork items as the name of the restaurant seemed to suggest that it might be the specialty. I think I might be wrong as I was explained that this was more of a Mediterranean style tapas restaurant. Somehow this didn't register in my head until after I had the pork chop, which was my least favorite thing. Everything else I really liked, very unique and flavorful. The prices are comparable to other tapas restaurants. Our waiter didn't do much recommending and was maybe a bit more on the serious side."
"The good stuff gets served here, no doubt! We tried the marrow - fatty and flavorful; the cauliflower and veal were incredible as well. The desserts were...interesting. I'd stick with the main menu. Great location too - sit outside on a nice day; pop open a bottle from the generous wine menu and enjoy!"
"Excellent! Was able to get a seat at the bar right away. After two glasses of rosé and a pork jowl BLT complete with a fried egg on top, I was in heaven."
"So nice when the actual product lives up to the hype.Grab a bar seat because the bartenders will take great care of you.My menu:Milk-braised pork shoulder w/mashed potatoes- The meat melts in your mouth works really well with the mash.- Well-seasoned, and at the same time allowed the pork to shine.- Satisfying portion at a good price.Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and Tzatziki - The Tzatziki keeps the dish light and fresh.- The chicken was perfectly seasoned, and skin was just the right amount of crispy.- Again, satisfying portion at a solid price.Sicilian Iris- Recommend having at least one other person help you finish this delectable dessert.- Can never go wrong with a warm ricotta and chocolate chip filling!Gonna have to come back with others in order to take advantage of the smaller plates."
"I came here with a group of 9 people after work on a Monday and was totally blown away with how well they handled our last-minute, large party! They told us it would be a 40 minute wait and that we would have to split up into two tables, but instead they sat us in 20 minutes all together! We got drinks on the patio while we waited for our table and then were able to transfer our tabs once we sat down. What I loved was that I just told the waitress what kind of wine I was in the mood for and she picked out something perfect! I easily get overwhelmed by wine lists, especially when they are mostly int'l wines (typically pretty loyal to CA wines), so I loved that she was able to match exactly what I was looking for. Also, doing small plates with a large group tends to piss me off, but the waitress was great a letting us know portion sizes for each dish so that we could order accordingly. Strangely enough, one of my favorite dishes was the Kale salad...sooo simple and sooo not what you should order here, but I loved it! We also got the big slab of cured meats which was awesome for our large group, however I would have liked some more bread or toast to be served with the platter. We also loved the eggplant smear, pork blade steak and pig tail. It was my first time trying beef tongue aaaand it was a good choice!"
"Even after devouring a Lou Malnati's pizza, a stop had to be made to The Purple Pig. A stop for 4th meal one may say. I called and they had no wait around midnight so off we went. We were seated at the long communal table, in adversarial positions nonetheless. I'm not a fan of squeezing between people at a communal table but we were only going to be there a short time to try a few choice dishes. ""JLT"" w/ Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli: An open faced sandwich taken to new heights. When you have crackly, juicy pieces of pork jowl with lettuce and tomato adorned with the perfect fried egg, it can be only heaven in your mouth. And it was. I wish I could be served this for breakfast every single day.Razor Clams w/ Oregano, Lemon, & Olive Oil: It's too bad razor clams are so tiny in their serving size. These were sweet and delicious. Lubricated with the fruity olive oil and caramelized from the grill, I wish there were more.Pig Tail's braised in Balsamic, Egg Salad: This was recommended by the server but wasn't a highlight. It was just soft upon soft. The pig tails melted but I wish there was a crouton or bread to accompany the dish to make it even better.Lemon Panna Cotta w/ Lemon Marmellata & Candied Pistachios: Of course she has to have her panna cotta. It had smokey crunch from the pistachios, tart from the panna cotta, and subtle sweetness throughout. She loved it and it was one of the best I've had.It's a shame we only could try a few dishes. Next time we'll have to go for the full dinner experience. And hopefully get an individual table of our own."
"OMG If I could give this place a million stars I would.Someone was looking out for us the day we went to another restaurant and decided to leave (because they didn't serve booze). My boyfriend mentioned that he saw this place from the condo we were staying in and we decided to come here. What a fantastic decision.First off, the menu seems daunting, but only because you want to eat everything, I mean EVERYTHING on it. I had such a hard time deciding what to get because everything was appealing to me. Finally the server, thank goodness, told me I was being crazy and if I wanted to order more after, I could. She told us to pick out the wedge salad and whipped feta with cucumbers to start. Normally we aren't huge wedge fans because I don't see the point in paying $10 for iceberg lettuce but she said the blue cheese dressing was homemade with really good cheese and the bacon is cured in house so I said, YES! WOW the dressing - I could drink it. The cheese was pretty mild but still gave you the zing you want from blue cheese and the bacon was ridiculous - super crunchy and flavorful and you could tell they made it in house. SO GOOD. They also had heirloom tomatoes in the salad which were really pretty and good. The feta comes with delicious garlic crusty toasty bread. Its nice and fresh with a drizzle of olive oil on top. It feels/looks like it would be heavy but was really light and refreshing. I want to figure out how they made it so I can serve it at home.We then got the braised pork shoulder and the mussels. They are best known for their pork shoulder (oh and by the way there is a lot of pork on the menu) so I figured you can't go wrong ordering it. YUM. Nice and tender with a great butter sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were amazing and creamy and smooth - I wish I got more of them. Boyfriend's mussels were yummy as well.Overall the experience is awesome. They are very honest and tell you up front how things are on the menu, how you should order and they let you know up front that when you order things will come out as they are prepared- no courses. I think this is a fantastic way on dining. I love small plates and I love getting food when its nice and fresh rather than sitting in a window. These people have mastered their business and I cannot wait to go back to Chicago to eat more of their food and enjoy their awesome patio."
"I am not the type of yelper that will sit here and tell you exactly what to order because everyone palate is different. I am also not the type of yelper that like to get roped into tourist traps. I had been watching the purple pig for a while trying to decipher if it was a great spot for dinner or just another tourist trap so finally I took the plunge. Once i jumped off my insecure pedestal I hit every flavorful branch on the way down. This was such a marvelous experience that I havent stopped thinking about it since. Heres a quick hint: Wagyu beef-GO. Milk Braised pork shoulder, what did i just say, milk?!?! -GO! Hen-Go stuffed olives-MISS. Quail-GO. What I am trying to tell you is stop thinking, GO GO GO!"
"I've been here twice on dates after a movie and the food was excellent each time. The shmears blow my mind and I am a huge fan of the tuna salad. I would give it 5 stars, but when ordering the scallop plate that was around 14 dollars I began to realize how insanely small some of the portions are for the price in contrast to a place like Avec. I will go back for wine, cheese, and shmears, but that is about it."
"I know this place has a huge number of reviews - well worth the popularity and high ratings.  I too will jump on the bandwagon and say that this place was outstanding.  I took a friend visiting from out of town who wanted to eat at a steakhouse downtown - I suggested we try this place instead of the typical tourist traps.  We were not disappointed!  Our meal was back in Mid-March (I'm late in writing the review) and it was one of those freakishly warm March days.  We sat on the patio outside.  The atmosphere, inside and out, was great.  The place was packed.  We ordered wine and several small plates.  I had some calamari that was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I also ordered an eggplant and goat cheese bread dish (eggplant caponata ""smear"") that was phenomenal.  I know my friend really enjoyed his steak and the other dishes he ordered.  I would definitely return!"
"No comment on the food but the hostess was poor. Walked in 1pm Saturday - not expecting to sit down right away - and saw that half the canopy space was not seated but inside was packed. Asked about getting a table and was told there is a 45 min wait and that there was a wait list for all sections even though my name was second on the list. Regardless of the 45 min wait I gave my phone number as requested only to never receive a call. I expect a bit of snob in a wine and cheese joint but this place needs to get over itself. Limited menu, poor service and attached to a Bank of America doesn't scream fine dining."
"Okay, so I really wanted to fall in love with this place because i'm a big fan of piggies :) And I went to the sister restaurant, girl and the goat and really liked it. Well, I left thinking it was pretty a-okay. the start of it, is they don't take reservations. fine. We called at 6:30 knowing there would be a wait on Sat night and asked if we could put our name down on the list, the hostess said absolutely no, you have to come in person. Why, I don't get it, since we would have come in anyway and been sat in about an hour. Well we finally came in at 7:30pm and there was a 2 hour wait, so my friends and I were not happy about that. Finally, we were sat at 9:30, outside on a communal table in between two sets of groups, which was kinda inconvenient.Now onto food and service. Service was great, she was very nice and full of recommendations. The food was just a-okay, we tried a bunch of things from the pigs ear, to the bone marrow, to the mushroom and pistachio schmear, to the chicken thighs with tiziki (sp?) sauce and finally this doughy dessert with ricotta cheese and chocolate chip filled center, which was prolly my favorite part. So the food was tasty but not amazing in my opinion. Def. worth trying once :)"
"waiting 45 minutes for a table but the food looks worth the wait!! I see that ""pig"" is the thing to eat in the Windy City. I had the bone marrow to start and I LOVED It a lil on the oily side which is why my fiance` didn't care for it but I don't mind getting a lil dirty. Then we had the Pig ears with Crispy kale which was another home run.. (just a lil salty, but hey its pork)Then we had the highight of the meal which was the milk braised pork sholder... meat was super tender and couldn't get enough of it... I would reccommend you visit this place if you are in the mood for some swine...Our waitress was from Florida and she was very nice and helpfull with her input on favorites!!"
"Best grilled cheese panini I have ever had! I'm dying for seconds! I specifically went there because a friend has heard they had great grilled cheese sandwiches. Yes, I know, slightly amateur to be dining out for grilled cheese. But this wasn't your typical panini. It was beyond incredible. Didn't try anything else on the menu- alot of the items seemed strange to me as a limited meat eater, but other customers plates around me did look outstanding as well!"
"We went to the Purple Pig on the advice of New York Yelper Judy K. and I'm glad we did.  I guess it could have been a little hard to find (there were other people on the street asking about it) but we noticed the purple awning.  If you're coming in from Illinois Street, the trick is to go up the stairs at Michigan Street.  This is not the way intersections work where I'm from, but we figured it out.Our cocktails were delicious.  We were a little disappointed that many of the things we tried to order (like the deviled eggs and house cured lardo and meatball sliders) were no longer available, but, hey, we were dining pretty late so I guess that's what we get.  What we did eat - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Prosciutto di San Daniele and cheese plate and, last but not least, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, was all incredible.  We sat outside and when a thunderstorm hit, the manager offered to move us inside but we were pretty dry under the awning and almost done with our meal so we decided to stay put. Overall, an excellent experience.  The Purple Pig lives up to the hype."
"Came here with a large group and each ordered 2 dishes so here's what we got:Fried Olives-  these were so so, not impressive. I'd skip this. The big tail was delicious, probably something i would want for myself :)The meatball slider- not bad. It's your average meatball with bread. Deviled egg was good- a bit difficult to share with 6 people. The pig ears were amazing!!! I've been here 3 times already and never had this. I don't know how I've missed this.The foie grois pâté was amazingPork shoulder was tender and TastyPork blade steak was enormous. Pork neck Gravy with ricotta cheese spread was good too.Caesar salad- Id skipProsciutto de Parma type 2 was so so.All this food for six people- this was more than enough. I feel you can get more bang for you buck here compared to Girl and the Goat.Must haves: pig tail, pig ears, shoulder blade was good value and the prosciutto. Done.Total bill 169- 35 a person with tip. This sure beats the 100 per person at G&G!"
"Maybe the 3 hours plus wait was part of it, but I really didn't think this place was that great. We were being tourists and yelped this place prior to coming. It's nice that they give you a call to let you know when your table is ready, so we didn't have to wait around there and were able to do some shopping. Maybe this restaurant tastes better to people who don't usually eat pork. But since I eat pork a lot at home because I am Vietnamese, it didn't really wow me. I felt like i was eating chicarones and a very overpriced piece of braised pork (which is kinda weird, because I think pork is originally the meat for not-so-rich people who can't afford beef in other countries). Everything tasted fine, it just.. didn't seem so amazing to me. If you want to try this, then go ahead, but if they tell you the wait is 3 hours, I don't think its worth it."
"The Purple Pig was probably the one place I was looking forward to after reading all the reviews on Yelp. We stopped by on Sunday night around 7, anticipating that it would be busy. Sure enough, we were told it would be about an half and a half wait. We put our names down, walked along the Mile, retreated to our hotel for a bit of rest, and then came back. After another short wait we were finally seated. Together we shared a cheese and proscuitto platter, the roasted bone marrow, pig's ear with crispy kale, braised pig's tails, octopus with green beans, AND braised pork shoulder. Yep, that was a lot of food. Considering I had never had bone marrow, I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit greasy, but it was delicious. That's all I can say about it. We also enjoyed the octopus, but the crispy pig's ear and braised pig tails were a bit of a let down. The crispy pig's ears were more like pork rinds, nothing spectacular. The pig tails probably contained more fat than meat, and the braised pork shoulder was very tender, but again, nothing too special. I did find the food a bit salty .. normally I'm not bothered too much by salt but I definitely noticed it in the dishes. The service was good and our server was really knowledgable. When ordering the cheese and meats, I wasn't familiar with a lot of the offerings but knew that I wanted a soft, mild and spreadable cheese. What he brought to us was great, and it tasted like butter! The name escapes me, but I kept our receipt so that I could remember. Inside the restaurant it can get incredibly loud, I don't know if I'd recommend this place for a date unless you were eating outside, which is much more quieter. I was pleased we were able to enjoy a private table inside though. If I were to return to Chicago I'd definitely come back to the Purple Pig to try out more dishes and get more of that bone marrow. Mmmm."
"it's too crowded and loud, but the paninis are solid even though they might be a little salty. Unfortunately, the day we went, the pork shoulder wasn't ready. I WAS ROBBED!"
"Small plates is my favorite way to eat, and this place is at the top of my list.  First of all, the raw corn salad is a must- SO GOOD! Some other good things to try are the fried pig ears, mussels , and pork shoulder."
"Pretty impressive. We didn't have any wine or the cheese plates but we did sample a good bit of items off the menu. For two people, 5 menu choices and water we paid $66. Here's what we had:Sweetbreads: Being a first time sweet bread eater, I didn't know what to expect other than it was a delicacy. I personally couldn't tolerate the texture as they were squishy and what I'd consider mushy. But they were fried very lightly which was pleasing. It was served with a tart, thick (borderline paste) sauce made of a yellow fruit. Sorry, I'm a terrible reviewer since I can't give you exacts. Fried Eggplant Parmesean: Actually better than I'd expect since I detest eggplant. They were very light and big enough to warrant cutting in half. You get 8 to the dish so it was a nice appetizer for 2 people.Bone Marrow: DELISCIOUS! Made me a bit squeamish scooping out the jelly-like marrow but man, oh man, I'd like to have this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Razor Clams: this was OKAY. I wasn't in love with them but they had a nice smoked butter on them. Quail with some sort of raspberry sauce: AMAZING! You just HAVE to try this one.All in all, the service was fine and the place was bumping. Unfortunately it was super hot that day and we sat on the patio chugging water. But on a cooler day I'd imagine that patio would be"
"very reminiscent of a tapas place in spain. Love the atmosphere. A lot of business types (I went for lunch on a weekday with 2 friends). We ate at the bar and the server made sure we were okay with food and drinks.We ordered the bone marrow smear, beet salad, octopus, and bread balls. SO GOOD. All of it. A bit pricey but worth the experience."
Order the bone marrow. Your taste buds will thank me.Everything was delicious and the server recommended an excellent wine pairing. The only downside was that quite a few menu items were sold out. I loved the bone marrow and octopus! I will be back :)
"Overall: 4.5 but they get the benefit of the doubt because of great service. :)I'm so glad we decided to come here before we left Chicago.  We had one lunchtime meal left and we didn't know what to eat.  A friend kept raving about Purple Pig, so we Yelped it and weren't going to go, but decided to squeeze it in.  It kind if reminds me of Animal in LA.  Their menu is Tapas style, and they serve a lot of animal products/parts, so it all seems very exotic.  Everything comes in small portions so it's definitely doable to eat your own, or share and taste a lot more variety. I would recommend sharing though, there's just too much on the menu to focus all on a couple things!  I totally wish we could come back and try more.  Brussell Sprouts= YES! I've had baked Kale that tastes like this but brussell sprouts are WAY better! They are crispy and salty---think healthy equivalent of fries? 5/5Octopus= Good, but I wish they gave more than just two legs of the octopus, though they were pretty hefty legs.  4/5Beets and Goat Cheese = Definitely something to be shared, unless you have a crazy sweet tooth. The beets are already slightly sweet on their own; once you add the creamy goat cheese and the pistachio nuts, you have the perfect dessert.  I wish they brought this out to us last, because we were totally missing salty and sweet. (Which isn't too bad, if you think about it). You also might feel like you have to get this because everyone around you will have their own. This is one of those times where giving in to peer pressure is good! 5/5Bone Marrow = Everyone raves about this, but I don't know, maybe my taste isn't refined enough? Not that it tasted bad or anything, it was actually good, but I don't think it was quite the ""MAGIC in your mouth"" feeling my roomie described.  It tasted a bit like fat cells spread out on some magical bread with salt and onions and cilantro,  It wasn't a bad combo but.meh. and DON'T SMELL THE BONE WHATEVER YOU DO! lol it will definitely ruin it. 4/5These four came out to about $55 so not your regular lunch price, but perfect for date night or a quick nice lunch stop.  Also you'd probably have to spend a little bit more to be completely full, but we were satisfied. All in all YUMMMY IN MY TUMMY, as my little niece says."
"Waited for more than 2 hours. Hostess kept giving tables to other people below our list and kept telling us you are next.. Another half an hour we checked again she said you are next.. This place is OVERRATED!!!If you come here with friends forget about splitting the checks, waitress said they cannot do that.. BS.. They will probably lazy"
"Excellent wine list at great prices. Food is good. Lines/crowds are crazy. Since we don't often make a reservation, our success in grabbing a seat at the bar is hit & miss."
"No bone marrow when I came here, BOOOOOO!!!!!!The only other thing that I can really rave about was their roasted beets with pistachio nuts. It's super duper uber delicious!! It was light and it's perfect for a light appetizer, the whipped goat cheese cream on the top was just a cherry on the sundae! Everything else was decent, the chicken kabob, and the braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was very tender and the meat just peels right off, but the portion was a little small.Very cute contemporary place, outdoor tent seating area with heat lamps. Indoor has a bar/lounge area that you can sit while you wait for a table. Very crowded and tightly packed, but prepare to rub some shoulders even when you are seated. It's okay though, make a new friend with your neighbor, you can enjoy some good food with a good conversation."
"Expectations were set and they were met. Regarded as one of the must try restaurants in Chicago, it lived up to the hype but didn't surpass it like Girl & The Goat. The restaurant is located in a prime location and they don't take reservations, which can be a pain. The best tip I can give is to sit at the bar, if your party is 2 or smaller, since seats usually open up much quicker than you would expect. There is also the additional benefit of seeing all of the different dishes being made, which is why I recommend sitting towards the right side of the bar, where the line cooks are. I had the pleasure of sitting next to Jimmy Bannos Sr. (one of the chef/partners) as he checked each dish before they were sent out. Being able to see each dish and hearing Bannos' recommendations was invaluable in the dining experience.If you like beer, I would highly recommend starting out with a Saisson Dupont on tap, absolutely fantastic albeit expensive at $10 a glass.For food, the dishes I enjoyed were:Broccoli, Charred Cauliflower, Deviled Eggs, Pig's Ear (great dish), Eggplant Smear (the goat cheese is delicious), Chicken Thigh Kebabs,and  Pork Blade Steak (big portion and juicy)"
great food - definitely give it a shot. great service as well.
"I am not particularly a fan of bone marrow, so although it was ordered, and properly executed -- well, I'm still not a fan. However, they did a good job..The pork shoulder was perfect, and the brussel sprouts just right.The wine was reasonable and delicious.Great service and lovely ambiance. I would highly recommend."
"We enjoyed the food.  Lots of interesting choices. Tight quarters at the tables, didn't enjoy being crammed in so much.No local Chicago beers?  Wanted to try some but they only had Mediterranean spirits. How are could it be to support local businesses?"
"Fantastic food, great prices.  Note that this place is loud, crowded and has communal seating.  If you are looking for a private place, this is not it.  The Porchetta Panini was amazing - and we also had the Chicken Thigh Kebobs - which were cooked perfectly, and were surprising juicy.  Would not be good for big groups ... the food comes out at odd times."
"On a sunday night, when most restaurants in Chicago are shut down, Purple Pig is bumping with a wait and full blown service at 11pm. And rightfully so, the food is excellent.Really valuable prices, really great flavours, simple and rich dishes. The menu is tapas style and the plates are not small at all. However, i would recommend carefully picking out your dishes. Many of the plates are extremely rich so you have to plan your dinner items instead of just choosing everything you think sounds amazing."
"Great food and wine. Wish the dishes weren't as salty and had more vegetables, but great for carnivores!"
"I have heard so many good things about this place-but I did not find it lived up to the hype. We came here on a Saturday and put our name in a 7. There was a 3 hour wait, but we were expecting it so that wasn't a big deal to me. The restaurant is small, but cute. The service was outstanding- from the hostess to the busser everyone was so nice and went out of their way to take care of their guests. I don't think we had an empty plate on our table for more than a second. So five stars for service.Maybe their food just isn't for me, but I really wasn't impressed with it. We ordered several of their small plates to share--chorizo stuffed olives- yuck-deviled egg- there was no yolk mixture in ours? so it was just a fried hard boiled yolk- not worh the money to mepigs ears- pretty good-mussels-amazing! and the bread it came with was really good-tripe- none of us at our table liked it-pigs' tails- I spit mine out, but my boyfriend liked it-wagyu beef- this was the best dish- AMAZING! If I ever come back here I'm just ordering several of these.-italian cookies- good but not worth the money-nutella sandwich- very good but something I could have made at homeThey do have a great wine list- it's huge! and has something for every price range. Overall I did not find the food good enough to wait three hours for. But I would consider trying this place again when the wait isn't so long."
"nom nom nom nom nommers.Great location, close to shopping and most major hotels.JAM packed but worth the hassle... cause...The grilled calamari was fantastic. It came in a little cast iron pot with roasted potatoes and buttery green string beans. I had some kind of avocado salad that was not great, but I would go back just for that calamari."
Long long wait. Food is so so. Price is fair
"You look at the menu and everything sounds very tasty. When you get the stuff on your table, it's really not that impressive, and very over priced. More hype than taste in my opinion. Twelve bucks for a 12 oz. draft. Are you kidding me? Did somebody hand carry it from Belgium?"
"Oh my word.We shared the pig tails (heavenly to say the least) the octopus (I am drooling right now) the white anchovy salad,"
"I really wanted to love this place as much as i love Bacaro LA in Los Angeles, but I really can't compare the two of them together. It's like discussing apples and oranges!The Purple Pig had some really great dishes with excellent flavor (pork shoulder, bone marrow, and a ton more that i've forgotten) but they also had dishes that needed a little less salt (broccoli). It gets super crowded during the evening so make sure you get there early or do not mind a half hour to an hour wait! As for service, we had 2 servers because the first one ( a male) ended his shift halfway during our dinner. The male server was really good - gave us great recommendations on what was popular and what he thought was good, and checked up on us frequently in case we wanted to order more tapas. The female server on the other hand, seemed like she needed a wakeup call. She was polite but seemed to be so scatterbrained. We placed in 3 more orders with her and the orders not only took forever to come out, but one never showed up and one that we never order came to our table and we told them we hadn't ordered that. She blamed it on us indirectly by saying that we should've asked her again more often for the dishes to come out, and that she swore we ordered those dishes. Uh, more like you just placed the orders in wrong, and didn't want to admit it. Also, she never really stopped by our table to ask if we needed help or anything so how were we supposed to flag her down?Anyway, other than the female server, The Purple Pig was a pleasant place to try many unique tapas."
"Tried bone marrow for the first time, pretty sure I just came my pants. Proceeded to order the blood sausage - I know it sounds strange, but same result as my first order. Beers are mediocre but my baseline is colorado so I can't be too picky in Chicago. Next up to bat is the pig ear, fried egg, kale and something else. Love this spot and this city this far, but go Avs! Hawks suck!!"
We decided to give the purple pig another chance over a lunch meal instead of late night.  We were really impressed this time.  Our food was delicious and everyone around us looked like they had really good food too.  The menu inspired me to make some new dishes at home.  Try it out!
"Cheese, swine and wine.  Love it.  This is the place to come for pig parts.  Forget about everything else - fish, beef, etc. - you can get that stuff anywhere.  You come here for pork.  The whole hog.We ate pretty much the entire pig.  We had ears, jowls, stomach, hoof, belly, marrow and tail and all were delicious.  Especially good was the JLT - jowl, lettuce and tomato sandwich.  Also delicious were the tripe and pigs feet stew with tomato and black-eyed peas.  The marrow is a decadent treat but the herb salad is what made that great.If you must have something that doesn't go oink, try the spring pea salad with bacon (no surprise) and spearmint.  Yummy.  The roasted beets with goat cheese were also good.  The grilled octopus is also first rate.Dessert selections are kind of boring - no pig there - but we had a yummy soft serve vanilla ice cream with aged balsamic vinegar and strawberries.There is an excellent selection of wines by the glass and one of my selections was a Macedonian red wine from Axia winery.  Unusual and delicious!I had to downgrade the place because it's so darn crowded and there's no reservations so we waited 1:45 min for our table.  At least they call you on your cell phone so we took a short walk to Nordstrom and did some shopping.  Also there's no parking and our public lot charged us $39!  Jeepers!"
This is obe of the worsw tapas restaurant that I have ever been. And they seat u with stramgers food is the worse I have ever eaten NEVER AGAIN
"First place we tried when landing in Chicago.. Had the calamari from the antipasti menu, wasn't what I had in mind but not bad.. Definitely isn't fried if that's what you're looking for. Our favorite dishes all came from the smears which were the Pork Liver Pate, Roasted Bone Marrow, and Foie Gras & Membrillo. As for protein you must try the Wagyu beef short ribs.. Hands down the best item on the menu.. We also tried the special of the day, which was lamb cutlet, not much flavor, fairly bland.. Would probably skip it. Overall good experience and great service, would definitely try again."
"They have an extensive wine & cheese menu which is AWESOME!  Be prepared to drop some money for some small portions.  My husband and I came here on a cold rainy night, finding ourselves waiting for 45 minutes. After such a long wait we were hoping to at least get an intimate table together.. but only bar seating was available.  There's a huge bar high table in the middle of the room shared by plenty others!  It was a neat experience, but I was cold/wet and just want to sit and unwind.  I couldn't find any hooks to place my purse anywhere or my coat so that already put me off to a bad start (if they had some underneath the table that'd be perfect!The bone marrow was a little messy to eat, and sadly it was just OK.. I think if it were cut in half we would've enjoyed it more.  the purple 'pig' says it all - i didn't find very many (if none at all) - veggie options.  if you're a meat/pork eater & feel like dropping money for small portions, this is the perfect place for you!"
"Another place chosen using only Yelp reviews. So, I must add mine to the long list. We arrived and were told the wait would be around an hour and 15 minutes so we ordered a glass of wine and waited outside w/ the others. They have a pretty decent size waiting area w/ a few benches to sit and sip wine. Within 15 minutes our table was ready! WHAT? An hour sooner than quoted? YES! Already pretty excited, we arrived at our table, outside, and ordered a few dishes to try. We relied on our servers choices for the goat cheese selections - I will try and find her name- SHE WAS AMAZING= - and our cheese was equally amazing! We had the following dishes and LOVED every single one:Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa VerdeScallop Spiedini with Chickpea AioliCharred Green Onions with Romesco Sauce... I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Dinner was great, atmosphere was wonderful, service was spot on! We would've gone back a second time if we had time. Will definitely stop again on our next trip."
We visited the Purple Pig for lunch  recently with a group of friends. The experience was incredible!! We sat at a large table and ordered a few dishes. The highlight was an octopus dish but what capped off my meal was the doughnuts. Amazinggggg! Great place with a creative twist. Atmosphere is great although it can get busy but worth the wait.
"Purple PigSmall snack and wine stop. ""Wine and swine"" is the tagline you see at their entry archway so knew we'd get along. Atmosphere: 3, Food: 4, Service: 3Cost to worth it rating: 3Eve award: best turkey legHighlights:- Sharing is caring: mostly small plates so you can try several things- Wines: extensive list with many by the glass/baby carafe, one other size, and bottles - Turkey leg: a far cry from your theme park version--only resemblance is the size. Flinstone-style meat on a bone with an amazing sweet glaze and succulent fork tender turkey complete with a few crispy capers.- Asparagus: chilled sliced raw with hard cheese- Short rib: milk braised which I've never had before and tender- Outdoor option: shared a long high bench table Lowlights- Out of stock: after we placed our order, the waitress came back 3 separate times to tell us things were out. Not the best to be out of so many items but to not know up front made for a bit of a frustrating experience.Liked the spot for a late afternoon wine stop and would come back."
"GREAT PLACE; it's SUPER busy, about an hr wait. However, the bar is open seating. Got the bone marrow to try it just to say I did. Also got the meat platter. Definitely a good call and appetizer for a group setting. The best dish was the pork loins and the pork shoulders; cooked to perfection. The loins had a very fresh cooked with herb, the pork shoulders was with mashed potatoes; all around great place. Would be 5 star if the wait wasn't as bad"
"Ok, I don't really eat much pig (I'm veg) or wear much purple (random fact). But this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Not amazing enough to be a fiver, but not plain jane enough for a 3. Ambiance: relaxed, classy, romantic. Food: great for the most part (the eggplant parmesan balls were delish, and the NUTELLA PANINI was BOMB. Can't go wrong with nutella + bananas! HIGHLY recommend this dessert!) Price: Very reasonable. For 3 dishes (which are small bee tee dubs, definitely get a few to share) plus 1 dessert, ~$40 total inc. tip. So $20/person between the two of us, which is very reasonable for gourmet quality food. I am definitely coming back---as in I'll be there again in a few days LOL. #fatass"
"Hit or miss with their food, long wait, service could be friendlier I like their wine selection"
"I guess the only real complaints I could have about The Purple Pig are that it's a bit crowded and noisy no matter when you seem to go.  But that's a small complaint compared to how good the food was, which is fantastic, and usually the atmosphere is loud/lively versus just loud.The wagyu beef was fantastic and everyone I know loves the bone marrow (which I find good, not great).  I had some tuna dish that I can't recall at the moment that was the best tuna-based dish I have ever had.This place is fantastic for drinks, a group and/or just a one-on-one date."
Cheese swine and wine
"This place is soooo awesome!! We came for lunch on a weekday around 11:15 and there was no wait!  We had the pig ears & kale, pork shoulder, and bone marrow.  All were suggestions of the waitress and all were superb!  I thought that the pig ears and kale would be kinda like eating the pig ears my dog eats but it was far from it -- the dish consisted of really thin strips of crispy goodness!! The pork shoulder was so tender and came on top of mashed potatoes and the  bone marrow + bread was soooooo buttery and good."
"Swine n' Wine! Great service! Purple! My favorite color! Pig! My favorite flavor!This place could not have been more appealing, but then I went in biased to like it. Me, the Oenophile dilettante (I love wine, I'm just not sure what to order - so I brought someone who did!) and the porcine . . . ophile as well. Salami, jamon, prosciutto, tongue, head cheese . . . all fancy words for FANCY MEAT, baby! Big platter of MEAT! Carnivores rejoice and bare your canine teeth! The salami . . . wow. They smoke and make a lot of their meat here, how is this possible to have a smokehouse here in Michigan Ave., but they do, and it is beautiful.Deviled egg. Now, I love the ova of Lucifer as much as the next siren, but this was particularly decadent. I called it ""A Scotch Egg, but deviled!"". Hard boiled egg, deviled, and DEEP FRIED with a crispy crust. Inside, creamy, warm and . . . mmmfff. Unexpected deviled egg, but yum. The best deviled egg, indeed. Reclining atop a bed of greens with a delicate vinegarette (there's the greens with all this meat). Don't miss this one.Another appetizer . . . ""Bait"". Deep fried . . . something like white anchovies? People who know me, know I'm a fool for the anchovy, and these were . . . well, something similar to them, and just as delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. Stellar company, MEAT and wine. And our waitress could not have been more friendly, cute and charming. Even the hardworking manager came out for a chat. Great addition to the Avenue. Will be back SOON.Updated to add: OMG, I forgot the Bone Marrow. Suffice it to say, I want to lay in a vat of this stuff while I dip bread in this marrow bath and stuff myself with 100% fat until I die of a coronary or get stuck in aforementioned tub. Yummmmm . . . Anthony Bourdain says bone marrow would be his last meal, but I'm gonna eat it again and again, baby! In fact, eating bone marrow WITH Anthony Bourdain. Well, that thought will get me thru many a dull evening . . . mmmmmm"
"Even though it's very rare to visit this place without waiting at least an hour... it's worth the wait. Order a glass of wine or two, hang out by a heater... the food is going to be AMAZING.They specialize in small plates. Our server was very good about letting us know how much was too much to order. Let me say, everything was SO GOOD. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.And whatever you do, do not leave without ordering the Sicilian Iris - a ricotta and chocolate filled brioche piece of dessert sent straight from heaven. It's freshly baked and served to you warm and delicious. I still dream about that dessert sometimes. My mouth is watering right now."
"Aww man I'm not quite sure what to say. A couple friends and I came here for dinner and it started off well enough. We didn't have to wait as long as the estimated waiting time. We were seated outside which wasn't that bad. The hostess was nice, friendly, upbeat, and very accommodating. We had just a few dishes: the beet and goat cheese, bone marrow smear, wagyu beef, and JLT. All of the dishes looked great and sounded delicious but for some reason only the wagyu beef and bone marrow worked for me. The wagyu was perfectly cooked, tender and melt in your mouth like a delicious fatty piece of beef should be. The bone marrow is just straight up indulgence smeared on bread. Two out of four hits on the dishes would still warrant four stars from me considering they were done exceptionally well but I have to knock off an additional star for the servers who bring out the food. I mean every single dish came out with barely two sentences, no smiles, and no enthusiasm. Then plopped down onto our table. Honestly, if the people who work at the restauraunt aren't excited about their food then why the hell should I be? Maybe I just haven't tried enough dishes to get a good feel for what everyone is raving about. Maybe I just caught the servers on the day they were having a ""who can be the least social"" competition. Regardless, my rating based on this experience leads me to the conclusion that this place is just...A-OK."
"I came to this restaurant while visiting Chicago last year since it came highly recommended. First off, the decor is really nice. It has a rustic feel to it and the outdoor seating is lovely. They have a very extensive wine list and the waiters/waiteresses are very knowledgable about them. The food is served tapas style, so you order a bunch of different plates to try. The tuna with lima beans, braised baby artichokes, milk braised pork, meatballs, beets and octopus were all delicious. I wish this restaurant was in NYC because I would go all the time - thats how good it was!"
"Grabbed lunch here last Sunday and was very impressed with their small plates.We got the cucumber and feta spread which was refreshing and opened our appetite a bit. The special that day was pig tail, so we ordered that as well. Tender, fall off the bone meat the melted in our mouth. The raw corn was very different and recommended by our server, however, probably our least favorite dish of the day.Our favorite was the pig's ear. It's a delicious blend with kale and egg. A must try!Service was great, overall enjoyable experience."
It is very sepcial place with awsome food. I like the concept that they provide all kinds of pig dish. Small portion and can share with each other.Their wines are great too.The only downside is the average wait time is 1.5 hrs on a week day nite due to limited space of the resturants. They will take down your phone number so you can shop around while waiting.
Unique and tasty food.  JLT and the pig ear's dishes were awesome!  Quick service and attentive waiters.  :)
"Wonderful restaurant. I admire their creativity in mixing and twisting food. Sit at the bar for fun, especially the seats you can see the chefs working . Razor clams, pig ear, pig tail, turkey leg...yum! Anything you think it is weird...order it! Love their cocktails."
"This place is wonderful!  Though I was surprised by some of the ingredient combinations I read on the menu, when it came to the table and I tasted it, absolutely delicious.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and I cannot wait to take other people back to this gem.  Truly a great place to dine out."
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Love the location, the staff, the wine selection, the menu, the cheese, the everything! I want one in DC!"
"Trendy, fun, LOUD!  Pricey, but unique, interesting items.Loved the deep fried chorizo stuffed olives and the pork shoulder served with mashed potatoes melts in your mouth!"
"This was a nice place to relax inside while snowing outside. The rosemary nuts and bone marrow was good! Beer was good too, I forgot what kind it was but we just asked our server what she recommended. Yum! Only bad thing (but good for them) is that it's real crowded there! We had to wait for about 40 minutes, but we just went to the mall nearby and they texted us when our table was ready."
"Small plates, perfect for sharing. Or, of you're me, perfect to eat all of and feel no shame in being selfish because you're at lunch solo. I ordered the beet antipasti to start off. And as anyone who eats beets is aware, they can sometimes be overwhelming... what to do to balance off what is essentially a pickled beet... oh, whipped goat cheese and pistacios with a vinegrette! genius!Next up was the Wild Striped Bass with Artichoke Caponata. Tiny fishy heaven. The fish was cooked perfectly and not even the bold caponata could compete with the flavor of the bass. Pretty cool that PP is tucked into Mich Ave too because it was the perfect retreat from the land of chain restaurants I was stuck in. And if you get there early enough you can essentially have your pick of tables. Get there late however, and it'll definitely be full. Even the patio was packed on a rainy April afternoon. I can't say it was one of my favorite meals ever, but if I were in the area again, I might be interested in stopping in for a small bite."
"Absolutely wonderful! Great food, service and atmosphere! It's worth waiting a loooong time!"
Nice place  the food was creative just wasn't my thing. However I'm not into olives. Be ready to do some research to understand the menu.
"First off, be prepared to wait! This place is always busy! They have a great selection of cured meats, cheese, and wine. The pork shoulder is to die for. It is so tender and full of flavor. Wait staff is always knowledgeable and helpful with making menu selections. Nice place to stop by for small plates and drinks after an eventful day on Michigan Avenue."
"Good food, always crowded.  Servers can be a little pretentious."
The eight of us sat at the communal table.  Family style dining is encouraged by the waitstaff.  I thought this worked better for smaller groups.  We ended up doing four and four.Portion size like tapas. I enjoy everything but I can't really give a thorough review as I just got to taste a couple of tablespoon size portions per plate.What did stand out for me was the roasted beets.  Now that was memorable.
"Very trendy.  Very crowded.  Even at 3pm on a Sunday, we had to wait an hour for a table--fortunately, we scored a seat at the bar just 10 minutes into our wait.Decent prices for this kind of fare. They had no meat/cheese combo plates, which is annoying.  We got the three cheese platter.  It was yummy.  We had a half bottle of Prosecco to cheers to our girls weekend.  They gave us extra baguettes too without asking.  Believe it or not, some places charge for that.  Service was attentive.  It was neat to watch the compact kitchen cook right in front of you too from our bar seats."
"Overrated. Been waiting to try this place for a year....finally made it there tonight.  Got the ""favorites""...bone marrow, pork shoulder, pig ear....etc.....everything was so greasy, food was cold, and underwhelming. Only thing good about this place was the music (awesome playlist) and the waitress was very helpful and nice."
"Has this Purple Pig met that other Girl and the Goat roaming around Chicago? They seriously should combine forces and form one super restaurant because they are both amazing!The Purple Pig is a snug little restaurant with a clean interior and lots of sitting room. Even so, you probably need to make reservations in advance for this place because it's that popular!Some of my favorites:-BEETS WITH WHIPPED GOAT CHEESE! A bowl full of beet cubes with an amazing, whipped goat cheese topping. The combination of the two is mouth-watering! I wouldn't recommend this if you weren't a fan of beets (what's wrong with you?) because it literally was as I am describing it. -Fried pig's ear w/ kale. It's topped with a sunny-side-up egg, so it's definitely a great photo opp if you're one of those people who love taking pictures of food. I'm not a fan of pig's ear but I did like this. Honestly, it kind of tasted like really crispy fries... but what's wrong with that :)-Pork shoulder. The pork is really soft and pulls apart with your fork. Seasoned well and laying on a bed of yummy mashed potatoes, this dish was worth trying (esp. since there were so many Yelp pictures on it!)After eating here, you'll definitely become a piggie yourself :) and you know what I say about that?... oink oink!"
"Great service.  Interesting wines.  Nice beers.  We tried a few things from the menu:Chefs choice 3 cheese plate (great!), foie gras (it was sweet!  I did not know foie gras was sweet - I thought it was savory), the pork shoulder with gravy (excellent) and a plain panini (excellent!).Interesting place, a mus try."

FIrst with Billy Goat and now Girl and Goat. Purple Pig, the under-pig of the night, being more of the veteran in this circuit, you just have to wonder about stamina. Both have very similar fighting styles. However Purple pig has some weight on the goat, and will try to pin the goat down into submission. The Goat has to keep moving, avoid being grappled at the legs, and dish out some headbutts and jabs.Fast Forward...And we have a winner. Purple Pig puts a death grip around the Goat's belly until the Goat cannot breathe. He squeezes  to the point of incontinence."
"I think every time I go to Chicago I am going to eat here. It was amazing. I do wish the portions were a little smaller because I would have tried many more items. The description did say tapas, small items but i would say this plates are a little larger then normal tapas in my opinion. The portions I would say are appropriate for larger groups. Me and my boyfriend went and were only able to split three items and some cured meat, and I mean we're were stuffed. We really should have only gotten two items and a cured meat (which still would have made us full) but we couldn't  hold back everything looked so good. They have great beers but they were pricey. We had the pleasure of being able to sit at the outdoor patio. We were also very lucky to be able to get there like 20 mins after they opened and got the last seat out there. About 10 mins after they sat us there was a huge line waiting to be seated. So make sure to come early for lunch or early for dinner. Now tho the portions were larger then I would have liked I plan to eat here every time I visit Chicago. I wish they were a chain and would open one in michigan some where so could enjoy this place more often."
"What a zoo. Crazy waits, noisy and crowded. All worth it for the delicious food. The Brussels sprouts were delicious and my kids actually asked for a second helping of broccoli. I have never had pig's ears before and ordered them because of the great reviews here. I am glad I did. They were wonderful. Don't be put off by the fact they're pig's ears. They are just crispy bits of heaven.The waiter recommended the turkey leg and pork shoulder. Both were good calls. We'd get them again. We loved the mussels and bone marrow too. Top all the great food with friendly and efficient service and you get a fabulous meal. It's worth the lines and the crowds. Fun and delicious food. Yum!"
"Lucked out with a great spot at the bar and stayed for hours drinking wine and sharing plates. Really terrific ambiance--fun, energetic and even a little cozy. The food was quite good overall. The razor clams overcooked and borderline rubbery, but the flavors were spot on."
"Let me start by saying that I love this place. They have great food. I live in the area and I come here all the time. Today, I had their pork neck... There was a huge bone that I almost cut my throat. I told the waiter that and all she could say was ""oh"". I was disappointed by the way this was handled. I expected a different response. A more apologetic response. The octopus was cooked to perfection but it lacked salt and it was very oily."
5 star as far as quality or food and service but is a casual restaurant. We had the bone marrow (was interesting) cheeses were amazing!!!! Along with the selection of wine and cured meats. Differently for the food adventurer along with people that love good cheese and wine! Totally go and enjoy!!
"I had high expectations of this place considering the extremely long wait and hype.  I'm glad to say it completely surpassed my expectations and was worth the wait.The atmosphere is loud and crowded, and it's obvious that they're trying to cram and accommodate as many people as possible in the small space with tables that spill out into a heated outdoor area.  So be prepared to sit at a communal table if that's what opens up first.The menu is extensive with so many unique and imaginative items.  Purple Pig does its own twist of Mediterranean cuisine with plates that are meant to be shared.  Based on the recommendations of our server and what we were feeling, our dinner consisted of:- Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette: Pretty standard when it comes to a goat cheese and beet dish with a nice crunch provided by the pistachios.  Although tasty, compared to the other SPECTACULAR dishes, this was probably my least favorite.- Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios: Not your typical calamari dish.  This was not fried and had such a fresh Mediterranean flavor profile.  This was perfect to offset all the heavy meat dishes we had.- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: It might not sound great, but this dish is DECADENT.  The bone marrow has a great mouth feel and savory flavor that is amazing over the buttered bread.  - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: This was also definitely one of the stars of the show.  The meat literally melted in our mouths and had a great flavor that was perfectly paired with the base of mashed potatoes.  HIGHLY recommend!Overall, a standout unique meal that makes me want to return TOMORROW to try more dishes on their menu.  Even though I am only in Chicago for a limited number of days, Purple Pig is worth a return trip."
"Really, just spare yourself. It's too crowded, too small, too long of a wait and it's simply not worth putting up with it all when you can go to another place that serves the same food and is much better (The Publican).I've had very poor service here before and you're literally sitting so close to your neighbors that you could bump shoulders. Our waitress forgot two things that we ordered, yet kept pushing us to buy more wine. The food is good, but I've definitely had better.Unless it's like 3pm on a Monday and you can walk right in, it's not worth it, but that's just my opinion after going there twice. Also, even if it's cold or raining, they will try to seat you outside under the tent next to a heat lamp. There's also no room to wait inside (for your hour and a half wait)."
"I must have been here a dozen times or more and each time was great. Excellent wine selection, whether you just want a single glass or plan to work your way through a few bottles. While the food is tapas style the portions are actually realistically shareable. Everything I have had has been good to great with few disappointments. The only downside is the wait time and lack of reservations - but that's true of a lot of good restaurants in river north."
"First time here and cannot wait to go back. Not only was the serve knowledgeable he was warm and friendly too. The atmosphere is so fun and amazing food at a great price point, it's no wonder they stay busy all the time. Thanks for the job well done!"
"So the 4 of us went on a friday night, got there at around 7pm? We were told we had to wait about 40mins for a table. Went to the nearby starbucks to hangout and somehow managed to bump into Lady Gaga. Cool, I know.What we ordered:Bone MarrowChorizoJLTFoie grasand some other random things that I can't remember cause I had about 2 glasses of wine at this point.Superb."
"What a great meal!  I was visiting Chicago for work and this place was close to my hotel, and I went around 3 pm, and got a seat at the Chef's counter.  Which had it's pro's and con's.  Fun to see the chef's working, but they also stack the empty clean plates on the counter and sometime the piles were so high I couldn't see over them and felt a little boxed in.  But onto the food.  My waiter was super friendly and I asked his advice.  A good plan it turns out. I had the fried sardines to start.  Delicious, very lightly friend fish, with some pesto and pine nuts.  Just delicious!  Next I had the pork secret with peppers, leeks and pickled watermelon rind.  Served piping hot, and so so good. The meat flavor was wonderful with the compliment of lightly pickled veggies on the side.  And I finished with the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios. It looked like a dessert - a beet sundae!  But it was nice and salty and a perfect way for me to end a meal.  I am not a big dessert person, so ending with a beet salad was a nice ending to a great meal."
"Excellent meal. Came in with my wife around 11:30 on a Sunday for brunch and there was no wait.  We're big fans of Jimmy Bannos' Heaven on Seven and I've got to say I think the son has outdone his dad...Food is small plates. Not too small to share, but you certainly want to order a couple plates per person if you want to leave full.We let our waitress pick a bottle of wine which was great, and took her recommendations for food but picked most of that ourselves.The famous pig ear was delicious of course, buy my favorite was the open faced jowl sandwich, and hers was the broccoli (amazing).Not sure I would come for late night snacks like other reviewers...food was almost too nice for what I want at midnight, but will absolutely be back for lunch or dinner."
"Menu is all about pork pork pork.  Even the veggie dish had a bit of pork and how can you say no to that!!!  Ordered the peas with bacon, bone marrow and more pork dishes.  Quality and taste is a go for me.  Would I come here again to try out different pork dishes??? Heck yea!  But please be warned that this place does not take rsvp therefore you may need to wait a while.I'm a fan~"
"I had high expectations for the purple pig, and they were definitely not met. We tried the cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, the crispy pig ear and bone marrow. 1st off, none of the dishes were remotely warm and everything was pickled. It left a bad taste in my mouth. And the pork shoulder was very bland and fatty. The bone marrow was the worst and full of grease and had an unpleasant odor and consistency. The only good thing I can say about the purple pig is the music was great! Never going back for seconds. OVERRATED!"
"Very creative menu, attentive service, small place - you'll wait during peak hours. We very much enjoyed the salt roasted beets with goat cheese, the pork shoulder (incredible), and the octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes. Decent world-wide wine selections. A lot of happy people having a good time over food & drink!"
"Someone on the street told me about this place when I asked where to eat - totally a great suggestion.  I had the Salted Beets with Goat Cheese & Pistacio - WONDERFUL.  Now for the charcuterie - I come from a place in the country where it is hard to come by so I decided to make a complete pig out of myself - I ate the $30 sampler platter by myself and regardless of the fact that I have probably consumed a years worth of sodium it was totally worth it and ridiculously satisfying.Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, great wine and very hard to come by Spanish beers which I love."
Perfection. In town from Miami for work and Purple Pig was next to our hotel.  Soooo glad we stopped in.  Amazing wine. .. chicken thigh with fried mashed potatoes and tzaziki was heaven. Josh was awesome and completely knowledgeable on whole menu.  We'll be back again before we fly home.  Loved it.
"Had an amazing meal at The Purple Pig & can't wait to try it again next time I'm in Chicago.  We sat at the counter where all the action was & I was incredibly impressed with the amount of food produced by the tiny kitchen & the efficiency & ""dance"" of bodies in that tight space.  We started with the salt roasted beets with the whipped goat cheese & pistachios.  The goat cheese was so creamy & the pistachios provided a much needed crunch to the beets & cheese.  Then we moved on the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta.  It was deliciously rich & satisfying although a bit salty.  Next we had the pig's ear with crispy kale, fried egg & pickled peppers.  The ear was fried perfectly - not greasy at all.  I could've dated a whole bag of them like chips.  The eggs provided the creaminess with the perfect acid touch from the peppers.  We finished with the JLT which had a similar flavor profile as the pig's ear & just as delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant although it was a beast to get a seat.  The reservationist will take your cell phone number so you can put your name down & walk around the stores nearby.  It's worth the wait & you can enjoy a glass a wine outside while you wait."
One of my favorite Chicago regular spots. I love how the menu changes regularly. But the go to dishes are the milk braised pork and the grilled octopus. Mmmmmmm.
"Amazing wines and desserts! Lemon panna cotta and affogato with salted caramel soft serve are both to die for! Try the moscato d'asti for a sweet dessert wine, or the Spumante brut rose for a drier  dessert wine. Also ask about the lemon sage gin cocktail. Forgot the name but it's great!"
"Thank you Yelp and Yelp reviewers for this amazing recommendation! This is my first time in Chcago and I relied onYelp to guide my gluttony- this first stop did not disappoint!My friend and I sat at the Chef's counter and started off with the neck bone smear (never had this befor but came highly recommended by our fantastic server).  The flavors were full and bold but we needed to a few more bread slices to ensure we did not let one single bite (definitely not a bad thing!).  Next, we had the fried brussel sprouts.  These are my most favorite veggies and the flavor with a hint of lemon brought them to a whole new level! They were not fried in the sense of breaking but rather more like sautéed, which kept the flavors focused on the sprouts and not the grease from the oil. I also appreciated that they were already sliced so we didn't have to worry about the sprouts rolling off the plate while trying to stab it with the fork. :) The bone marrow and pork shoulder were by far the most popular items.  We opted for the shoulder since we weren't sure how marrow would be perceived by my friend's 4 month fetus.  ;). Again, amazingly delicious! She hasn't been able to eat much meat since being pregnant but baby must've enjoyed this one because she ate her fair share without too much hesitation.  We ended with the apple crisp because 1. It's her favorite dessert and 2. we figured if everything else was so damn delcious, how can we skip dessert? Incredible! Just the right amount apples and crisp (although I could always use more ice cream/gelato cause it never fails to melt too quickly).The Purple Pig is a must visit!  It really brought the essence of Chicago to light for me. We are now for our 2nd Yelp recommendation- breakfast!"
"You come here for the quality and not the quantity. If you're super hungry, don't come unless you're willing to spend a few $$I highly recommend the pork heart panini. It's their take on the classic Italian beef sandwich. It's just incredible. Also tried the roasted bone marrow. It's essentially meat butter. It's rich, but I love that comes with a lemony parsley, fennel, and caper salad to cut through the richness. The serving is good for 2 people. Had great conversation with our server who appreciated that we were out of town San Jose Sharks fans."
"I was in Chi-Town for work and was directed to The Purple Pig by my trusty Yelp app. Man, was it good. The restaurant is a little...cozy. It is hard not to feel that you are dining with the patrons on either side of you as there is so little room between the tables, but the excellent service and food quality make up for the lack of real estate. This menu definitely has something for everyone. My boss led the charge with our server and ordered enough food for our whole office, despite the fact that it was only the two of us dining. I liked that the restaurant brought the dishes out as they came up. Since my boss had ordered so many options, it was a special surprise each time a dish came to the table. We started with the Pork Fried Almonds, mostly just because of the name. They were so salty, but so delicious at the same time. We also tried the Chorizo Stuffed Olives and Deviled Egg with Arugula and Capers from the fried section of the menu. Both excellent. I specifically ordered the feta cornbread and anchovies with avocado hummus and was not disappointed. Both dishes were unexpected flavor sensations. I am sure we had many more items, but this meal was over two weeks ago and I can not remember all the varieties at this point. The only dish that disappointed was the stuffed squid, but that is more due to my own palate than any flaw in the dish itself. Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. It took about an hour and a half to get a table on a Friday night, but it was well worth the wait. Besides, there is a great wine bar across the street named Eno where you can while away the hours."
"Believe in the hype.  I live blocks from here and balked at waiting in line for the past 3 years.  People know about the food here.....what people also need to know is that even though there is a LOOOONG wait, it's fine!  They take down your cell number and call you when your table is ready.  I put my name down at 5:45pm, chilled at my condo for 2 hours and walked back for one of the most ridiculous dinners I've had in a long time.  It was like dim sum:  we got 2 orders of Pig's ear with Crispy Kale, 2 orders of milk braised pork shoulder, 1 JLT, bone marrow, salt-roasted beets, and some other dishes.  Definitely get the Pig's ear.  Trust.  The braised pork shoulder just melts in your mouth.  You can read about the other dishes in the other reviews....my advice if you're visiting from out of town:  Put your name down around 4 or 5pm  and just go shopping on Michigan Ave.  The place is tiny so it'll be tough to just wait there for 2 hours.  (or just message me and we'll do soju shots at my place while you guys wait)"
"Convenient location. Great atmosphere (you must be ok with communal tables and tight space). Our waiter was fantastic....wish I could remember his name.  My party ordered: pâté from the smear menu, lamb blade steak, and some kind of fancy kicked up quesadilla. The reason for three stars is bc the pate was runny and the quesadilla type thing just wasn't very good. HOWEVER, if I could, I'd give the lamb blade steak 6 stars bc it was honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted. It comes with anchovy butter/ caper/lemon wonderfulness sauce over rapini. SO GOOD.  I will be back for the location, wine, service, and blade steak, but will probably order a different small plate/smear next time."
I generally don't do a review unless I've had a few things on the menu but I made an exception here -  I stumbled on this gem while I was waiting for the rest of my group to arrive in Chicago. After walking up and down the street shopping I needed a drink and wanted to stay out of a hotel. This is located almost exactly across the street from the Intercontinental (where I was staying) so it was perfect. The place was packed! A Saturday night around 7 - and there was not an empty seat in the house. I circled the bar and was served a glass of wine that I took outside to their large patio area to enjoy. I wanted to eat an appetizer so I went back to bar and was lucky enough to find someone getting up. The people next to me were enjoying the bone marrow and said it was nothing short of spectacular. That seemed a little too adventurous for me - I went with the Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (and more wine). I kid you not when I say I dream about this stuff. It was the perfect amount of richness. The flavor profile was amazing. I was there in January and cannot stop thinking about it!  Highly recommend. I can't wait to be back in the area and try some of the other menu items!
Their pork blade steak is tender and delicious! I didn't know a slice of piggy can be so much fun in the mouth. This dish is large so be prepared to eat (it's large enough for two). Their chorizo olives were good but not something I'll order again. Dessert - the lemon panna cotta is the perfect closer with a cappuccino!
"Wonderful restaurant.  Chicken thigh kabob very good, ham panini Loud but good music"
My favorite restaurant in Chicago!!!!
"I'm a big fan of pork, so this place is like heaven!! Went to the restaurant the past few times I was in town, and it never failed to satisfy my cravings.The place feels cosy and great for hanging out or a romantic dinner with your loved one. Service was great, they had no seats when I went there for thanksgiving, so we chose to sit outdoors, the waiters brought tons of fire heaters!!!Recommended dishes:Pork fried almondsRoasted bone marrow with herbs (smears)Pig's Ear with Crispy KalePork Blade steak*Smears come with this awesome toasted bread, ask for more refills!!!For dessert, try Sicilian Iris or the Festa di Santa Lucia Cremathe Panino con Nutella was good, but a little too sweet for me.. One thing to note, you might want to make a reservation beforehand, they tend to be really packed even for lunch.. and especially dinner."
"Oh man. I could eat the pig ears made here forever. That's right. Pig ears. (Schmears, toasted bread, pork shoulder, etc... all are delicious. Be prepared for a 2+ hour wait if you go here anytime after 5 pm. Unless, that is, you are able to sneak your way to a seat at the bar, which is full service.)"
"Love Love Love this place! Wait staff is fantastic and the menu is like no other place. Bring your adventurous taste buds as they have some one-of-a-kind choices and they are all perfectly cooked and completely delicious. We went twice in 2 days and had: beet salad, quail, sardines, pork secreto, octopus. If you are a foodie with a broad palate, you will LOVE this place. Wonderful busy, energetic atmosphere too that feels more European than American. YUM!"
The food was delicious but too greasy...not good for overweight customers...
"1st time going tonite - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Salt-Roasted Beets withWhipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans, Burrata Pugliese with Peas, Radish, Celery,Spring Micro Greens & Aceto Balsamico, Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbseverything was amazing. i think i loved the deviled egg, bone marrow, and salt roasted beets the best."
"everything spot on, only thing bugging was the communal tables, but you can wait for private"
It is too hard to enjoy the food because of the noise.  The music is too loud which causes the diners to shout at each other which causes the wait staff to shout at the diners to explain what is on the menu.  After several minutes of shouting at each other we just gave up.  I would not go there again.
"food was good. highlights were razor clams, mussels, burrata. not a fan of the foie gras - too sweet, bone marrow was too rich for me. didn't have to wait at 4pm on sunday. was able to accommodate my 15 month old. hostess was nice."
My wife and I came from Michigan for the weekend 1st place we went was the purple pig fantastic different kind of menu great wine list staff very friendly food was excellent would go back anytime I'm in town  could definitely eat there more than once on a three day stay the corned pork panini was the best panini I ever had
"The name of this restaurant really caught my eye which is why I wanted and convinced the people I went to Chicago with to go to The Purple Pig.  Even now, when I think about The Purple Pig, or pig in general, my mouth salivates like waves crashing on ocean floors.  I loooove pig!A great thing about The Purple Pig, aside from their awesome food, is that they're open late.  Love it, especially when the clock is still ticking in West Coast mode.  When we got to the restaurant late at night the hostess was as cool as can be and accommodating.  We had her play musical chairs with us because the family style tables weren't to my liking.  More on that later.  As for our waitress...well, I'd put her in the Top 10 servers I've ever had considering the demand in our orders, the number of times she check up on us, the multitude of times our water glasses were refilled without asking, and the time taken to explain the dish when delivered.  Simply, Bravo!  A true show of how many in the industry should be but aren't except in a few high end restaurants.Of the food we ordered, a few stood out, but everything was delicious!  Here's what we had:- PIG TAILS BRAISED BALSAMIC- ROASTED BONE MARROW W/ HERBS- MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER W/ MASH POTATOES- SALTED ROASTED BEETS, WHIPPED GOAT CHEESE & PISTACHIO VINAIGRETTE- CHORIZO STUFFED OLIVES- BURRATA PUGLIESE, PEPPERS & GOLD TOMATOES- '05 BODEGAS MAGANA ""DIGNUS""I'm all about bone marrow.  The Purple Pig's bone marrow is really good, albeit, not as good as my LMOE locale.  I'd order it again though...no doubt!  I would also recommend the pits tails.  Yes, it might sound disturbing to the unadventurous, but if you open up your palette and mind...it's freaking awesome.  Without a doubt though, the salted roasted beets, whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette dish stole the hearts of myself and my table mates.  It's a safe assumption that we all frowned upon ordering this dish, but when it entered our mouths we were all awestruck with immense goodness and were left speechless.  Thank you Yelpers that recommended this dish.  I personally, hate beets, one could say terrified of it, but that particular dish was memorable.  The reviews on this dish are mixed, but if you like beets...give'm a try.The chorizo stuffed olives and burrata were pretty good as well.  Olives, when done right, is a thing of beauty.  We closed our meal with the milk braised pork shoulder w/ mash potatoes.  Now, I don't know if it was because we were incredibly stuffed already, but I didn't care to much for this dish.  The appearance of the dish just wasn't pleasing to the eye.  The pork itself dissolved in my mouth like butter.  Incredibly tender, a little tasty, but with a full stomach already, maybe not the wisest decision to order.With all this goodness we had we accompanied the dish with a moderately priced wine, their '05 Bodegas Magana ""Dignus"".  I'm not a great expert on wine, even though I was a former bartender, but I know what I like.  The Dignus was definitely something worth trying.  At first, when you sip it and swallow it, it feels bland, but later the flavors starts to burst it your mouth, and soon the berries and currants start to take control of the hint of oakiness that disguised the wine as something worth trying.Why 4-stars and not 5-stars if I like The Purple Pig so much then?  Well, I hate family style seating.  Yes, it's a Euro thing, but homey don't play that.  I don't need a complete stranger next to me when I eat my food.  I've done enough of that to last me a lifetime.  Thankfully, a booth opened up that we transferred to hastily....one little piggy, two little piggy, three little piggy, four.  five little piggy, six little piggy, seven little piggy...who wants more!"
"Great food, drinks, and atmosphere. Make sure and get the fried pig ear with kale and fried egg.  The Purple Pig is known for it's big, but make sure to try the chicken kabob with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki. Alan was our bartender and was great."
"Anything I write in this review isn't really going to be sufficient to express my love and affection for this restaurant.   Easily a top 10 meal for me and it was only lunch!We arrived around noon on Saturday to an hour and a half wait.  Luckily, as we were putting our names in we got a spot at the bar.  I loved sitting at the bar, watching the chefs perfect their crafts and interacting with the bartender.  We got the following:Bone Marrow-  My first experience with bone marrow and it definitely will not be my last.  Fantastic.  The bread served with this is phenomenal.Prosciutto and Bread balls -  While very good, it wasn't as good as the rest of our choices.  If this is as bad as it gets, you can't go wrong. Razor clams - I could have eaten these like they were popcorn.  They did it right.  Right amount of citrus, oil, oregano... you get the idea.  Veal and Mortadella sausage - All I can say is wow.  Probably the most delicious sausage I have ever had.  Certainly gives Hot Doug's a run for their money.  The kale and tomatoes that accompanied the sausage were perfection. Sicilian Iris -  This thing is everything a donut should be.  Brioche, chocolate chips and creamy inside.  If it was socially acceptable I would have licked the plate.  $120.00 including the meal, 6 cocktails, and tip?!?!?!  ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME?!  I would have paid double for that meal.  I feel like this is what girl and the goat is aspiring to be, but the purple pig is far superior! (and much more reasonably priced)  I am dying to come back!!!!!!!!!!"
"Thank goodness I found this place my last night in Chicago. Otherwise, I would've eaten practically all my meals here....Eating at one establishment two times within four hours is some sort of record for me. But, Purple Pig was worth it. My recommendations? Everything! But, here are a few highlights:Salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinegrette---Can you say Yummers?!? I know that some people have an aversion to beets, but this dishw as decadent-almost like dessert. You lose a bit of the earthiness of the beets in this dish but the textural contrast with the pistachio was outstanding! Prosciutto escarole bread balls-The texture was a bit lacking, soft on the inside, I really wanted more of a crunch but the taste couldn't be better!Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and a fried egg-So, I have a problem eating egg yolk. It's the smell, the texture that turns my stomach...But, not in this dish!You have to eat this dish HOT. Dig in, mix up the ear, egg and kale a bit and go for it. It's salty and delicious. Tusan kale and romaine Ceasar salad...real sardines....I'm not a huge Ceasar fan and thought that a bit of lemon would brighten it up (I think that's a PNW thing) but it was perfectly dressed and the sardines couldn't be better!Shaved Brussels sprouts and parmiagino reggiano...I didn't feel like such a hog with this dish-perfect pairing with anything on the menu. Olive oil poached tuna with Greek Lima beans...This is one of my fav's because it reminds me of something my mom makes. Citrusy and full of flavor. The tuna was fantastic. Roasted bone marrow---decadent, rich and overload. I tried to get my best friend to eat some but she was terrified of how it looked. Don't knock it-try it. Some of the best I've had. Another dish you want and need to eat hot. Extensive wine and drink menu-I couldn't adore this place more! If you get the opportunity to sit at the chef's table which we did both visits---DO IT! Enjoy the show and the conversation from the chef!"
Bar service was great! The meals are small and dense and just incredible. The desserts were decadent and it's all worth the wait when you can.
The place is a bit pricey but it's quite an experience.My friend and I went here because we heard a lot of good things about the place and I must say that they didn't disappoint. Thank heavens there's no waiting time when we came. The staff were attentive and friendly. Love their food especially the bone marrow. Will definitely come back when I visit chicago.
"After finally checking into our hotel, me and my family were hungry and I was left to decide where we were going to eat for this entire trip. Luckily, it just took a few short minutes to walk from the hotel to The Purple Pig. Since we had not eaten there before our server did a little run through of the menu then got our drink order while giving us some time to decide what to order. She gave us some suggestions based on our food preferences and popular favorites. We ordered:- Fried Deviled Egg- Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- Fried Pigs Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- JLT with Fried Duck Egg & Lemon Aioli- Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche)- Panino con Nutella (Nutella, Marshmallow Cream & Banana Panini)My favorites were the fried pig ear (I enjoyed the bit of spice and vinegar flavor from the pickled peppers with the crispy pig ear), pork neck bone gravy with ricotta (we asked for more bread to soak up every last but of gravy and creamy ricotta), milk braised pork shoulder (the pork shoulder was so tender), and the Sicilian Iris (it has everything I love in desserts - the melted chocolate chips and creamy ricotta with the fried brioche was heaven. and it wasn't too sweet).The food was amazing and our server was very helpful. We liked everything so much that we picked up some take out to take back to our hotel a couple days later because I was craving the Sicilian Iris for dessert after having dinner somewhere else and my family wanted the fried pig ear."
"I went here with my best friend on our trip to Chicago, this was a fun but very crowded spot. When we got there, there was an hour and a half wait  so we decided to try and find a seat at the bar. We ended up getting A seat and waited 15mins for someone else to leave the bar so we could finally sit down together. I'm not really a fan of pork so a lot of the pork tapas were new to me; like the fried ears, pork liver pate (Loved it). Then there were items like pigs tail braised in balsamic vinaigrette that were a little to ""porky"" for me. The Bone marrow dish seemed to be a favorite there but I didn't get a chance to try it. Overall, If you like pork you'll love it. If you don't youll find your self eating a lot of pate."
"My absolute favorite wine bar in Chicago! Great place to bring visitors to Chicago. Insane wine list. Very popular and usually busy so expect to be put on the waiting list if you go during the evenings. Also, while they do have small tables for 2, the main seating in the restaurant is at shared long tables. I love this, but if you're looking for more of a quiet, romantic wine bar, maybe not the place. But tons of fun all the same! Mixed review with service. Went once over summer time when the server was new and couldn't make many suggestions on wine or food. But, went again this January and had the most amazing, friendly server who explained the food and wine in a way that made our mouths water! Food is AMAZING. Recently had a beet & goat cheese salad that almost made me order another. If you haven't been, you must go! Two thumbs up!"
Wine and small plates - can not go wrong!The caesar with kale is delicious and I'm not even a fan of kale!Wine selection is wonderful and desserts are tasty.
"Flew direct from Kauai to Chicago and had to rapidly adjust to the time difference. Thank goodness for the warm weather and this superb recommendation from my neighbor.Only had time for late lunch/early dinner and ordered:Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesSicilian IrisIrony is the pig's ear served in an adorable ceramic pig. The combination of the fried egg with the fried pig's ear was brilliant. As for the milk braised pork shoulder, it was juicy, tender and one of the best I've tasted. Pure swine delirium which rekindled my love for cooking. Unfortunately, I don't remember much about the dessert so whatever.The Purple Pig was a pivotal moment where I truly agree that  ""life is too short to have bad food."""
"We heard very good reviews about the place and had always wanted  to give it a try. A saturday night, after 2 hours waiting, we were seated at the patio. In a cold winter day, the seating area was covered, with a couple holes on the top and and one at the corner, the door was widely open, we could not take off the winter coats the whole time. The place does offer a good food selection, we tried the famous pork shoulder, razor clam, pork ear, and squid. Large Tapa sized dishes, but everything was SO salty and oily. Food already started turning cold when they were served. We did not enjoy the meal and were very disappointed at the place. Their service, was actually pretty good."
"The Purple Pig is a fun venue with a vast menu featuring nose to tail cuisine with an emphasis on pig dishes. I had a bit of an adventure arriving at Purple Pig; there were mobs of people on Michigan Avenue with temporary metal gates erected and streets closed off. At first I thought the New York occupy Wall Street movement had relocated to Chicago's Michigan Avenue but it turned out to merely be some lights festival.I dined at Purple Pig with a friend and left the wife behind as I was in the mood for some adventurous foods and my wife is more the meat and potatoes type (in fairness there are some ""safe"" foods on the menu, so one does not need to be into exotic foods to be able to dine here). The menu is broken down into different categories such as antipasta, smears, cured meats, fried items, cheeses, from the grill etc. The dishes are small (i.e. tapas style) and it seems about three items per person is optimal for those with a moderate to hearty appetite. My friend and I shared our dishes and they were all consistently very good. My new favorite food is roasted bone marrow and Purple Pig's version was tasty, though a tad oversalted. The octopus was excellent and my favorite dish was the pig ears with a fried egg (who knew pig ears were so tasty)? I also had the sweet breads and, in keeping with the nose to tail cuisine theme a JLT (like a BLT, but in lieu of bacon there is meat from the jowl of a pig). Purple Pig is also known for good cheeses, so instead of dessert we shared a cheese plate; this also was excellent. We opted for the Truffle Tremor (a goat cheese), the Podda (similar to a Parmesan) and a cheddar. This was accompanied by a tasty homemade jam with a cinnamon aftertaste and some good toasted bread. About the only knock on the food was one of our courses had a hair in it and moments later the people sitting across from us complained to the server they had found hair in one of their dishes; aside from this the restaurant seemed clean, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that this is not a regular occurrence (and not part of the nose to tail theme). The Purple Pig has a fun, casual yet chic ambiance. It is a smallish venue set up with a European style (even the bathrooms are labelled WC as in Europe for wash closet, but fortunately you do not need to leave a Euro in a basket). All the beers and wine are from Europe. The beer list is nice, but a tad pricey (most beers run $8 or more). The wine list is vast, but also a bit expensive (most glasses run $10 and up). Though the alcohol is kind of pricey, the food is surprisingly inexpensive for the quality; Purple Pig is definitely deserving of their Bib Gourmand recognition from the Michelin man. The restaurant is on the noisy side, but not so loud as to render conversation difficult (unless you were to come here with a large party). Our tab for six dishes, three cheeses and three beers was just over $100 before tax and tip. Since space is at a premium, Purple Pig does have some communal seating; we opted for this as despite arriving just after 5:00pm the restaurant was hopping and there would already have been a wait for a private table (they unfortunately do not take reservations). We did not mind at all dining at a communal table and actually enjoyed the experience. Our server was fairly good, but since the venue is so busy you do not receive a lot of personal attention from the servers - though they are there when you need them. What was impressive is how efficient Purple Pig is; since it was so packed, and the kitchen is smallish,  I was expecting a long wait for food but it was delivered at a nice pace; not rushed, but no significant gaps between courses. There were many more dishes on the menu I would have liked to have tried (but was plenty full from those we sampled) so this in combination with the fun atmosphere definitely makes Purple Pig a venue I plan I would like to dine in again. I would encourage Purple Pig to join the ever growing list of Chicago restaurants on Open Table as that would really make things easier for a majority of your patrons, but all in all this was a very good dining experience and a place I highly recommend to anybody with a sophisticated palate and into consuming adventurous foods."
"Never in my wildest dreams would I think that one of the best meals I would eat in Chicago is a stew of black eyed peas, tripe and pig's feet.  After a freezing outing on one of Chicago's awesome water architectural tours I snuck into the Purple Pig to warm up and get some lunch. I couldn't have picked a better spot.  The food was hearty, hot and delicious.  The service was great and I enjoyed trying this new dish tremendously."
"OK ,now I know why Pig is in the name. You are squeezed in so tight it is like eating at a trough. Food is alright, I don't know what all the hoopla is about. Service leaves a lot to be desired. From the minute you sit down the main focus is to get you out. They bring your dishes and stand at your elbow asking you if you are finished. Finally, we told waiter to back off. People waiting for tables stand there looking at you like vultures for carrion. Would not go back or recommend."
"We came in to The Purple Pig around 3pm on a Tuesday (not the busiest time at a restaurant) and got seated right away. We were completely overwhelmed by how delicious everything on the menu looked! Their wine list was extremely extensive, though their beers were slightly underwhelming and a bit overpriced.Get the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta. Seriously, do it. It was so yummy... I could imagine it going really nicely as a sauce on pasta too. Also, I highly recommend the JTL: pork jowl, lettuce and tomato. Everything here is share plates and I did not want to share the JLT!Our server was pretty awkward, just sort of a strange guy. He didn't seem very comfortable doing his job but he mostly stayed out of the way. I also was spoken to kind of rudely while waiting in line for the bathroom (one of the servers was waiting to use the bathroom and I didn't see him there. When I tried the door handle he snapped at me, saying ""It's occupied. I'm WAITING."") While the service was a bit subpar, the food was too damn good not to give this place 5 stars!"
"My friend and I visited for the first time, yesterday. Totally didn't expect a 45 minute wait on a Monday night. But it was totally worth it. After consuming the Pigs ear, shoulder, and couple more parts, gotta say there is nothing bad to say. Even the service was awesome, quick and very friendly. Kudos guys, keep it up."
"Would be 4.5, but the high noise level and community seating can make it unpleasant to sit there for a while.  We were right in between two parties, so that may have made it worse than usual.  Therefore, I'd suggest asking for the end of one of the tables.  Aside from that, the pork shank and pig ear was delicious.  We went with the waiters rec on the meat and cheese plates which was spot on.  The doughnuts and Sicilian iris will make you overeat.  Service is great, the waiters really hustle"
"You want to go to here and put all of these things in you mouf!  But seriously, delicious and Azar is the best server.  A Chicago must on the eats list."
"Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- I love braised pork! It was my favorite dish. I just wanted to order 3 more, but I was trying to hold back. Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots- It was delicious!!!"
"Being a true  Self proclaimed ""foodie"" I was very excited  to try this place out.  Since they don't take reservations(ughhh) I arrived first , quotes of a 30-45 min wait.  Allen the bartender suggested a great Grenache for me..  NO CALIFORNIA OR ARGENTINIAN WINE!   So after a little snafu bringing our bottle to the table(got up to bar myself), the ordering commenced.   The waiter was very accommodating with food suggestions.    I only eat veggies n seafood.. Many many choices!  EVERYTHING was AMAZING!! Scallops were probably the best I've ever  had.  The sommelier came over to bring something to our table( super sweet)  and returned with the wine written down for us!!  GREAT SERVICE, FRESHEST FOOD, FAB WINE!!  Can't wait to go back!!!  Oh yeah reasonable prices!!"
"One of my favorite Chicago dining establishments--I've never had a bad visit.The fare is eclectic and interesting, and the 'small plates' style lets you try a lot of new things that you might not otherwise be able to try. Some of my recommendations:Bone Marrow - if you ever have considered trying marrow, this might be the place to do it. Their's is rich, buttery and decadent.Pork Neck-Bone Gravy - I know it sounds weird, but it's absolutely delicious. The meat  is 'meltaway' tender and the tomato-y sauce and ricotta complement it perfectly.Milk-braised Pork Shoulder - I've never had a more tender pork shoulder dish. For anyone who isn't quite as adventurous, this is a must get.It's no accident that all my favorite dishes are pork. It's called the purple PIG for a reason, and I think you have to try it at least once. They also have a fair number of meatless dishes, for you vegetarian types. The roasted Anaheim peppers with sea salt were great, for example."
"You must come here if you love pork.  It's smaller shared plates to share, so best to come with a big group. The pig ears were probably my favorite (although a tad spicy).  The milk braised pork shoulder is super tender and delicious.  We also go the marrow, which was good, not great.  The bones they give you are HUGE.  Enough to feed at least 10 people (although not enough bread and salad for all the marrow).  The brussel sprouts were pretty good too.Know going in that everything here is really rich, so plan on leaving stuffed."
"Cheese, wine, and swine. Minus the swine for me! This place is fab!After walking by here twice and loving the gate and the sign we went in. Holy smokes we were not let down!!What a great place!! The service was spectacular! The beets with goat cheese is to die for delish!! I cannot say enough great things about the purple pig. It will be a stop for me everytime I am in the Chicago area!!Keep up the great work!!"
"We got really lucky and walked in around 6:45 on a Saturday night and snagged the only two open seats at the bar. The wait was an hour and 45 minutes at that point...but if I would've known how great the food is, I would have waited every bit of that!The service was great, exactly what I'm looking for when I go out for a nice meal. Attentive but not overbearing, offered suggestions when we asked, and drinks were always filled.  The food - so good. We ordered the fried manchego cheese (delicious, the sauce is a little sweet) and the whipped feta with cucumber. Those were both amazing. We also ordered the JLT, which was salty and delicious and had a perfectly fried egg on top. Our last dish was the homemade chicken mortadella sausage, which had almost cinnamon-y undertones and had a salad alongside that complemented it perfectly. Overall, a great experience. I would go back to repeat some of the dishes and order the chicken thigh kebobs--the couple next to us ordered those and they looked awesome. To top it off, our tab was $57 for all four dishes plus a glass of wine. Granted, we could have spent more and really stuffed ourselves, but we were really full as it was. Must visit!"
Overpriced and Serrano ham portion was enough to feed a mouse. Bread (3 small pieces that came with ham & cheese plate was flavorless and very skimpy
"I'm not sure if I just failed at ordering here, but I felt the food was just okay.  Nothing excited me.- Split Brussel Sprout: 2 stars.  I noticed a lot of Yelpers talking about this dish, so I checked it out.  About the size of a cup of soup.  Meh.- Pig Ear: 3.5 stars.  The textures and are really delicious and interesting in this.  My favorite dish of the day.- Pork Neck Gravy with Ricotta: 2 stars.  Our server's recommendation, but it just seemed like a nice tomato sauce on buttered toast.  Skip it.- Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: 3 stars.  Meat was tender and moist, but this isn't anything you can't get at 100 other restaurants.  Definitely skimped on the mashed; not a good meat to mashed potato ratio.I wouldn't discourage you from visiting The Purple Pig, because I like that the plates are small and made to share, but come in with low expectations.  Then you might think everything tastes better."
"Other than that it is difficult to get a seat depending on the time of week the food here is truly outstanding. JLT, bone marrow, all of it is superb. Highly recommended."
"This was the best restaurant dining experience i have had in a very long time.  Excellent service, delicious & adventurous food, good wine, and reasonable prices.The dishes on the menu are all unique.  I had Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio for my appetizer and it was a revelation.  I struggled not to lick the bowl.  I will go back for that dish alone.  For my main I had the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with smashed potatoes and tzatziki.  It was also a delight I hope to repeat.Family-style seating on the patio added to the experience rather than impairing it as I expected. Wow."
"I was told this place was a must try place while I visited Chicago, so I gave it a try. I must say that it was pretty tasty. One of my favorite things I had was the roasted butternut squash with pumpkin seeds, brown butter and ricotta salata...A-mazing! The milk  braised pork shoulder was pretty tasty too, but just a little to plain/ordinary for my taste buds. The chorizo stuffed olive were not that great, all you tasted was olives. The scallops were pretty good too! Overall, the place was great! I will definitely go again when I'm in Chicago. I do recommend going right when they open or getting a reservation, otherwise the wait is forever long, but worth the try."
"I'm sure this restaurant would have been fantastic-- HAD I BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY EAT HERE. They don't take reservations, and for a place with all this hype you'd think they would have upgraded their space / figured out some sort of fix to help their never ending line of customers. We went to the restaurant and put our name in at approximately 6:15 on a Saturday. They estimated the wait to be an hour and a half to an hour forty-five. That sucks, but okay. So we give them our number and come back in an hour and a half, starving, without a phone call, to hopefully wait no more than a few more minutes to be seated. The hostess, rudely of course, informs us at this time it will be another 45 minutes because they're ""running behind"". OH RLY? We scoff out of there at the thought of waiting 2+ hours for a two-person table, considering we had plans later in the night that would run into our dinner excursion. We end up eating dinner at our hotel, and are called at approximately 9:20. That's over a 3 hour wait. That is ridiculous. Learn how to manage your restaurant, take reservations, or get a bigger place. Effing jeez."
"Seriously, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! Everything is so delicious and the atmosphere is phenomenon! There is nothing like it! The wine list is excellent but I personally love their version of the manhattan, one is simply not enough! The owner Jimmy is very friendly and so, so humble. He is always in the kitchen making sure everything is running smoothly and that everyone is happy. I've tried almost everything on the menu, and I love each one of the item but my favorites are the kale caesar salad, chicken kebab, bone marrow spread, and gosh so many other dishes! Can't even begin to name them all! This is definitely the place to check out! I cannot wait to go back!"
"Went here with a group of 6 the weekend before Christmas, and it was hands down one of the best experiences we had. Purple Pig has been reviewed almost 1500 times at this point, so other than saying that it is DEFINITELY worth your while, here are some brief points:- avoid the wait by getting there when it opens on a weekend. We showed up at 11:15 or so, and there was already a group of about 10 people in front of us. We were seated right away at one of the high top communal tables, and then about 3 seconds later the place was totally full. - let your server order for you. Seriously our waitress was the bomb. The only dish that got a less than 5 out of 5 was the calamari, but we still ate the whole thing.- have an open mind. They have unusual menu items that are totally delicious. And communal seating is their thing - go with it!"
"Don't come hungry to Purple Pig or you won't be able to sustain the very long wait and the sight and smell of their savory smears and various dishes pairing pork with bacon, with ham, with sausage, and/or any yummy combo possible will make your famished head spin.This place is famous for a reason. Its worth the hype. Curiously small and reasonably priced equates to it always being crowded. My last trip to Purple Pig was at 9:45Pm on a Tuesday night. Certainly, this off-hour would guarantee a free table. WRONG! We balked at the idea of a 30 minute wait in their ""waiting area"" aka a 10-ft space in front of the coat rack. Suddenly, the Purple Pig looked on us with favor and a party of three cancelled, so we hoisted ourselves up to the communal high top table.Our waiter was the best kind of waiter, one that is fun, friendly, and knows his food and drink. He knew exactly what pairings worked and helped us select a delicious under $40 red. Cool guy. Many Thanks!We just ordered two plates, but both were unexpectedly large and delicious. The Apple and Sunchoke salad was tart, fresh, and nutty. The Pork loin panini with bacon and pesto was more like two panino (plural of panini) and qualifies as ""heavenly ham."" We three little pigs did not want to leave this house. PS - I'm only withholding a star for that awful wait."
"even though this place doesn't take reservations and can be a bit of a wait as a result, it's worth it! we were actually told it would be 75 minutes at peak dinner time on a saturday night, but only ended up waiting about 45, so that was a nice surprise.the wine selection is absolutely insane, and if you aren't sure exactly what you're looking at, you're in pretty good hands. our server was very knowledgeable and was able to direct several members in our group to delicious wines based on others we said we liked.this place is NOT good for vegans/vegetarians, but if you're a carnivore, you should have no problems. my husband ordered a few of the sausages, which were great, but my favorite was the black cod that i picked. beet salad and brussels sprouts appetizers were also huge hits with our group.high price tag, but a fun excursion every once in a while."
"This place is amazing. It is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Great food, excellent service and surprisingly good prices. In fact when I took my father there, who was visiting from Michigan, he did a double take and told me we had to pay and get out fast before they realized they'd given us the wrong  bill. The joke was on him because it was definitely our bill.i love the atmosphere and the drinks, there are a couple dishes that are a little salty for my taste but other than that I can't say enough good things. I tell people all the time that they need to eat here or they are missing out. Three favorite things on the menu:Turkey Leg ConfitPork Liver PateSicillian IrisAlso do yourself a favor and drink the Estrella Damm Inedit with dinner. It will blow your mind to pieces in space!"
"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and a coworker. We were all pretty much blown away by the food. Knowing that they don't take reservations, we left work at 5 and arrived at the restaurant at 5:15. Even then it was packed, but we were able to get seated immediately. This is not a quiet restaurant and the tables are extremely close together, but if you can get past those negatives, the food is certainly worth it.Since the food is served tapas style, we ordered several small dishes for all of us to share: charred cauliflower, braised baby artichokes, a combination of cheeses, pork shoulder, turkey leg confit, scallops, and some kind of fish that is no longer on the menu. Everything was absolutely delicious with the exception of the scallops. Normally I love scallops, but these were skewered with whole lemon slices, which made the scallops themselves taste overwhelmingly like lemon. Personally, I'd rather taste the seafood. The pork shoulder was amazing and I don't even normally like pork.We skipped dessert since all the other food was pretty filling. One thing to note is that the dishes vary quite a bit in size (which our server warned us about). Some of them are like small appetizers, while others (such as the turkey leg) are the size of a whole meal. However, if you tell the server what you're thinking of ordering, they can advise you on whether it's too much food or not enough."
I was there few months back and was little disappointed. After reading great reviews on line I was expecting a lot more. Just good food 4 stars
"This place is fantastic!My relatives and I were in Chicago for the day and we decided to try out the Purple Pig, seeing as it had great reviews on yelp and it certainly did with reason. When we first walked onto the patio, there was already a crowd of people eating and waiting to be seated even though it was quite some time before when people usually have dinner. We were put on the waiting list and sat in the various couches they had placed for people waiting to be seated. My relatives were served wine, so that did make up for the 45 minute or so wait (the good thing about this place is that it is pretty much located on the Magnificent Mile, so it helped with passing the time for me and my aunt). After 45 minutes, we were finally seated at a high rise table. The waiter was a nice fella and helped us pour our water and also helped us order. We ended up getting: burrata pugliese, milk braised pork shoulder (everyone had been raving about it on here), roasted bone marrow with herbs, and the duck egg. I just want to start off by saying that the milk braised pork shoulder was the most tender thing I've ever eaten. The burrata pugliese was wonderful and probably the best cheese I've ever. I loved all the food here and wish that I can come back again some day.The downside of this place is the wait (hence the four stars), but that was understandable since the food here is absolutely amazing."
"Do I really need to write a recommendation for this delicious restaurant?  Probably not. But because this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, I would like to offer my favorite dishes.pig's ear with crispy kale:  although this may be a bit adventurous for some, it is worth it.  The salty flavor with a dash of lemon and the crispy kale is a perfect combination.pork neck bone rillette:  delicious!  As you may know, rillette comes in a mason jar.  This is one of my favorite rillettes in the city.   I've tried many and this one has amazing flavor and is plentiful.milk braised pork shoulder:  rich and delicious.  everyone will enjoy this dish.JLT pork jowl:  with each bite my eyes close so that I can bask in the savory flavor.  calamari:  I don't always order this dish but it's really good. It's refreshing and light so is a good balance to the richness of the other dishes.Decent dishes but not a regularly ordered item:deviled eggs:  good deviled eggs but they are just deviled eggs.meats and cheeses:  they have a good selection and they are very good.  I can get this anywhere though, so usually skip it unless someone at the table wants to try them.olive oil poached tuna:  I liked this better when it was served warm. They now serve it cold so some of the flavor escapes.bone marrow:  it's good but I've had better elsewhere.eggplant with goat cheese:   I liked it but other people I've been with did not.  It tastes just as it sounds - eggplant with goat cheese.  It's good but I make this at home so don't order it out.pork blade steak with honey:  it's okay but the milk-braised pork shoulder is better.A couple dishes to stay away from:paninis:  I've had better.  The aren't as bountiful with ingredients. It's mostly bread.proscuitto bread balls:  flavorlesschorizo olives:  just taste like ordinary olives.There are so many other items you can choose.pork chop:  very dry. I make this better at home.As you can see, I typically order the rich items.  I choose items that I can't make at home.  I usually balance my meal by ordering a salad or a veggie dish and of course wine.  You have several options of wine pours that you may choose from and a good selection, too.  I like the variety.It's walking distance from the theater district and is open late.  If you haven't tried this restaurant, please check it out.  You won't be disappointed."
"Easily the best meal I've had in Chicago so far.  Just a heads-up to expect a wait as they don't take reservations.  Went with a party of 4, 5 plates, 2 desserts, and a bottle of wine for $160, which I thought was very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.Fried Brussel Sprouts - A little over-salted, but good.   Wasn't as heavy as I imagined a fried dish to be and the lemon and thyme are good additions.Mussels - Great.Braised Pork - Probably the highlight of the meal.  The pork falls apart as you try to serve yourself.  Extremely flavorful, but watch out for excess fat.Chicken Kebabs - Loved the dark meat, loved the sauce, but the Smashed Potatoes were probably my favorite part of this dish.Wagyu Tips - On any other night, I would have loved this dish, but it was really just put to shame by all of the other dishes.Bread Pudding - I'm not a fan of bread pudding in general so I won't comment.  Tasted ok.Sicilian Iris - This is probably going on my must have if in Chicago list.  Just melt in your mouth goodness."
"Place was recommended by a specialty food/wine shop owner in the area. Food was underwhelming and the server and greeting/seating added a special and clear memory in my mind to never return and to not consider a recommendation from someone who ""knows the owner"" of a restaurant."
"Are you a lush? Love pig? If you answered yes as enthusiastically as I did, you will love The Purple Pig. They say it is thus named because when a pig drinks wine it turns purple. Mmmmm sounds delicious to me.First off I have to stress I loved our waitress Jill. We started off with our own wine pick, a Jacky Moulin-A-Vent Bojoulais. It was nice enough but nothing thrilling. She found us the best wine I have drank in a really damn long time, Furlan Castellrosi Cabernet Franc 2007. It was even slightly cheaper than the one we picked. Mmmmm we had two more bottles. Yes you are reading that correctly. I am sure no one is surprised I am a lush but my sister is a very bad influence indeed. I adore her.We started with a selection of cheeses and charcuterie. We wanted a good variety so we just went with a chef's selection. We had a bit of Blu di Bufala, Big Ed, Peccorino Noce, Camembert Fermier and Delice de Bourgogne for the cheeses. Our meats were Coppa, Jamon Serrato and the best Sopressata I have eaten. It was served up with toast (that they will give you more of if you are like us) and a little pot of a fruity chutney/jam-ish substance that worked with the soft cheeses particularly well.We moved on to some bread balls with prosciutto and escarole which were nice flavor but small. We also partook of some homemade Italian sausage with broccolini and tomatoes that was just awesome. Our bowl of mussels had lots of pancetta and creme fraiche and the marjoram really added a great dimension to what is normally a fairly standard thing.The star of the show was the milk braised pork shoulder. I thought it sounded boring but OMG, it reminded me of my Grandma's best pork dish. Shreddy and just melt in your mouth. The potatoes with gravy that came with were just incredible. Evillicious.I loved the setup here, it makes making friends easy. We met some totally fun men from Santa Fe (I believe, I was a lil bit drunk by then) who were just a wonderful addition to our party, Prada pants and all. By the end of the night we were hugging strangers and doing shots of orange vodka. No I am not normally like that...well maybe sometimes. At any rate if you go to Chicago you must visit The Purple Pig, Jill will hook you up and you will have great wine, swine and fun people with whom to dine."
"Wooo hooo. Finally made it here for a late lunch and it was really, really good. We started with a spanish cheese and some jamon serrano. We could have definitely skipped this as there were so many other awesome things, but we were starved and didn't want to wait for something to be cooked! I could live off bread and cheese, mmm mmm. The highs: The crispy pig ear with kale was highly recommended and it did not disappoint. It was salty, crunchy, and crispy and we were fighting over the last bite. The biggest bang for your buck is the panini. We thought there was a mistake as we got two sandwiches, but nope! Just a hearty portion! Also tried a duck dish, but it wasn't my favorite. I don't understand the people who were seated at the bar but waiting for a table. This place is tiny and the wait is crazy. It's communal sitting...the bar and the table are just about the same thing, eat there or move it!"
"Is the Purple Pig good?  Yes.  Is it good if you're a picky eater who eats only fried foods and chicken (like me)?  No.  So don't come here if you can't appreciate good food.  One of my friends mentioned that Purple Pig is about quality over quantity, and I agree.  Portions are ""family style"", but don't expect huge servings.Our party of 5 ordered:- Fried pig ear: HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  Crack the egg over, mix everything up, and eat with the veggies.. soooooo good..one of my faves, but that's bc it was fried :)- Bone marrow: scoop out the bone marrow, spread on bread, sprinkle the green thingy and salt on top.  Described as ""butter...on another level.""  Highly recommended.- Pork liver pate: our first dish, eat it with bread.  If you had to decide between this or the bone marrow, I'd pick bone marrow.- Pork shoulder: so good and juicy..def. recommend..just don't let it get cold- Octopus: highly recommended by the party next to us, and it was GOOD, just not as good as the other dishes we ordered- Pork jowl: SO GOOD..our waiter described it as something along the lines of Purple Pig doesn't serve bacon, but it's like bacon, except it's from the pork cheek.  The boys were skeptical, but I went ahead and ordered it anyways, and it was MELT-IN-YO-MOUTH delicious.  Seriously...hands down everybody's favorite.  Lesson learned: Girls are always right.  Lesson #2 learned: Always trust a Yelper.- Turkey leg: yummy, esp with the little crispy things on top.  It was good and is recommended, just not highly recommended.- Lemon panna cotta: described to me as a lemon creme brulee w/o the hard caramelized top.  It was good with just the right amount of tart/sweet.  (Note: my friends didn't eat this..just me!)In summary, you MUST get: fried pig ear, bone marrow, pork jowl.There's an extensive wine list, and I love the idea of communal-eating.  We met some friendly people from Cincinnati, OH (I think) who gave us their recs.  Trust what the waitstaff and your foodie neighbors tell you!  Great environment, great food, and great service.  5 stars!"
"My friend and I showed up on a whim, expecting a long wait, but were treated to two open bar seats immediately upon our arrival. Score!Then we ordered the ""pig platter"" charcuterie tray. Believe me, this is not for the faint of heart or spirit. We enjoyed every morsel of the charcuterie tray's diverse selection, ranging from delectable serrano and prosciutto to a variety of salamis and even tongue meat. It was nothing short of awesome.The service at the bar was great; we lacked for neither wine nor cocktails. There were other dishes that evening, mostly at the recommendation of fellow friendly bar patrons. They were all good, but the charcuterie tray is this place's raison d'etre."
"If you love pork and innovative, rich cuisine - this is the perfect place for you. Come early to avoid a wait, and you'll want to try as many dishes as possible so try to find a group of friends. The setting is warm and lively with lots of shared seating. The small plates design encourages sharing.Highlights: pig years, milk braised pork shoulder, brussel sprouts.Again, this is for those who love rich cuisine and for those willing to try anything. I found the food was unique and absolutely delicious."
Great service. Great price . Great foodIt is worth the wait. Food is under 20 and dozens of wines under 40. Try the bone marrow. Carnivore's paradise.
"Admittedly, everything we ordered tasted very good, but the general tone of the restaurant came across as unbelievably pretentious instead of lighthearted and fun, as ""cheese, swine, and wine"" might suggest. I don't think that menus should need glossaries, but 90% of the items on their menu required one or two wikipedia searches to figure out all of the ingredients. That being said, the milk-braised pork shoulder and the roasted cauliflower were both exceptional, and the kitchen staff is clearly very talented.Unfortunately, however, truly great restaurants require more than just great food. The most absurd detail here was the WC sign on the bathroom doors. I am all for fine dining, but there is no need for coldness or attitude."
"Sat at the bar and ate and drank our winter siesta away.  No really, we were walking back to the hotel to warm up and passed by here. Sit at the bar to get a great view of their open bar/kitchen. Staff was quick, knowledgable and friendly. Food and wine selections were abundant and tasty. Love the myth behind the name."
"I love this place. Although the wait times are insane and there is nowhere to stand while waiting, the food and wine is absolutely great. The butternut squash is a must! Servers know a TON about wine so don't be shy to ask!"
"This is one of the better restaurants on Mag Mile that isn't exorbitantly priced (not that it's cheap).  Great drinks, wine, and food.  I've liked everything I've ordered so far and will continue to go back."
"The Purple Pig has been on my radar for a while, just about a year I'd say. I was excited. The anticipation was killing me. My hunger was killing me. And ya know what else was killing me? The wait.The place is pretty much always packed, so prepare to wait. What's nice is that you have the opportunity to take in our fine city while waiting outside...that is, if it's not winter. Lucky for my fiancee, friend and I it was decent out...just a bit nippy. We wound up waiting like an hour, and were seated outside next to a couple heating lamps. Oh wells.Our server was nice and attentive, recommending dishes as we perused the menu. TPP's headline is ""Cheese, Swine, & Wine."" We opted out of the first and third, jumping into a number of swanky swine dishes. With that said, realize that much of the menu will be fried, salty, or savory. Don't be surprised when your swine comes out.Some highlights:I've gotta say that I thought I knew bone marrow...boy was I wrong. I've tried it a couple times and thought it was meh, but I think that's because I wasn't eating quality prepared bone marrow. So savory. Melts in your mouth.For being all about swine, TPP does chicken and red meat pretty well. Chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes were delish, as was the wagyu sirloin tip. I understand the Bib Gourmand love from the Michelin guide...kinda.Walking out, I felt a little hungry, and my pocket felt a little lighter than I'd hoped. I'm not sure how well this fits the Bib guidelines ($40 or less for 2 courses, glass of wine, and dessert).  Oh well, I'll probably be back to feast on some more swine (I'm still not comfortable using the word ""swine."")"
"We visited the restaurant on valentines day 2014 as a walkin.Pros: the food is awesome! Large selection of cheeses, charcuterie, beer, wine. The staff was outstanding.  The bartender was knowledgeable about the menu. The server (that took our order while we waited for a seat at the bar) was very polite and funny, even one of the busiest nights of the year.The interior design was modern traditional with Italian accents.(I don't know anything about design). Seating is mostly high tops with seating at the bar.The pricing was very reasonable. The music was current and energetic.Cons: no reservationsIt is located 1000 miles from where I live."
"Fantastic upscale restaurant just north of the loop in downtown Chicago.  On a Friday night at 5:30, the wait was an hour and a half, but the wait was completely worth it.  We ordered baby artichokes with potatoes, asiago and salami; calamari with fregula, radishes cucumbers and pistachio; and skate with beets and blood orange balsamic, which was amazing.  Their cheese selection was also relatively extensive.  Don't miss the lingua agrodolce, which is cured tongue that they make in-house.  Fantastic flavor, tender and a great flavor of beef mingled with sweet and sour notes.Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us lots of great recommendations based on our interests.Highly recommended, and worth the wait to get in!"
"Tapas galore -- the Purple Pig is the joint to be at if you want to stuff yourself with casual, unique, appetizing, fun and eclectic food! The food here is prepared fresh and you can taste it with every bite you take from the various dishes. The flavors are simple yet bold and each ingredient of the dish is highlighted very nicely. The flavor combinations, for the most part, worked together and had a great balance. Here's how I would rate the ones I tried: --Tuscan Kale & Romaine Caesar Salad With Hard Boiled Quail Egg - 3/5--Porchetta with Salsa Verde - 3.5/5--Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - 4.5/5--Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche & Marjoram - 4/5--Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - 4/5--Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - 3.5/5--Eggplant Parmesan Balls - 3/5"
We visited from London Ontario Canada for 5 days.  We went to some great restaurants however the Purple Pig was the best of the best.  We went to this place our first night and enjoyed it so much we went back on our last night
"Do:- Be adventurous and order the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.  It may take a few orders to get the mix right, but after a few tries I've mastered getting a bit of egg, ear and kale in almost every bite.  Delicious!-Order the Prosciutto Escarole Bread Balls.  These 5 bite size bread balls are fun and full of flavor.  More prosciutto than bread and a good value on the menu at $5.  -Try the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes.  It's a staple and one of my favorite dishes in Chicago.  The pork shoulder is extremely tender and the mashed potatoes are smooth and buttery.  -Sneak a seat for two during the week without the hassle as long as you're in by 11:45AM.  Don't:-Order too many small plates.  I've found that 3 small plates for two people is just right, especially if you're going to order some of the more intense and rich staples like the pork shoulder."
"Very cool and hip little wine bar right off Michigan avenue. The French inspired cuisine ( especially utilizing all parts of the pig) allows you to get as adventurous as you dare.  From Serrano to brains, hoofs and tongue. A very nice collection of cheeses, meats, appetizer sized dishes. A great place for a social outing. The even have ""social"" tables, where you sit with others....Very hip and trendy, but with a matching price tag.  Everything I tried was delicious!"
"I loved The Purple Pig! A chef friend told me to go when I came to Chicago and man, am I glad I did! We didn't want to risk the long wait for dinner since they don't take reservations, so we came for a late lunch/snack to hold us over for our dinner later. We got there around 4 and were seated right away, although the place was packed. Their menu concept is great, tapas style, with lots of small plates to share. My favorite way to eat! We decided on trying some jamon serrano, fried brussel sprouts, feta spread, and the turkey leg confit. Everything was amazing, but there were definitely some highlights. One of my favorites were the fried brussel sprouts- the best I've ever had BY FAR! This should be the only way that brussel sprouts are prepared...OMG. SO. GOOD. Another favorite was the turkey leg cooked confit. They cook the turkey leg slowly in pork fat...now if that isn't enough to convince you to try this dish, I don't know what is...I am currently thinking of ways to cook my thanksgiving turkey this way because I just don't know if I'll ever be able to have turkey any other way. It is served with this agradolce (not sure of spelling) sauce that cuts perfectly through all of the richness of the meat. The feta spread and serrano were good as well, but just didn't compare to the brussels or turkey. I would definitely recommend going here if you are coming to Chicago, it was phenomenal! I can't wait til next time I come back and can try even more!"
"Milk braised pork should and crispy fried beef tendons, OMG....no more needs to be said. So I am one of those people that hears beef tendons and goes yucky, but NOPE, I loved them so much I found the recipe on the internet, went to the 99 Ranch Market and attempted to make my own. No where near as good, but they will have to do....Oh yah and the panna cotta is amazing, as is the peanut butter semi-fredo. If I didn't live in LA, I would eat here at least a few times a month."
"If you like swine and wine then this is your place!  Must haves:  roasted bone marrow, charred cauliflower, & the osso bucco!  We tried the pig ear with kale, but a little on the salty side.  Great wine selections and customer service!!!"
"Service was good; I ordered the pig ear and octopus, and both dishes were very good."
"Tried to go several times but the wait was insane (2 hrs, 1.5 hrs, 2.5 hrs) and it was snowing & freezing cold in December! Finally we ordered takeout Monday at lunch. Minimal wait :) maybe because of the 5 min walk in the cold the food just didn't stay as it would have been served in the restaurant. The bone marrow was good but by itself it had no real flavor. I enjoy a French preparation of bone marrow and have had better marrow dishes. The caper, onion & cilantro accompaniment was delicious. I would eat that again on top of anything if I could! The bread was really tough and thickly sliced. I think marrow is best served on thin crunchy Melba toast. The other pork dishes were unremarkable. I guess to be fair I should give it another try dining in the restaurant but I won't be rushing back there. Too many places to try in Chicago first."
"This starts a weekend of foodie heaven and suicidal wallet in Chicago. The Purple Pig has it all: Trendy hip name that boasts delicious tapa-style food without the tie. Great location on Mag Mile with a private outdoor entrance of sorts where you can drink wine and watch the pretty people. Mysterious and foreign parts-of-pig that you don't dare...but DO dare...to eat. Finally, an extensive wine list to wash all that piggy love down. Milk braised pork shoulder is creamy and delicious. The chicken kebabs I was fine without. Definitely order the Pig's ear with fried egg, not because fried eggs make everything delicious and that warm, golden yolk is last years pork belly, but because it actually does go well together. I had a great meal here with great friends and conversation."
"The Purple Pig was definitely my FAVORITE restaurant when my boyfriend and I visited Chicago.  Decor is homey and unpretentious.  Dinner gets pretty busy but we were able to snag some seats at the bar being able to watch our food cooked in front of us.  Great wine list and unlike many wine bars where the food pales compared to their wine selection, the purple pig hit it out of the park.  Reading the menu, I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued by their interesting food combinations in their dishes and had a hard time choosing.  Watching the food come out, we deducted that the bone marrow and turkey leg confit were most popular- we ordered and were satisfied!  We also ordered the mussels, salad with quail egg and best of all their brioche dessert with ricotta and chocolate (OMG!)  Purple Pig makes me want to move to Chicago and I can't wait to visit again soon!"
"Delicious selection of small plates, especially the pork liver pate. Seriously the best I have ever tasted...smoky and rich! Great wine selection, too. We found some obscure selections that aren't typically served elsewhere. The ambiance is good but the notice level is way too loud for conversation. ""What did you say?"" We found a table right away (got there super early) but It quickly filled up."
"CHEESE. SWINE. WINE. I came. I ate. I drank. And I can't wait to go back!! Here's what our group of 4ordered (amongst numerous glasses of red wine)...*Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley*Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette*Prosciutto Escarole Bread Balls*Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio Smear*Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes *Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki*Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette*Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli*Cheese platter - Le Chevre Noir, Gouda, Truffle TremorYes we were hungry. After all of that, we opted out of trying the dessert. However, I will be returning. Personal favorite was the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. I've never had meat so good. No joke. The Wagyu Sirloin and the Chicken Kebabs are tied for 2nd place. I could have done without the Proscuitto Escarole Bread Balls. They were, eh, just okay. Nothing special, and nothing you couldn't find on a menu at a bar.A couple of downsides - they don't take reservations ((Buzzkill)) We still encountered an hour long wait for an early, 5:30pm dinner on a Saturday. But it was nice outside, and the waitress took drink orders, so we sat and waited. And drank. The restaurant is small and they get extremely busy, so if you don't see a dish come out, make sure you ask for it! We ordered a Purple Pig Platter (which I was sooo looking forward to) which never made it out. Boo. Oh well, next time."
"Had a flawless experience here!My boyfriend and I came in to have some food and wine while we were in Chicago visiting. We had a friendly greeting at the door. A wonderful and knowledgeable waiter who was beyond helpful in selecting some meal options. He was absolutely spot on in all of his recommendations. They had an extensive wine list with some great choices and a wonderful desert menu. And I just add, the bus boy was the most attentive and delightful I have ever had the pleasure to come across. He could have easily been a waiter himself. We had an assortment of meats and cheeses and some wonderful vegetable dishes. Desert was absolutely incredible! Could not more highly recommend a restaurant!"
"We must have gotten the shift change at the bar, because we were immediately seated, and didn't even have a wait!  I really enjoy the atmosphere here, it's very loud and you can easily get lost in your own conversation or thoughts and not feel self conscious at all.The food was quite good, we had a couple of the smear items: pate and a mortadella dish.  In addition, we had the quail.  The pate was amazing, though I love that stuff anyway.  The quail was good, but the surrounding sides and accompaniments were the real star of that dish.The only thing keeping this place from a higher rating was the service.  Our bartender seemed distracted, and not too attentive to us, though I'm not sure what she was doing otherwise.  And, while I know the place is small, there was an employee drying glasses about 2 feet in front of us the entire time, very awkward.  There has got to be a different place to dry glasses that isn't within my personal space.I'd recommend this place for a glass of wine (or three) and some appetizer type dishes, you probably won't get too full on the servings provided, and it would be quite expensive to do so anyway."
"Came here for some early wine and cheese with my friend while shopping.  Really good wine selection, I choose a greek white wine and my friend choose an italian white.  Both high quality.The kitchen seemed a little backed up with getting our order out, but the service was very nice about it and we did eventually get our food.The cheese was good, but the highlight for me was the side of  soft honey covered dates and raisins which tasted amazing with the cheese.Super crowded though, a bit of a wait for a table mid-day on fri, 35min but worth it.  If i came back, I'd definitely have a reservation. Would have liked to try more of the wine and food."
"Pretty good. The food was very flavorful and the staff was great. Purple Pig serves very pork heavy items and it is tapas style so you can try a bunch of stuff. Price)- Obviously pretty pricey, but the taste and quality of food is very goodQuality)- As I just mentioned, it is very good. This is what we got:Bone Marrow Smear- very delectable, but our friends didn't like the texture. Forget them, how often do you get to eat marrow out of a bone?Braised baby artichokes- very meatyProsciutto Escarole Bread Balls- Like a better corn bread ballPig's Ear with Crispy Kale- One of my favoritesCured Meat Platter- Interesting, but I would have rather just gotten another main thing than cold meatsMilk Braised Pork Shoulder- One of the heavier items so you'll feel fullerJLT - My favorite- Duck egg was a nice touchQuantity) It's tapas so you get small plates meant for sharingAtmosphere) A small place that looks like it seats about 70 people. Very rustic.Staff)- Very accommodatingEmbrace the wait"
"This place definitely lives up to the hype.  Everything we ordered was ridiculously delicious and our waitress, Jill, is awesome (in my eyes, she's set the bar for waitstaff that deserve to be tipped 20% haha so ask for her if you come here).  She gave amazing recommendations for wine and food, and never pushed us to buy more or pick something we wouldn't enjoy.  Like most other reviews, I would highly recommend the Pig's Ear and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  Save room for the Sicilian Iris for dessert!Try to get here several hours early to place your name on the list since they don't take reservations and it takes a long time to get a table.  They'll call you when the table is ready."
"Came here right before the lunch rush and my Nana and I appeared to be a few of the only people here. Once we sat down in the outdoor area and had a chance to look at the menu we had an extremely difficult time choosing what to order (because everything looked sooo good). Finally, (with a little help from the waiter we made a decision) we choose on the Pork Neck Gravy with Ricotta Smear and the Stuffed Squid. The Pork Gravy appeared to be more of a rich tomato sauce with that amazing pork neck and grilled bread to soak it all up. The Stuffed Squid was tender and was stuffed with breadcrumbs and pancetta. It was also paired with a fava bean puree that had squid ink in it to give it a black color. We were lucky to arrive before it got really busy and after our meal our waitress was nice to let me meet and talk to the chef. She also gave me a complimentary Purple Pig bandana. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone for good food and an awesome time."
"Came because of the hype, even more so since our hotel was down the street as well.  Location of the restaurant is great, right around the heart of downtown Chicago.  The menu items were full of variety.  We ordered quite the assortment of dishes.  Service is good, but I just felt that the food was a tad bit salty.  Definitely a place to try, but don't think I will be coming back when venturing back to Chicago."
"I was on vacation and came here because of yelp. I have to say, this place feels like a tourist trap being on Michigan Ave. We waited 30 minutes even though there were few tables available for two. It was unoccupied for the duration of the whole time while we were waiting. Finally being seated in one of them after 30 minutes. The food here can be summed up with one word: SALTY. everything I ordered feels like i am eating the same dish since salt is the only thing that I can taste. being Chinese, I have eaten a lot of salty food, however, this is far too salty then to my acceptable tolerance. It is pretty bad when the pig ear I ordered came out to be a bunch of fried crumbs tasting like the oil that it was bathed in."
"Stopped by here for a late dinner on a recent trip to Chicago. We got here around 10 PM and were seated right away. The ambiance is great, the menu has a great selection, and the wine list was impressive. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and really knew the menu well. He ended up picking the cheeses for our table and made some fine choices. For a party of 4, the meat platter with the choice of 3 cheeses, plus 4 dishes to share was plenty. I highly recommend the:- Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde;- Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes; and- Turkey leg confit, crispy lentils, treviso, endive, and agrodolce. Just keep in mind that they don't take reservations, so if you're looking to have dinner during peak times, be prepared for a long wait. Definitely recommended if you're visiting Chicago!"
"Great fun. I managed to slip in after only a fifteen minute wait when traveling by myself, otherwise not sure it would have been worth the usual 1-3 hours. Had a darling waitress who made great reccs. Highlight of the meal were the out of this world salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese. A dark velvety wine from Croatia and peppermint affogato were solid to good. I would pass next time on the kale with fried pigs ears and peppers, unless they up the ratio of kale to crispy meat nubbins to make it less overwhelmingly salty."
"Came here during our visit to Chicago couple of weeks back...  due to lots of good Yelp reviews... Drinks--awesome, I had the sage infused cocktail and it was amazing!! Food was also really good.. the only thing I found as an issue  was the amount of salt being used in their dishes... e.thing we had seemed a bit salty! so if they can keep an eye on the level of sodium in their dishes I think its a 5 star experience... will def go back if I visit Chicago again!"
"To quote a friend, ""Why are the portions so small for gourmet food?"" I don't know. But The Purple Pig isn't exactly gourmet... Still, I felt like we ordered a lot of food.We started out with the carrot, avocado & fennel salad with citrus vinaigrette. It was okay. The carrots were a bit mushy for me... I prefer my carrots slightly crunchy. Then we had the roasted bone marrow with herbs. Mmm. Delicious. You should have seen the way my friend sucked the juice out of the bone marrow afterwards -- she's so Chinese / Asian! Hahaha. The presentation could put off some people. But to me, it was fine. I loved it. It was soft and mushy and full of fat and juicy... Delicious. Loved it on the bread. Sprinkle it with a dash of salt and add the onions and cilantro on top. One of my favorite dishes of the night.Next, we had the pig's tails braised in balsamic. I didn't like this one very much. Too much balsamic vinegar. I think it took away the pork flavor. Strange enough, the tail wasn't a curly thing as I had imagined. Those children's books lied to us!!We wanted more food so we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder. It came sitting on top of mashed potatoes. This was my other favorite dish of the night. The meat was so, so, so tender. I was still hungry afterwards, so we ordered the pork liver pate. After this, I was like ""No more. I want to go home."" The pate wasn't as great as I'd have prefer. I think the French and Vietnamese make better pate (for the Vietnamese sandwiches). I'd have wanted a duck pate instead.I was really excited to try this restaurant out when I saw it on the Hot on Yelp list (and it's really close to my work place). But I was a little disappointed. First with the communal tables because I hadn't expected that. And then with the food itself. I mean, I only liked 2 dishes out of all the ones we've ordered! Luckily everything was divided among three and even with a bottle of white wine that priced at $49, the bill came out to be approximately $97 without tip. So it was a decent splurge."
"Had a very late dinner at the Purple Pig. Arrived after 1030pm had about a 10 minute wait and seated at a communal table. Service was fast and very good, it's a very busy place. Ordered the crispy pig ears, YUM! The combination of the flavors and textures was delicious, my favorite dish of the night. Also ordered, the bone marrow, it was okay. We had the last Bone Marrow order of the evening (after 11pm) so maybe that's why. It was overcooked and couldn't really spread on the bread. We also had the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, YUM! The pork was flavorful and tender and was complimented by the mashed potatoes and gravy, and I can't stand gravy but loved this dish!  All 3 plates were shared by my husband and I and we were stuffed! Will definitely go back next time when I'm in Chicago."
"This place is fantastic well worth the 1 hour wait we had to endure!We started out with the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic, Salt & vinegar Beef tendons and the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Everything was amazing the bone marrow was like butter the beef tendons were out of this world. For the main course I had the Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs which I highly recommend my companions had the JLT and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes which were amazing as well.The staff is amazing and very helpful with the menu.."
"this place is ridiculous ... everything i've tried is amazing. basically sit down, randomly point at items on the menu, enjoy.just don't try to get in there on thu-sat night ... 2-3 hours of wait."
"I am really happy with our dishes today. We went a little after the regular lunch time and snagged two empty seats easily on a Wednesday. The waiter was very helpful in giving food suggestions.We ended up ordering:- the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder which was juicy, tender and delicious.- calamari with couscous and cucumbers and pistachios, it was tasty and fresh- mussels, the sauce was delicious, but i wish we had more bread to dip it in because it ended up being leftover- pig bone marrow, a 'must' and never tried it before so it was pleasantly yummy! - lemon panna cotta pudding dessert which was refreshing the candied pistachios were delicious! I shared it tapas style and it was a great priced meal! I can't wait to try more desserts and appetizers next time!"
"This has been on my ""to do"" list since it opened, and my husband finally treated me to a Valentine's lunch here (well, the day after!).  We arrived right as they were opening and got a great two person table.  The restaurant quickly filled up to capacity.  Our server was busy but helpful when asked.  The other staff was very attentive and kept our table cleared when dishes were finished and kept our water glasses full. I was in lunch heaven:  bone marrow, pigs ear, milk pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, and wagyu sirloin tip.  Everything was amazing!  The bone marrow was my favorite, as it was such a stunning indulgence.  I loved the little pieces of toast that were served with it.  The wagyu sirloin was amazing with potatoes, onions, and olives was an amazing and addictive combination.  The mild braised pork shoulder was so tender and delicious, my husband's favorite.  Can't wait to enjoy it again soon.We finished off with a donut for dessert, which is not on the menu.  Lovely finale to a great meal!This is a fun place, and I cannot wait to go back!!!"
"I cannot emphasize enough how awesome The Purple Pig was for me and my five fellow swine-loving friends.For a quick trip to Chicagoland, we stumbled across TPP and was recommended by a fellow Yelper who checked it out a few months prior.We were still thawing out from watching the game at Wrigley Field when we arrived and were in need of warm shelter, perfectly aged vino and what else...some pig!We showed up a little after 9:00 p.m. and was told our group of six will have a half hour wait.  After ten minutes, Darma came out and told us our table was ready. Awesome!Although we were two short from being a bunch (some of us went back to our nearby hotel to put stuff away thinking we'd have to wait the full thirty minutes), she still seated us and we carefully listened to her; it was like listening to a beautiful poem of what's good on their menu since we were all Purple Pig virgins.  Just listening to Darma speak makes you want to order everything she recommended on the menu. I think we did just that too.We got situated on one half of the communal table behind the hostess stand and I noticed that our food and wine came out quick.  I'm usually not a fan of gamay rogue wines, but I was surprised at how it complimented the dishes we indulged in.From what I can remember, we ordered pig ears with crispy kale and a fried egg, two orders of bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, chicken thigh kebabs, sirloin tip and a couple of desserts recommended by Darma.Five stars for all the yummy food.  Five stars for the great experience and if I can give ten stars to Darma, I would.  She really went out of her way to make our Chicago experience a great one.  Thanks Purple Pig, I really hope restaurateur, Scott Harris decides to open one up here in San Diego for us swine lovers to enjoy!"
I'm giving The Purple Pig 1 star because the person who cleaned our table wouldn't return my phone I had left on the counter.
In town at a conference a couple of months ago and wanted something delicious. Stopped in on a Wednesday night right at dinner time - packed with folks spilling out the door.  Ordinarily my flight response would have kicked in but the smell wafting around the place convinced me to stay. The woman at the front suggested I try to snag a seat at the butcher bar instead of wait an hour plus for a table for one.  Within 10 minutes I had a prime seat at the prep station. So much goodness right in front of my face.  I had the beets+goat cheese dish that was presented like an ice cream sundae. Cute. And sweet. Followed by the legendary cauliflower dish and eggplant parm balls. I finished with fried dough dipped in cinnamon + honey.  So freaking good.  Jeez. It took all my restraint and home training not to take pictures of my food but trust - presentation and taste were on point.  Well deserved reputation.
"Dishes are quite unique.. A bit disappointing, as the dishes are small, too salty. The 1.5 hour wait was just so not worth it.. For the meal, We had to sit outside under the canopy, and it was quite cold that I developed a headache due to the cold.. Waiters are nice but too busy.. I won't go back again.. This place is overrated"
"We've been here twice, and both times I think the food was awesome. The only complaint I had was the seating--too crowded. The first time we went there, we ordered Sardines and Pig's Ear with kale for appetizer. Pig's ear was good but sardines were a bit too strong. Then we tried the Purple Pig Platter. All the cured meats were delicious, but my favorite was the Jamon Serrano, which was the duck meat and had very strong taste. I think my BF's fav was the Salami. We also had the Pork Neck Bone Rillette. It was presented in a glass jar, easy on the eyes and better in your mouth. The meat melts in your mouth, coupled with the fat and the bread, it was delish. The second time, after reading all the reviews on their Bone Marrow smear, we decided to give it a try. I think the breads were what made it yummy. We also ordered Pork Blade Steak and some duck egg with Serrano on a bread, both of which were very unique and delectable. Although after the whole meal, we felt like we were overloaded on the bread. All in all, it was a solid 4 and we will definitely go back."
"I've been there at every trip I take to Chicago. Every dish is just amazing. The wait times are definitely worth it (1 - 1.5 hours on a weekend night), but if you want to shorten it to a 15-minute wait try going in the afternoon for a late lunch."
Five stars because its something different than your regular run of the mill cuisine. I enjoyed the ambiance and creative dishes. Don't go on weekend if you mind long waits
I am head over heels in love with this place. I was in Chicago for 4 days and visited the Purple Pig 3 times. I was able to try many things on the menu and the cheese and meat board/selections are AMAZING! JTL and pork neck were phenomenal! I am so excited to go back! I have recommended this place to any friends traveling to Chicago and they have all loved it as well. A must try or must return type of place!Delicious doesn't even begin to cover it!
"Amazing place!  I've walked by this place numerous nights and it always seems packed.  I saddled up at the bar fast, bu it took me a while to figure out what I was going to order as the menu is packed with interesting and great sounding dishes.  I ordered the Tuscan Kale & Romaine Caesar Salad WithSoft Boiled Quail Egg and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and asked the bartender to reco a red - she know both dishes and her wine.  The service, food and drink were all excellent!  Because the dishes are meant to be shared I'd say it's great for groups ...as long as you have a reservation."
"Really 2.5 stars.It's tough to write an unbiased review of Purple Pig because of the ridiculous wait to get in.  I'll submit that the food here really is fantastic.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  However, as many other Yelpers say, the wait to sit down here is unconscionable.We waited THREE HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES to sit down after we gave the hostess our names.  I don't think we were the only ones who waited a while to sit, as none of the other patrons seated in our area looked happy.  They looked tired, frustrated, and quite frankly, seemed as though they just wanted to get dinner over with and leave.  I can't say I felt much differently. Like I said, the food here is excellent, but the wait is unbearable.  Management should really do something to remedy this issue (ever hear of reservations!?)  I probably won't be back."
Yummy!! This place was my first food stop while in Chicago. Had a couple of firsts here like roasted bone marrow and crispy fried pig ears. I enjoy the tapas style of eating. Definitely a place I would love to go to again if I am ever in Chicago again.
"Came here based on Yelper recommendations. Found the idea of being able to eat many parts of a pig in an American restaurant interesting but wished it stayed as a novelty idea. Ordered  fried Brussels sprouts, roasted bone marrow with herbs, pork tripe with skin, pork shoulder with mashed potato, and Wagyu beef sirloin. Found most of the dishes were too salty but the Wagyu beef was succulent and the pork shoulder was tasty. Decided to leave it as a 4-star for the novelty."
"Wow, how have I not written a review about one of my favorite restaurants in the US and for sure my favorite in Chicago?!  I have been here at least a dozen times and have not yet had a bad experience or meal.  The milk braised pork shoulder, while nothing earth shattering in the originality department, is out of this world good! Menu changes semi-seasonally and the food is consistently excellent so feel free to really explore the day's offerings. Other than the food, I also like that this place has a really interesting wine list from all over the world (hello Greek wine?).  The servers are usually pretty good with their recommendations and they very rarely try to sell yo on the most expensive bottle of wine on the list.  I've actually been recommended plenty of $25 bottles here that went great with the food! Desserts are nothing to shake a stick at either, this summer it was The Purple Pig's salted caramel ice cream that inspired my dining companion to get an ice cream maker of her own and to ""make ice cream from everything.""  Yeah, it was that good. The only drawback about this place is that they don't take reservations and it is VERY popular and it gets VERY crowded from about 6-9pm. Best way to be seated quickly is to go with just one other person (or by yourself) and hover around the bar area.  If you do go with a group of 4 or more you can expect to wait up to an hour for a table. On the bright side, the staff is always more than willing to pass you a bottle of wine and a few glasses over the bar which you can then take outside to enjoy on the patio, which is a really civilized place to wait for a table in the summertime (assuming it's not raining). OH! One more thing, the best seats in the house are definitely at the bar, hover and try to grab one of those if you can!"
"Cheese, swine, and wine?  And open late?  PERFECT!!!  The service here surpasses many of the Michelin star restaurants I've eaten at recently.  We arrived around 11pm and the place was still humming.  We quickly perused the menu for items that would satisfy our after-baseball-late-night hunger.* Salted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette - what a smashing combination of flavors!  It was my favorite dish of the evening.  The texture of the beets, that hint of salt coupled with the power of the goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette just put my palate in heaven.  * Chorizo Stuffed Olives - my least favorite dish.  This was the second time I've had fried olives and I'm not that fond of it.  However, I will say that this dish was still decent as they used high quality olives.  * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - wow, the meat is so tender that you don't even need a fork to eat it with.  You can eat  it with a spoon.  It was rich and slightly overpowering but the mashed potatoes carried just the right balance to offset the power of the meat & sauce.  * Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic - okay, I know some of you are reading this and saying pig's tails....seriously?  Yes, you seriously have to try this dish!!  It is awesome.  Beyond awesome.  They ran out of the pig's ears so we opted to try this and boy was I surprised at how good it was.  I've had pig's ears before at another restaurant and I know how fabulous it can be but this was my first try at pig's tails.  You wouldn't even know it was pig's tails.  The texture and taste were like pork belly.  A marvelous dish!* Burratta - a exceptional cheese dish.  They used good quality cheese with a nice texture and the plating was lovely.* Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - this was a lick every last drop off the plate dish!!!  Small toasted pieces of bread that you can smear with luscious, salty goodness!  I will say that it's not the best roasted bone marrow dish I've had but it rates a strong 9.  Wow!!!* Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes, & Salsa Verde - I'm a big fan of octopus because they make it so well in Spain.  They cooked the octopus perfectly but perhaps I just like my octopus the Spanish way.....perfectly cooked and seasoned with salt and a little paprika.  Sometimes certain dishes are better when they are prepared the simple way."
"pig pig pig pig pigOn the guys food trip, this was the final stop for me.  We previously tried coming here the night before but it was 2hour wait.  2 HOUR!  So we came first thing in the morning when it opened on Sunday and got a table quickly.  We were seated in the tented (yet heated) area in the larger communal table.  It is more fun talking to random people next to you btw. Food, was amazing.  Pictures itself don't do it justice, but I love eating all things that will probably give me a heart attack.  We almost ordered everything on the menu (seriously).Parking: We parked on the street somewhere (meter) so either have someone running back and forth or go find a garage to park at so you can enjoy your pig.Service: Very friendly (even if they aren't your waiter/waitress), gave lots of suggestions for food and drinks especially for first timers."
"This was my first visit and I met a friend for lunch during the week.  I was excited  to eat at the Purple Pig after reading such great reviews in the paper.I had no idea what to expect and didn't know it was a tapas-style restaurant.I had to wait to be seated because my friend was not there yet.  I put my name in and took a seat outside, by the river (they provide extra seating, which was nice).Once my friend arrived, we were seated outside right away.Our waitress came by immediately to ask us if we had been there and explained the menu.  She took our drink order, but they were slow in arriving (a coke & water).Plus, she forgot my lemons until my 2nd request.For lunch, we split the roasted beets.  We ordered them without goat cheese.  They were delicious.Food was good, but I'm not into all the swine dishes that they serve.  Give me bacon & I'm happy enough.The scenery is wonderful outdoors when weather is nice.People love this place, but it's not my thing.I would go back just to try it again."
"I had a lot of reservations about going to a restaurant that serves mostly pork dishes. But my husband convinced me to go because of the razor clam on the menu. We've been on at least 5 restaurants prior on the hunt for this ""treasure"", and still we weren't successful! The server said the clam was gone... which was disappointing. Thankfully, we got plenty reasons to stay - even with the 1.5 hour wait! Most favorite dish? The bone marrow, hands down. You take a fresh piece of toasted bread, spread some of the buttery marrow on top, then garnish it with the capers/onion/cilantro trifecta and sprinkle with freshly grinded sea salt. The result? Magnifico! Second on our list? The pig ear. I believe the secret to this dish lies on the combination between the texture and taste of the crunchy pig ears, fried kale and sunny side up egg. I would have given a 5-star, except for the fact that these dishes are HEAVY. You walk out of the restaurant feeling very ""porky"". But, if you do feel like piggin' out tonight (literally), then The Purple Pig is the place to be :)"
"The food was ok. Nothing amazing to me.This place is crowded and doesn't have much elbow room.The reason I have 2 stars though is because of the service. I couldn't believe how long we had to wait for a menu, the food, the water, and the 4 pieces of toasts we requested (for the bone marrow spread)!!! We were notified over and over it would only take a minute. I took 15 minutes! Then it took forever for the server to let us know if we could eat our cupcakes at the table... We almost ate it there because it took so long but thank goodness we didn't because we would have been charged $2 a cupcake. The worst is when it took them forever to get us the bill. The wait time is ridiculous and we were only a party of 2. I can't believe I was still in a good enough mood to tip her well over 20%."
"We had very high expectations for this place, and we weren't disappointed.  We just missed the first seating on Sunday, and had to wait about 40 minutes.  Be prepared to wait for up to an  hour and a half, but they will call your cell phone so you can shop while you wait.  We chose to wait outside and a waitress came along and took a drink order.  We ordered a signature drink (the spicy one) which made our wait quite enjoyable. Once seated we ordered the almonds appetizer, delicious but too many for two; deep fried pigs ear and kale...excellent; fried deviled egg, also excellent and not at all greasy. Then we shared a main dish, some kind of steak, which my husband enjoyed more than me...mostly because I was just full. We ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were also delicious.  Food is delivered as it is prepared.  We had no trouble with the wait time, but I imagine if we were in the first seating, there could have been a longer wait since every table was full in a matter of minutes.  Can't wait to go back."
"I have no complaint whatsoever about how tiny the restaurant is or how long the wait is. I gladly took a walk down and up Michigan Ave, and before I realized, time to eat!peas with bacon - not on the menu any more but very delish.octopus with green beans and potatoes - very nice and tender octopus. The salsa verde really compliments the octopus well with its citrus fragrance and the peppers kick.roasted bone marrow with herbs - I grew up eating bone marrow, no joke. Cantonese people love making soups out of big bones and we'd suck on the bones for the bone marrow, which is believed to be highly nutritious. So in my memory, there is no way bone marrow would not taste good. This dish is a bit of a let-down because of my familiarity with the food. If you have never tried bone marrow, you should give it a try. The consistency and almost buttery flavor of the bone marrow are so unique you would appreciate that there is complimentary bread and salt. Essentially it is like a spread now that I think more about it... rather expensive spread, that is.milk braised pork shoulders with mash potatoes - yum yum yum!!! I really enjoyed the combination of almost-melt-in-your-mouth pork with perfectly prepared mash potatoes. I'd order two of these if I were to go there now on a chilly November night...Sicilian iris - FRIED DONUT WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND RICOTTA. Need I say more? I do actually. If my opinions matter, I'd suggest that they try this with sweet red bean paste instead of chocolate chips. That'd be perfection.After dinner, of course we took on a mandatory walk down and up Michigan Ave. to burn all those calories. A strategically positioned restaurant for both itself and the stores I must say..."
"Fun and interesting place to eat! I've been here a couple times and have never been disappointed with the food. The reason I don't give it five stars is that there is always a long wait, it is impossible to talk to the hostess who is right by the door where everyone is either standing or walking in/out, and if you sit outside when it is raining the roof leaks on the people sitting at the tables near the tents walls. But back to food - the pork shoulder is a must, the sandwich with pig heart is actually amazing and the heart is so tender that you will never know it's heart, and the bone marrow is a good salty snack. I would not recommend pig's ear. The pork secreto was just okay - but maybe I had too high of expectations because the waiter kept raving about the salad that came with it which ended up being disappointing."
"Overall, I give 8 out of 10 for The Purple Pig. First, I waited for an hour to get a seat. They will give you a call when the table is ready. However, I was not satisfied about my table because it was near the door and the waitress did not ask if we were ok with it or not. We ordered grill chicken, calamari, tuscon kyle salad. I recommend grill chicken and calamari. They put new concepts into foods that you can have a new experience. However, I dont think their food impressive me. The price is a little overprice."
"The Purple Pig was such a wonderful treat! The portion sizes were perfect, the service was spot-on, but most importantly, the taste was luscious.  We started off with the cheese plate which was the perfect introduction to The Purple Pig.  Cheese, bread, and jam, oh my!  The cheese melted like butter and tasted like heaven when combined with the spread. I felt like I was eating breakfast at night! For entrees, my husband and I shared the Wagyu sirloin with fingerling potatoes and the mussels with pancetta.  The Wagyu was prepared and seasoned perfectly, but the potatoes were my favorite part.  They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and they were seasoned with parsley which completely developed the flavor.  Yummy! The mussels were on the small-side, but the broth packed a punch that made up for their humble size.  To top it off, the flavors, service, and ambience were priced just right!Things to know before you go --  It seemed pretty crowded, but  we went on a Monday night and we were able to get immediate seating at the bar.  Yay!  Also, The Purple Pig only serves Mediterranean wines.  So, if you have a favorite wine that is not European, just ask your server for an appropriate substitution."
"My party of four waited almost three hours when we went on a Saturday night. It was worth the wait, though--the food was amazing. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the turkey leg for the last couple of days.Other awesome things we shared:- Fried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- Roasted Bone Marrow Smear with Herbs- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & ApricotsMy suggestion? Be prepared to wait and come hungry. You're unlikely to be disappointed."
"I had tried to go here Memorial Day weekend of 2011. We had a large group of 10, and it would have been an 3 hour wait. So I came back in December of 2012 with just me and my boyfriend, with only an hour wait. We had a drink at the Hancock Tower until our table was ready.I wasn't a fan of the long communal tables, with high bar seats. I had trouble on where to put my purse and sitting on my long coat, that kept touching the floor.Food wise, most things were pretty good. Here is a breakdown of what we ordered:- Milk braised pork shoulder: The description said it came with mashed potatoes, but I felt like the potatoes were too smushy at the bottom of the dish. The meat itself was very tender and moist, but a bit too salty.- Bone marrow: My first time eating bone marrow, so I had to psych myself out and not think about it. It was a nice meat jelly/butter, and the extra salt I sprinkled on it helped bring out the flavor. I couldn't eat too much of it, because it got too rich.- JLT sandwich: I was excited to try this dish, but I think I didn't eat it fast enough, because the fat in the jowl started to solidify and I couldn't finish it. Still pretty tasty.- Assortment of cheese and meats: My bf is all about cheese and he loved the 2 that we tried (can't remember which ones). I also ordered some prociutto di parma, and it made me reminisce about my trip to Italy. I'd wanted to give this place a 5, but the minor details listed above (solidified jowl fat, over-salted shoulder, awkward seating) warrant it a 4."
Awesome menu.  Literally everything is good.  Been there multiple times.  You may have to wait a while to be seated since the place is small but packs a BIG TASTE.  Well worth the wait!  Order a few things and you won't be disappointed.  Pork-chop is notable.
"Before making the trip to Chicago I researched this place as well as many others. Time and time again I kept coming back to The Purple Pig and decided to check the place out while we were on The Mile doing some shopping. All I can say is that it's worth the trip. We were seated quickly (even with the place being a little busy). It's definitely not a tourist trap ( thank god ) and they're wine selection is great! The service was awesome repeat AWESOME! The two ladies were very helpful , fast , answered questions and sincere. That's really all you can ask for when going out if you want my opinion. The food came out at a reasonable time and everything was made to order. There is only two cons that I can think of, and that would be table size and space. Other than that this place is one that  you'll need to check out. It's definitely a place to take your significant other or  clients for a drink after a day of meetings.We will definitely be back again. Thanks guys!"
"The Purple Pig suffers from being in a tourist pocket, but it still keeps it's tiny euro bistro/american Indy vibe despite this. It's a small plate menu - and you'll want at least 2 to yourself.  We shared the neck gravy in red sauce with ricotta and I scarfed down the braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  Both dishes were excellent. My friends had the calamari and the olives stuffed with chorizo.  I ordered the fried sardines with fennel salad sort of as dessert.  It was bomb.  $6 glasses of wine and damn good tapas.Good lookin' staff - most with tattoos."
"It's very solid comfort food..  Since my friend is vegetarian, our food was a bit more limited (no marrow, etc etc).   Still, we had a fun time eating almost the entire appetizer that was veggie friendly.   Really like the squash, eggplant balls, beets with goat cheese....  dessert was awesome (some donut like thing).   All in all, great service, excellent food, and excellent location."
Wonderful!!! Such great food!!!!
"Came here with a few girlfriends for brunch on a Sunday. It wasn't overly crowded, but it did take a while to be seated. The wait staff was not very friendly, did not spend time with us and was slow with dishes (in comparison to other tables, so it prob wasn't the kitchen). Anyhow, we tried a variety of items, including the pig's ear, artichokes and rabbit. Everything was on the salty side and actually didn't have that much of the main ingredient (e.g., the pig's ear was in small bits and mostly fried). Even the bloody mary's were sooooo salty, it was hard to take down. I will not be back and am classifying this as a tourist trap."
"I look forward to going back. We tried A LOT of different items, everything was very good."
"In my opinion, dining doesn't get much better, or more interesting than this.Don't bother with the wait, grab the first open seat at the bar if you see one! Watching the chefs cook makes you appreciate their dedication. As full as we were, everything they kept bringing out just continued to make us drool.We tried the following:1. bone marrow - 4.5/5, a definite MUST try. It's a little trippy that cooked bone marrow looks and has texture exactly like fat, but smear that badboy on top of the bread, add some cilantro, capers, and a hint of sea salt and it just tastes badass!2. pork shoulder - 5/5. Um, perfectly cooked tender pork that melts in your mouth. Served over creamy mashed potatoes and light gravy. Everything just kinda harmonizes perfectly. And the portion is perfect, not enough to weigh you down with food coma.3. iris - 3.5/5. This is basically like an inside-out donut. While I have to say that the chocolate inside is excellent, I just didn't love this dessert... and I usually LOVE dessert. Still worth a try though, because I've never had this elsewhere.4. pork ear - 4/5. The first couple bites of this was excellent. It was definitely the right way to start our meal with this terrific appetizer. However, with each passing bite, it just seemed to get saltier and saltier. The picked jalapenos offered a great contrast, but again, it started getting a little annoying towards the end. This is the one time that'd I'm actually advocating smaller portions. It'd be a great idea to split this 4-5 ways.And... although I didn't order this, I have to say that their TURKEY LEG looks ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR. It's probably enough to feed 3, so it's not the best if your goal's to sample different things. Nevertheless, I'm definitely ordering that next time I go back!In summary, this place puts all other tapas places to SHAME! Definitely making this my go-to tapas place from now on :)"
"The food is great. Atmosphere is great. Beware the wait, and order adventurously!!!!"
"Nice modern cuisine with small plates best shared.  If you want a simple formula for how much to order, go with the following: Per 2 people= 3 cheese selection, 1 salad, 1 smear, 2 a la Plancha. That should leave you filled and happy. Cheeses: Went with the Delice de Bourgogne, Truffle Tremor, and Podda. The Delice is a French cow's milk cheese very similar to a soft bree. It's really rich and creamy and was an excellent choice as our soft yet flavorful cheese. The Truffle Tremor was my favorite. It's earthy yet absolutely smooth. Just a nice mix of truffle thrown into a goat milk cheese. Last but not least, we wanted a hard so we went with the Podda.  Basically a straight up dry and Caramel-ly cheese. At the end of the meal, we were glad we had gotten the 3 cheese selection along with the dishes. Brussels Sprouts: I wasn't too excited about ordering this dish, but was glad we did. Basically the brussels sprouts were finely shaved(they probably used a Mandoline) and then pancetta cheese was mixed in with it. Pretty simple, yet flavorful dish. Ricotta & Pork Neck Gravy: This was probably my favorite dish. It's almost like a tomato marinara sauce mixed with a flavorful ricotta and really tender pork neck. I didn't know what to expect when it was under the ""Smears"" section, but was glad we went with this. If you've tried the marrow, go with this one the 2nd time through. Italian Sausage: This was supposedly the chef's sausage dish. It had a lot of flavor, as do most sausage dishes(considering fat content) but it wasn't really anything special for me. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: This was my second favorite and it seems to be a hit with almost everyone who comes through Purple Pig. It's basically a very tender braised pork shoulder paired with mashed potatoes. Honestly, i would have liked to see this dish with something not as starchy, but it's still really good. Maybe the chefs could pair this with some quinoa?Overall great meal. Would come back again."
DOPE
Wow
warm...
Lost its way..... Was a fun place to hang out with great wine and cheese but now is a victim of their own success.  The place seems to be on the list of must visit places in every newspaper and magazine that has a story about Chicago.I've never seen so many xmass sweaters and people having 'I'll just have a water' at 9pm on a sat night. They need to establish a local following for long tern success.
"Food:Fried pig ears with crispy kale was very delicious. Don't be afraid to try this dish especially if you already have tried head cheese. it was a little hard to eat with forks--call me asian but  would have prefered using chopsticks with this dish. The combination of crisphy kale, salty fried pig ears and sour pepperoncis worked very well together.Pork liver and toasted bread:Fresh pate is always good. This would have been better if the bread wasn't so greasy with butter to begin with. I would have preferred plain toast in order to really taste the pate.Calamari:Delicious-especially for those who like anything tart, lemony or sour.  I was expecting it to be fried like most places, but it was nothing like I expected to be. Mussels: This was my favorite of the tapas ordered. Coconut milk and I think curry was used in this dish. Those two flavors are great especially with mussels. it was served with chopped onions, celery and the best part, bits of bacon! yum! It added a great salty flavor to the dish. I found myself digging for all the goodies in the bowl of juice so don't waste it! Use your bread and dip away.Service:Very attentive staff. Very helpful when asked about any menu item."
"OOoooOOoo I love meat and beer! This place had both! I happened upon the Purple Pig while walking down Michigan Ave; it had just started raining a little harder, and I was anxious to duck for cover somewhere.  Before I came to Chicago, a housemate of mine had raved about the Purple Pig, and I was quite surprised to have found it without looking. I had a pleasant, warm experience. I was able to sit at the bar as the lunch rush must have just ended. It was raining anyway, so the place wasn't packed, but it was still quite full.  The wooden walls and high ceiling give the little place a bit of a cabin-like feel, and the seating arrangement makes it so that you're brushing elbows with perfect strangers.  I was straining to eavesdrop on the guy a seat over, who seemed to be having a deep conversation about beer with the knowledgable bartender.  I personally ordered a glass of Nora, and Egyptian styled one that was quite interesting.  I also ordered a plate of milk-braised pork shoulder.  I figured I ought to order pig if I'm going to be at the Purple Pig. There were so many interesting things on the menu, though! I had to pull up a dictionary to identify some of the animal parts highlighted. Thank god. I might have been eating innards, otherwise. (I have an aversion to innards) My food was sooo good, though ideally, I'd have a dining partner to share with.  One chunk of pork shoulder for one person was a tad much in terms of sodium, but it tasted great for what it was. The dish ended up being a hunk of meat that easily breaks apart, covered with gravy, and placed on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes.  Mmm.... While not huge, it was enough to fill me up for a reasonable price. Hopefully I'll make it back here the next time I'm in Chi-Town!"
"Tucked away from MiAve, this place is a gem. Interesting small plates, creative ingredients combined in ways you would not have thought up yourself. Very rich ingredients compliment the wine and beer selection available. Nicely decorated interior and creative menu placement makes this place a unique establishment too."
"This place is super crowded during the dinner crowd, you actually end up sitting next to people you dont even know...  The food is almost like tapas style... we ordered a bunch of things on the menu, shaved brussel sprouts, pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder, bone marrow and razor clams.The brussel sprouts were okay, they were a bit over powered by the cheese they used.  The pig ears were nice and crispy with the kale was delicious!  The bone marrow was pure gluttony, but also yummy.  The razor clams were my first time so I dont really know what to expect but they were simple and clean tasting.  The item that takes the cake at this restaurant has to be the milk braised pork shoulder!  Wow this dish was AMAZING!I would just got back and order the pork shoulder alone!"
"I wish I could live inside of this restaurant.We were told the wait was 45 minutes and were seated within 20.  It was a nice day out though, so we didn't mind waiting.  We were seated at the end of one of the large communal tables inside.  The place was SLAMMED for lunch, but never felt overwhelming.  In the two hours we spent there it never got less crowded...and once we got our food we knew why.We started with a selection of meats and cheeses and a little wine.  Everything was fresh, crisp, and so flavorful.  I could have spread the jelly they served with it on everything for the rest of my life.  We were hungry still after that (obviously) so amongst the three of us we had an order of calamari, the panini, and the squid salad (I dont think thats what it was called).  I have never had such a fantastic lunch.  Although the portions were on the smaller side we were anything but unsatisfied.  The flavors, textures, temperatures, and presentation of all the dishes were nothing less than fantastic.  We sat at our table for awhile after we ate simply because the energy in the room was so fantastic.  Some people may not like bellying up next to ""strangers"" for a meal...but I think a room full of new people pairs beautifully with a top notch meal.  This is not a restaurant, it is...an experience."
"I honestly cannot figure why this place wouldn't get a consistent 5 stars!  ITS AMAZING!This is the second time I've been.  This past Friday night, since it was my birthday, my friends said we could go anywhere and I chose Purple Pig.  We got there a little later so we were told it was a 3 hour wait (which we only waited about an hour and half).  By the time we sat down, they were all a little peevish because they were so hungry but by the end of the meal everyone unanimously agreed that the food was SO worth the wait!!!!!We rolled ours eyes and ""mmmmmed"" and ""aahhhhhed"" through the whole meal. We shared everything.  I can't remember everything we got, but I've found that the best way to order is to ask your waiter what they recommend.  I've never been steered wrong!  We started with a few appetizers and then we had 3 main courses, the turkey leg, the chicken kabobs and the lamb.  We didn't even talk we were so in love with what was in our mouths.Then came dessert........They way they sit you inside the restaurant is at long community tables so you're sitting next to someone.  We were sitting next to this couple and by the end of the meal she told us that they were ordering based on our reactions to the food.  When we got to the dessert she said that it reminded her of that scene in When Harry Met Sally -- ""I'll have what she's having.....""  Oh My Word!!!!  We got the lemon panne cota as I love love love panne cota -- amazing!  We also had the nutella, banana and marshmallow sandwich (weird sounding but good - but not our favorite from our trio of sweets).  AND THEN!  I had been sitting looking at a menu above my head the whole meal and when I read the description, I had had had to get it..... it was called the Sicilian Iris.  AAAAHHHHHHHH!  We were literally fighting over the last bites.  Its this beignet type thing stuffed with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips.  I can't even explain the taste.YOU HAVE TO GO - YOU HAVE TO TRY WHAT THE WAITER RECOMMENDS - YOU HAVE HAVE HAVE TO HAVE THE SICILIAN IRIS!PURPLE PIG - I am SO proud that you're in Chicago!!!!!!!!"
"Every bite of food earns 5 StarsBut... Dining spaces fall off to between a 1 & 2 Stars- Inside is overly warm and humid because tables and open kitchen share small  space.- Outside tented with periodic drifts of nearby plumbing (Look forward to opened walls that come with warmer weather)- Both spaces are congested and loudThe wait for a top restaurant, not taking reservations is 4 Stars- About 45 - 90 minutes- Will call you when your table is ready... AND hold it for 15 minutes, allowing you to shop nearby Michigan Ave while passing the timeIn-spite of the atmosphere, the food will have me back often.The fresh peas app amazing, the charred cauliflower will make raving fans of  a veggie scowling diner. Milk braised pork, melts in your mouth.Wine List, 4 Stars for good variety and valueStaff, 4 Stars for balancing a hectic pace with personalized interaction... though sometimes too busy to be proactive.In-spite of how busy it was... it didn't feel chaotic and we never felt pushed so our table could be turned."
"This place is like Girl and the Goat: overrated.I've been here a couple of times for brunch/lunch and tried a bunch of the dishes. The Turkey Leg Confit crispy lentils, treviso, endive & agro dolce was super filling but a bit too salty and greasy - maybe I shouldn't have eaten an entire turkey leg by myself? The butternut squash had too much cheese. The Jowl, Grilled Asparagus oyster mushrooms & fried duck egg was probably my favorite. I don't remember what else I've had, but I haven't been impressed by anything. Maybe I just need to try the famous bone marrow?Service is sub-par - I'm a slow eater and it always feels like they're trying to rush me and clear my plates away. And the communal seating is super uncomfortable."
"Was in Chicago with the family and had dinner here with my wife. Food was amazing, the bone marrow was out if this world. Love it love it love it"
Melt in your mouth delicious with excellent service.
"Meh... I don't know what all the hype is about. It's a loud, crowded place where you need eat at a common table. I've ordered what everyone is going crazy about in their reviews: the bone marrow and milk braised pork shoulder. And while the shoulder dish is absolutely fantastic and melts in your mouth, the bone marrow is pretty much some fat with oily toasts which priced at $14. I must say that the food is of good quality, and the staff is very friendly and attentive. 3 stars - no more or less. This place is ok, but overpriced and overhyped. I guess try it, if you absolutely have to, but you can find a better restaurant in the area."
"I think I'm going to get mobbed for giving this place 3 stars but first ... hear me out.Despite it's great ratings and high profile as one of the best new restaurants of 2010, The Purple Pig honestly doesn't actually offer that much if you think about it. Most wine spots have a great selection of cheese already (they had almost 10) and a great selection of wine. But of course with a title like ""Wine, Swine & Cheese"" most people come here for the swine.We got the bone marrow, the waygu slider, the milk braised pork shoulder and a cold dish to share. Despite what little food it was (since its all in tapas form) we were extremely overfull with how greasy everything was. The bone marrow, to be expected but the toast they gave us was DRENCHED in butter. Literally there was butter dripping onto the plate the whole time ...Then their infamous milk braised pork shoulder was incredibly heavy with the mashed potato it was served with almost 80% butter and 20% potatoes from a box (or that was the texture anyway ...). I felt like the place was over hyped because none of the dishes were spectacular, and if you cook everything in butter that's just kind of cheating. I went away feeling very greasy and kind of gross despite the fact that the pork shoulder itself was very tender. In the end I didn't think this place had anything special to offer. Yes it's a quaint, cute wine bar with tapas, but there's plenty of those. There's nothing that distinguishes this place from any other place except for its liberal application of butter. Seriously, I do not want a heart attack."
"I'm so glad I'm only a metaphorical (foodie) piggy, or else I would definitely be scared of this place! Randomly spotted this restaurant as Liz K. and I were walking Michigan Avenue. When we entered, I definitely knew this would live up to its name. We weren't that hungry, so we ordered the following:Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons and Parsley- SO delicious! It was pretty salty, but I loved that the charr brought new flavor to the cauliflower. I definitely have never enjoyed the usually bland veggie than I have at Purple Pig!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- My friend said that it was ""life changing""...it was definitely delicious! The pork was seriously the most moist, pull-apart goodness that I have ever had. I'll never look at pork the same ever again :)Props for an affordable price point. College-wallet friendly yes!The service was super amazing. Our waitress checked in on us often and was very friendly and genuine. 25% tip for you!Need a break from all that walking/spending your cash? Step into The Purple Pig for a bit, and you won't be disappointed :)"
Beating a dead horse here but this place was delicious.  I like the community seating and the wait staff even though slammed were very attentive.  I will agree that things were just a tad too salty but I do not add salt to anything so I am starting to get used to it just being that way in most restaurants.
"This was one my most memorable meals in Chicago and I would have ate here every day if it wasn't for my extensive ""to try"" list I needed to conquer.  Ignore the wait and crowded bar and focus on the food!Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula - 4/5  The meat was seasoned perfectly and still tender and juicy.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - 5/5  WOW!  The shoulder was braised to perfection and so tender and flavorful.Berkshire Pork Chop, Fava Bean - Greek Yogurt Salata & Horta - 5/5  You can really taste the salted brine!  A perfect pink center.. superb! ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - 3/5  Way too salty.Sicilian Iris - 5/5  This is what deep fried clouds in heaven taste like!"
My boyfriend took me here for my first time last night and every thing was great! We had an amazing bottle of wine for an unbelievable price and very tasty small plates! Love the social tables where you get seated with different parties but large enough table where you don't feel cramped an can still have a semi private conversation. All in all great time : )
Food is great but NO RESERVATIONS and long waits plus no splitting checks is not the way to run a modern restaurant.
"What a find. Loved the place, didn't have to wait long, even though the place was packed. We got adventurous, tried the fried pigs ear, a bit too salty for our taste, bordering inedible. liver pate was good. bone marrow was so filling, very greasy, what do expect from marrow, i thought it needed a bit more greens to cut the richness of the marrow, jlt was good and messy with the egg on top. they have a nice wine selection and different sizes for a luncheon. happy we stumbled upon this gem."
"The Purple Pig definitely lives up to the hype.  Julie, our waitress was awesome and gave us amazing recommendations for wine and food. Everything is served in small plates to share. The olive bowl with bread was super.  The tomato antipast, mussels and the braised pork shoulder with gravy were absolutely delicious and for dessert we had affogato - Mmmmmm. Since they don't take reservations it is wise to get a couple of hours early to place your name on the list. It takes a long time to get a table but tons of shopping to do while waiting for your table.  In the summer, they have a beautiful open area with full bar service where you can wait. Food wise everything had great flavor and prices were reasonable."
"3 dishes that will blow your mind..  Crispy pigs ears with crispy kale and fried egg, milk braised pork shoulder and pigs tails braised in balsamic ( think ox tails but rich).   I will keep coming back."
"Awesome, awesome, awesome! The highlight of my Chicago trip.Order:Beets and goat cheese with pistachio vinaigreitteMilk braised pork shoulderA glass of white chablisThe portions may be tiny for all those food but as my waitress said, ""It's big on the flavor."" Not mentioning that I DISLIKE cheese (but I cleaned the plate till it's spotless)."
"The food was good, but it wasn't worth a 4 hour long wait. And it was so busy that you hardly got any sort of service."
Ok so I travel a LOT and run into tons of different restaurants all across America. The Purple Pig is one the most creative most flavorful restaurants I've ever been to. The only other restaurant ive been to that has the same creativity and caliber of taste would be Star Noodle in Maui. Start your experience with the Pig ear Kale salad with fried egg- very impressive!
This place seems to ALWAYS be packed from what I can tell. They have a super extensive listing of wines. We got some really light and flavourful cheese and the fired pigs ears. So totally delicious. The cocktails are pretty good too although its a much smaller selection than the wine.
"We went here on valentine's day. The wait was about an hour, but worth it. The ambiance was very casual. We sat at this table with many other unknown food lovers. We had conversations across the table, with people suggesting their favorites. The butternut squash in brown butter was to die for. I went mostly for their vegetarian options (most people come here for their meat) but I was still very impressed."
"Fantastic food and atmosphere.  However, respectfully decline any offers to sit under their tent when it's raining as water gets in between the building wall and the tent.  Don't let the two $$ fool you, it's more like $$$ unless you eat pigmy portions normally."
"Our first meal in Chicago was at The Purple Pig and boy was it a great way to kick off our vacation!  Let's jump right in with what we ordered and what I would recommend as must-haves:-Pork Liver Pate-Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs-Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes-The Purple Pig's version of the Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato open-faced sandwich (I forget the name and it's not listed on the online menu as of 9/18/2011)This is a tapa-style place where most of the plates are smaller and meant to be shared.  With that said, we happily devoured the food listed above and I would highly recommend... ALL OF THEM!  Bone Marrow is not for everyone, but if this is something you enjoy then get ready for a memorable palate (and artery-clogging) experience. Our server was incredibly helpful and patient as she talked us through their mouth-watering menu.  Everything came out pipping out and The Boyfriend and I made our Moms proud by not leaving a crumb behind.Tip: we made a gamble by not making reservations, but we showed up at 5pm on a Sunday night and were seated ooohhh, right away.  Happy eating!"
"All this time I  thought I was not cut from the epicurious cloth. I squeal at the thought of eating someone's flesh off their bones; I can't even stand the thought of liver, a common protein to many Americans. But something inside me told me I needed to experience The Purple Pig, and so I did on a day I felt most daring... and after a glass of wine or two to lower those inhibitions.As it turns out, I love sweetbreads! Crispy, crunchy little nuggets of deliciousness they are. And scooched around in that apricot sauce? Devine. I had more than my share. It was the highlight of a five (small) plate dinner. From there it was a little downhill for me, I'm sorry to say. The fried deviled egg was just that, a whole egg with a liquidy center, deep fried. I see the point of deep frying a deviled egg, we do it simply because we want to see if we can. It's like Twinkies and Oreos, a little ridiculous, but hey! It's America, and we can fry if we want to. Unfortunately this appetizer would be better left off the menu.  The pig ears were actually my second favorite on the dinner, save for the fact that they were so incredibly salty. Sliced and then, there it is again, deep fried, these slivers of ear have a wonderful taste if you can power through the sodium overload. The bone marrow was our last course before dessert and the smell emitting from the bones was almost too much for me. Have you ever gone a little too long without using lemons or a cleaner to deoderize your garbage disposal? That, friends, is the stench wafting from those bones. I was a champ and  tried it anyway, and I can't say I'm a fan of the texture, though I in no way hold that against PG, that's a personal taste I just don't possess. The intriguing dinner was capped off by two of the most delicious desserts I have had in a long while. Lemon and pistachio panna cotta, with sharp zings of lemon cooled by refreshing and light custard. And the nutty, chocolatey gelato they served  that tasted like a Ferraro Roche. Superb.A few other tidbits: PG has an excellent wine list and you can buy by the glass, the half bottle, or full. They also have very tightly-packed communal seating, and a few tables and chairs, so plan accordingly. The wait is tremendous, so be prepared. Reservations are only for eight or more in a party."
"Tried the Bone Marrow for the first time--not so fancy as expected. On the other hand, the mussel stew and the broccoli/ cauliflower dish were EXCEPTIONALLY amazing.There is usually a long waiting line but if you have a smaller party sitting at the bar sounds like a good idea."
"Yes, please.  Needing some dinner of course and not cooking for ourselves half the time, my friends and I went to Purple Pig for the first time.  We knew the wait would be long perhaps, but somehow we got seats at the bar area even though the place was pretty crowded.  Inside of course the place is pretty nice.  Modern, casual, but nice.  We all ordered some good, small plates and dishes, none of which were bad at all.  My favorites were probably the Serrano and the Bone Marrow smear.  Really, don't even get me started on Bone Marrow.  That stuff was so good, and even served out of the bone.  Great stuff!  The Tuna appetizer was good too, but nothing amazing.Looking for dessert, the guy behind the bar recommended the Iris and said it was amazing.  I texted Ryne D and asked him too and he said it was the best dessert he's had in Chicago.  Well, it was very very good, although I wouldn't call it the best in town.  Maybe top 5 for me, but still up there.  It has ricotta in it, which was a great touch!Really, this place is pretty great and I plan on coming back more.  Very good!"
"Book reservations for this Michigan Avenue bar slash pig eating place.  The seating is a little awkward, but when you eat some of the food will fall on the floor and these tall chairs discourage you from picking up your droppings.I had a french country ale, serrano ham, and some new friends, sort-of, from Kankakee.  I also shared and had dessert and short ribs.So when we left my wife was in the bathroom and I got the evil eye from the new people who were seated just seated next to me.  It was like I had to leave too!  Whatever, I maybe would suggest off hours if you don't want to wait, have reservations or deal with lots of people."
"Literally, it is restaurants like these that make me want to live in Chicago. I could literally eat here ALL THE TIME. My friend raved about this place and took me here to eat dinner. When we went though, we had to wait all 3 hours that we were told, and I was almost getting hangry 'cause well, I would never wait 3 hours to eat somewhere if I'm really hungry. Granted, I realized, that it was all worth it in the end. Everything we ordered was really good: -pork neck bone smear: it tastes like marinara sauce, but ... REALLY REALLY good marinara sauce. it's much more rich and just tastes amazing with the bread that is given with it. -milk braised pork shoulder: can I just say oh my god? literally melts and dissolves in your mouth and it's just sooooooo good. It is kind of on the heavier/saltier side of dishes but the portions here are small enough that it wasn't overwhelming at all. MUST ORDER. -BLT(?): sjafkljalfjsl;a this was ALSO REALLY good. It's kind of a spin off on a BLT sandwich/eggs benedict but with pork belly. oh mah gerddd, it was also really really amazing. not too heavy and it has this pesto-like spread and arugula that just balances everything out. ALSO MUST ORDER. -wagyu beef: It was good, but just good. (compared to all the other stuff we ordered) Honestly, it just tasted like any other sliced steak I've had before, there's really nothing special to it, but then again, maybe it didn't taste as good 'cause i was already full at this point. I also ordered a cosmopolitan. WARNING: THEIR DRINKS ARE REALLY REALLY REALLY STRONG. like come on, a cosmopolitan is supposed to be one of those fruity girly drinks, but no, every sip that I took of their cosmopolitan literally felt like I was taking a shot. For sure was tipsy by the end of dinner, but luckily, my tolerance didn't get me drunk. Of course, it depends on your liking, and I do think it was worth my money, but was way too strong for me to just be sipping on during dinner in my opinionAll in all, if I was rich enough, I would fly back to Chicago just to eat here again."
Fantastic food. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Right in the midst of downtown ChicagoThe few items we tried which were all great included: -Chorizo Stuffed Olives: so unique!-JLT with fried egg: a welcome spin on the blt-Mussels: not as exceptional as the other items but still good-Beets w goat cheese
"I can't even begin to describe to you how happy I was to stumble upon The Purple Pig. Everything about this restaurant made me feel like I was right back in San Francisco. It's such a cute restaurant and a very unique dining experience. It's on the small side with an outdoor dining area. It's family style seating with long, large tables and it's very intimate. Excellent decor and great service and our waiter was so fun and helpful. We tried so many dishes, mostly pork obviously, and they were all excellent. We also had a killer assortment of cheeses and wines that were the icing on the cake. Not only is there a great selection of wines there is also a nice selection of specialty cocktails. The tapas, drinks and casual cozy vibe definitely make this an unexpectedly sexy place.If you are in Chicago you need to go to this restaurant."
"I need to come back here for dinner.I met up with friends for a happy hour. The drinks were good and the appetizers were delicious.TRY: pork fried almonds, the meatball, all meats and cheeses because c'mon."
"The Purple Pig is the embodiment of the holy trinity of cheese, wine and swine....When it comes to TV shows reviewing restaurants it can sometimes look staged and well, very much like a paid advertisement. So, when I saw the tail end of a clip of The Purple Pig on one of those food TV shows I was skeptical but intrigued to the point I said ""the next time I am in Chicago I will check it out."" Funny how life works because color me pink I found myself in Chicago this week.Not to say that I am a pessimistic New Yorker; maybe I am a little snobbish because I do live in the city known for being the crossroads of the world of fashion, culture, finance, beauty and food. Coupled with the fact that I live on the upper West-side where there are an abundance of great restaurants - large and small. Pessimistic no. A realist with high expectations when it comes to all things service, food and fashion? Hell yes.Let me say this...if The Purple Pig was in NYC...folks here would be lined up around the corner for days on end. This place is absolutely off the hook. The portions are sized perfectly to share and the prices range from $5 to $23. So, you can eat like a pig (no pun intended) and not break the bank. Don't even get me started on the selection of wines. Its freakin amazing! How do I explain amazing in a way one can understand? Try this...not only did I find myself eating everything on the plate but I was trying to find a way to be able to lick the crumbs that fell off the plate and onto the counter without looking like -- dare I say? A pig.So, if you like cheese, wine and swine and don't want to break the bank.... run do not walk to The Purple Pig."
"GO, It is seriously delicious and surprising!Heavenly Pig, Tapas style, very Chill environment, Fun, Loud, Let your hair down and eat sorta place.Very Smart and Friendly staff, the food is really worth it and youll dream about it later....You'll leave happy. Bon Appetit."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you Purple Pig!  On my recent trip to Chicago I finally had a chance to check out the PP.  I took it as a great sign when there was a 20 minute wait around 1:30PM on a Saturday, I had no issues waiting especially after taking a peek of what was on other diner's plates.We went with the heirloom tomatoes tossed with raw corn and pesto.  This dish is simple, effective and delicious!  Next came the milk braised pork shoulder.  Again, very delicious.  Finally we got to the pork neck gravy w/ ricotta.  The theme continued, all very tasty.  Really good service, great wine list and cool ambiance.  The only negative here is if you need to wash your hands or use the restroom, you're going to wait around 15-20 minutes.  It's just busy and the bathroom lines reflect that.I'll definitely be back!"
"Way overpriced and overrated. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty delicious and tasty but the fact that we had to wait for about an hour to be seated in a communal seating table(Thank goodness we got to sit outside until it started raining). They have a large selection of wines which I of course took advantage of. The bone marrow was yummy and probably my favorite. I honestly can't even remember what we ordered from a year ago but I know the portions were small like tapas style and at the end we were still hungry. It was too crowded and I didn't like how casual it was for the prices. People would walk in with shorts and flip flops while I came in a cute dress and heels.  I also had to shimmy my way through to the restroom. At least I got to try this place at least once but unless I was making bank I'd go there a lot. Since I don't, it's not worth it for me."
"I was finally able to make it to the Purple Pig for lunch with some colleagues in from out of town for a conference. It was the perfect spot to go on Michigan Ave. Good food, really pleasant service and a nice atmosphere. My out of town folks were thoroughly impressed. I wasn't crazy about the salt roasted beets but I could have eaten about a dozen fried deviled eggs. We had a nicely dressed salad along with the very hearty pork neck gravy. I would definitely be back."
We did a date night here and everything we had was delicious. I will say to try to get here early because we went around 5:30 to grab a bite before a movie and the place was already packed. It was just my boyfriend and I so imagine it could be a nightmare with a group. Our favorites were the oxtail and the octopus.
"If it was socially acceptable to eat at the same restaurant every day, this would be in the consideration list. I travel to Chicago for work once a month, and this place is one of the highlights.  Great way to eat: communal tables, small plates, great wine and beer list and amazing food.  I know the star is pork, but make sure you make room for the vegetables.  The cauliflower and asparagus salad are both great."
"Reasonably priced tapas.  Place is a zoo even on a Tuesday at 5:30PM, but really delivers on quality and pushes the envelop of traditional tapas and serves a refined version of the Spanish small plates.  Obviously heavy on the pork offerings, but seafood eaters can also find some very satisfying options.  The fried sardines and the octopus a la plancheta were delivious.  Not sure this would be a great match for vegetarians."
"Since The Purple Pig takes no reservations, I wasted no time and dropped my bags off in my hotel room and headed straight to the restaurant. We were lucky, got there on a Wednesday night and was immediately offered seats either inside or out. It was a perfect July evening so sitting outside was much more preferable over the very noisy indoor section. Since it was our first time, our waitress let us know that it's a sharing menu of small plates and that a guideline is 2-3 plates a person, but certainly not a rule. A ""pig's ear"" is a British slang for a mess, and at first blush you might think the dish of Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg can't work, but nothing could be further from the truth. The ear is cut into thin strips and fried, and looked like tortilla strips. As the chef recommended, we broke up the egg and mixed it all together. It was our favorite dish of the night. The textures and flavors were unique, yet perfectly harmonious - just amazing! I love bone marrow so an easy pick was the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. I was so looking forward to a luscious nugget of quivering marrow on a toasted baguette. But it was not to be had, it was overdone, turning the marrow into liquid and losing it's flavor (heavy sigh.....).Fried Sardines with Shaved Fennel Salad and Lemon Vinaigrette was excellent. The strong flavor of the sardine and it's crispy outside was perfect with the bright lemon vinaigrette. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes was a wonderfully tender and comforting dish. Couldn't detect any dairy, but no matter, it was delicious.Never tried pig jowl so we ordered the Seared Pig Jowl with carrot and peas. When it first came to the table it looked to be like very little food, about 3x5 and the thickness of Canadian bacon. It was delicious and purposely small because it was also very rich. The richness was cut perfectly with the sweetness and freshness of the peas and puree of carrots. The Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil was awesome! ""Less is more"" and this preparation allows the eight perfectly roasted clams to shine through.  I still dream about this dish!At this point we were full, but I couldn't help but think about the Soft Scrambled Egg with Uni that I saw on the menu. I was so intrigued I had to order it. The dish struck a delicate balance; for the uni lovers it doesn't hit you over the head but gives you subtle hints of it's briny goodness, and for my non-uni eater it was still enjoyable. I've never had the Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche) before, but at the same time it was very familiar in a good way. The ricotta was great as it added body and depth to the chocolate, and you can't go wrong deep frying a brioche and covering it with sugar! If you're keeping score, our happy bellies were filled with a total of eight dishes between the two of us, (hey, our server said 2-3 dishes per person was just a guideline...OINK!).Overall we loved The Purple Pig, even though the bone marrow fell way short (deducted one star). The next time, no doubt we will order the clams and pigs ear again along with other new dishes, and will pray that if we take a chance with the bone marrow again, the chef will give it the attention it deserves."
"My friends and I went to Chicago over Spring Break this year. We decided to have a ""non-touristy"" adventure and tried to visit as many places recommended by locals as we could. That's how we got to the purple pig! I am a big fan of food places that have their own culture, and this one is definitely at the top of my list. They were very accommodating and helped us add an extra spot for one our friends that was running late. We did not try the bone marrow but people next to us did and they seemed to enjoy it. I have no complaints about the food, and the wine was delicious. I would highly recommend this place if you are in town for a good food experience."
"My first time to try the place, it was rainy and crowded so an hour wait for a meal was not suitable for my friend and I.  We wound up in Heaven On Seven which is owned by the father of one of the partners in The Purple Pig.  The concept itself seems fine wine, swine and cheese.  So we finally tried the place on Memorial day when the weather was warm and the place not crowded (although it got windy).  The patio was open and the seating was fine.  Looking through the menu, my friend looked over what to drink and we decided to get a bottle of red wine suggested by the waitress (btwn the 2 reds, she mentioned one was like Welch's grape juice (which my friend who is English by way of Canada didn't know what she meant).  The wine was fine so now it was to the choice of foods.  My poor friend was not necessarily a big fan of tapas style food.The order, he chose the arugula/asparagus salad which was good to him but really tasteless to me and the braised pork shoulder.  I ordered several items, marinated olives, chevre noir, prosciutto balls, and jamon serrano with oyster mushrooms and fried duck egg.  The menu is a mixed bag but mostly I love pork pork pork.  Of the food we ordered here are the raves, faves and so so.salad was okbraised pork shoulder with mash was good!marinated olives yumchevre noir great but not enough toast pts to spread on.prosciutto balls not enuf prosciutto to tastejamon serrano with the fried duck egg was a good way to endwe had the lemon penna cotta delish and festa di santa lucia crema ok.Overall the Purple Pig was a delight and a disappointment sort of like the name.  How does the Pig turn Purple....it drank the grape wine!Since there were good selections on the menu, I would recommend it anyway.  Go for what you like.  cheese, small appetizers and easy to eat plates.  Definitely try the olives, meaty and tasty."
"Came here for lunch and the place was hopping.  Wasn't too long of a wait though and spent that time looking over the delicious menu and relaxing outside.  I love places like the Purple Pig with smaller plates - it's nice to get to try more than 1 dish.  The atmosphere was nice, not really a view of anything outside since it is kind of back in off the street, but that is kind of nice too and getting to sit outside on a nice day is always the best.Service was attentive and helpful.  For plates we got a salad, the pesto corn, pig's ear, and razor clams.  I had never had razor clams before and they were pretty good, although I don't know if compared to other clams and the like that I would choose to get them again.  The corn was delicious.  The salad was probably my favorite - I forget exactly what was in it exactly but it was flavorful and yummy.  I got up the courage to try the pigs ear and that was piggylicious.  Got a nice Portuguese wine to accompany our lunch choices and the whole meal was a success.  Wish this place was in Boston so I could make it a regular stop."
We had been looking forward to eating here for a long time and finally had the chance last night.  Out table of four were all disappointed as every course (except for the cheese tasting) was overly salted.  So salty that any other seasoning was non-existent.  We were also amazed that there was so little effort took with the plating of the food.  The citrus greek salad looked like something that had been scavenged.  The service was good but when we asked about order of service we were told that our food would come out in the order that it was ready. Will we dine there again?  Highly unlikely.  I am baffled at the high ratings this restaurant has gotten.
"Purple Pig's the perfect place for lunch or dinner with friends or business acquaintances without breaking the piggy bank. I was very pleased with two meals I had here and want to go back. Soon.Both times we sat outside under umbrellas on a small patio surrounded by railings with gorgeous planter boxes filled with tall grasses and flowers. Perfect for a sunny Chicago day.Food. Wow.  Served on not-so-small small plates, the food was creative and delicious. Deep-fried chorizo-stuffed olives-crunchy and acidic with a bit of heat. Moist & tender chicken thigh meat on a stick, with crispy skin small whole potatoes that were flattened like roadkill. They had a great outer crust and moist baked potato interior. All that on a bed of creamy tzatziki sauce.Cold dishes we tried: roasted sweetcorn kernels mixed with minced walnuts, herbs and vinaigrette; Greek salad with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, feta-the usual, but entirely fresh and very good.We also had pork shoulder on mashed potatoes which was just ok.  The pork was moist, flavorful, but a tad too salty and the potatoes had been thinned to the point of runniness.  A large bowl of mussels with broth and bits of crunchy vegetables was very good.  We didn't even get to the cold processed meats and cheese selections.You can pace yourself at the Pig and have a very good meal at a surprisingly fair price per person for a Michigan Avenue eatery. Or go hog wild. Either way you win."
"Good beer, great wine excellent food.  I took 5 of my coworkers out after work and we had a great time. The only issues for me were that that we had to wait an hour for a seat. and the portions are small. Either way it was worth the wait and the dishes tasted great. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago."
"I really wish San Francisco had a place like this. Wine and Pigs! What a great combo!You can't really go wrong with the food here. That's what our waiter said. Actually that's what my friends have told me. So I went with the following...1. Fried Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg. I adored the pig bowl! How to eat this? You mix everything together and enjoy with a glass of wine.2. Asparagus and Hazelnuts with Arugula and treviso salad. Delicious. The hazelnuts give a good crunch to the salad. Very refreshing on a warm day.3. Jamon Serrano with oyster mushrooms and Fried Duck Egg over a grilled bread. Just like an open face sandwich. Love this dish.4. Milk Braised pork shoulder with mash potatoes. This was my favorite dish! Pork was tender and tasty. All the dishes are considered small plates and meant to be shared. Of course having a few glasses of wine to compliment the dishes is a must. They have an extensive wine list. They have pigs. What more can you ask for. I highly recommend this place!"
"Alright, after my last visit to the PP, I have to up my rating to 5 stars. The service was great, and we were able to grab a table outside on the patio, which I found to be less cramped than the inside. This time I was able to try a few new dishes including the olive oil poached tuna with Greek lima beans, the salt-roasted beets, and a few of the meats and cheeses. It was all scrumptious... our table was definitely ""mmmm'ing"" our way through the meal."
"AAAHH!  Can't wait to go back!My cousin and I went here for lunch on a sweltering weekday.  We could wait 45 minutes for an inside table or be seated immediately outside.  Because we were starving, we decided to sweat it out.  We didn't have anything to drink - I think I would have passed out from the heat.We started with the corn appetizer and the prosciutto escarole bread balls.  The corn was a cold salad consisting of fresh, sweet corn kernels, minced walnuts, arugula, and rosemary with olive oil, a touch of vinegar, and some spices (I think maybe red pepper flakes?).  This was delicious!  They were a bit heavy-handed with the olive oil, but I didn't mind because it was so fruity/grassy.The prosciutto escarole bread balls were gumball-sized fried balls that sat on a bed of tomato sauce and did not taste particularly like prosciutto or escarole.  They tasted fine but were not as special.For our mains, we went with the mussels with pancetta, creme fraiche, and marjoram, and the milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  The mussels were AMAZING - large, fresh, and tender.  The broth was UMAMI HEAVEN and was very light despite the creme fraiche.  The addition of pancetta, garlic, and shallots (I think) was wonderful.  Sadly, the mussels only came with two toast points (perfectly buttery) for us to dunk in the broth.  We had no shame, though, and were drinking the broth straight up.  Oh, and the mussels came in one of those adorable pig-shaped bowls.The milk-braised pork shoulder was ridiculously tender and tasty.  However, after the flavor explosion that was the mussels, I was a little disappointed here.  Also, the mashed potatoes were extremely oversalted and pretty much inedible.  I talked with some friends afterwards, and they said I must have eaten it on an off day.For dessert, we shared a berry crostada, which was topped with mascarpone (or some sort of similar sweet cheese) and drizzled with a wonderful basil syrup.  I think I need to make basil syrup with my basil plant now and drizzle it all over everything.  We also got the Sicilian iris - ricotta and chocolate chip-filled fried brioche.  This looked like a humongous donut dusted with powdered sugar and tasted very similar.  There was just the right amount of ricotta and melty chocolate chips inside so as not to feel super guilty while eating this (although personally, I would have preferred for it to be stuffed to the gills).  My cousin absolutely loved the Sicilian iris and couldn't stop talking about it.  I liked it, but is it terrible that I'd rather have a cider mill donut?  (Franklin Cider Mill, to be exact...)Oh, and sitting outside in 94-degree weather ended up being tolerable.  The awning provided a good amount of shade, and there was a bit of a breeze.  The bussers kept bringing us ice water, which was very helpful.  Our server was extremely awkward and irritating, but it's OK... the food was just so incredible.  I will be back!"
"If you're PMSing, this is THE place to go!!  Satisfy your salt crave here.  This is no dis, I'm serious.  Everything was perfectly seasoned with salt.  Not overly salty, but it was definitely there.  I was a little nervous about coming here for lunch right after noon.  Usually for hot spots, I like to get there early so I don't have to wait.  I have my limits.  I can eat anywhere, but I loathe waiting!!  It's probably because I'm HUNGRY while I'm waiting.  No fear though, this place was easy walk-in.  And bc the weather was still good, there was outdoor seating available as well.  I wonder if they close the tent up during the colder weather or do they just take it down.  That would severely hamper the occupancy at this place.  Yes, so with regards to seating.  Be prepared to sit at either a communal table or very close to another table.  It did feel weird that I did not know my fellow diners as we were so close, several times, I swear some of them were reaching over for our food!!  And since you are so close, be prepared to have to chat with your neighbors should they decide to talk to you.  The food is good and interesting.  I like the whole tapas idea migrating outside of Spanish food.  I always feel that sampling many is sometimes better than having a big honking plate of one thing.  But I guess that depends on the many.  We ordered:1. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (Excellent!  Very crispety, crunchy.  You don't even realize it's pig's ears.  They reminded me of soft shell crabs. Love the fried egg on top.)2. Lardo Crostini (Yeah, not for the weary at heart.  It is basically, a thin slab of lard, not fried, a little rubbery.  But still decadent. I'm not ashamed.)3. Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta (This reminded me of the typical tapas dish with the tomato sauce and plop of goat cheese in the center. Although in this case, the sauce was stewy and the cheese was ricotta.) 4. Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche & Marjoram (oh how i wish there was more bread to sop up the sauce!!!) 5. calamari (we were a little hesitant to get this as we were told the calamari was ""blanched"".  blanched?  who blanches calamari?  but it was good.  a nice lighter dish compared to the other four heavy ones.)i liked the place. i would definitely go back.  wonder what the crowd is like at night time."
Great food. Loved the beet and goat cheese starter....delish!  Such a fun small bites spot. lively environment.
"I've heard so many great things about TPP that I absolutely needed to try it before leaving Chicago. My friend and I spontaneously decided to dine here, since we both wanted to come here for the longest time. We were quoted an hour and fifteen minute wait, but were given a table after only 45 minutes. TPP has a huge menu and everything sounds so amazing that it's hard to choose, so we just ordered the three most popular dishes that the waiter recommended: bone marrow, fried pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder. I gotta give it to them, the bone marrow is quite good; I didn't like it initially, but it grew on me. The fried pig ears however arrived at our table lukewarm, were too salty and vinegary, and I just wasn't a fan of the texture. I didn't like the pork shoulder either, which is supposedly their iconic dish. It's basically mashed potatoes and gravy with pork, and it reminded me of Thanksgiving dinner.Everything we ordered (and everything else on the menu it seems) is extremely heavy and is pretty much just fancy man food: tons of fat, pork, and more fat. I was dying for a palette cleanser by then end of the meal, but they were out of their lemon panna cotta and everything else looked heavy. The prices were at least decent; the three dishes between the two of us after tax/tip was $20 per person. I can't help but compare this restaurant to Girl and the Goat (similar price range, entree size, tapas style, and cult following) and GATG wins hands down as the more delicate, creative option."
"I'm a bit tardy with my review of our lunch at the Purple Pig. So, I'll keep it short and sweet with what I remember from our lunch here. -They were packed. -Communal style dining table for us, ugh! -Someone at my table drank my water. Not my glass, but still MY water. -Big Ayinger Weis Biers for me and my lady. -Marinated Olives -Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette -Salad of Asparagus & Hazelnuts with Arugula & Treviso -Trifecta of outstanding cheese: Blu di Bufala, Capriole O'Banon and Parmigiano Reggiano -Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde -Saltimboca -We loved everything we had. The beets, salad and cheeses were all very tasty. The waitress suggested octopus was some of the best I've had. The Saltimboca was the traditional preparation that I've seen at Lupa. If you dig that dish, you'll want to get it here. It was the best thing I had at the pig. I really don't care for those huge tables, unless we're there with a bunch of friends that take up most of it. That said, I still really liked this place and I'm sure we'll be back for more Ziggy Piggy."
"This is where I come when I feel like eating and drinking too much, and have a taste for wine. I usually ask my server to recommend a bottle of something amazing off the wine menu. On my last visit it was a Spanish red. As I enjoyed my wine I gorged on fried pig ears, lardo iberico, morcilla, guinea hen, and for dessert lemon panna cotta. I was heart broken to learn the balsamic braised pigs tails were sold out for the evening. I recommend going with a few hungry, thirsty friends. Go through two or three bottles, and order everything that sounds interesting. You can't go wrong."
"I got out of work early for Summer Friday and made plans for a late lunch at Purple Pig. Around 2 p.m., there was still a bit of a crowd lingering, but we were able to snag a nice little seat outside. It was a bit chilly, but the heating lamps were fantastic.I have to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we ordered several small dishes to share but forgot to save room for dessert.What we shared was: - Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheese...so good. And quite a lot for sharing.- Chorizo stuffed olives...major flavor explosion.- Charred cauliflower w/ cornichons...really delicious. Something even a non-cauliflower lover would enjoy.- Prosciutto bread balls...these were fine, but I wasn't overly impressed. Reminded me of meatballs (duh...)- Fried manchego with quince paste...kind of a glorious version of a mozzerella stick. yum.And here's where we reached the tipping point: pork rillete with crostini. Good lord. This was just so rich, I almost felt like it should've come with a warning. There was a LOT of it too, which would've required more crostini to finish. Alas, we'd met our match and had to throw down our napkins in defeat.I was expecting a much higher bill, but for all that deliciousness, plus one glass of wine and an Italian IPA, I felt like it was a steal for $67. Definitely going to make a return!"
"I went for a late night dinner and was recommended a fabulous wine to start, a Spanish blend but I can't remember the name. Had the crispy pig's ear (amazing), braised octopus (tender and perfectly flavored with green beans), bone marrow (tough to take the texture but the flavor was out of this world) and the best of the night, milk-braised pork shoulder. It's nostalgic. It makes me think of cuddling up under a big fluffy blanket with my grandma. If I weren't so full I would have ordered another. The service was impeccable but the tables are a little close together and it is very loud. We still didn't have any problems having a conversation. I will definitely be back the next time we're in Chicago."
"Amazing!  Food highlight of our Chicago trip.We were looking for a place to eat on Sunday night and this place came highly recommended on our Lonely Planet Guide.   It's literally hidden, tucked away beside Nordstrom's huge building on North Michigan Ave's Magnificent Mile.  I literally walked right past, retraced my steps and found it.  Tip: If you see Michael Jordans Steakhouse on Michigan, skip that place and look directly across the street and you'll find the Purple Pig.Popped in shortly after 6:00, left my name with the host table, then cheated a bit:. Rather than stick around at the bar, I walked back to our hotel @ 10 mins away to pick up my wife.   We both arrived just before 7:00 and they seated us right away at a patio table.   Food was awesomely different. Beets with goat cheese and pistachios was amazing.Greek salad very nice.Pigs ears, an unusual choice, very nicely complimented by a loosely cooked fried egg that our server recommended to stir into the crispy bits.  Very interesting taste, I'd describe as a chewy pork crackling for my British friends.Milk-braised pork shoulder to die for.  Very simple dish, super tender, nice use of (mild) spice.   Turkey leg confit: amazing taste, HUGE portion. Overall very nice!  Not super-pricey, either.  Left completely stuffed, bottle of nice Valpolicela, desserts, meal for two and total bill was $120 + tip."
"Do not come to Purple Pig in hopes of having an intimate conversation.  Because it's not going to happen.  This place is obnoxiously LOUD.  Do we really *need* Elton John blaring??  (Answer: No.)  You'll have to leave the whispering of sweet nothings until after dinner.Aside from that, plan on a long wait.  I asked the host if she'd have any tables inside available and she said yes, but the wait would be longer.  Since this crazy weather has a mind of its own, I didn't really want to sit in the make shift outside tent thingy.  Even though it had heaters, it looked uncomfortable.  After about 45 minutes, my sexy companion & I got seated at our own table, as the communal table didn't really interest us.  If you're drinking, go ahead and get a full bottle of wine.  You know you want to!  Besides, after our several rounds of drinks, it would have just made more sense.  I'll keep that in mind for my next visit.  Side note:  my prosecco was extra bubbly and delightful.  Oh gosh, I almost forgot--we found their wine list to be difficult to navigate.  Unless you are a sommelier, you may feel a little lost.  Ask your server for suggestions.  Or better yet, they can re-do the wine list and make it more user friendly.  Don't pass up on the pork shoulder and mussels.  Both were dream worthy.  The desserts were pretty average looking.  We took a pass, since I came prepared with cupcakes.  It's true, I don't leave home without cupcakes in my bag."
"I went here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon for a couple tapas. She is vegetarian and I generally eat vegetarian, so as we looked at the menu and saw so few options without meat we were pretty disappointed. I had heard good things and yes, I do get the whole pork theme or whatever, but if you're serving tapas, I expect more vegetarian offers than this place has, and I also expect them to at least be tasty, even if there is no meat!  We ordered eggplant Parmesan balls, charred cauliflower, and the feta cucumber cheese spread.The eggplant was the best out of the three and the filling was pretty good. The outside was crisp and golden, and the inside was hot and cheesy. The cauliflower dish smelled like a mixture of weed and old socks, but I guess that's what it's suppose to smell like when cooked. Regardless, there was too much salt. It was seriously drowning in salt. The bread that came with the feta cheese spread was very oily and we got enough feta cheese spread to feed 10 people. We ate all the bread (we were hungry) and were left with a heaping mound of feta cheese spread left, just looking at it like uhhh why did they give us SO much? Our waitress was neither helpful nor unhelpful. She pointed out a few things on the menu real quick, but it was busy so I understand if she couldn't spend more time offering her opinion on veggie options for us. Overall, we were disappointed and left with the taste of oil and salt in our mouth...yum?"
"A little on the pricey side, but absolutely delicious pig bone marrow!  Great atmosphere and friendly service.  It's all about the swine here!"
"WARNING:  This is going to be a long review!  So here are some quick notes.  Come here, no questions asked.  Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, JLT with Fried Egg and Meatball sliders were my favorite.  Awesome service!I have been excited to try the Purple Pig since I've first heard about it.  I'll admit, this is one reason why I wanted to come to Chicago in the first place, that's how much I love food.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.I stopped by around 5:30, which ended up being about 30 minute wait, not bad for how busy this place was. I didn't know what to expect walking into the doors but the atmosphere I experienced was absolutely AMAZING!  This is not a fine dining establishment, but the food is definitely on par with any high priced restaurant.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded but very fun.  The staff is VERY Friendly which is always welcomed.  They have a waitress to takes your orders and then they have other individuals who refill your waters and serves your food.  It works well, except they tried to give me a dish I didn't order and charge me for it...that was fixed though, no complaints.The FOOOOOOD!!!-Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs:  I've heard a lot about bone marrow and this is my first experience with it.  The bone marrow was extremely rich and the capers and herbs went very well with the spread.  I tried the bone marrow alone, with the bread and then with the bread and herbs.  I definitely think the herbs brought out a great flavor because it helped cut the richness of the bone marrow and it just gave more substance to the dish.  Maybe I'm just a bone marrow amateur.-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder:  OMG!!  This was absolutely amazing!  I wish I ordered two of these! The pork shoulder was extremely tender and gravy was just wonderful.  Chewing threw the pork, you really get the essence of a dairy/milky flavor which was very subtle made this dish fantastic!  The mashed potatoes are mashed potatoes, nothing special there but it helped get me and my friend full.-Prosciutto Bread Balls:  This was our first dish and I can't say I was a fan of this so much.  Probably cause I was expecting something different.  It was a lot more herby than I expected and I couldn't quite figure out what was in it, herb wise.-""JLT"" with Fried Egg:  This was my favorite dish! The main reason why I ordered this dish is because I thought, pork and a fried egg together?!  How is that not a win?   The flavors on this dish were exquisite!  I expected something more rich because of the egg, but the lettuce was tossed with a very citrus-based dress that made the dish extremely refreshing and light even with the egg on top.  Although, the jowl (pork cheek) didn't stand out as much it rounded off the sandwich, if you can call it that, very well.  The balance in this dish was absolutely perfect, I'm drooling thinking about this as we speak.-Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli:  I only had one piece of this, but the scallop was cooked perfectly.  To me, as long as you cook the scallop properly you don't need to add much to make it good.  It was a good dish, just doesn't stand out to me compared to the other stuff I had.-Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil:  This is my first experience with razor clams and I was very pleased.  By the name of this dish you can tell it's very simple with the overall emphasis on the clams.  They felt and tasted a lot like a scallop to me and I liked it.  Nothing fancy here, just well executed.-Meatball Sliders:  I love meatball sandwiches!  With that said, I picked up my slider took a bite and was in heaven!  The meatball was moist and perfectly cooked.  The bread was soft, NOT soggy, and had great flavor, it was served on a brioche bun.  Maybe I'm biased towards a meatball sandwich but this was a great item.Overall, my experience with The Purple Pig was fantastic!  Yes the portions are small, but it just allows you to share with your friends and try out a lot of things on the menu, which I'm glad I got to do.  My suggestion is order the whole menu if you can!"
"Our trip was shorten so we had to fit in as many yummy places as possible in or itinerary even if it meant midnight on a Friday!!  Wonderful spot for late night since it is open until 2am but the kitchen closes at 1am.  Perfect downtown spot for wine and pork lovers!  We got seated right away and off I got lost into pork land.Ordered: - Calamari Salad with Radishes, Farro & Cucumbers.  I can see this dish as refreshing but being a not so big veggie fan, I couldn't really eat this dish, other than trying to pick out the calamari....My bf just plainly loves his fried calamari so this was a fail for us..- Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki...Tender and the right bite pieces.  The addition of the tsaziki sauce was good.. The skin itself was a bit too salty for me but it's alright, I just took it off!-The best dish of the night for ME was the roasted bone marrow spread...so fatty... so much... but so gooood!  I ate it all and had to walk around to not get sick from it because it was so muchhh!  I don't regret one bit of it though.I wanted to try the deviled eggs and pork shoulder but they ran out on a Friday night at like 12:00pm.  Must try next time I am around and hopefully I'll be with a pork lover so we can try more dishes!!!"
"Really long wait, but nice to have a glass of wine and chat with your party on a cool Fall night outside. The food is very reasonably price, but I have to say the Bone Marrow dish is nothing really too special, but kudos to Purple Pig for making it a thing worth saying you tried."
"I was really excited when my friend suggested to try this restaurant.  I have been meaning to come here for some time.  We sat at the patio area but it was too cold outside and I was really grateful that our waiter sat us by the heater.  Our waiter was quite hilarious and extremely friendly and the staff was quite attentive. We ordered Bone Marrow, Manchenga Cheese, Calamari Pistachio Radish Beans and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  Our waiter suggested 5 to 6 dishes for 2 since the dishes comes in small portions (tapas style).  4 dishes was enough for us.  Manchega cheese was quite good.  I love the Calamari dish.  Light, fresh and tangy,  Bone Marrow spread was delicious but it can be very rich I wish that we had another dish with it to balance the richness.  Definitely will try to scoop all the marrow out first drizzle it with lemon juice and mix the green with it.  Let the richness of the marrow marinate with the lemon. After those three dishes I was quite stuffed and couldn't really appreciate the tender juicy milk braised pork as much as I would have if I wasn't  extremely FULL.  Love this place.  Will come back again!!!"
45min wait at 3:30 pm on Saturday. So we went 2 blocks to another tapas bar. Maybe next time.
The food was good and our server (Colleen) was great but the setting and long wait get one star. We were stuffed at the end of a long table in the most trafficked area of the restuarant with a huge fan blowing directly into our faces.   We were bumped more times then I could count.  Did not mind sharing the table with strangers but putting 14 on a table for 10 or 12 small sized patrons was a bit much.  Need to find a better way to sign in.
"I think I'm in love with this restaurant. We found it thru Yelp, and were so glad to have gone and tried it. We had the Salt-Roasted Beets withWhipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana, Fried Brussels Sprouts, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki and then for dessert the fried Brioche filled with ricotta and choco chips. Unbelievable food...nice environment, fun fun fun! I absolutely love this place. WIsh they would open a restaurant in San Diego!"
"Nope. Not happening for me. What's the hype about?  The wait? The noise? The cramped space?  If so then for the Pig five stars. If the criteria is food, ambiance and service then Purple Pig fails."
"If you've read my reviews, you'll know I'm far from a foodie.  My visit to the Purple Pig was my first step on a road to becoming an aficionado of food and drink. I went during the lunch hour, and I highly recommend checking it out.  Since I don't like to round up, I gave it 4 stars...but this is a 4.5 star establishment.What I liked most (aside from the food) was the price tag.  For a spot that's tucked away on Michigan Ave, I came away very impressed with what I paid for 2 people (under $75, and we shared 4 plates worth of food.)  This price includes beer by the way; and I didn't leave hungry at all. Now for the food - Everything that I had was small plate style.  I tried the braised pork shoulder (legit), the jamon (legit - just a regular plate of ham), the pig's ear (fyi - this looked real interesting b/c it has capers, egg, and these small fried pieces of pig's ear mixed together...but give it a shot), and the turkey leg confit (I probably wouldn't get this again; it had this vinegar-based sauce that didn't agree with me.) Other pros - the waiter was very polite and attentive (which is helpful when 50% of the items on the menu don't make sense) and the ambiance of the outdoors area was money.Cons - This place is pretty small.  If I say anything else here I'd be reaching...I'm a fan."
"Wait on a Saturday night: 3 hoursAmbiance: Touristy, Bar scene, small, and unimpressive.Service: Hostesses, snooty and unsympathetic (they kept elongating the wait time with no sympathy). Waitress, poor attitudeOrder: bone marrow (ok, the bread itself was better than the marrow).  pig ear (salty), wagyu beef tips (good), milk braised pork shoulder (salty, not unique in flavor but good), & lemon panna cotta for dessert (good and refreshing after salty meal)Was it worth the 3 hour wait? Food is good, but the service attitude needs to be adjusted. Would I eat here again? When pigs fly or if I am paid to.Glad I went to Purple pig b/c now I know, as long as Girl and the Goat is in business, I will have NO need to eat pig here. Girl and Goat is much classier and spacious, better service, comparable prices, and TAKES RESERVATIONS so you can actually plan an evening about you, not the other way around."
"This place is really excellent. Service, once seated, was fast and efficient. Every dish we had was terrific. Only the pigs ear was a bit more salty than I would've liked. We sat at the counter in front of the people preparing the food. Great entertainment!  High energy establishment. Highly recommend the chicken kabobs and pork neck gravy."
"I have been here a few times just for snacks and maybe a glass of wine and I have liked their veggie dishes (not being a meat eater).  I appreciate that they know how to give their vegetables a lot of flavor.  I especially enjoyed a shredded raw brussels sprout dish they had a while back.  On my recent visit with a friend, however, all the dishes we tried (corn salad, cauliflower, grilled green onions) were tasty but too oily.  My friend actually stopped eating because of all the oil.  And neither one of us are afraid of fat! Service has been ok my 3 visits, but not really that warm.  I think they're just too busy to pay enough attention to people, and all 3 visits I've gone there are kind of off times, like 4 PM on a Saturday.  But they're definitely crowded all the time, it seems!  I suspect weekdays at odd times are much more bearable.  I would come here more often for a bite if the waits weren't so crazy, but I don't know....maybe it's because I don't eat meat, but the draw isn't big enough for me to make it a destination."
"Chicagoans seem to have a hard-on for tapas, and the wait for a table at this small-plate joint on Michigan Avenue was over three hours on a Sunday afternoon.  We came back on a weekday afternoon and the wait was down to 10 minutes.  The seating inside is crowded, with long, communal-type tables, sort of like a beer hall.  The patio seating was really nice, tucked back from Michigan Avenue.  The restaurant says it specializes in Swine, Wine and Cheese.  Their swine is totally, awesomely divine, but any deviation from there will be regretted.  We started off with two non-swine plates that were horrible.  We followed that with two swine plates, milk braised pork shoulder and the pork flank steak, which were some of the best we ever tasted. Unfortunately it would be pretty hard to fill up on just the pork dishes.The servers are nice and efficient, but they either can't pour a friggin' beer here or they just have a thing for head."
"It is quite a unique experience here.  I got to sit next to the kitchen and watch the chefs at work.  My favorite dish was the milk-braised shoulder, which was juicy and tender, and the meat easily came off the bone.  The bone marrow was absolutely delicious."
We stopped by the Purple Pig for a couple of drinks and a small snack.  We choose the Eggplant Parmesan Balls.  They were very good.  Solid atmosphere as well.
"I always wanted to try this place and suggested the restaurant to my friend who was visiting. He was up for trying it also. When we got there around 7 pm on Wednesday night, the place was super busy. While we waited, we got some beer at the bar. Boy, this bar is crowded and you definitely have to work hard to get the attention of the bartender.Finally after 30 minutes, we got seats at the communal table at the outdoor patio. I was glad because inside was very noisy and it would of been hard to talk to my friend and catch up.What we ordered:* Fried Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries* Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs* Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes* Scrambled eggs with sea urchin* Turkey LegIf you are going to come here, definitely get the roasted bone marrow and milk braised pork shoulder. So delicious and the pork shoulder melted in your mouth. The scrambled eggs with sea urchin was a new item on the menu and it was definitely interesting. It helped that they served bread because it was fishy and salty, so it balanced it out. What pushed us over the edge of being full was the turkey leg. It was HUGE! Full of flavor and tender. We still ordered dessert and got the Sicilian Iris, a ricotta and chocolate Chip filled fried brioche. Hmmm...The perfect dessert to end a meal.When I left, I was very satisfied with my meal and not majorly full. Ordering 5 dishes was the perfect amount for two."
"Man, we just ate so much here that I can't decide if I love this place for the food or hate this place for making my wallet feel the pain. My three friends, Wing L., Vicky L., a non-Yelper (what?!?!?), and I sat down here after a long touristy day in 102 degree heat, and we were absolutely starving. The place was packed, but we got our seats pretty quickly. There's a mix of booth styled seats and communal tables; we were led to one of these tables to showcase the gluttony and Kobayashi-chow down skills were were capable of. One minor niggle about this communal seating... we were a group of four and it would have been nice to sit in two pairs facing each other. However, one of us got seated at the head of the table, while one of us also had to face a complete stranger for the duration of the meal.That tiny detail aside, the food was glorious. We started off with the meat sampler, a wooden board of two types of prosciutto, various chorizo styled sausages, and other yummy meats. Paired with a sampler of three cheeses, and the pork neck bone gravy smear, we dug into this with the ferocity of Vikings at the table. Then we added the fried olives stuffed with chorizo (fried olives are always a delight), the milk braised pork shoulder, the Berkshire Porkchop, grilled octopus, grilled cauliflower, the ham panini, the pan seared scallops, and the wagyu tips. Each dish was well flavored and balanced, and came out of the kitchen in a steady progression. Our lovely communal table neighbors kept looking over with a sense of amazement and I'm sure a tinge of disgust at the amount of food taking up our allotted space. Needless to say, I waddled out of this place, and proud of it.If I visit Chicago again, I'll be sure to stop by again for another great meal. Maybe a little more restrained next time. ;)"
"There are enough reviews to go around on this page, so I'll try and keep it short.First of all, I recommend to try and RSVP.  I tried going on a night without RSVP'ing and the wait was over 30 minutes.  Some real first world problems stuff..Anyways, onto the food!  My friend and I were catching up and decided to heed advice from our fellow Yelpers.  We ended up getting the pork shoulder and bone marrow.  The bone marrow came out first and was pretty good, but wasn't too memorable.  I'd say get it just to say that you had tried ""bone marrow,"" and maybe go for something else in the menu.  On the other hand, the pork shoulder was AMAZING.  It was succulent, flavorful, tender, and any other objective you'd use to describe perfection sitting on top of a bed of mashed potatoes.  I forgot what wine we ended up choosing, but it was a red that complimented our food nicely.  This joint is worth checking out, so put this on your itinerary and get ready to swine and dine with the best of 'em!"
Waiting time was an hour! We finally got a table but the service was slow. Food was too salty.
"The Purple Pig definitely lived up to its hype.  While you may have to wait 45 minutes to an hour to get a table here, the tapas style food is so worth the wait; and with the restaurant being located on the Magnificent Mile, there's plenty of (window) shopping you can do to kill time.  This was our ""splurge"" meal when I went on a girls' trip recently so we went all out on ordering all of the highly reviewed dishes and local favorites as well as a few dessert items.  I highly recommend this approach so you can get a tasty bite of multiple dishes and still come out paying about $30 a person.  Some of my favorites included the Pig's Ear and Roasted Bone Marrow.  Other favorites from our group included the Pig's Tail, Pork Shoulder, and Mussels.  The Pig's Ear is fried in thin strips and paired perfectly with a fried egg.  When you break the gooey yolk over the crispy pig's ear and mix it with some of the kale, you'll get a combination of delicious flavors in your mouth.  It's amazing!  The Roasted Bone Marrow smear comes still in the bone with several pieces of well toasted baguette slices.  While the menu doesn't detail the seasoning that goes into cooking the bone marrow, you won't find it lacking in taste.  I found myself scraping the inside of the bone to get every last bit of marrow out.  For dessert, we ordered the Panino con Nutella and Sicilian Iris.  Whoever thought of toasting a panini that's been filled with nutella, banana, and marshmallow cream was a genius.  It's like eating a smore, but a million times better.  The Sicilian Iris was also pretty delectable.  Think beignets but filled with chocolate.  Come to Purple Pig with a healthy appetite because you'll want to try almost everything on the menu."
"My husband and I stole away for one afternoon, and this is where we went. It's advertised as ""cheese, swine, and wine,"" and I have an affinity for all three of those things. So far, so good.We had a short wait, and the front house staff was very friendly. They have an extensive wine and beer menu, all European, and we asked for suggestions. It was recommended that I try one of their Moscatos (nice, sort of floral, $11/glass) and it was suggested that my husband try some sort of Belgian ale (extremely hoppy, $36!!! A bottle.) I wouldn't recommend accepting their recommendations without checking the listed prices first, unless you don't need to pay attention to that sort of thing.They offer small plates meant for sharing. We ordered pork fried almonds with rosemary and garlic (yum), two spreads with charred bread--whipped feta and cucumber, and arugula with mortadella, balsamic, and pistachios, fried petit basque cheese with membrillo, and milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy. Just pause for a moment to fantasize about that spread...There was not a single thing I wouldn't eat again, and fight my husband with a fork for plate remnants. It was really really delicious. Our service wasn't excellent, but I think we arrived at a shift-change. Our second round server seemed to forget about us and the table next to us, but I would give them the benefit of the doubt on it. I took one star off because of the extremely outrageously priced alcohol recommendations, and the slow service at the end of our meal. I will definitely return!"
"1) See Sunil D.'s 7/18/11 review.2) While I was under the impression that this place is known for it's meat, it's the seafood dishes that really won me over.  The calamari (which was, as Sunny D mentioned, more like a mediterranean salad) was fresh and had great textures, and the mussels were also the best I've had. Ever. Unbelievable.  Thank God for lots of bread(from the bone marrow) to soak it up bc I was about two minutes from licking the bowl.  If you know someone who hasn't tried mussels or doesn't like them, Purple Pig's mussels would be the dish to change his/her mind."
"The food was amazing!  This is a modern tapas bar.  I loved everything about the food.  They also have a huge selection of wines as well. We Ate:Roasted Bone marrow (everyone needs to order this)cold cuts - spicy / salty selectionscheese - firm / nutty selectionspork shouldershredded brussel sproutsJust know the resturant is pretty small.  They don't take reservations so you could easily wait over an hour.  If you have the time it's worth the wait, however, reservations would be nice."
"Arrived in Chicago fairly late and found that The Purple Pig opens till 2am so we rushed there around 1am to grab a bite.We wanted really savory dishes and The Purple Pig was the perfect place.  Since it's a tapas style restaurant, it's a good idea to get a bunch of plates to share among each other.In the end, we decided to go with the following dishes:+ Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumber, pistachio - light & refreshing+ Prosciutto Bread Balls - we thought it was a fried bread ball wrapped with prosciutto, but it's more like the bread ball is stuffed with a salty prosciutto mix+ Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - ahhhhh roasted fatty bone marrow then smeared on a super buttery toast, add some mircogreens & marinated onions, sprinkle a bit of the sea salt, and sent your taste buds into heaven.+ Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Eggover Grilled Bread - what part of that doesn't sound good?  Did wish the egg was more runny so it can just flow over the dish.+ Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - amazingly tender pork shoulder that's covered in gravy.  Must be eaten together with the mashed potatoes.Everything tasted delicious, and it the end, the group decided that the bone marrow was the best.  When you see the two big pieces of bone somehow glistening in a dimly lit place, how can you not be excited?  I liked how the salt was provided on the side so you can decide how salty you want it.  Definitely a good idea to get around 2 plates per person if you're really hungry but for tapas, the portions aren't bad.A nice selection of reds & whites, but it felt like a beer sort of night so decided to go with the .  10.5% ABV?  Yesss but surprisingly, it was smooth, had a nice sweet taste to it also!  They have lots of European beers on draft, and they serve each in their own distinctive glasses, which is a plus.The place itself is nicely decorated with lots of wood everywhere.  There's even an outdoor seating area for those warmer nights.  Bar counter was full with people just having a glass of wine and a plate or two to snack with.Service wasn't bad, except our server sounded like he had checked out a bit already.  Our savory food craving was definitely satisfied by the end of the meal.  Everything can get a little bit pricey since it slowly adds up but Purple Pig is definitely worth a try."
"I had a pretty great lunch here yesterday with my boyfriend. We only had one day to spend in Chicago, so I chose The Purple Pig as our restaurant to try. We went right from our boat tour to the restaurant, and just beat the rush by arriving at 1145. Our server came over right away, and was really helpful with suggestions, etc. We ended up ordering the bone marrow (AWESOME), the deviled egg (my least favorite, but not terrible), mussels because my bf likes them, and the braised pork shoulder, which was excellent. Then we had the peanut butter ice cream for dessert - could've used more sauce! My main quibble is that the dressing on the greens that came with the marrow was the same as the one that came with the egg, and the broth for the mussels was super similar in flavor - it was kind of one-note, and I would have liked to taste a different sauce/dressing for at least one of the three dressings. One other thing, it gets kinda smoky in there since the kitchen is out in the open - not too big a deal though.I'd totally recommend this place; we really enjoyed ourselves and were pleasantly surprised with the bill - only $61 (before tip) for two people, including my drink. Nice."
"The pig is a magical animal and any restaurant devoted to serving pig is a place I want to check out. Purple Pig sits right on Michigan Ave and needless to say it's a big tourist trap. So of course we decided to go there for lunch before hitting the town. The place was crowded but luckily we were able to get a couple of seats by the bar. The bartender was a bit aloof/quiet but polite and helpful. We started with a couple of Estrella Damm beers while we browsed the menu. We finally decided on the croquettes, a salami and goat chesse panini, and the pork blade steak (on a friend's recommendation). The panini while still good, was the least memorable of the three. The croquettes were made with potato and Speck ham with a chili aioli and they were crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The star of the show was the pork blade steak with 'Nduja and honey. 'Nduja is a type of sausage made with pork shoulder, belly, and jowl, and roasted hot peppers. The spiciness of the sausage and the sweetness of the honey sauce were a perfect complement to the pork which was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender.I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Chicago."
"I LOVE this place.  Like, love, love, love it.I've been lucky enough to grab a table a few times.  There have been a couple of times when the wait is 2+ hours and those days were sad days.  First - trust your server.  The servers know what is up, what is fresh and what you should order.  I've always ordered a cheese plate with recommendations from the server.  In addition to tasty toasted bread, it comes with a few jams to kick up the flavor.  My favorite dish is the roasted beets with goat cheese.  I could have that as a light dinner on its own.  The bone marrow is also good although small.  The location is a discrete alley right off Michigan Avenue.  You wouldn't think you could find superb food on a touristy shopping street but there it is.  It's my favorite spot to eat in the area.  With the exception of the long wait times, this place is the best - down to earth and comfortable and lacks that River North faux hoity toity vibe.  Best to go on off hours, then you don't have to wait and you get extra attentive service!"
"A piggy lover, I was giddy with excitement to finally try Purple Pig after months of lusting after its promise of porky goodness. While the menu does a great job in showcasing the versatility of this fine animal, the flavor profiles of all the dishes, when not overly seasoned (milk-braised pork shoulder was especially salty), are good but forgettable. The necessity for referring to a completely separate and long list of glossary terms to understand all the jargon in the menu is a bit pretentious; it's a good thing the ambiance is casual and service friendly. Definitely a fun place to go to with friends for the novelty of a head-to-tail focused restaurant, but don't expect to be blown away if you're used to eating various pig parts."
"Hm, more like a 3.5, but everything was just a little pinch away from being mindblowingly delicious. The bf and I needed a late dinner, yes we dine at 11:30, and apparently this was the place to be! Friends recommended the place, since we're from out of town, and I'm really glad we went. Amazing wine selection that's perfect for pairing with all of the yummy snacks.Had the fried pig ear, which was darn tasty, but a little too salty...can't say it was an OMG UMAMI PORK moment, but it worked well with the crispy kale. MM! Artichoke heart antipasti was way too salty for me, and I throw on the salt when it comes to home cooking. We had the balsamico, mortadella, pistachio spread and it was beautifully presented with a web of balsamic reduction laced on top. The only downside to the aesthetic was that the vinegar reduction drowned out the subtleties of the rest of the dish. Evening's best dish was the gargantuan cave man turkey leg. Tender, falling of the bone and greasalicious (I mean that in the best possible way...). Highly recommend that, as it is probably the largest dish on the menu and only $15!"
"I'll add to the 588 reviews.Me + The Purple Pig = Very unimpressed.We won't be back.  We sat at the bar.  We had three bartenders helping us.  The first one forgot one of our orders.  That was fine...$9 less than we had to spend.  Wine selection was great...beer selection was lacking.$19 for 3 pieces of cheese was a bit expensive.  Proscuitto balls tasted like fried mozzerella sticks.  Didn't get to taste the pork shoulder - that was forgotten.  In all honesty - as a Chicagoan, I feel this place is a tourist trap.The tasting room is so much nicer and less expensive. It's like this place is frequented by people who go to travelchannel.com and this is a recommendation.And the music in there, sucks.  Didn't know I was in Wrigleyville after a Cubs game at a lame-o dive bar.  I wouldn't reco this place to anyone."
My friends were visiting so I thought we should try this place. We waited two hours which was expected. Service was good and friendly. We ordered the braised pork shoulder which was probably the best dish and the bone marrow. Everything else we ordered was salty as hell. The meatballs were salty. Corn and calamari was Okay nothing special. We ordered a few more plates but it was just really salty. This place was too hyped up.
"Every time I'm in Chicago, I have to visit this place. Great food. Great wine. The best modern bistro in town. Any weird pig parts on the menu is awesome."
"I have to admit, all I knew about this place was they had a ton of pork and it was supposed to be good. We wandered in on a whim on a Sunday afternoon. We got a spot at the bar and I was immediately overwhelmed by the menu. I didn't know what a lot of it was (I felt kinda dumb) But the guy behind the bar was uber helpful and explained everything. He also made some great recommendations. You HAVE to get the whipped feta and cucumber smear! It is to die for. I know, not pork, but still! We also loved the potato and speck croquettes and we had an amazing panini, which one is escaping me...we really wanted to try the fried deviled egg...I mean...how awesome does that sound?? But alas, it is only available for dinner.We each had an amber ale of sorts, which was awesome, and really expensive! oops! haha, oh well, it was worth it. I will definitely stop in again. The place is tiny though so probably won't go during prime time unless I am feeling adventurous. I am now dreaming about that cucumber smear!"
"A-MAZING!!!  Not sure how else I can describe this wonderful place.  This was recommended to me and I of course had to make a food stop here.  We got there around 6PM on a Saturday night and the wait was about 30 minutes.  We were given the option of outside, the bar or a table; which ever came first.  The bar opened up first, so we took a pair of seats there.  The best thing about sitting at the bar, watching the executive chef make all the food!!!  We ordered, Prosciutto di Parma, Pecorino Noce and Whipped Feta with Cucumbers.  All items were awesome!  The meat and cheese were paired with a sweet raspberry spread; which was a great combination.  The feta/cucumber spread was very creamy with diced bits of cucumbers on top; served with 6 slices of toasted bread.This is a great place to stop for an evening snack, good drinks and great atmosphere."
"Wow this place was mind blowing. Group of 12 and the service was perfect. Favorite items were pork blade steak, boneless ribs, pork roasted almonds, octopus, and bone marrow.  Beer menu was a bit European however I found a great moretti."
"So with the current gastropub rage, I was hopeful but a little wary as gastropubs seems to be popping up on every corner, at least in So Cal where I live.  Regardless, I was excited to try the Purple Pig so we popped by on our first night in Chicago. We were greeted and seated right away - given the option of a table or the communal table. We chose to the communal table and didn't regret it.  We had great service and also made friends with some locals who helped us with some recommendations from the menu. Everything we ordered was pretty amazing but the standouts were definitely the bone marrow  (AMAZING and cooked to perfection!) and the pig ear w/the fried egg (crunchy and so flavorful!) The wine selection was fabulous and the waitresses were helpful with suggesting some excellent pairings.All in all the Purple Pig lived up the hype and didn't disappoint. We enjoyed it so much that we spent the rest of the trip trying to go back but were never able to squeeze it back in.  It'll definitely be on my 'must-hit' list next time I go back to Chicago!"
"Purple Pig was easily one of the most memorable meals I had while in Chicago on my most recent 4 day trip. My friend and I were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar as soon as we got there, at 10pm. Our waiter, Lucasz, was really, really funny. He was informative too, but clearly really chill and knowing his stuff.He recommended an awesome wine for us after we said we both liked Malbecs. Furthermore, he helped us pick three distinctive cheese, all three of which were pretty unique and worth finishing to the last crumb.PP served up one of the best beet salads I've ever had. Another dish worth trying was the Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive and Bone Marrow Vinaigrette.It's a bit loud, and I hear it's terribly hard to get a table, but if you have the time, it's definitely worth a bite."
"The most happening, cool  place on Michigan Ave. My friends and I found this place on yelp. It was only a few blocks from our apartment so we went to try.This place is pretty busy on weekends. I've never heard of a place that had a 2-3 hour wait at 9:30 at night. Luckily they stop serving food at 1am and drinks at 2am. We were able to fit in a meal somewhere else and still stop by in time for our table to be called.This place is super tiny and you go here for appetizers and tapas, not a full meal. I would define this place as a wine and cheese bar. Their portions are super small and the food is refined. Don't expect to be full unless you are willing to spend a lot.Since it was out first time, the waitress chose our cheese platter for us and my friends all thought they were super yummy. She recommended the wine as well and I really enjoyed it. Normally I'm not a wine drinker, but I will convert for this one. I tried the bone marrow, but it had less flavor than other bone marrows I've tried. This place is very cool and quaint. Service is awesome and the food is very unique. Great place to chill and drink wine."
"My date and I didn't have to wait for a table at all since we went at 10 pm on a Sunday night.The place was crowded but you can still hear your date. Our server was attentive and straightforward.I had the pig ears, calamari antipasto and braised pork with mashed potatoes. None of them I was excited about. The nutella dessert was the only thing that was tasty and honestly the only satisfying part of our dinner."
"If you are in need of a great happy hour sampling this is the place to come. Lunch and dinner are always busy so prepare to wait for a table, but it was some of the best food I had while in Chicago. The beets and goat cheese app is to die for, as is the ricotta smear, chorizo stuffed olives, and the Octopus dish were my favorites. This is a great place to come for wine, appetizers, and take out but best for happy hour. It has tall communal style tables in the main room and is often very loud."
"I'll preface this by saying two things...1.  I hate restaurants that don't take reservations2.  I hate communal dinning tablesThat being said, I found my Sunday night visit to the Purple Pig to be less than thrilling.  To get to the hostess you have to walk through the outside dinning area really close to people who are eating.  We were able to be seated (really quickly, actually) at an end of an outdoor communal table which was  problematic.  Since the outside was tented for warmth, the tables were really squished together and we had to keep getting up from our seats whenever another group wanted to leave the table.  The other problem with this set up was that the plastic of the tent was flapping in the wind and kept hitting me in the back whenever there was a breeze and of course send chairs that were holding the flaps open crashing to the ground.As far as the food, it was okay.  The menu is somewhat limited for a small plate place to start with and then they were out of 4 different items.  The most depressing of these being one of the desserts, that I only found out was unavailable after I tried to order it.  Also to set the mood, our waiter disappeared half way through our meal so we had to order our next course of plates from the bus boy.  When he did come back he said he was sorry, but that he got involved ""in a librarian type discussion about cheese.""So I was pretty let down and disappointed about the whole experience from start to finish.  They do have a killer Nutella and marshmallow pannini, but it's not enough to make we want to recommend or revisit the Purple Pig."
"So, given its location, I definitely didn't expect this to ever be as good of an experience as it's been every time. The downside is that it can get crowded, and the space is packed a little too tight. This means sometimes a plate won't come out for awhile (or at all -- but they dealt with that very professionally when it happened to me, and that's all I care about), or your server will be a little elusive. But the upside totally outweighs any of that. This is the perfect place for a glass of wine and a few small plates for lunch on a day when you're showing your friend around the city and you just want a glass of rosé and something guaranteed to be delicious. The choices abound, and everything I've tried has been pretty off the chain."
"Good cheese, and good wine. Memorable actually. Didn't like waiting, but at least they serve drinks while you wait."
"Where to even begin?  This place is better each and every time I make it there.  As I write this I can't wait to go back!I'm not a fan of waiting but this is one spot that I'll sit next to the heat lamp patiently waiting for my name to be called.  There are no reservations here so be prepared to wait unless you show up during the week at 10pm.  Whether you wait or not, its totally worth it!  I honestly can't mention one item I am not a fan of and the menu changes depending on what's in season so there are reasons to keep going back and eating it up!If there are scallops on the menu, please order these! So scrumptious and amazing.  Feta with cucumbers and bread grilled with butter?  YES PLEASE!  Fried brusselsprouts?  DOUBLE YES!   Also have to applaud the awesome wine selection.  That's it, I'm going to stop writing just so I can go back!!!!!If you get lucky, you can snag seats at the bar which are first come first serve.  Also, there is no valet so keep this in mind."
"If you're visiting Chicago, this is a restaurant you HAVE to try. But if you live in Chicago, I recommend trying it, but it's not a place I would visit often. Short version: A bit pricey, because everything is 'tapas' style, so although each dish is about $9-13, you have to order at least 3 between two people. Good food. Best service (our waitress was the bomb). Cool atmosphere. Long version: We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, & the Chicken Thigh Kebabs. The Bone Marrow was excellent. It's served with several garlic breads (which is unlimited!), and herbs. It's definitely very heavy and fatty, though. So if you're not into that, then I recommend you don't order it. The Pork Shoulder was very soft and tender. Yum. My favorite was the Chicken Kebabs. The chicken was served on a stick with the crispy skin still attached to it and they were laid on top a bed of mashed potatoes and some sauce (tar-tar like). I looked around and saw people ordering the antipastas, but they were so tiny. I was kind of glad I didn't order them. I eat A LOT, and I'm also broke. So antipastas wouldn't really work for my belly and my wallet. The server was so knowledgeable about the menu, and even the wine menu. She recommended all the great dishes and the best wine. I like the restaurant ambiance. During busy times, it's BUSY and hectic. The music is blasting, the environment is lively, and you hear laughter everywhere. Love it. You should definitely try it out, you won't regret it. By the way- there is free Wi-Fi! Just ask your server what the password is. They'll tell yah!"
"We arrived at our Hotel, put our stuff up and walked over to the Purple Pig...our group had no problems getting a table, but we did have to share it with 2 other people. This wasn't a big deal to me but might be to others.I think we ordered everything on the menu, or it seemed that way since food just kept coming out.We ordered the pig platter and it had EVERYTHING on it!My favorite thing was the pigs ear with kale and the turkey leg (the meat pretty much falls off the bone. Everything else was good.They have a nice list of beers to choose from and lots of wines.I would go back to try a few more things I did not get to order."
Fantastic- everything Chef Jimmy Banos brought to us was delicious- bone marrow was  a huge highlight.
"M-AZE-ING! Kelly our waitress is the sweetest prettiest girl ever!Food is great, LOTS OF TALENT in that kitchen !! Chef AMANDA ROCKS!"
"An entire restaurant devoted to my favorite animal to entirely eat? Lessgo!!So my friends came here for a going-away dinner (well it's only for a couple weeks, but a good reason to hang out anyway) on a weeknight. I guess they don't take resos unless you have a party of 8, but you can come by an hour ahead of time to put your name on the list and come back later. Pro.Everyone on Yelp has their list of must-haves...here were ours:Eggplant with goat cheese - so nice we had it twice. Savory eggplant with the creamy and sweet goat cheese was a great combo, and was surprising because half of us hated eggplant, and the other half hated goat cheeseBone marrow spread - so nice we had it twice, also. Salty, fatty goodness on some plain bread as a vehicle. Iris dessert - I think this replaced the ""ridiculous"" from Sunda as my favorite dessert in Chicago. The iris' advantages: chocolate, pastry-like hot crispiness, and chocolatePig ears - as any Filipino will tell you, chicharon (aka pork rinds) are the snack of the gods. These are like those, but in crispy stick form.I'll be back pigs. Stay delicious."
"My sister has been to this place many times and raves about it, so finally, on this trip, we made our way to Michigan Ave to wait in line for some pig.  We were sat at a sort of communal table, that probably can seat 12, and was a bit crowded with a stranger to my right (who was arguing with his date the whole time (awkward!!), but space is valuable and I know they must get in as much ppl as possible.  To start, we ordered a bottle of bordeaux and the olive oil poached tuna antipasti dish and the charred broccoli with toasted breadcrumbs.  The tuna dish was quite good, and reminds me of a Mediterranean-style tuna salad sans mayo.  I did not like the broccoli dish as much as I imagined I would because it was quite a bit oversalted, which always ruins a dish for me.  Next, we had the fried pork ears with kale and fried egg.  Again, I was not a fan of this dish because it was oversalted.  One of the cooks back there has a heavy hand with the salt.  I really like the creaminess of the egg yolk in the dish, though, because I felt it helped to tame some of the saltiness of the dish - I know I would really enjoy this dish if they had just been a little more restrained with that salt.  Next, we had the pork jowl sandwich (their version of the BLT), which was not really like a BLT because the jowl was nice and soft and fatty and not at all crispy like bacon would be in a blt - however, the flavor was nice, especially with the open faced egg on top to give it extra sauce.  We also had the bone marrow smear plate, which we all liked bc we love bone marrow - you scoop out fatty bone marrow from a bone and spread it onto slightly charred pieces of bread and top it off with the tangy salad that comes with it - such decadence, mmm - don't be afraid to eat this, it's yummy.  After this, we had the braised pork shoulder with mashed potato (which was tender and good, but nothing spectacular), the chicken thigh skewers with tzaziki sauce (nice, tender, and charred with tangy yogurt) and fried mashed potatoes (good), the braised pig tail with gribiche (Loved the tender and fatty pig tails, but HATED the gribiche which was overpowering with herbs and tanginess and made the dish almost unpalatable).  We were so full, we only got 1 dessert to share, which was the buttermilk soft serve ice cream with berries - it's tangy ice cream with a berry sauce- nothing more to say but I ate it all.  This of all the dishes took the longest to come out to the point where we thought our server had not heard us order it.  I would come back here again with reservation.  Most of the dishes were hits, and the menu changes a bit every now and then, it seems.  I'd have to be in a patient mood to eat here, though.  The wait for a table is quite intense and added to the crowdedness of the space inside and having to be squished next to other diners, I would have to be in really good company to go through the hassle."
"Loved it for the wine list alone!The wine selection was extensive and exotic. It was nice to see such a comprehensive list of non-Californian, or even American wine for that matter. Also loved the option to get half bottles of any wine $40 or less- what a fantastic idea.The dishes were tasty too. We ordered the fried deviled egg, which was a bit disappointing in flavor, but mesmerizing in technique. I'm still not sure how they deviled the yolk but managed to keep the whole egg intact and fry it. We also ordered the bone marrow, which was very rich but kind of bland at the same time - the rock salt and herbs that accompanied it helped, but I'm beginning to think that I'm just not a fan of bone marrow. The pig ears and pork shoulder were the highlight of the night.We ended the meal with some podda cheese. Note: cheese portions are VERY small.Bottom line: stick with the pork dishes and French Rhones and you won't be disappointed!"
"Very good tapas dishes, and well priced at that.  The only drawback is they don't take reservations.  They have a variety of tables, some of which is communal seating, and others are just regular tables / outdoor seating when it is a nice day out.  Service is pretty good - only drawback is they just bring dishes as they come out of the kitchen, so not much ""ordering"" to how you're served.Dishes that I would recommend for future diners:- Prosciutto Bread Balls- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, PickledCherry Peppers & Fried Egg- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde- Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki- Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions,Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette"
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but there's always a wait.  We went at 3:00 on a Sunday and got a great table outside right away.  We didn't want a full meal, so we split 4 things.  The beet salad, mortadella smear, and meatball slider were fantastic.  We also had the prosciutto balls, which were good, but not like the other things we got.  I'll def go back."
"This place, located in a prime spot on the MM, certainly packs them into its undersized dining area.  In short, the enticing menu is variable in its execution.  The much-lauded crispy pig ear dish was a tad greasy, with the pigs ears so thinly sliced and heavily breaded that they had little pork flavor.  A (house-made) charcuterie and cheese platter was a mixed bag, but very good overall.  The turkey leg confit, on the other hand, was one of the most memorable dishes I've had of late, rich and moist meat in a great agrodolce.Huge props are due to PP for their exceedingly cool wine list, offering up scores of intriguing bottlings from around the world (none from the USA, though!).  The staff were knowledgeable and gracious despite the insane crowd.  Definitely worth a repeat visit for the wine alone, with mostly good food playing a suitable supporting role."
This was the perfect spot for after dinner drinks on a recent trip to Chicago. The kitchen is open late and the menu had a great selection. The outside patio is fully covered and dimly lit making it a perfect date night spot. Service was excellent.
"Excellent food, but it requires a huge amount of patience before you get to sample any.  The two of us came here on Saturday at 5:00 and were told a 30-minute wait.  We walked on Michigan Ave for a bit and came back in 30.  A rainstorm blew through and that clearly threw them off their game.  After waiting 90 minutes altogether, the best table they could offer was on the wet outer fringe of the patio.  This is the price you have to pay to get seated at such a popular place.  Are you up for it?"
"Stumbled in here after a game at around 11:30, I swear, we had some of the best service ever in Chicago. Ordered a bottle of Burgandy, and a couple piggy treats. Our server (as mentioned) was cheeky, helpful, but not overbearing. While we were trying to decide what to order, the girls at the table next to us told us how everything that they had was delicious, and to order as much as we could stuff in. They were right.1. Cheese board - brilliant, the right amount of cheese and accompaniments.2. Pig Shoulder - braised to perfection3. Sweetbreads - never had pork sweetbreads before, this will have me trying them again and again4. Brioche with pork and duck egg - amazeballs 5. Pork tenderloin - tender, fatty, huge. Add wine, grappa and port to that, and you have my favorite meal ever. If I lived in Chicago I would come here at least once a week."
"Here piggy piggy piggy...Just over the river and if it wasn't for the crowds that congregate you could easily miss this place.  However, tapas served items focusing on Mediterranian and emphasising pork dishes... what's not to love?The menu is a good size and I wanted to try everything, however, such is life the four of us sat outside and began to wonder how well we would enjoy this knowing we couldn't have everything.Starting off simply with almonds soaking in pork goodness and crisp rosemary... oh yeah... here we go.  Juicy and full of bacon goodness and garlic drizzle.The meat Purple Pig platter with the cheeses is fantastic.  Home made sausage was velvety and fully of easy melt in your mouth aromas.  Beef tongue disolves...  for the cheese GET THE DELICES DE BOURGOGNE cheese, an intense creamy and fungusy mushroom with butter rich feeling.  It's like eating the perfect stick of butter (with no doubt the calories to match).Whipped feta and cucumbers makes for a minor brine salt kick with enough wet cucumber to take away the saltiness on the palate.  Smears with the neck bone are a pate like pig lovers dream. Sprinkle and crush the salt just enough on it and it becomes even better.  The charred green cauliflower is made crispy and pulls a fantastic crunch with the lightly seasoned dusted bread crumbs.Pigs tail in balsamic is a succulent fall off and fatty scrumptious deal, fitting in nicely with a turkey leg that has the meat fall of the bone and tendons, topped with some crunchy sprinkled lentils on top giving it some earthy goodness.   Grilled octopus cooked just right mixed in with great seasoned roasted potatoes and salsa.  Razor clams slight bite and mixed with lemon and garlic oil?  what is not to love?The food items here BURST with flavors, but all compliment each other nicely.  Pistachios and lentils appear in places I would have never expected them, but they work out fantasticaly.For drink, skip the beer, go straight for the wine which is EXTENSIVE but also providing plenty of choices by the glass as well.  Hey it does say wine and swine on the sign right?If I were to have desert I would have exploded.  Finishing off with a simple espresso does the deal.A once in a lifetime meal, and I am sure 8000 calories to boot, but hey who is complaining?!  Would go again to have the other 20 items on the menu I couldn't have."
My favorite dish was the brioche dessert stuffed with ricotta and Nutella.  The rest of the dishes were disappointing.  I prefer Avec.
"This was the first restaurant my bf and I stopped in when we were in Chicago. I liked the general decor of the restaurant, didn't mind the communal tables. It does get quite loud, but we were still able to carry a conversation during our dinner. What we ordered:Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- I've had my fair share of bone marrow at numerous restaurants, I wouldn't say this was the best I ever had. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers, and Fried Egg- I love the idea, the flavors went very well together. It was just slightly too salty with no carbs to mellow it out.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- definitely our favorite dish. The pork just melts in your mouth. Wish we had room to try more dishes. I loved though that the dishes were quite small so that we could try a little bit of everything."
"Two simple facts: 1. When you go to Chicago, you go to eat2. When you're in Downtown Chicago, you go to  The Purple PigThe number of positive reviews already speak to the food and the quality - my only advice would be to be adventurous (and the number of creative dishes definitely allows you to be so) otherwise you might end up getting stuck with something you could have ordered anywhere else but with half the wait...the lines are ridiculously long even late at night!"
"+ nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long waiting timeSince it isn't that easy to find a nice hang-out on Magnificent Mile, which is not a rooftop bar and where you can sit outside without being blared by music I was happy to find 'The Purple Pig'.I have to admit that it is hard to get a table without a longer waiting time but the wait is worth it. The menu offers decent European wines, most of them for less than $40 a bottle and tasty tapas/small plates you can share with your companions. But the most important you can spend hours talking and have an enjoyable evening with friends without being interrupted by noise.If you cannot decide on the menu try the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the spreads, and the artichoke, potatoes and asiago cheese appetizer.The restaurant's inside also looked promising but I guess it will be noisy.+ nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long waiting timeAverage price for a plate: $10Average price for a bottle of wine: $35"
"Honestly, I think this place is a little* over-hyped, BUT I did enjoy the meal. All in all, a SUPER rich meal. I understand now why our waiter raised his eyebrow when we put our order in and wondered if we wanted another dish. What he meant was a vegetable dish.We started of with the Roasted Bone Marrow. Yes, this was good, rich, and super fattiness to spread on slices of baguettes topped with some oil drenched parsley and capers.Next we got the Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and a fried egg on top. I'm not sure if the egg was supposed to be sunnyside up (looked like it), but it was a tad on the over cooked side and wasn't runny at all. The pig's ear was super crunchy and I couldn't really tell it was pig's ear (as I've had it braised before so you can taste the flavor). It tasted like overdone to a crisp fry. The crispy kale was my favorite out of the dish. Go figure. The least favorite was the pickled cherry peppers, which completely took away from the entire dish and overwhelmed all the flavors.Lastly, we had the milk braised pork shoulder. By this time, I was a little pigged out from all the richness. The pork shoulder was nice and tender, but a little bit on the salty side. Even after everything we had, I could still taste the saltiness in the dish. We had a great Syrah from the Corbieres region of France. This medium bodied berry wine went great and held it's own with the rich meal we had.We finished it off with the Sicilian Iris, which was a deep fried brioche (think donut) filled with ricotta and chocolate chip. Very good and it was lightly powdered with cinnamon sugar. Yum!Next time in Chicago we will probably be back as the bf enjoyed this meal a tad more than I did, but will be prepared for the dollar amount spent this time NOT $$ as Yelp as reviewed, but more like $$$ :)"
"I must get wine if I do come back to this place. I believe they have a good selection of drinks to choose from. This place is packed! When I went here, there was a long table which the staff seated several different groups at once. I didn't mind that part except it was a little loud to hear what my friends were saying. I don't remember what I ordered but the food was great and overall, I enjoyed eating here."
"Our server Azar was amazing!!!! So nice and suggested the best dishes.  (Calamari with freehold, radishes, cucumbers & pistachios AND asparagus with arugula, Trevino & hazlenuts salad.) I definitely recommend this place and will make it a point to go back when I'm in Chicago again."
"The Purple Pig  is still excellent.  We got 5 of us in on a Sunday with no wait. (Lucky!)Shared a TON of things--pig platter, beef marrow (not my thing, but the  rest really liked it), lardo (good), cauliflower  (GREAT), pork shoulder (still wonderful), pig tail (excellent), pig ears (Really good), peas and bacon (very good).   Got the pig theme here?Since we didn't drink much, we got out of there for about $25 per person.Service was so-so.  We were seated and helped and watered just fine initially, but the waiter kind of disappeared after that.  I had to ask for clean plates (never have to ask for clean plates at the Publican)."
"The wait for here was really really really long!!! My friend and I came around 6 and were told it would be an hour-long wait so I ran to get a look from the John Hancock tower. Finally an hour and a half later we were seated in a very ambient corner. I ordered the chicken kabob and my friend order a few tapas that I don't quite recall. Everything he got was very yummy and my chicken in the tzatiziki sauce was UH-MAZING!!!! It was so moist and the sauce was so delicious I had to try and not lick my plate clean. My biggest complaint was the noise level. I think it must have been just that night but the table behind us had an extremely loud group of friends to the point where my friend and I were laughing with the table next to us about how obnoxious the noise level was. It really made for an uncomfortable dinner.Regardless, the food was really good and next time I'm back I want to try their cheese plates."
"My co-workers and I came here for lunch since we work in the neighborhood and have always wanted to try it out. We got here around 11:15am (they open at 11:30) so we waited outside until they opened. By the time 11:30 rolled around there were probably 12 people in line behind us! This place gets CRAZY packed- by the time it was noon the whole restaurant was filled. I would definitely suggest if you can get here right at 11:30am for lunch you'll be good :) Otherwise, welcome to the world of waiting for a restaraunt in Chicago... The food however was awesome! Each one of us ordered something different and we all loved our meals. I ordered the pork-shoulder which was amazing. I would definitely go back here again, I just don't know abou this whole waiting in line for over an hour... I love food, but not enough to wait for 2 hours!"
Everything is just perfect! You get to try such a variety of flavors that your taste buds just love! It is always crowded but the wait is worth it! Small plates but great to share when ordering several. A must if on Michigan Ave.
"Purple is making a comeback. Pigs are making a comeback. Purple+Pig=long ass wait (but worth it)After attempting to come here once, but wanting to come here every day, the wait on a Friday night at 6:30 for two posed to be quite accurate- 1.5 hours. We hopped over to Eno for wine and cheese and came back just in time. We started with the shaved brussel sprouts with parmesan, moved to soppresetta and jamon cut meats to milk-braised pork shoulder, mussels, and pistachio gelato.The food (pics included):Shaved brussel sprouts--awesome and light with the perfect amount of cheeseCured meats-delicious and saltyMilk-braised Pork shoulder-soooo tender. covered in mashed potatoes if I remember correctly. I could have eaten 4 plates of this...and I don't even like pork.Mussels-flavorful broth, semi small portionPistachio gelato-big portion, but nice and lightOther notes:Our service was great. The beer selection was very small.Communal tables available, and two seatersIf you're willing to wait, put your name in and go shopping at Nordstroms or grab a drink or 5 at the bar.You might as well get your fill of Purple Pig now, because once the weather gets better, your wait time might double!"
"Went around 5 pm to avoid the dinner rush.  Extremely creative menu; my wife and I were deliberating what to try for quite a while before going with a calamari and radish salad (awesome), chorizo stuffed olives (good), and milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (awesome).  The chef is a master of cooking pork and there are all kinds of cuts available.  The wine prices will get you--if you are going to drink wine, just go ahead and order a bottle, otherwise you are getting gouged."
Very good food. Good service. Great winelist. Maybe not worth 2 1/2 hr. wait though...
"Exceedingly impressed. Better than I expected.Ate:-shredded brussel sprouts - yum!-pig's ear with crispy kale - my favorite dish, never had pig's ear before but this was an awesome starting dish-bone marrow - a little heard to spread, but delicious otherwise-pork jowl - bold flavors, awesome mix of textures, second favorite dish-pork blade steak- least favorite but still good-wagyu sirloin tip - tasty! love the added potatoes and olivesIntense dishes with lots of strong flavors, but very different from anything I've had.  Very tasty- highly recommended! One of my new favorite in the city."
"My husband and I eat lunch and dinner out several times a week. I don't know why this place gets such great reviews. It was only okay in both of our opinions. Our panini was flavorful, but the meat on our panini was fatty which I find gross. The fried olives had a smoky flavor and were not very good. The only thing we really liked was the meatball and arugula slider. We didn't like the table set up. I don't want to sit at a table with a bunch of people I don't know. At one point, I saw the guy next to us scoping out what was in my purse. That's too close for comfort."
Delicious--wait time was around 30 minutes on a Saturday night (which is not bad at all) and had the bone marrow and some other meat and cheese dishes.
"I have been here multiple times in the last 2 years---quality stays the same.This is really 4.5 stars--a little dent due to the occassional long lines and loudness of the space.  I have probably had about 75% of the food menu through my many meals here.  One tip for newbies: this food is rich, savory, and full fat.  This means that when your server suggests you order 2-3 plates per person, take into account how much of this style of food you can actually eat AND bear in mind that they have an awesome dessert donut thing that you have to order.  (because I dream about this thing and think about it often--it is that good)  I think their recommendation is too high.  Other than that I recommend that you be adventurous as this isn't your typical menu, share with friends so you can order more, and ask for a wine pairing because they have a good selection.  You really can't go wrong with the menu."
"I hate to say this but this place is over rated. Be sure to order a glass of wine or beer to wash down the salt!Salt roasted beets - nothing special. You get a bowl of beets and a glob of goat cheese. Why is it $6?Roasted bone marrow spread - Probably the most interesting dish. The bone marrow spread didn't have much flavor. Most interesting thing about it was the texture. Pig's ear - Way too salty. Wasn't crunchy and you end up with an oil film in your mouth. Milk braised pork shoulder - pork was very tender but once again... way too salty. Pork sweetbreads - They're pretty much pork ""chicken"" nuggets with way too much breading. But the peach sauce complimented the nuggets very well.Pork blade steak with 'nduja' & honey - Probably the only dish that didn't leave me wanting to chug a glass of wine/water after every bite. The pork is very tender and well seasoned. My company found the 'nduja' to be the most interesting part of the dish. We were trying to guess what it was until we noticed a piece of paper above us explaining some terms on the menu. You'll have to go yourself to find out what 'nduja' is :)It's definitely worth trying and an experience. I have a feeling you either love it or hate it. I'm sure after reading my review...you know which side I'm on."
"Awesome place! Tried it for the first time today. Dish sizes are small but gives an opportunity to try many dishes. We tried 9 different plates amongst the 3 of us. Love the ""jlt"" sandwich (jaw sandwich), the braised pork shoulders, and the foie gras spread.Review Written 12/31/11 but didn't complete till march"
"As my group of 7 arrived, we were told that it would be around 40 minutes.  Well after 75 minutes, I was ready to kill someone.  But after we sat down, we were ready to kill the pig ourselves.  I suggested that we let the server choose for us and she brought us The Purple Pig Platter (a variety of cured meats) and a variety of cheeses.  Did I ever mention to you that I LOVE cheese.We also got fried olives, a corn/tomato dish, roasted bone marrow, sardines, pork liver pate and pork neck bone rillette.Well, the food was terrific.  The recommendations from our waitress were spot on.  And the tapas style worked perfectly with our larger group.I hoarded on the cheeses and pork neck smear.  The liver pate and bone marrow smears were tasty.  The charcuterie were cured and slice paper thin - yummy.The vibe is energetic.  And if the weather is nice, it's great to eat outdoors.So just expect a much longer wait than what they tell you.  But the food is really good."
"I GUESS WE WILL NEVER KNOWCame to Chicago for a mother/ daughter culinary adventure. The purple pig was on the top of our list. It was at the top because of all the Yelp Reviews. We walked in and asked the ""host"" (I say host because in my rush and excitement to experience this much anticipated destination I asked if this was the ""hostess station"") You enter from the side patio so it's not obvious). There were 2 females and a male standing at the podium. The male got snappy and told me I was at the ""host"" station. I apologized and asked if there was room for two. He sauntered over to a long bar table with community seating to let us know he was ticked off. He plopped down our menus  and left. I felt like we were being punished. I might add there we plenty of tables but it was made clear we were not going to be blessed with a table. Bad customers get this spot. My daughter and I looked at each other stunned. There are SO MANY choices in Chicago. We came to this great city to indulge in all it has to offer. We stood up and left. Is the Purple Pig management aware that the ""host"" is representing the restaurant in such a poor manner? We'll never know if the Purple Pig is worthy of all the praise. We left with a bad taste in our hearts"
"This place might be the most crowded I've ever seen a restaurant.  The wait was 2.5 hours for a 2 person table with most people willing to duke it out.  I, instead, stalked the bar and grabbed two seats since they serve the full menu there.  I think I would have rated Purple Pig higher but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it.  I would not wait 2+ hours for it.  The food is good but again it seems like many of the good gastropubs that are in LA.  I do love the variety and wish I could have tried more, but what I did have didn't blow my mind.  For one, I was so excited by foie gras (since CA banned it), that I immediately ordered that, but what I got tasted kind of like foie gras diluted with butter.  It was so so heavy that I could still feel my heart struggling to beat the next morning.   I would avoid it and I've never said that about foie ever."
"I'm a big fan of small plates. I love sharing food! So the idea of The Purple Pig is so great to me. Both times I've been here I've felt that the line wasn't too bad (since I went either pretty late or pretty early). I tried the follow things:Beets with goat cheese and pistachios: First time really pretty good, interesting texture, second time wayyyy too salty. Inedible, even.Prosciutto: whoa crazy good. Crazy. Crazy. Get it.Delice de Bourgogne: a fantastic cheese if you like soft, French cowmilk cheeses.Bone marrow: GREAT. Get extra bread for this one.Braised pork shoulder: Really good the first time, but also almost inedibly salty the second time.Manila claims: Pretty good, but nothing to call home about.It seems to be that this place is pretty good, but also pretty variable."
"I decided to come check this place out since it looked like there was always a crowd there.  We came around 530ish which was perfect timing since it didn't start to get crowded till around 6. I ordered the roasted corn and mushroom, the milk braised pork shoulder and the fried deviled egg. All the ingredients they used were so fresh, I wish we could have ordered more food but by unfortunately we were in a hurry. The portion size here are small which is great because that means you get to order a variety of things.Excellent food, will definitely have to come back again!"
"I viewed so many good reviews from other people, but the food taste really bad. We even cannot finish the food. I don't see any point of the bone mash morrow. It's so oil and it doesn't have any taste. You need to have it with salt. We were seated in front of the kitchen, which is not a good place to sit in. The service is good at least. I guess you only want to go to purple pig for adventure tasting."
"Took my family there on a Sunday around 5 to put our name down.  We had planned to be in downtown doing lots of walking so we were in our comfortable clothes and shoes.  Perhaps 'cuz we were dressed more like tourists or because we had brought our kids, the hostesses especially the dark haired one was extremely unfriendly.  Table in the outside tent was immediately available but we chose to return an hour later because we weren't very hungry.  Server dude was friendly and genuine and explained the menu well.  Started with bone marrow on a toasted bread.  It was a nice start and kids loved it.  Then we tried the calamari, not bad but very few pieces of squid rings which my kids weren't very happy about.  Milk braised pork was marinated well but tasted like cheap boiled meat.  Pig ear was good but after a few sticks, we started getting a little queasy.  Octopus was ok, again nothing special.  We were still hungry so we ordered a plate of sweet bread.  That was pretty bad and I highly suggest that they take that off of their menu.  We're still not very clear what that was and what was in it.  Overall a bit too oily so on the way to our car, I stopped off at corner bakery and got some sprite to wash it all down."
"The two hour wait was worth it! Heard so much about this place when we were in Chicago. The eggplant caponata itself was worth every minute we spent. The service was great, I asked the guy to surprise us with the dessert and oh my lord, the sicilian iris was so mouthwatering! This restaurant is enough for me to want to move to Chicago! Can't wait to come back. ;)"
"Oh you devil, you purple pig!  I thought I was stopping in for a brief tour of your menu, but I got an unforgettable 2 hour multi- orgasmic experience!  (I didn't think it was possible, but never say never...)How you turned me on:-expert and pleasant staff help to guide my menu/drink choices-mouth watering dishes served promptly despite a full dining room -intense flavors that could not be improved-excellent and affordable full wine and bar selectionI only regret that this was a fling, and I returned home after our meeting.""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
Amazing food and great staff I love this place it is very busy but yet the food comes very fast and the staff is very friendly. Can't wait to go back and try the bone marrow.
"small bustling place in the middle of downtown chicago.  seats available on tables, communal tables, high tops facing the kitchen.i came here by myself and luckily had a seat immediately by the high tops facing the tiny kitchen.  got to see how food was made and executed! got the fried pigs ears and bone marrow.pig ears were delicious!! cut super thin and fried to crispy goodness. i wish they were a bit thicker to get the full texture of pig ears.  served on top of generously salted fried kale and topped with sunny side up egg.  love the piggy bowl it came in.bone marrow was ok.  not a big fan of it. it became overly greasy for me (maybe bc of the pig ears as well).  spread on buttered toasts, sprinkle of sea salt, and some crunch from salad.  lovely presentation.dessert-i really wanted to try the silician, rec by my friends...but they didnt have it.  got the salted caramel soft serve rec by the waitress.  i love a good salted caramel dessert....this one was ok.  they had a mix up on who ordered it..so it was sitting by the counter for a little until i told them i think that is mine.  was a little melted but that was ok.  didnt have a full caramel taste as i wanted. sea salt was delicious.  i would imagine a place like this to add candied bacon on top...but they wanted to watch the weight, i suppose.overall, i liked the menu. food can get a bit toooo greasy but it tastes good.  i want to go back to try some of their salads and other piggy dishes!"
"I've got a tall drink of water to impress and we're downtown... where to go? One familiar Polish bartender (see previous review), one bottle of crisp Slovakian Pinot Grigio, some of the best 'date' conversation I've ever had, and two small plates later, I was only hungry for more.The one caveat that almost derailed a textbook-perfect rendezvous? The bacon lard on crostini smear. No, the name on the menu isn't 'bacon lard', but that's what it was. The greasy appearance and slick texture was not only off-putting but rather unappetizing. It was almost pizza-like in the sense of when you bit the crostini, the entire layer of fat slid off. Not an aesthetically-pleasing dish! However, I really enjoyed the Jamon Serrano, oyster mushrooms, and fried egg atop grilled bread. It was like an upscale take on a classic breakfast sandwich, and the oyster mushrooms are essentially potent flavor morsels. Delicious! Well, almost as delicious as my date.The bar is still the place to be, and a place to be seen (as evidenced by a full bar on a chilly Monday night). And the wine list (served in three different size denominations) is globally deep and simply fantastic. Yes... I'm still crushing."
The Purple Pig is a cool place with a great location.  And the bone marrow is A-Maz-ing!   I will be back!
"This is the type of place that us urbanites love to avoid.  Has a fancy address on Michigan Avenue. Check!  Has a crowded, uninspired patio with little sunlight packed on a summer afternoon.  Check!  High prices for once trendy food that has been commonly available for awhile now. Check!  Sadly, I think The Purple Pig is now attracting a mixture of touristas, surburbanites and faux hipsters.I will say the food was good, but not great.  The prices for small plates that really didn't encompass any expensive ingredients were high.  I must also say the portions are small even for ""small"" plates.  (While TPP is noted as moderately priced $$, it is definitely on the very high-end of the range for those with even an average appetite.)  Just so you know, I eat everything and I am a very experimental eater.  I totally get the hoof-to-jowl movement.  But, Hello! Fatty pork cuts and bones are not expensive ingredients. Roasted Bone Marrow -  This seems to be the pork belly of the 2010s except pork belly actually tastes like something and is amazing.  When they tell you it's like butter, spread it on the bread and sprinkle on some course salt and fresh herbs, ask yourself if this really is such a big deal.  In my opinion, this dish needs to be something more than just a fatty, gelatinous, lightly flavored spread.Sepia (cuttlefish) -  A tiny handful of chewy strips.  The dressing of herbs and nuts was interesting, but this was served in a small ramekin dish.Razor Clams - About five or six overcooked razor clams drizzled with a pesto and piled up like Lincoln Logs to give the dish volume.  Tip: Find an Asian restaurant in Chinatown or Uptown who will serve you a big bowl of these unusually-shaped, delicious clams for the same price.Pork Jowel, Tomato and Duck Egg (""JLT"") - Basically a piece of bacon-style pork cheek and an egg on greens.  Tip:  Order applewood-smoked bacon and eggs at a nice breakfast spot in town.Milk-braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - This was the best dish of our afternoon.  A very nice, tender, milky piece of pork.  It just tore apart beautifully with a gentle motion of the fork.  Tip: Before you get excited about mashed potatoes, I think the pork was quickly dipped in mashed potatoes because they make a cameo appearance in this dish."
Amazing pork inspired food! Try the pig ears with kale... You will not regret it. Great atmosphere for after work drinks and tapas style sharing plates.
"OMG meatfest. Meatfest party in my mouth. Makes me so happy. Things to prepare yourself and make the most of your Purple Pig experience:* No reservations--get over it. Get there earlier than you'd want to eat and have a drink or nine. And if you're lucky, they'll bring you these roasted pig-fat almonds (not the correct name)* There may be a few drunken tourists there. Just give them dirty looks and move on with eating your meat.* You're likely going to get bumped. Again--get over it and eat your meat.* A few of the must haves (likely not the right names): fried olives, cucumber feta frappe, milk-braised pork shoulder, pigs ear.Most of all--enjoy the fried goodness."
Everything I have had here has been impressive. Great wine list and knowledgeable servers. Each dish is the delicious. Try the goat cheese and eggplant smear and the bone marrow. Will not disappoint.
PHENOMENAL.  Just go.  You'll be happy you did.  We tried the crispy pig ear with kale - great!The beat and goat cheese salad option - delicious!Turkey leg - awesome!
"The hassles of getting a table at the Purple Pig were NOT worth it because the food is mediocre. Salt + Salt + Pig = Purple PigWe went to Purple Pig during a trip to Chicago last week. On Friday night we tried to get a table at 8PM, and was told there would be a 3 hour wait... We decided to come back the next day instead for lunch when it opened at 11:30, and we were promptly seated at the outside communal table. We were hungry, so we ordered the bone marrow, pork tripe Ala Parmigiana, octopus, fried pork ears, pork shoulder, and razor clams. All dishes recommended by Yelpers. However, none of the dishes had any uniqueness and taste. The bone marrow was bland, and is overwhelmed by the bread and caper. The pork tripe and octopus are so salty, you can't even taste what you're eating. The fried pork ears was a MAJOR disappointment. It was so finely chopped and fried to a crisp, you can't taste the flavor of pig ear anymore. The pork shoulder was tender, a little bit on the salty end. The razor clams were pretty good, definitely the best dish we had at PP. There are much better restaurants at Chicago to experience than waste your time and money at the Purple Pig."
Excellent tapas style eats.  It was a great time out on the patio with shared tables. The wait staff steered us well for the cheeses as well.  This is a place that you are better served by going as a moderate size group so you all can enjoy many different tastes.
"ah the purple pig was EXCELLENT. i love the swanky upscale feel of this place. the bone marrow was plentiful but extremely fatty, so be prepared to have some arteries clogged. the octopus was delicious, succulent, and flavorful but pricey ($15) for 2 tentacles plus fingerling potatoes and string beans. the milk braised pork shoulder was FANTASTIC. it literally melts in your mouth. this dish is highly recommended!!! for dessert, we got the sicilian iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche). the texture of the brioche was absolutely perfect it was a wonderful dessert that was not too sweetwait on a saturday night was 1.5 hours, as expected, but open seating at the bar! luckily, there just happened to be 2 seats open for me and my friend so bring a good friend or a date on a busy night and stake out the bar seats!"
"My hubby and I went for lunch. It was perfect. We ordered a bit too much, but it was all good, so we over ate! the raw corn salad was crunchy and refreshing. We also had the feta spread. The flavors were strong and good. We also split a panini and the roast pork shoulder. The panini was superb. The pork shoulder was very good... but the least fav of what we ordered. Service was efficient. We ate outside under the shade of their purple umbrellas. It was a wonderful relaxing way to take a break from the bustle downtown.The place is small, so I was glad we went at lunch and ate outside. I don't think I would try to go for dinner. I assume it must be too crowded."
"Long long long wait and NO RESERVATION! There are definitely some delicious  dishes like milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes,  wagyu sirloin tip with fingerling potatos and bone marrow.  But 2 HOURS waiting kills the experience.  thanks but no thanks!"
"Oh awesome purple pig. You are wonderful!!!!!I absolutely love this place. bang in the middle of the magnificent mile, this place is always bustling with people. If you want to get a table here you are going to have to wait, but for sure the wait is worth it.Having been here for lunch, i can say that the tapas made here are absolutely delicious. They change as per the season you are visiting the restaurant as they try to capture the flavor of the season in locally grown and acquired produce and crops.You can grab a seat at the bar or a high center table or other tables. the restaurant is a little tightly packed though.The wine and beer selection is pretty impressive and the service is fabulous.The price might seem to be on the higher side but when compared to other restaurants that do contemporary food, I think this place is priced at about average.Surely try to grab a seat if you are wandering down the magnificent mile and enjoy the small plate delicacies this place has to offer."
Amazing place to share small plates!
"This place gets packed during dinner and it's definitely a different dining experience than if you go for brunch. The one time we went for dinner we were squished between people on the communal table. This is why I now tend to come here only for weekend brunch right around 11:30 when they open. Note that you can go in through the building to the right of the outdoors entrance as sometimes they don't open the outdoors gate until a little bit after 11:30, doesn't matter in the summer, but on a cold winter day, waiting 5 mins outside matters.Service is great if you come early as there aren't as many patrons and the waiting staff isn't quite as swamped. The food has been very consistent in the now ~10 times I've been here. Recently I began trying some dishes that were off my list of staples for purple pig such as1) Cauliflower- not a veggies kind of person, so normally I fill the table with meat dishes, but I was in a particular kind of mood for some cauliflower this past weekend and decided to give it a shot. It was delicious! I almost ordered another one.2) Pork live pate- again a new dish for me, normally I go with the neck bone marrow spread but decided to try something new. Creamy, flavorful, until you realize just how much there is in an order. The fattiness of the pate becomes somewhat overwhelming at the end of the meal for the two of us as there was a very good portion given to us. So I do advise perhaps ordering this when you have a party of 3 or 4 so it doesn't get overwhelming."
"The vibe at this place is great.  5 chef's in the kitchen that go non-stop, a bar that is constantly turning out great drinks, and staff which are super attentive and friendly. It's almost like you are watching a show while eating dinner :).  Unique place, fun time, memorable experience, worth visiting.Resounding 4 stars.  There is quite the selection to choose from on the menu and would have loved to taste everything if we had the time.  It's best done tapas style, with everyone sharing but there were folks there by themselves having a few plates as well.  Interesting food combinations, Greek/Italian influences in many of the dishes, and some great cocktails (vodka made from semolina!!).  Also you may get a table or you may sit at one of the communal tables, but there is plenty of room and it's fun to see what other people are eating.We had:- Charred Cauliflower - roasted, has pickles in it, crunchy breadcrumbs on top.  We did find it quite salty though, and thought just a bit of honey or something sweet drizzled on top would have balanced it all out nicely.  Still good.- Olive Oil-Poached Tuna - ours had green beans and some red peppers in it with the tuna.  Nice dish, good balance, fresh tasting.  Would recommend.- Fried Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale - ok I've never had pigs ear before...I can say I've had it now.  It was ok but nothing special I wouldn't order it again...wishing we had gotten the chorizo stuffed olives - Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta - I was thinking it would be a brown pork gravy, like you would have on a pork roast or something like that.  It was really a tomato based sauce and man was it delicious.  Highly recommend...would have had 2 if we weren't so full.- Fois Gras & Membrillo - Toasted bread rounds, Fois Gras is put into a spread form, then has a dipping sauce of the Membrillo (a sweet spread made from quince fruit, like jam).  It was good if you like fois gras.- Octopus with Green Beans, potato and salsa verde - Octopus was amazingly tender, I have no clue how they did it but it was bbq'd and just amazing (could cut it with your fork).  Was expecting some more memorable seasoning or sauce on this one but would order again just to eat the octopus.  - Pork Osso Bucco - So tender, great sauce, Polenta was ok, gremolata was great.  You have to break it apart and make sure you roll it in the sauce though.  The pork alone is good but the sauce makes it.- Pork blade steak - Ohhhh mama.  Blade steak thin and seasoned well.  Ours had some mustard greens on top I think.  Alone those two were ok...but when you mix that with the home made chorizo, just insane.  Blade steak, chorizo, greens in a single bite it was heaven.- Sicilian Iris - Great dessert, just get it, it's delicious- Loukoumades - meh, they were ok but not amazing- Saw the turkey leg at the table beside us, it looked great (confit style). Many of the dishes you should stir up as the sauce settles to the bottom (best bites right at the end) so don't be afraid to mix it up.At the end of the night we wanted to thank the chef for a great experience but he was crazy busy.  Before we left Jimmy Jr. took the time to come over and chat with us, just a classy thing to do.  We appreciated it.  His Dad owns and runs Heaven on Seven, so we are going to go there next time...after visiting this place again :)"
"A small, intimate restaurant with amazing food and a stellar wine list that's also a good value ... all on Michigan avenue?  Is it true?  Absolutely. As a local Chicagoan, I tend to avoid many of the restaurants along Michigan avenue since they are generally geared toward tourists and/or are overpriced compared to all of the lovely neighborhood gems.  However, I've been proven wrong.The restaurant itself is much smaller than I expected with tables lining along the windows and the one wall, and diners also lined up at the bar to taste the tapas.  The decor is simple, but well done to feel like a Mediterranean tapas bar.The wine menu is extensive with pages of Greek, Spanish, French and Italian wines - many of which are under $40 a bottle.  The cheeses are exquisite and sourced from Pastoral which I love.  We opted to try new ones, and really enjoyed the recommendations from our waiter.  The pork shoulder was tender and just fell apart, while the black cod offered a lighter option accented with grapefruit.  The Sicilian Iris for dessert, a splurge in the calorie department, was a wonderful doughnut meets canoli creation.Downside is that it can become very congested around 7-8pm as people wait for a table since there is no good spot to stand in the restaurant without being in someone's way.  Just a result of the no reservations policy."
"So last night, I finally got to devour the porky goodness at Purple Pig with some French friends (yes, I'm still obsessed with France and Frenchies). We had made plans to meet at PP between 6:30 and 7. A busy time, but one at which everyone was available. Personally, despite our long wait, I really loved the food and I would love to go back (especially to try the dessert!)I arrived at PP at about 6:40 and waited for my friends to arrive. I put my name on the list (thank God, there was a wait of over an hour so I'm glad I got my name down instead of waiting for everyone to arrive first). One of the servers took my drink order (dirty martini, up, 3 olives) and it helped to pass the time waiting for everyone to show up. My friends began to trickle in at about 7:00 and we were asked to wait in the back of the restaurant. We formed a circle in the back hallway and passed the time drinking more martinis and catching up. Although the wait was really long, we all wanted to try the food at PP. At one point during our wait, my friend spilled some of her dirty martini. Oh and btw, the staff had also made up some olives stuffed with blue cheese, specially for our martinis! I call that GREAT service. When my friend spilled some of her drink, they brought out another mini carafe of vodka to refill her glass! Free booze = awesome. When we finally sat down, this is what we ordered:Marinated OlivesLaughing Bird Shrimp and Clams with RosamarinaWinter Squash Arancini & Sage PestoPanini: Salami Toscana, Goat Chese, Black Olive TapenadeJamon SerranoCheese: Bucheron, Podda, some blue cheeseA la plancha: Jamon Serrano, Oyster Mushrooms, Fried Egg with Grilled BreadSepia with Almonds and Fried RosemaryThere were also 2 different white wines that my friend chose, but I have no idea which ones they were. Regardless, they were delicious.My fave dishes out of the above were the: Laughing Bird Shrimp and Clams with Rosamarina (like a delicious cold seafood orzo), the Panini (a wonderful combo of flavors), and the Plancha dish (you cannot keep me away from fried eggs).I really wasn't disappointed by anything and there was so much more I would have liked to try. I really appreciated the service we got at the restaurant. We weren't sure if a 6th person was going to join us. He did show up right at the moment when we were sitting down and they deftly added another chair for us. It was great! Also, gratuity was already included in the check, so that made things a lot easier."
"The Purple Pig was perfectly paired for our party's purposes: after dinner drinks and snacking.  The Pork Pâté was really impressive, and I thought the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta was also very good, but just not quite as good as the Pâté.  The Jamon Serrano and selection of cheeses (we opted for an omakase selection) were both very solid.  I thought the MIlk Braised Pork Shoulder was just okay, though I admittedly did not have much of it.Hats off to our bearded server, who was incredibly knowledgeable and more than able to help us with selections of wine.  The 2007 Domaine Anne Gros Echezeaux, ""Les Loachausses"", Grand Cru was a great recommendation (admittedly at a pretty healthy markup, but I suppose you have to pay that Michigan Avenue rent somehow).  He also expertly guided us through a stronger red wine and then a lighter white wine to end the evening.I cannot help but compare The Purple Pig to Avec.  I think the food options at Avec are superior; but as far as the general atmosphere and restaurant environment, I prefer The Purple Pig.Protip: They turn the lights back on full at 2:00am closing time.  Ouch! ^ ^;;"
"The thing that left the biggest impression here @ Purple Pig is the fact that they actually have QC for their dishes. We were here, eager to try the signature milk braised pork shoulder dish, but was informed about 30-45 mins into our meal that the chef has decided to pull the dish for the night after having had a few of them sent back for being too salty. I've never had a restaurant take this extreme step because it ultimately means lost product and revenue for them. But for a restaurant to actually recognize that something is wrong with their dish and just pull it altogether rather than risking unhappy customers, that takes a dedication to happy taste buds. Additionally they offered the replacement dish (whichever one we chose from the entree section) complimentary. That was great because we tried the pork blade steak, which we wouldn't have before, and it was actually pretty good.Other than that, the service is good. We also ordered the pork and ricotta smear, the chorizo stuffed fried olives, the bread balls, the fried pig ears, and the bone marrow smear. I have to say that after having noshed on a variety of bone marrow in the past, this one was probably the least impressive, so I wouldn't recommend that dish. It tasted more fatty than flavorful, and needed some additional layers of seasoning. The fried olives and bread balls were okay. The pork and ricotta smear were really good on the first few bites but then quickly became too rich and salty. The fried pig ears were fantastic though. When you have the right combination and proportion of fried pig ears, banana peppers, fried basil, and the lot, all the textures and the flavors complement each other perfectly.Considering the reasonable prices and the good portions, this is definitely one of the places I would go with friends and family or even in larger groups. Great place for get togethers. Note: If you're sensitive to being disturbed during your meal make sure to not sit at the long bar tables at the end of the bar on the patio. I had to move at least 4 times during my meal so that people could get in and come out of their seats that were situated in the middle of the tables."
"Amazing beets, pork shoulder, and bone marrow!"
"LOVEDLOVEDLOVED the scallops over some delicious chickpea spread. Well cooked, great flavor and excellent value (4 total scallops).LOVEDDDDDDDDDD the pigs ear-duck egg-mushroom. I don't know what it is about a duck egg that is so genius. And by the way, pigs ear tastes alot like the cured meats you get a wine bars or in spanish sandwiches. The ingredients are quality, but I just wish it didn't cost a whopping $10.Ofcourse, as expected, I liked the milk braised pork shoulder. Tender and tasty.Things that I liked unexpectedly....- The chicken thigh: 3 small thigh tenderloins served per skewer, 2 skewers total. Served on a plate of tzaziki sauce and crispy potatoes. I NEVER order chicken at restaurants because it's usually too boring, but I would recommend this one.- Deep fried chorizo stuffed olives. I typically hate that kind of thing, but the shell was perfectly crispy and didn't taste heavy of oil.- Insalata Bianca - There's a crunch at the end of each bite from the Arborio rice, and overall it's just a really tasty and refreshing dish. The OK's and meh's:- Antipasta Beets - not too innovative, but they were good nonetheless and served in a vinaigrette.- Panini's are... well, panini's. Duh. I would skip, not too exciting.- Pork Saltimboca tastes like a salty, compressed porkchop. Decent but I would skip this next time.- Sea Bass was not memorable and not chilean. Read: tastes like halibut, and not very flavorful. Skip.- Brussel sprouts. Ew. Who eats brussel sprouts these days? They serve this chopped/sliced thinly so it looks like slaw. - Their desserts weren't too impressive. I got the banana nutella marshmallow panini which tastes exactly like how you might expect, but not as good because you just can't imagine how sweet that combination is until you take that first bite."
"To be fair, The Purple Pig really deserves 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 because some people really cannot handle the wine part of ""swine, wine and cheese,"" and that really kills the ambience. (To be clear, this was not anyone in my party.)But other than that, The Purple Pig is fabulous. Even though the wait was obnoxiously long for a table for 4 on a week night during winter, that was only if you wanted to wait for a table INSIDE -- if you had no objection to sitting in a tented area outside with heat lamps, you could be seated immediately. And we were.Our waitress was nothing short of fabulous. She was bubbly and friendly and had extensive knowledge of the menu. We trusted her so much, we let her pick the cheeses for our cheese plate, and a good bottle of sweet white wine to go with it. As far as food went, we went with exactly what she recommended, as well, and we were not disappointed.The fried pig's ears came in this SUPER cute pig-shaped dish, and, mixed with some fried egg, was an awesomely savory treat; the crispy kale lacked any bitterness, and the pickled cherry peppers gave the dish an awesome bite. The roasted bone marrow looked like a couple of volcanoes, and, spread on some crostini, was divine. The turkey leg confit looked, smelled, and tasted nice and smoky, much better than anything you'd get at a Disney theme park. The milk-braised pork shoulder was a little too salty for our tastes, but hey, the boys had to eat something!The way to go here is to order a few small plates and share: If you're an adventurous eater at all, you definitely don't want to miss out on anything this place has to offer!I'm disappointed to think that, during the summer, everyone WILL want outdoor seating, so I probably won't be as lucky in scoring quick seats every time I want to go to The Purple Pig, but this is one place that's worth the wait!"
"I hate beets, but I LOVED them here. I could not get enough of them.The place has a hype and a reputation for high end food and it is well earned. We had several dishes, among them things that I absolutely hate such as beets and brusel sprouts. In both of those dishes I tasted them initially mainly to be polite but much to my surprise they were not just good, they were delicious. The beets in whipped goat cheese completely warped my head, the neck bone gravy was so unbelievably good that I swear they had to lace it with pixie dust and unicorn horn grindings.I'm coming back!"
"Been wanting to check out Purple PIg ever since I saw it on Check Please. The wait...was SO worth it!To spare the time & agony of parking, W & I took the L over there. We arrived around 9:30pm & the place was bumpin. Venue looked much smaller than I expected, and since it was a party of 2, we got seated by chef's table. Didn't mind seating per se, but we asked to be seated a bit farther in a booth. Servers were attentive and accommodating. The chef was working hard along with his father. We started off with a nice glass of Prosecco; light, dry w/a hint of sweetness. Perfect pair to go along with the fatty meals to be consumed. Small plates : * Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg             ---- My fav! I love the fried egg on top and the fried pig's ear...wow. The flavor was incredible. The whole dish had a slight asian feel to it. * Pork neck bone gravy w/Calabro ricotta           ---- Thick oven toasted bread w/creamy, buttery blend of gravy. We asked for more bread & licked the plate clean. Impressed. * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/Mashed Potatoes         ------ This was the HIGHLIGHT of my night. Reminded me of korean braised short rib. The pork shoulder was so tender, and the gravy that came w/mashed potatoes was superb. Not too heavy, not too salty. We asked for a side of gravy and more bread..and they happily gave us both :)* Morcilla w/Apples, watercress, and apple saba        ----- Like Korean Soondae.             Blood pork sausages with thinly sliced apples w/sauteed watercress. It was ok. Meat wasn't as juicy, and the herbs were a bit overwhelming in this dish. All in all, the small plate concept was brilliant coz it allowed us to enjoy  the different parts of pork in small, itty bitty morsels. We chatted w/Chef Jimmy Jr & praised him for delicious meal. Next time, I wanna try Roasted Bone Marrow w/herbs and Pork Saltimbocca w/Rainbow Swiss chard. This place lived up to its hype & I will be back soooner than later. Cheese, Swine, & Wine. Oink!"
"Went here during my visit to Chicago last week.  We went at around lunch time, and the wait about 45 mins long.  We put down our name but we decided to walk around to find some snacks to hold out our hungry tummy for the feast.  We've returned to find that they had already called our party but we weren't there to claim.  They didn't throw away our reservation and set up the table for us anyway. Our first time there, the waitress was super nice.  She gave us suggestions on wine selections.  We just had to try the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs and the Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce.  I don't remember what else we tried, but these two dishes were good.  I was honestly a bit hesitant about the bone marrow because it just looked like a plate of fat.  But it was served with bread pieces and wasn't too shabby.  We ended up purchasing a to go order of the turkey leg for our friends who weren't able to join us (everything else would just be too messy to carry).  We ended up all sharing it for dinner.  Heat it up and it tasted like we just ordered it."
"I don't remember saying too many words during my visit here, since it was rare that I wasn't dipping something into something and airplaning it into my mouth. Seriously - it was so good. We took the server's suggestion on quite a few items which included: Cheese plate - We let him pick based on some preferences we gave him and they were all unique and delicious. Bone Marrow - No words. So good. Spoon it onto the bread and die happy. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - Remember what I said about dying happy after the bone marrow? Now you're just straight up in heaven. That was some of the most tender meat I have encountered in my life. This was supposed to be a light lunch date during work, so we had to cut ourselves off there but one day I'll probably just not eat for a few days, come back here, and shut. it. down."
"The Purple Pig was one of the restaurants I most wanted to try while in Chicago, but it's an extremely popular restaurant that takes no reservations, and when I called to ask how long the wait would be one night during dinner, I was told 2 1/2 hours! (And another friend who'd called independently was told THREE hours!) But then I noticed the kitchen was open until midnight Sundays, and so decided to wrangle a bunch of friends to go after a Sunday night meeting rather than before, which had us arriving at around 11:15. We STILL had a wait to get seated, but no more than 20 minutes or so. And it was worth it!I think we ordered around a dozen dishes for the five of us, including what turned out to be my favorite -- the ""JLT"" -- which is Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg. The pork fat and the runny egg yolk mingled perfectly, making it quite a sensual, visceral food experience. We also had Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic with Grated Egg & Parsley, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and more. Every dish was perfectly prepared.One of my friends is a vegetarian, so we made sure to order three dishes he could have, including the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, and they were so good that even the rest of us non-vegetarians enjoyed what he couldn't finish. So don't think vegetarians can't eat well at the Purple Pig -- well, not unless watching others gorge themselves on pig puts them off.Even though we were stuffed, I just HAD to order the panini filled with  Nutella,  Marshmallow Cream & Bananas -- the perfect gooey way to end the meal.I'm torn between rating this a 4 or a 5, because the food itself definitely deserves a 5, but due to the wait issues, think of it as a 4 1/2. I'll definitely be back ... assuming I can spare the time for a long wait during peak times or can go at odd hours."
"First off AMAZING!!!! I still think about how great the food is! We came in on a Thursday night and the place was packed. It was about an hour wait to get seated, but the outdoor waiting area allowed us to order some alcoholic beverages as well as appetizers. When we finally got seated, our server was great! He was so energetic about how great the food was and made everything sound so amazing that we wanted to order almost everything off the menu. The dishes are meant for sharing and are served tapas style. Everything I tried did not disappoint so its hard to pick and choose what I liked the most, but I have to say having never tried bone marrow before, It was so good! (But after eating it, I almost felt like I was clogging my arteries! Haha)With that said, this will definitely be a spot on my list when I'm in Chicago again! Highly recommend"
"Prepare yourself-- I don't think Purple Pig is incredible. I don't think it's great. I think it's okay at best.  Maybe it was the dinner I had at Bibou in Philadelphia that threw me off, but Purple Pig had some less-than-bright spots to go with its strengths.Let's start with the positives:- Great use of pig. Pig ear, pig tail, pig jowl, pig shoulder.  All very savory, delicious parts to start a dish.  - Large wine list.  We were able to pair our meal with a gorgeous red wine.- Overall menu looks intelligent and well done.  Negatives:- There is a long wait on a typical night.  My girlfriend and I came here on a Thursday night at 9:00pm.  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated at a large outdoor table under a tent.  Not quite what we were hoping for.- The outdoor seating is next to a major roadway.  The night was punctuated with lots of emergency vehicle sirens and big rig trucks. - We had a really really long wait for some of our dishes. I understand that there is a large demand, but 20 minutes for a tapas sized dish is wholly unacceptable. - Three of the five dishes we ordered were okay at best. If you're going to make me wait 30 minutes to be seated, you better serve up the best of the best. Highlights:- The pork jowl was ooey-gooey great and chewy.  - The wine was excellent also. We had a half bottle of a Spanish red wine.- Their take on the roasted beet and goat cheese salad was refreshing and enjoyable.Sadly, their other dishes were forgettable-- too salty, lack-luster flavor, or overly flavored (pig's ear, I'm looking in your grossly over-pickled direction).  Would I go back?  Maybe if they could price things a little lower and could seat me inside instead of in a tent next to a highway and too close to strangers who I would rather not sit next to.   Sorry Purple Pig.  You were imaginative, but lacked execution both in food and service."
"I have found my new favorite place to eat - we ordered several meals each (the theme/idea of the restaurant is to choose several size items and share) ad everything was incredible! even items that didn't necessarily 'sound' great to me that my husband ordered ended up being some of the best food I've had in a while. I didn't like that the food all came out at different times and be sure to get in early if you are planning a weekend night because this place gets packed! worth the wait, just plan ahead so you're not waiting outside starving :)"
It was excellent. Very cozy feel unless your outside. It seems like this place is always packed. The food was great. The Bar tender was very attentive not smothering. The servers on point. The plates are good portions for tapas and the prices just right. I still don't know how they get it done in such a small space but they make it work. Expect other people to jump in your convo as it can be very 'chummy'. One girl even asked me if I wanted to sample her plate while I waited on my order. Yeah people can feel very familial. Keep your hand sanitizer nearby.
"They have a great menu for experimenting with ingredients and mixtures that you almost certainly haven't tried before.  The Salted-Beet Salad and Chorizo-Stuffed Olives were fantastic.  Service was helpful and attentive.  The atmosphere was loud and crowded for my taste, but others may prefer it."
"Service: 5; even though the place was packed, we were well taken care offFood: 5; Bone marrow spread was interesting and rich,  BLT was super tasty with a fried egg on top, and the braised pork shoulder was melt in your mouth delicious. Drink: 5; Fantastic wines to choose from, though the bar can get crammed while you waitI will be back."
"I have attempted to go to The Purple Pig on a few different occasions, but I was, like many others turned away by the long wait time that was presented to me as I entered the restaurant.  I finally decided that the wait was nothing that I couldn't handle last night and I sat on their outside benches with my dinner partner drinking some champagne while waiting for our table.  After about 40 minutes we were called in and seated at one of their communal tables in between two other parties.  While I don't mind communal tables, it does take me about 5 to 10 minutes to get comfortable at such a table.  We had a party of 3 on our one side and a party of 7 on our other side.  Both were very friendly and offered their opinions on all of the wonderful food that they just ate.  After a while I eventually became aware of the fact that the man sitting directly next to me was Jimmy Bannos, the chef and part owner.  What a nice man he was!    We went with recommendations from both parties beside us, even though their recommendations were quite similar.  To start off with, we ordered the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary and Garlic, Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette, and Shaved Brussel Sprouts.  After these antipasti items we then ordered some other items on the menu, which included the Brussel Sprouts with Thyme and Lemon (from the fried items), Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (from the Smears), and Chicken Thigh Kebabs Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki (from a la Plancha, etc).   Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary and Garlic - Were absolutely fantastic!  Something seemingly simple turned out to be so delicious.  The whole garlic cloves were at first scary for me to eat whole as I thought they would taste a bit too strong, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  They were perfectly cooked and oh so tasty with the almonds.   Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette - While I have had something similar to this dish at another restaurant, I preferred this one and thought the beets were delicious and the goat cheese was wonderfully whipped into them.  Shaved Brussel Sprouts - Unfortunately I didn't feel as strongly about this dish as I did with the others.  I felt that there would be more flavor in this dish, but it was a bit bland.  Brussel Sprouts with Thyme and Lemon - Extremely good and a lot more satisfying than the Shaved Brussel Sprouts we had prior.  There was SO much flavor in this dish that it's hard to even describe.  Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - Another wonderful dish!  This dish was served with bread, already spread with goat cheese, and the eggplant caponata in a dish beside it.  There was a wide variety of flavors in the eggplant caponata and it was very delicious!  Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki - While my dinner partner didn't like this dish as much as I did, we both enjoyed the Tzatziki sauce underneath the chicken and potatoes.  She didn't enjoy the texture of the chicken, but I thought it was perfect.  While we were extremely full from all of these wonderful dishes, we made room for some dessert, which was surprisingly sent to us from the chef.  Such a nice gesture!  We had two of the soft serve ice cream flavors, the salted caramel being my favorite of the two.  Then we had the Sicilian Iris, a ricotta and chocolate chip filled fried brioche.  It was doughy on the inside and the ricotta and chocolate chip filling had so much flavor.  A wonderful dolci item!  I would definitely recommend this place.  I am a big fan of sharing dishes and this is the perfect place to do so.  Everything comes out pretty quickly, so it is good to order as you go and not all at once.  It never felt as though we were rushed to order everything at once and I appreciated that.  We walked out extremely full, but it was definitely a good kind of full."
"Positives : Everything is sooooooo GOOD!Negatives : The waiting line is way too LONG! But worth it!During my last trip to Chicago we stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel. We wandered around the first night and saw The Purple Pig across the street and thought these restaurant really had a cute name. Being from out of town, I never heard of this place before, which apparently has a following in Chicago. Don't let the corny entranceway fool you. We ordered roasted bone marrow?! It was stupendous!! I can't never forget how good it was. I don't know how to describe it but the moment you put inside your mouth, it just melt. Crispy pig ear (so effing good)?! Deep fried strips of pig ear with crispy kale salad, topped with a fried egg. It came in the more darling little pig dish. I know it's just dinnerware, but it was so adorable!The creamy pork shoulder tasted like flavorful pork roast. Last but not least, Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey totally worth it. We ordered so much that we couldn't finish it and guess what? I carried the Blade steak left over the next day all the way from Chicago to my home sweet home. Heat up and it still taste as good as it was. If I'm back in town again, I'm for sure will be going back for more."
"So good! We had the olive oil poached tuna, bone marrow, milk braised pork and fried eggplant and it was all amazing. Will definitely be returning. The only down side, be prepared for a wait. We were told one hour and it was almost two. They don't take reservations."
"Yum? Hell yes. Was it worth the 1.5 hour wait? Well, I had the right company along with me so it wasn't as bad.The decor is cute, very very cute. The atmosphere is great but I swear I was yelling the whole time. It's definitely one of those places that you go to for a chill atmosphere and the prices were really friendly for being a trendy place.We ordered literally everything. Ok,  not literally. But the ribeye definitely made a huge dent in our wallets with the millions of other things we ordered. I was a bit disappointed with the cheeses. The portions were tiny, but the bread and the cured meats were fantastic starters. Get the prosciutto for sure. We had the olives, turkey leg, prosciutto bread balls, ... Holy crap I can't remember everything we got. Everything was perfectly seasoned, perfectly marinated, and perfectly cooked. The turkey leg was a little on the sweet side for me, but cooked very nicely. The wine choices are extremely wide as well. Both the cocktail waitress and the waitress who served us was friendly, but sometimes you can't help but feel that the suggestions they make are always the pricier ones haha. I had a great experience and would go again, but the star is knocked down because it was sooo loud. It's not very well designed inside with some high tables, some low tables. The communal thing is sort of a knock off of avec and blackbird... But food was amazing. Oh I think I left my sweater there. Sigh"
"Adored this place. I was in town for a conference and went with a coworker. I love the concept of this place - wine, swine and cheese. We got the cheese plate. I tried to google the cheeses and pick on my own but in the end the waiter helped guide us and the combo of choices was great. I had the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. Yum!  And we wanted one pork dish so we tried a super soft melt in your mouth shoulder with whipped potatoes. Seriously some of the best cooked pork. And save room for the dessert!  The nutella panini is so good!The wait staff was great!  Well informed, helpful and funny. Great lively atmosphere if a tad loud and quite crowded!"
Went for late dinner. Ordered: -Milk braised pork shoulder -Pork liver pate-Prosciutto di parma-Salted beets-Fried pig's ear w/ krispy kale-Goat cheese with beetsFood was not bad. Would love to go here for cocktails and people watching. Place gets really packed. Don't freak out if they seat you with strangers.
"The wait was expected, the service was very good, friendly and helpful once seated.  On to the food...First, know that these are very small dishes for the price.  Think tapas size, you'll need to order a lot.  Our family of four ordered a total of 8 dishes.Skip these:- Bone marrow smear.  The grilled bread, capers, cilantro and sea salt was enough flavor, the bone marrow was an expensive greasy distraction.  Not understanding the appeal of this dish whatsoever.- Pork on mashed poes.  Nothing wrong with this dish, just nothing special to report about it. Meh.- Fried eggplant parmesan. Again, meh.  Other good options, so skip this.- Wagyu beef.  Borderline, but considering the price its a minuscule amount of meat and potatoes.  Great flavor, yes, but unless you're a beef connoisseur you'll prolly enjoy a really nice filet somewhere else and get 8x the meat.Get these:- Beet / Goat cheese / Pistachio salad.  I didn't even think I liked beets til I had this, very very good.- Veal sausage.  The standout dish for our table, just a really great flavor to the meat.- Fried olives.  I'm biased here cause I love olives and chorizo and its just a unique dish i'd never considered before.- Charred green onions.  This is borderline 'skip' but it was better than I expected and, c'mon, ya need some greens somewhere considering how much meat and grease you're about to eat, right?"
"We went for lunch on a Monday, and there was no wait (surprise, surprise). The communal seating was a tad too cozy, as you could hear the conversations all around the table. But the food makes up for everything! Decent portion sizes for the price, and each dish as tasty as the last.Try the tuna with lima beans, bone marrow, JLT, thigh kebabs, etc. Try everything! We kept scoping out the food from the other parties at the table, and everything just looked so good."
"So after all the hype and waiting to go here twice before actually getting a table I say it is NOT worth all the wait.  I have friends that love this place but I think it's too small and not worth the wait.  We ordered the roasted beets, whipped feta spread and wild bass.The beets were overwhelming due to the cut of the beet but the concept was good.  The feta whip was good but not worth the hour and half wait.I think the wild bass was light and a good finish but once again not so amazing I would wait for it again.I definitely think the place is overpriced for what it serves and maybe better for tourists looking to wait for a table on michicgan ave."
"My boyfriend and I finally got a chance to come here on a Friday afternoon at 4:30PM. We were expecting there to be a wait--but fortunately, there was not!Our waitress Heather was extremely knowledgeable with the wines and was very helpful in deciding what we should try.The food portions were PERFECT. And they came out right as they were plated which was awesome!We started off with the chorizo stuffed olives which was AWESOME. I didn't expect them to be so salty, but they're olives--couldn't expect anything else. :) If you ever try these, wait like 5 minutes because they are HOT and straight out of the kitchen!We then had the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Need I say more? The mussels w/ pancetta - oh my god. Be sure to ask some extra bread because you'll need that to scoop the rest of the broth out. The flavor--so delicious!We also got the Chicken thigh kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki sauce. This dish was okay. I was a fan of the fried mash potatoes because I do love my carbs :) The tzatziki sauce was stellar and is definitely great with the chicken.Despite the slow service and attentiveness, i give the Purple Pig a 4 star!  Will definitely come back and next time I'll try more of their wines. Needless to say, their food was VERY good. Highly recommend!"
"Hello, pork lovers, look at your menu, now back to your server, now back at your menu, now back to your server. Sadly, you can't order everything on the menu, but if you ask your server for recommendations and order one of the three sizes of wine out of the amazing selection, you could be enjoying cheese, swine and wine. Sit outside under the heated tent (although not too close to the drafty sides- BRRRR), or inside (although it can get very crowded), where are you? You're enjoying Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic (NOM). What's in your hand, back to your Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes (NOM and VEGETABLES).  You've got it, it's Prosciutto di San Daniele and Sopressata (MMMMM PORKY MEAT). Look again, the pork is now a selection of three cheeses- Le Chevre Noir, Camembert and Delice de Bourgogne.  Anything is possible when you order wine you don't like and send it back for replacement wine- no problem. I'm on a pig."
"My favorite place in Chicago. The wait is always an issue but You can't go wrong! The menu changes regularly but all the pork dishes and appetizers are amazing. a great wine list too. Definitely try the milk braised pork shoulder, and the rillete as a starter."
"All in all, this is an overrated place and I wouldn't wait two hours for it again. Things were good, but a couple small tweaks and it would truly deserve the 5-star ratings I've been seeingWent there and had a two-hour wait. After this long wait we were seated at a communal table. Overall, the experience was a bit above average. However, this place is definitely overrated. We ordered: beef tendon chips, foie gras, pork shoulder, veal mortadella, pork chop and the bone marrow. The best thing was the bone marrow. It melted like butter. Beef chips: so salty we had to have them remake them. The tendon is made over a 3 day process: thinly sliced, dehydrated, freeze-dried and fried to order. Sounds great, but overly salty. Wish they would've added more vinegar. Foie gras: tasted like butter. Creamy isn't buttery, and for some odd reason it tasted like butter. Pork chop: EXTREMELY salty. It would've been better if there was some lemon to cut the salt. Veal: good, tasted like chicken sausage. Nothing to write home about. Pork shoulder: good. Very tender. However, the flavor isn't anything sensational."
"Came here for the second time and confirmed this place is more than worthy of all five stars. In my opinion, this is one of the few ""hyped"" up places in Chicago that actually lives up to - and exceeds - its great reputation. Everything that I tried was absolutely spectacular. I am one of those (admittedly somewhat obnoxious) picky eaters who is afraid of trying things that are foreign to my (admittedly somewhat bland) palette. A note to those like myself: trust the Pig. Do as it says. Enjoy.  Did I know what was in most of the dishes? No I did not. Did this bother me one bit? No it did not. Did this stop me from joining the clean plate club? No it did not. I pigged out (pun intended) and had to drag myself home to lie down in a delightful, swine-induced coma. 100% worth the wait."
I had to update this for consistency.  I've been here 5 or 6 times now and every single time has been amazing.  Some restaurants I feel like are outstanding one time you go and the next not so much.  The Pig always delivers.  There are different things on the menu when you go (which is annoying but understandable since they use what is fresh) but every time has been absolutely amazing.
Pork done OK but really seems like it arose as a gimmick rather than a true passion.Servers professional but lacking in warmth.
"I am from out of town and I always try to pick one really nice, slightly out there place to try when I travel. The Purple Pig was my pick for Chicago.I debated between giving this place a 4 or a 5. It wasn't the best place I have ever been, but it was darned close, hence the 5 in the end.I got there at around 7 on a Saturday night and had to stand around for about 50 min to wait for a chair at the bar. It is a very tiny place with just a few tables and probably 16 or so seats around the bar. You have to be aggressive if you are waiting for a seat at the bar. I had 2 seats stolen from me by people who had gotten there after me because I was too slow and polite.I finally sat down and I ordered a LOT of food. I told the waiter (bartender) up front that I was only going to eat part of everything because I wanted to try a lot of different things. I ended up eating a third to half of everything and taking the rest back to the hotel as leftovers,I ordered the Butternut Squash appetizer with browned butter, one of the cheeses, the Morcilla, and the milk braised Pork Shoulder. OMG the pork shoulder was amazing. Everything was good but that had to be one of the best things I have ever eaten. All of the courses are small, but I was full with only eating a little of everything.I went ahead and ordered dessert anyway. He said that the  Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche} is a house specialty so I went ahead and ordered it. It was really good. Not the best dessert I have ever eaten, but well worth its price. It tasted a little like a chocolate chip muffin, but MUCH better for those of you that need a taste comparison.For all of that food (and a glass of wine), I paid $61.My only regret was that I was there alone. This place is definitely better enjoyed with more than one person. You can order more items and share them so you can taste more or their incredible food. If I am ever in Chicago again, I will go again"
"Came here on a Thursday night. Service was quick and friendly (but nothing noteworthy). I enjoyed the Roasted Bone Marrow, as it reminded me of pho (because of the cilantro and onions) without the broth and noodles. I preferred to eat the dish without adding sea salt though.Also, the mussels were delicious! The broth was savory and the temperature was perfect. I really enjoyed coming here. The ambience was quaint and cozy, albeit the music was a bit loud. It's a small place, but a nice wine bar to wind down and have a bite to eat.  Their dessert menu was a little small and sounded unappetizing. Soft serve ice cream? Bleck.4 stars because, yes, I'm a fan (of everything except their dessert menu)."
"This place was interesting to say the least. I have heard that there is usually a wait for this place and so I was skeptical about the length the wait on a Saturday night around 8pm. Warm summer July night and there were people waiting at several outdoor benches when my boyfriend and I walked in. We did the smart thing and opted to sit at the bar which was open and was a really good mood.The clientele was interesting as was the wait staff. The place is actually quite casual in nature. All the bartenders behind the bar were in jeans and rugby t-shirts and the patrons were a mix of casually dressed (like we were that night) and the club crowd. We ended up fitting right in. The menu was a little intimidating  at first and although I like wine, I'm no sommelier. However our rugby shirt wearing bartender was quite helpful with pairings and food suggestions.The food was really good and it was small plates so nice for sharing. We started off with the manchengo and membrillos (sweet sauce). Ryan had chicken skewers in tzatziki sauce and I had the serrano ham on toasted bread with duck egg. Ryan's meal was better, in truth my ham was a little salty, but I couldn't complain when there was a nice cooked egg on top to compliment it. Although the plates are small they were filling and so we opted to share a dessert. Yum the panino con nutella was yummy.Definitely need to go back and try new plates and desserts."
"Amazing food, service,  & atmosphere.  Open late w/great food for travelers coming east! Loved the Pig's Ear w/Kale!"
"Should get 6 stars!!Hands down best restaurant of Chicago IF you're open for eating different food than you're used to.They make me like food I never liked before. Brussel sprouts, red beets, artichokes?? The chef turns them into the most delishes dishes I've ever had in my life.Thank you for existing and thank you for being different!The place is popular so expect a wait, enjoy a wine and strike up a conversation with the people next to you. Cool crowd."
"This place was good, but not great. Can't decide if the seasoning was different or just salty? Would NOT recommend the bone marrow. Pig ears were super salty (kale) but okay... Tried the mussels, which had a great sauce! Also really liked the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Not a huge fan of the turkey leg... But it was a good size portion, and very tender with an interesting sauce! Overall, the atmosphere was posh (?) and the wine was probably good (designated driver). I feel like this gets ratings because of the location... But the food didn't give me the wow factor I wanted!"
"I went here for a bachelor party and Jimmy Jr. hooked us up!  I honestly had no idea what I was eating half the time, but I decided to try anything that was put in front of me and it was outstanding!  The meats, cheeses, and breads were all unique and were perfectly cooked.  We also drank quit a bit and they had a great selection of beer, wine, and spirits.  The place is tight and gets packed quick.  I actually saw them turn away former NBA great Evan Eshmeyer (OK Wildcat great), because they were so packed for the night.  Get there early and don't be surprised if people are packed in like sardines."
"When I first heard Purple Pig was opening by my office I blew it off. Frankly the name (and my dislike for pork) scared me away.... Luckily I saw past the name and gave it a shot. The awesome reviews helped change my mind... One of the best meals I've had in the city. There is truly something for everyone here.5 small plates is perfect for 2 pretty hungry diners.  Everything we ordered was outstanding:Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes 3 cheeses with toasted bread.Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (Heard it was glorious)Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea AioliAnd the pinot noir (Tortoise Creek) our waiter recommended was fantastic.The meal was pricey but worth the extra $. My new go to special occasion restaurant. I wish I could afford to eat here everyday....but I'd be paying for the calories."
"If you like Pork, this is the place for you. From the nose to tale, everything was great. Go early because it is difficult to get a table. The plates are meant to be shared. So, you can try many new things. If you are in Chicago, you have to get to the Purple Pig. Great vibe adds to the experience."
"We are visiting Chicago from out of town and a friend recommended this place. The wait was pretty long for 2 people, but we had drinks while we waited. The wine list was good. We ordered a few sides. The squash salad was all squash - no lettuce. Okay but sort of salty. The raw corn antipasti was so good - we ordered a 2nd order. The pork and mashed potatoes took a while to cook, but it was so delicious. The olives were okay - could've gone without them. Overall just okay. Wouldn't go back of I visit Chicago again, but maybe I would if I lived here"
"Finally made it over here!  Only a 20 minute wait on a Friday at 6 pm.  We ate:Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes- so tender, very rich and buttery, would gladly order again.Pig's ears with friend egg-  BLAH .  Did not care for this dish, just tasted like fried food.  We didn't finish.Beets with whipped goat cheese- this dish was perfect.  So tasty.Mussels- the sauce was awesome, I liked picking out little bits of pork out.  Overall total was $40, a little spendy for not so much food.  I'd still recommend, just get there early to avoid a long wait!  And skip the pig's ears."
"The food was fantastic, and the price was fair.  Had the braised pork sholder, the bone marrow, and the fried pig ear.  Loved them all!  Definitely coming back.  Be prepared for a long wait though - no reservations!"
Marrowmarrowmarrowmarrowmarrowmarrow *deep breath* marrowmarrowmarrowmarrowmarrowmarrow.The wait was somewhat intense and they don't offer reservations but it was certainly worth it.  Wish we had been hungrier to try more!
"What a lovely place.  I risked the wait-warnings seen here and elsewhere and walked up to Purple Pig last night.  I breezed in pretty much immediately, which was easier because I was solo, and was willing to sit at the community table.  Had I been with my husband, I might not have wanted that, but solo, community tables are perfecto.  Only two problems relative to the seating were 1) my legs are too short, so it took some adjusting to make them not fall asleep from the chair cutting off my circulation (you have to be short to understand what I mean, I suppose); and 2) the ladies sitting next to me apparently had no concept of what COMMUNITY table means.  The one across had plopped her giant purse onto the chair next to her, thereby eliminating the possibility of that seat being filled by an actual customer, and the one next to me had her giant purse hanging on the back of her chair, such that whenever I needed to reach into my own giant purse, and thereby brush against her giant purse, she glared at me.  Seriously?  Whatever.My husband says I can find one in any crowd -- this evening I found two. ANYWAY, this is supposed to be about the food.  I ordered a 1/3 split of rose` since it was pretty warm in there.  I love the idea of a glass and a half pour -- just right.  I had a really hard time deciding on what to order, but the server, Kelly, was really helpful.  She helped me select the chorizo stuffed olives and Wagyu sirloin with cranberry beans, capers and romesco.  I'm a sucker for romesco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I started with the chorizo stuffed olives with what was either yogurt or creme fraiche.  The olives were pretty tiny, but lovely.  I hadn't eaten more than two of the olives when my wagyu came out, which wasn't my preference, particularly given the community table and premium on space.  I decided I needed to have a glass of red to go with such beautiful meat, so I let it sit a little while until my Cotes du Rhône arrived.  No fault of the server -- it was an afterthought on my part.  At any rate, slowing down the meal was my objective.  The wagyu was delicious!  Fork tender.  I am wary of beans, but these were dynamite with the capers -- something I am going to have to emulate at home.  And, as I said, I'm a fan of romesco, so the only problem with that was that I could have used double the amount.  I shouldn't have, but I ordered the salted caramel soft serve.  It was some of the best ice cream I've ever had.  It had little shards of brulee topping to add to the crunch of the salt.  YUM!  I would love to try this place again with my husband, so that we could sample more.  I rarely find so many things on the menu that I'd like to order.  The patio area is extremely appealing, and I'd probably be willing to wait (they don't take reservations).  All in all, a wonderful meal."
"I was visiting Chicago this past weekend and kept passing by this place and it was always packed. The name Purple Pig kept ringing in my ear, so I decided to pop in. Lucky for me, there was one lone seat left at the bar. I started chatting up the guy next to me and he was alone too so we decided to share a bunch of small plates. Most everything here was just delicious! I tried things I would never try so as not to look like a wimp and I loved them. The yummy factor: 1) Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios 2) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (I never would   have picked this or tried it, but it was so freaking amazing) 3) Foie Gras & Membrillo4) Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots5) Sicilian Iris - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried BriocheThe nothing special factor: 1) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - was good but nothing special2) Petit Basque Cheese with Membrillo - again same. Was like fried mozzarella. I had a fabulous wine along with the food. The service was great, atmosphere was perfect. If not for the ok/bland factor of the two dishes above, I would have given 5 stars."
"Why is the pig purple?  Just thought of that now....We had an early lunch here when we arrived in Chicago and had really amazing food.  We chose a few items including croquettes, the porchetta, prosciutto and salad.  Wished I had some of the smears and a few of their homemade cheeses.  Loved the atmosphere, busy, loud, a real ""tapas-y"" type of joint.   They lose a star because our waitress was a fri-gid. Didn't crack a smile once, but I figured it was because she hated tourists or something.Despite her, I would still go back and order another round of many a varied things.  Get the pork shoulder in milk-apparently it's a hot item."
"With all of the restaurants and shopping located on the Magnificent Mile, it can be easy for a restaurant to get lost in the shuffle.  Ever since it's opening, the Purple Pig has surely stirred up quite a craze!  Vienna and I definitely knew that we had to check it out!  Seriously, who can't love a restaurant where PORK is the main feature!Complete with an outdoor patio, Purple Pig has a very rustic and friendly feel.  They have a large table located on one side of the room to accommodate large parties or the table can be used as community seating.  You never know who you could be sitting next to.  If you have a chance, try to jockey yourself near the kitchen.  Watching chefs doing their thing is always amazing!Be sure to look around the restaurant to check out all of the decor!  Random pigs and memorable quotes are scattered all throughout the restaurant.  On to the important stuff... here's what we ordered.Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Growing up Filipino has taught us to love bone marrow!  In scouting the restaurant prior to our first visit, we knew that the roasted bone marrow was an absolute must!  The marrow is roasted to perfection and is served with bread, greens, onion, capers and salt.  Put all of those together and you have a wonderful spread!  This makes a perfect appetizer!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - One of our favorite dishes!  The milk does a wonderful job breaking down the connective tissues and rendering a wonderfully moist, tender and scrumptious pork shoulder.  The mashed potatoes have the perfect texture and taste.  It along with the gravy compliment the pork shoulder perfectly.  Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki - For being named The Purple Pig, I would never have expected the chicken thigh kebabs to be so delicious!  The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection and was beautifully tender, moist and juicy.  The herbs and spices were wonderfully combined and integrated in to the dish.  This is definitely one of our staple dishes at Purple Pig!Pig's Ear with Pickled Crispy Kale - Purple Pig gets bonus points in our book for utilizing the entire pig!  With this restaurant located on Michigan Ave., a lot of patrons probably wonder why in the world they would serve pig ears!  Well the obvious reason is because it is absolutely DELICIOUS!  Each individual ingredient was well prepared, but when you put them together into one perfect bite, you have a wonderful combinations of flavors and textures!  If you're feeling just the slightest bit adventurous, go for the Pig's Ear!Turkey Leg Confit - Turkey leg cooked in duck fat? How could this possibly be a bad idea?  No it wasn't Thanksgiving dinner and no we weren't walking around an amusement park!  As we were sitting contemplating what we should order an epiphany struck us as one of the chefs walked by with a humungous turkey leg.  Thank you for being able to sit at the chef's seating.  Make sure you make this unique restaurant a stop during any visit to Chicago.  It's tasty and affordable!#hellaYUMMS"
"Excellent old world wine, great selection. Staff is knowledgeable, helpful and ask them for advice when ordering. I loved my ceaser salad with anchovies :)Their toasted bread with garlic and olive oil is so delicious. I ate two trays of that! Just be prepared to sit in a crowded table, and very noisy. it's hidden, but definitely a great late night joint. I highly recommend it."
"I came here with one picky eater and one only moderately adventurous eater (me).  The service was great--helpful, friendly, and not overbearing.  The ambiance was nice--simple decor with a lot of natural wood, laid back but classy.  The outdoor space is comfortable, but can be chilly at night.Here are the following items we tried:-Chorizo stuffed olives: delicious.  How could you go wrong here?  Just the right amount of spice, salt, and tang.-Eggplant Parmesan balls: surprisingly good; appealed to the picky eater in our group.-Roasted bone marrow with herbs: it's good, but REALLY rich.  I only had a few pieces because it was just so much.  The bread was especially good (that's the non-adventurous eater in me).  You don't get quite as much marrow as at Gilt, but I did really enjoy this version.-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: DELICIOUS.  You must order this.  It was perfect comfort food with just the right level of fancy.On a different trip, I went just for dessert:-Panino con Nutella: exactly as wonderful as it sounds--bananas, Nutella, & marshmallow cream.  Perfect dessert.-Sicilian Iris: a fancy brioche with chocolate & ricotta; still not as good as the nutella banana sandwich.Overall, I loved the place and the food was as delicious as everyone says.  This is a place I come back to again and again (especially with foodie visitors).  However, watch your prices for the bottles of wine--I accidentally picked a wine that I thought would be as affordable by the bottle as it was by the glass, and this was not the case.  This is a place I come back to again and again (especially with foodie visitors).Try to come during off-hours (i.e., really early for dinner or REALLY late), because the wait is pretty extensive and they don't take reservations."
"Blanket statement - I love pig! LOVE it! Any food that is pig related I run to. So when I visit another city for work or pleasure I search out local eateries that serve pig.So I fly into Chicago for work, check in to my hotel and reference Yelp. I find Purple Pig listed near the hotel and with good reviews. The idea behind Purple Pig is great - small portions of swine related product, cheese, wine and beer. It's like pig tapas! Heaven right?I seat myself at the bar, order a beer and look over the menu. Looks like many tasty things to be had. I don't want to eat a lot since I have a late dinner scheduled so I am focus on the Smears. First thing I get is House Cured Lardo Iberico, which is salt cured pig fat on toasted bread. The spread is great but the toast is over done. It's way to crunchy and slightly burnt. Next thing I get is what the bartender states is ""life changing"" - Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta. The dish comes with toast that is overdone and burnt. I bite my lip and deal with it. Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta is done in tomato sauce and tasty overall. However, the souse overpowers the taste of the pork and and I'm realizing that if you didn't tell me it's Pork Neck Bone, I would think it's tasty meat sauce, but hardy ""life changing"". Both dishes left a taste of burnt bread.So in the end I think the idea is great, and maybe the guy who was doing the toast was overzealous this day. I'll most likely try this place again when I am back. But for now I just can't justifying more than 2 stars."
"We came on a Friday night around 5:45p after a nearby boat river tour and there was already a bunch of people waiting.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait so we put our names on the list and headed back to our hotel closeby to change.  We got back in 40 minutes and they already passed us but were able to seat us quickly inside.  The hostesses are really nice and dressed cute.  The waitress and efficient and pleasant.   The interior is charming and creative and they were blasting 80's music (Top Gun, etc.).We had the fried deviled egg with argula (pretty good), fried pig ears and kale (not bad), milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (really good) and the bone marrow spread with herbs and sea salt (really good).  The sparkling Piedmont wine I had was delicious.   Would come back!"
Excelent restaurant in Chigago! I loved their unique menu! The waiting time for dinner is about an hour so I recommend to stop by and make your reservation first. The have a good selection of beers and wines to accompany the plates.
"Don't go here if you're hungry. Everything is made to share, so mostly you'd go here to snack on stuff with your wine. Food is mediocre and costs too much. The food I did enjoy, there wasn't enough of. Wanted to go to McDonald's after we ate here."
"Flavor explosion in my mouth with every bite. My mouth literally just watered thinking about my dining experience last night. I had heard of this place, but not a lot. I didn't know what to expect... so expect a long wait. We waited an hour and a half, but we were content sitting on the bench with a bottle of red wine and we talked the bartender into letting us order an appetizer while we were waiting (that's what you can do when you're a group of cute persuasive chicks). The appetizer we ended up devouring was the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta smear. NOM NOM NOM. It was so good. Reminded me of a ragout almost - slow cooked tender pork in a red sauce with a big hunk of creamy cheese on top with toasted bread slathered in olive oil. You just can't go wrong with that. So finally we get seated (small restaurant - not a lot of seating inside - there is a nice outdoor seating section). Tapas style - who knew? We ordered the: -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes-Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Egg over Grilled Bread-Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde-Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. SO much flavor, SO delicious, SO going back. The only thing I have had better elsewhere is the octopus (it is the BEST at Café Iberico - just an fyi). The chicken was the best chicken I think I've ever had - crispy skin, tender meat, fresh tzatziki. Milk braised pork shoulder - holy scrumptious, amazing food experience. You will not want to share it.We finished this incredible experience with the Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche) Sinful. Best dessert I have had in a long time. You have to get it. Basically... you have to try this place. It is worth the wait. It is worth the price. It is just ... a necessary experience."
"LOVED IT.  Romantic, interesting, adventurous, and stocked with delight in both the menu and wine lists.   Get there early, or very late, and beat the crowds, or wait like you would at any great restaurant.I will say no more."
"This dinner was absolutely amazing.  I am not typically a huge fan of pig meat, but this restaurant completely changed my mind!  I high recommend the meat platter to start off with.  Everything on there was delicious and it was my first time trying head cheese--amazing piece of meat!  The bone marrow is an absolute must have! It will be one of the most delicious things you will ever taste.  I would also high recommend the pork shoulder; the meat was so soft we you didn't need a knife.  Finally, the sweet bread is absolutely do die for.  Do not leave without eating it."
"After moving back to the mainland from Hawaii let me just say this was Ono.  Sardines with fennel salad, could have had two orders. Also the fried manchego with jam was so good as was the wine pairing.  Food comes up quick as that was the most efficient and adequately staffed kitchen I have seen in a long time.  Looking forward to going back."
"i really like tapas, but this wasn't typical tapas. these guys rocked my world with the octopus, milk braised pork shoulder and marrow spread.the octopus was tender, perfectly seasoned and excellent all by itself. then came the milk braised pork over mashed potatoes. this stuff was so tender, i bet i could sip it through a straw. 5 stars just for the pork; however, when the marrow came i was skeptical. OH MY GOD, is there a 6th star?if i wasn't married, i think i could elope with the marrow. seriously, how do you describe heaven on crostini? imagine beef flavored butter. that's as close as i can get in describing the absolute mouthwatering experience that is Purple Pig's marrow.yes, it was loud, crowded and extremely busy, but our half hour wait was worth every second."
"Loud, busy, crowded, weave-your-way-around, music-pumping, dim, trendy, wooden, hip-folks, and then make your way out to the back room to have a drink while you wait for a table. Overall, the wait not too bad for a night downtown.And then the food. Starting off with a selection of European beers on tap or something else off the extensive wine and spirits list.Small plates are meant to be shared, and so if you're an eater, you may end up with a lot of plates, but variety is the spice of life, so let's get it goin'.Roasted beets and goat cheese. Rich, great textures. Fantastic goat cheese makes the dish, with the beets giving the sweet undertones. Shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino and parmesean are tart and salty and crisp. Prosciutto bread balls came out steaming hot, less full of prosciutto than I would think, but the tomato sauce is very nice. Braised pork shoulder was tender and flavorful.A couple of winners, though. Pig ear and crispy kale, peppers, and a fried egg. Fantastic. It's like eating fancy snack food. But oh so tasty. And the turkey leg. A whole big turkey drumstick. Something is just exciting about having a whole leg in front of you. And it's good. Oh is it good.It's a fun spot."
Amaze! Can't wait to return. Be sure to sit at the bar and watch the action from the kitchen!
"Best restaurant I have ever been to. Small plates, so be prepared to order a lot and spend a lot. But you won't leave hungry or dissatisfied.They use family style seating, where most tables inside seat 10 or so and you will be next to strangers. I noticed some tables for smaller groups, even for couples, but it appeared to me that the majority sits at the larger tables or the bar area. There was outdoor seating underneath a tent as well.They had a very extensive wine and beer menu, with options for a glass, 1/4 bottle, 1/2 bottle and full bottle for some of the wines. We had a 1/2 bottle of the 2010 La Cartuja, a red blend, and it was amazing.I tried to break the meal down into three courses. We started with three plates: Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic from the antipasti section, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg from the fried items section, and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs from the smears. All were incredible. The almonds lasted us all night, and were easy to eat in between dishes. The Pig's Ear might have been my favorite dish - you crack the yolk of the fried egg and mix it together with the fried ear, kale, and peppers for a wonderful mix of tastes and textures. the cherry peppers give it a little zing and the fried ear has a great taste and texture. Don't be afraid of the bone marrow - yes, it comes in a bone, and you spread it on the bread like butter, add some sea salt and top with the salad - and it's delicious. Try it, you will not regret it.Our second ""course""/set of plates was a cheese and cured meats plate. Our waiter put it together, combining the tartufo and some prosciutto with a soft, hard, and semi-soft cheese. It was good, but I probably would have rather stuck to the larger items that were ""prepared"" rather than just served, if that makes sense. With the cheese plate, we got Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche & Marjoram and Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Red Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette. The mussels were very flavorful, but not as filling as other items. The sirloin was sadly somewhat ignored, because we were so full at the end. I did try a few pieces of it, and it was very, very good. I wish I could have had more of it, but I had to save room for dessert.Our last course was dessert. Save room for it. We got the Affogato, espresso over ice cream - I'm not a coffee fan but this was very good. I think we got it with the salted chocolate ice cream or something like that. But the winner of the dessert menu was easily the Panino con Nutella - a panini with Nutella, bananas, and marshmallows. Omg. Drool.To me, The Purple Pig is Chicago in a restaurant - full of people, so many different things to try, and so much fun. I love the seating, I love the menu, I love sharing all the food you pick out with your group, I love the wine, it's just all so great."
"Came here with BF a couple of weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was around 7 or 8, so I was pleased when they could seat us on the patio right away.  Score!As soon as we got our menus, I began scouring the wine list for Nebbiolo, as I had just returned from a jaunt to Italy, where I was introduced to the beautiful aforementioned grape.  Double score, they had several options, including by the glass!As for the food, BF enjoys forcing me to eat beets (although I almost always enjoy them) so we got the beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio ""vinaigrette"". A-MAZ-ING.  I could have eaten approximately 15 more bowls of that delicious love.Secondly, we ate the calimari.  This turned out to be a chilled salad with perhaps... toasted... israeli... couscous?  Who knows, something was in there that was israeli couscous-esque.  It was so delicious, the calimari was so tender!  Also could have eaten 15 bowls of that.Our third thing was a bruschetta type thing with serrano ham and an eNORmous fried egg on top.  Goose egg maybe?  It was huge.  This one was a bit disappointing... unwieldy to eat, very messy.  Though tasty, this was my least favorite ""tapa"".Fourth and finally was the milk braised pork shoulder.  This thing was crazy good.  The meat was SO tender, simply falling apart.  I literally ate it with a spoon.  No really, LITERALLY.  The waiter had taken my fork when he cleared the last plates.  It was that tender, it was spoonable.  The mashed taters that it came with were pretty boss also.If only we came to the mag-mile area more often!  This place is mega yummy."
"I never get tired of going here.  It's definitely in my top 5 favorite Chicago restaurants.  I too often end up with the Pig Platter and a five cheese platter.  It's always amazing and usually different every time I go. I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't already been said in previous reviews.   But, what I will stress is how helpful and attentive the staff is.  Every time I go I have questions.  The staff is never impatient or annoyed.  They genuinely like to help and give suggestions.  Good customer service gets me, every single time.  Kudos to the staff of The Purple Pig!  Keep it up, I will obviously be back."
"I've now concluded that for solo business travel, this is as good as spot as any to dine downtown.  The piped in music is vibrant and festive, the bar lively, and the staff's recommendations are just dead-on.  I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  I recommend just letting the bartender suggest highlights from each category, as well as your per-course wine pairings.  They are simply money!  Fried chorizo stuffed olives started me off and next course was beets with goat cheese whip and pistachios-- delicious! But what totally took the cake was the WAGYU SIRLOIN TIP with fingerling potatoes, caramelized red onions and olive and bone marrow vinaigrette.  This dish was highly recommended by the bartender.  I very seldom eat red meat but I decided to take the plunge because of her enthusiasm.  It was thankfully a lighter portion than it sounded and was, in a word, stupendous.  Every bite had a delicious combination of acidity, marshmellowy and charred beef, briney-ness buttery-ness and sweetness.  I believe it ranks up there as one of the single best combinations I have ever enjoyed on one plate.  Kudos to the chef, who recommended a medium temperature, which I went with.  I can see why she did and was so, so pleased with the result.   Definitely recommended!"
"To the Purple Pig, ""that'll do pig.  That'll do.""No reservations here so be ready to wait a while.  Unless you enjoy late dinners which the gf & I do.  Showed up around 10pm and we had our choice of indoor or outdoor seating.Our waitress Jill was just straight up awesome!  Really helpful & suggestive and was around enough to make sure we had anything we needed but also not enough to make us think she was our mother.  And extremely friendly too!We got the...  -Pig's Ear w/ the Fried Egg, Kale & Peppers  -Bone Marrow Smear  -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes  -Octopus w/ Beans & Potatoes  -Wagyu Sirloin TipALL OF THEM (with the exception of the Bone Marrow Smear) were MUST HAVES!  The smear was good but I just didn't think it was great.One last thing if you're driving, they don't valet but they do validate parking for the parking garage at 50 E. Ohio."
"Wow, what a difference a day makes. We came here because my friend had read that bon appetit had voted this restaurant onto the best new restaurant list. WHAT A MISTAKE THAT IS.This restaurant is so snotty they dont take reservations. I can tell you its not as good as a Rick Bayless restaurant or the Girl and the Goat.  Rick Bayless deserves to do the no reservation policy, this restaurant DOES NOT. We walked in around 3:50pm. The place had PLENTY of seating. We stood by the door waiting to be acknowledged. No one greeted us. Instead, when we were looking around the restaurant deciding on the best place to sit, we were spoken down to by the hostess who said to us ""I will seat in you a moment."" Wow. Not even a ""hello"".When our hostess finally decided to seat us, she seated us at a communal table, when there were tables of two that were empty. When I requested to sit at the two person table, she said I could not sit there because she wanted to keep the balance of patrons to waiters.  I could understand that. What I could NOT understand was that she seated a white couple who arrived TWO MINUTES LATER at the table that I had requested to sit at. I was PISSED.After having being seated at a table I was not happy with, we started thinking about leaving because we sat at our communal table for 15 minutes without a greeting of ""hello"" or ""I'll be right with you"" from our server, who served the couple to our left AND our right and had passed by us multiple times within those 15 minutes.  We were really going to get up and leave but at this point, the waterboy decided to come and give us water (20 minutes later).At this point (20 minutes later), our server decided to come and talk to us. He talked as if he was being friendly but I totally didnt buy his ""personality"". We already knew what we wanted to order since we had such a long time to look at the menu. We ordered the bone marrow, pigs ear with kale, and the pig shoulder. Everything tasted only OK. Nothing was really delicious. The best of the dishes was the bone marrow.Towards the end of the meal, our waiter took forever to settle the check. He totally did NOT deserve the 20% tip we gave him (we only gave him 20% so as not to perpetuate the stereotype that asians are cheap tippers). As I was struggling to dodge all the people inside the restaurant to use the restroom, another waiter looked at my shirt (I was wearing a Red Sox t-shirt) and said ""Red Sox, I dont think so..""  Do I care what you think? Not really. Could I go without all the commentary from the wait staff? Yes. Would I ever come back here again? NO.That was the worst birthday dining experience I ever had. I even saw the owner of the restaurant (the younger one) pass by us a few times and he didn't say anything to us while we were waiting 20 minutes for service. This place and the people who work here think they are top notch. They need a reality check. I honestly think they treated us like crap because we were asian. I can tell when I've been discriminated against and this was one of those times. I hate to make it all about race, but if we were treated even A LITTLE better I wouldn't have.I recommend going to the Girl and the Goat. The food is much more DELICIOUS AND CREATIVE and the service is more FRIENDLY AND ATTENTIVE than this place."
"We were able to fit in only 2 main meals--one of which was Alinea--during our 36 hour trip to Chicago so I researched high and low for just the right option. It had to be brunch/lunch on a Sunday, during which time our first choices (ie girl and the goat) were closed, and it had to be w/in walking distance of our hotel (state/lake). So Purple Pig it was! And I'm so glad for it. Great food.We had the roasted artichoke and potato antipasti; pork sweetbreads with roasted fennel and apricot; bone marrow w/ parsley, shaved fennel and capers; JLT pork jowl, frisee and heirloom tomato w/ toasted bread; milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes; lemon panne cotta.I wish we had opted for another antipasti in place of the bone marrow. I LOVE marrow...but marrow is marrow anywhere you go. The parsley, fennel and capers were a nice addition, but didn't add enough flavor. It would've been nice to see a fruit jam of some sort to accompany the marrow instead. And the lemon panne cotta was overwhelmingly sweet. I wish I could have the sweetbreads every single day w/ a beer or two. The JLT was PERFECTLY seasoned..every component. Milk braised pork shoulder should be a dish at every Thanksgiving dinner from here on out. Delish."
"Aside from this place being a complete tourist trap (not really sure why because the food is so non-touristy) and eating at almost 11 pm, this place is great! There were six of us and we ordered a lot! But the highlights were the fried manchego, octopus, bone marrow and turkey leg. Will definitely be returning but will just have to go at 5 so I can actually eat at a normal dinner time!"
"Excellent in every way: simple foods done to perfection, huge variety of wines & specialty cocktails, and a cozy vibe that promises your experience will feel casual and unpretentious. We sat at the bar and watched all evening as chef Jimmy Jr patiently and painstakingly trained a sous chef to his high standards--his attention to the craft is personal and genuine. Go! Order the spring peas with bacon and mint if they are in season, or the richly tasty pork neck gravy with ricotta if you want something hearty. Bring a friend's wallet...you won't want to skimp on tastes, and small-batch awesomeness isn't cheap."
"Maybe the best looking menu I have ever seen. The food was awesome and I want to try more items. The charcuterie plate was great with house made cheese, bread, and meats. I had a whipped Feta cheese with cucumbers and fresh toasted bread. It was so freaking good. The stout I had was great and this place is as close to a five star restaurant as any place I've been yet. Probably 4.5 stars."
"We love purple pig!  So much fun to try all the different items, but we definitely have some favorites.  DO TRY:  the pork shoulder, neck bone gravy and beet salad.  We tried the marrow once, but didn't particularly care for it.  The Turkey leg is a large portion if you're trying to share with lots of hungry eaters.  The calamari was surprisingly light and refreshing- not the standard fried version at all.  Have always had good wine there and definitely plan on trying some of the cheese plates in future.  Is popular and doesn't take reservations but the wait usually isn't horrible."
"Ahh purple pig, I was so excited to finally get a chance to try you out. You were so promising from all the hype and reviews I have heard. Sadly, it was really just all hype. Came here last night with the gf for her birthday and we had high hopes and expectations. You know, like it was your child and that he/she would become great when they grow up. However, my dreams were crushed when the Purple Pig turned out to be a tweaked out salt-addict. We basically ordered based on all the other wonderful yelp reviews. What we had: 1) Fried Pig Ears2) Bone Marrow Spread3) Blade Steak4) Pork Shoulder with Mash5) Turkey Leg ConfitThe fried pig ear and bone marrow was delicious since it was the first two dishes that came out and we were both starving. The new flavors was a welcoming taste to my taste-buds. However, by the last few bites of the first two dishes we started noticing a pattern, it was overly salty. The blade steak came with a side of nduja and greens. The flavor was there, but again - over-salted. The greens was the worst, why does veggie have to be so salty!?! Next came the pork shoulder, we both each had literally two bites before we gave up because of salt-OD. Last came the turkey leg, and same thing. We took two bites and packed the rest to go. Overall, I was disappointed and even more surprising is only one other Yelper commented on how salty everything is. The potential is definitely there, because I can taste a lot of flavor and assorted ingredients in every dish. Sadly, this is all drowned out by the over-seasoning of salt. Someone please let the Purple Pig know that salt is not going out of style, and there is no need to use it this generously."
"What an unassuming place.  Walking down the street you would never know this place was so popular just by going past it.  Once you stroll down the walkway towards the entrance you see just how popular this place is.  My and my party were lucky enough to get one of the last seats before they had to start a waiting list.  The seating at this place is really cool.  Shared long tables gives you a chance to possibly meet new people.  I didn't know what to expect from the food, but it was incredible.  My co-workers and I shared the almonds, brussel sprouts, and olives as an appetizer and for the main courses we had the pork shoulder, the pork steak, magyu beef, pork jowel, and probably another dish or two that I can't remember.  Once food coma started to settle in it was hard to remember.  Everything was excellent.  Between the 3 of us and everything we had to eat and drink along with the quality of the food it was a great value.  I am not generally a very adventurous eater and so to that end there were a lot of things on the menu that I wouldn't try so I stuck to things that I felt were reasonably safe. If you aren't adventurous, then there aren't too many things that you may actually  want to try, but that doesn't mean that you won't still have a great meal in an fun, cozy atmosphere."
"Service was great! Waiter was attentive and extremely helpful. We had the bone marrow (yummy- tasted like beef butter) smeared on buttery, toasted garlic bread to start with. Next came the beets (loved it but I like goat cheese) and the milk pork shoulder (also good, but too salty). We also had the fried pig ears (loved it, my favorite dish!). This was plenty for 2 people with moderate appetites to share without leftovers."
"I visited Chicago for the first time and Purple Pig was the first restaurant I ate at for dinner. Couple things to know- there is a pretty decent wait time (we waited nearly 2 hours).  I can't imagine having to wait that long during the winter time but in August, it was bearable (minus the stomach pains in my stomach).  The waiting area is large with a good number of seating available.  In addition, you can order drinks while you are waiting outside.  Ambiance is very cute- there was outdoor patio seating.  Very cute date place.Okay, now to the food.  We ordered:1) Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes,Asiago & Salami ToscanaThis was a so-so dish. It was good but not incredible. Probably the least favorite thing I ordered.  Had a nice lemon, vinegary taste to it but nothing special.2) Roasted Bone Marrow with HerbsThis was WONDERFUL! Never had anything like this before. If you like bone marrow, this is definitely the dish for you. The only con to this dish is that I wish the bread that accompanied it was less oily/less buttered because it distracts from the bone marrow flavor.3) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesThis was a very delicious dish.  The mashed potatoes are creamy and are to die for. The pork shoulder was flavorful and tender.4) Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & TzatzikiProbably the best chicken kebabs I have had in a long time. The chicken was cooked very well- moist and tender.  The Tzatziki sauce complemented the dish very well and was refreshing.Overall, a great way to start off my foodie experience in Chicago!"
"I've never been to a restaurant with such diverse menu list. I got the bone marrow for appetizer which was great , got the eggplant dish that was very good, my wife got the Turkey leg which was excellent."
"Yes, a late night spot with great food!Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- this was very good, I never caught on the beets and goat cheese, but they go very well together. Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios- nice cool salad type dish, very tasty and everything went well together. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- I was imagining more to this dish, ended up tasting like fried flour.. not much crunch you would get from pig ears like i hoped. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- You can't go wrong with this if you already love bone marrow, I've seen a few reviews stating how the bread was too buttery or how fatty it was... it's bone marrow, the fattier the taste, the better the smear!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- the meat was cooked nicely and the mashed was pretty good, overall it was an okay dish, wasn't my favorite.. maybe I was full from everything else!Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots- Fried sweetbread.. need i say more? So good. Service was good at 1AM, food came out great, I wish I had more room to order everything else on the menu... I will definitely be back when I'm back visiting.."
"Two stars exactly - Meh. I've experienced better. Perhaps I'm just different. I live in Miami where these types of places are everywhere. So when I heard about this place and saw all of the reviews, I immediately thought FOR SURE, I'M THERE!We walked in the early afternoon, fresh off the plane to have some fine wine and food. We ordered the following:Jacky Moulin-A-Vent: Very good wine, highly recommend.Delice de Bourgogne: If you like Brie, you'll love this cheese.For food we were told the portions are small. Because we traveled on AA we were starving. So we ordered with our eyes. The Roasted Bone Marrow wasn't all that great, unless you're into very greasy foods. Prosciutto Bread Balls - 6 tiny (and i mean tiny) balls with red sauce. I never tasted the prosciutto.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - For all the hype, I was disappointed. It is a small portion of pork with gravy that tastes like you're having turkey. The mash, ehh, ok. Overall, the place looks awesome ONLY if you're going for WINE AND CHEESE. This is why I give it two stars. Perhaps if I wasn't so hungry and just wanted to chill with some wine and cheese then the rating would be higher. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. If you're hungry and want good tasting food,  keep walking."
"3.5 stars. If I hadn't gone to Girl and the Goat the night before this place would have easily gotten a 4 if not a 5. Food: Creative menu with some very tasty things that were perfectly prepared. But other items that sounded good on the menu didn't pan out. And I thought a few things were a tad on the salty side.  Ambiance: Wine cellar country theme. Cool place, a little on the crowded side.Service: Waiter did his job but wasn't really that friendly.Price: Can get a little pricey since it's small plates.Overall: Definitely a cool place to go if you're on N Michigan and want something non corporate. But if you have the chance I'd recommend Girl and the Goat over the Purple Pig."
"I really don't get the hype!  I had been looking forward to trying this place for months and had a list ready with several of the items recommended by other Yelpers.  I mentioned this to two people and they both told me not to bother cuz it's not worth the hype...I jumped to the conclusion that they don't appreciate ""exotic"" dishes, and they don't have discerning palates, and they had no idea what they were talking about.  Obviously, I was wrong and they were RIGHT on!  It's okay, not great, and I've had better food at tapas style restaurants.  Maybe I had hyped up the bone marrow more than I should have so, when I finally had it I almost thought something was wrong with my specific order of the bone marrow.  The thing is though is that  I've had better bone marrow growing up in an Indian house, sucking it out of chicken bones via my mom's chicken curry!  We also ordered the fried manchego cheese, razor clams, octopus, fried pig ears, and had two deserts, and nothing was outstanding.  It is different...the whole concept and atmosphere and the menu items are different, but I've had better 'different' elsewhere :)"
"EDITED: I've now been three times, and I'm keeping the review at five stars.The first time I came, we sat at the bar and watched them prepare and cook the food. Amazing. I kept wanting to add things to our order (we did add a few things... i mean, you see all these tempting dishes passing under your gaze and you just can't help it!)The second time, I came with family. We ordered A LOT because we had five people. Everything was absolutely delicious, but my favorites were the vegetarian dishes (shaved asparagus, hazelnut, and arugula salad, roasted beets with whipped feta and pistachios). The neck marrow was delicious. The crispy pig ear with fried egg and swiss chard- amazing. The bottle of wine didn't hurt either. Two people were having deep dish pizza with friends for dinner and gorged themselves anyway. This past Sunday, I brought a foodie friend from NYC. She's eaten at a lot of great restaurants. She's had some freakin' amazing tapas (Tia Pol? Otto?). I was a little worried to bring her here.I shouldn't have been. She doesn't even love pork that much. I was disappointed that they didn't have the amazing shaved asparagus salad (it was only 3 weeks since the last time I came!) because asparagus is out of season. They had fresh summer squash in the salad instead. I was practically licking the plate. We got jamon serrano and podda cheese. We got the roasted summer corn, seared pork blade steak served with nduja and honey, and of course, the crispy pigs ear. To finish the gluttony, the Iris and the Nutella/banana/marshmallow fluff panini.Then we rolled ourselves home, oh-so satisfied. (We both commented that despite how full we were, we'd both eat more of that hazelnut salad.)The wait wasn't very long when we went, so... if you're impatient like I am, go on an off hour. Don't come here on Saturday at 6 or 7 or 8 and expect to be seated anytime soon.old review:Disclaimer: i've been once. but i'd love to come back. again. and again. and again.Came here with a friend after perusing menupages for places that were within walking distance of both of us AND had interesting menus.Our server was terrific and (mostly) efficient. He helped me get my chair in (we sat at the bar, and well. I'm short. so I couldn't stand on the footrail and pull my chair in) and pointed out his favorite dishes. Every bite in my mouth was like a little song. They spaced our food out PERFECTLY. If they had brought it all out at once, I would've probably wanted to order more. We shared the eggplant caponata (served with hot crostini with goat cheese spread), the white bait ""french fries"" (I think it'd be more accurate to call them white bait ""onion rings""), milk braised pork, and jamon serrano with a fried egg on top. Then we shared two deserts. The sicilian iris is a big powdered empanada/donut with cream and chocolate inside. Oh wow. The bread pudding with carmel sauce was also delicious.There were a lot of dishes I wanted to try, but there's only so much one can eat in one sitting. I'm glad it's close by, so I can come back next time I'm in town!Now, really? I was gonna give it 4 stars. But then I remembered that they told us the wait would be 35 minutes? We waited maybe 10. I hate waiting. A lot. So, extra star for not making me wait!"
"OMG, Purple Pig is awesome. The place was packed and the only seats that were open was at the bar. It was squishy but comfortable. I liked that under the counter were hooks for your personal items to rest while at this eatery. The menu had many delightful items and we couldn't order everything so we decided to start with something simple. To start we had ""Roasted Bone Marrow w/ Herbs"", two bones hollowed with spreadable marrows with a handful of toasted bread slices topped with cilantro and onion. Next was the ""Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki"", both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The dishes were small but it was well worth the cost, guaranteed. I will say that I will definitely be back for more Purple Pig delights."
"A 40 minute wait for 2 on a Friday night around 8pm but worth the wait!  We started with the famous bone marrow plate and it was very flavorful.  Can't remember the names of the other dishes that we ordered but they were all very tasty and perfect portions.  Oh, and we finished the night with their salty caramel ice cream-so delicious and a hefty serving.  Very satisfied!"
Great selection of food and drinks. The wait is a little long so make sure to arrive a little early if you don't want to wait 1 hour +. I will have to say the place is a little small but the atmosphere is really nice.
"Surprisingly good! My friends and I tried the bone marrow spread on bread, beef, and chicken with taziki sauce. I expected the portions to be small, but they were filling. My favorite was the beef. It's tender and good enough it doesn't stick to the interproximal areas of my teeth. This place is always busy and packed too! We came at 1:30pm on a Monday. This is definitely passed lunch time and we were surprised the wait was till 30 mins to get a seat. It's a great tapas place and I would come back here!"
"Took my little sister here for her ""I got a new job celebration lunch,"" and had a good experience.  We sat outside - wish we would have sat inside.  I felt like the ambiance out there was a little awkward.  The vibe inside seemed a lot more communal and cool.  My favorite was the pork cheek gravy - must try. I would pass on the Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots - as much as I love sweetbreads, I was not a huge fan of the way these were cooked.  Weird aftertaste and kind of blah. They were sold out of the bone-marrow smear, so I plan to go back just so I can try it."
"This place is fabulous!  I happened to show up with my family on an unseasonable warm April evening.  This VERY small wine bar / restaurant does not take reservations, so just expect a long wait.  Trust me its worth it.The hour or so of hanging out on their long patio and enjoying the warm weather with a dozen or so other soon-to-be patrons was just enough for us to finish a bottle of very nice wine.   On to the dining room were we were told that the menu items should be considered like tapas and that 3 people should order 6-8 items.  Without getting into too many details... everything we ordered was excellent.  The best of the best was the Mortadella, Balsamico, and Pistachio Smear, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Razor Clams, and the must-have Sicilian Iris (dessert).  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"
"This is my go-to place when I have people visiting from out of town. It's very crowded (always) and the service definitely misses the mark (sometimes borders on rude), but I find the food to be consistent and I love the mediterranean wine list. My favorites:Brussel sprout saladEggplant caponataCheese White wines by the glass: albarino, bodegas naia"
"Octopus is the real thing ( a la plancha).  great wine offerings, lively atmosphere with attentive and information service."
"Deliciously tasty, great atmosphere. Be prepared to spend some time, and I'm sure you'll love it.Salted beets: yumBone marrow: mmmmmPork secrete: splendidJLT: mother of god deliciousness.Get a great wine and relax!"
"To start, the wait is ridiculous, especially since they don't take reservations. I got there at 6:40 on a Wednesday night and I was told the wait for 2 people would be 1-1.5 hours. We ended up waiting 1 hour. It is nice that there's quite a bit of seating area for people to wait and they serve you wine outside while you wait. It is also nice that they will call you when your table is ready so you can walk around Michigan avenue until you can get your table. Anyway, once we got our table, our server was kind of weird. He was kind of nice but distant and when we asked for beer suggestions, he said any of them are good. That's not very helpful. Also, all the employees are casually dressed. There didn't seem to be a dress code. We kept being surprised by people taking our drinks and plates because we thought they were customers. The hostess looked like she was a punk rocker and the waiters looked hipster.I like how they give us one dish at a time so we can focus on that one dish. I feel like they should have switched our plates out after every dish but they only started doing that after our 4th dish.Anyway, to the food:Chorizo stuffed olives: I am not a fan of olives but these were good! fried on the outside with olives on the inside and chorizo inside of the olives. There's maybe like 6 olives.Eggplant parmesan balls: Kind of tasted like mozzarella sticks but not as good... my fiance liked them. Came in marinara sauce. There were like 6 balls.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: I disliked this. I LOVED the bowl it came in, because it was a pig bowl. However, the shape of the pig bowl and the food itself made it a very messy dish. The dish basically tasted like a bunch of fried wontons with a few pig egg meats in it. It was too salty and too messy.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: I strongly disliked this. I didn't even finish it. It tasted like really mushy chicken and the sauce didn't have much flavor.Bone marrow: This was really weird. There were 3 big bones with some meat in between. Only one of ours had a lot of meat. The other two hardly had any at all. Then there were 5 pieces of crispy small bread slices, a small bowl of rock salt, and some kale drenched in dressing. You were supposed to put everything on the bread and eat it. The bone marrow meat was completely tasteless. The kale with the dressing gave all the flavor.Nutella dessert: I regret ordering this dessert. It was a nutella sandwich with bananas, nutella, and marshmallows. It was so weird because it felt like I was eating a grilled cheese but instead of cheese, it was a smore on the inside. I didn't think the buttery grilled bread went well with the nutella, bananas, and marshmallows. Will never get this again anywhere.Girl and the Goat is 100% better."
"Somewhere between 3.5 and 4 based on more delicious dishes than failures.I had stayed away from the Purple Pig because of the tales of 2 hours waits.  We came on a Tuesday at 5pm and the restaurant and patio were more than half full.  By the time we left at 6:30, there was a line.  I would definitely recommend coming at ""off"" hours.The place is really cute, very loud and overall quite delicious.  Service was pretty good (although the tables around us seemed to get more attention than we did, but no big deal) and the food came out quickly and piping hot (where applicable).  The wine list (read: book) was intimidating, but our waitress was able to recommend a great wine based on what I usually like.Now, for the food!  Here it is in order of yumminess:-pork shoulder - this was fantastic.  It was piping hot, impossibly tender and full of flavor.  The mashed potatoes and gravy at the bottom were a great accompaniment.  Delicious.-octopus - this was an afterthought, we had originally ordered 4 plates to split, but were still hungry.  We were contemplating the mussels but our waitress suggested this.  It was delicious.  It was served in two large pieces, almost like crab legs, had a great texture (not at all chewy) and had a great citrus flavor.  We thanked her for the recommendation.-artichoke with fingerling potatoes and salami - I was picturing an antipasti, but this was more like a cold salad.  I really enjoyed the flavors and since the artichoke was braised, it was not briny (as it sometimes can be).  The lady beside us ordered a second helping of this, so let that be a testament.-nutella, marshmallow, banana panini - it is as yummy as it sounds, I couldn't resist.  I only wish there was more nutella and less marshmallow but that's a personal preference.  There were two failures of the night:-bone marrow - I am a big fan and we heard the waitress (and Yelpers) highly recommend it, so we ordered it.  The marrow itself was good, served nice and hot with sea salt and french parsley (I think) which were nice additions.  However, they served it with buttered toast!  The bone marrow is supposed to be the main fatty attraction here, the butter really ruined it.-crispy pig's ear - I had heard great things about this so we were excited, but it was basically a bowl of grease.  The ear is julienned and then the individual pieces are deep fried with kale and topped with overpoweringly vinegary giardiniera and an egg.  We told the waitress it was too greasy for us and she shrugged and said ok.  I had hoped they would remove it from the bill, but no such luck.Overall, the great dishes outweighed the bad so I'm recommending it."
"The Purple Pig was my first venture into ""Tapas,"" as i'd never heard of this style of food before. It's basically picking at appetizers and smaller meals for your meal for the night...decided to try out Purple Pig based on some good Yelp reviews and the local feedback..This place has a GREAT ambiance. Dark (but lit-nicely), small, intimate, great wine selection. The wait was about 25 minutes (and this was on a weeknight).**HOWEVER WATCH OUT FOR THE WINE ISSUE** My girlfriend and I asked for 1/2 glass of their best red, and it was the SAME AMOUNT OF WINE as the 1 glass, but for $20 more. Keep an eye out for this****The food itself was awesome. We split everything -- got a smear of Pork Neck Sauce with Riccotta cheese, as well as an Eggplant spread with tomatoes and Goat Cheese. Both tasted terrific on the house bread. Then we got an order of chicken thiegh, which was also terrific.The dessert was something i'd never seen before -- A Nutella sandwich of bread, nutella, banana, and marshmallow. It was PURELY HEAVEN.Purple Pig is solely responsible for turning me on to the style of food known as Tapas for a long time to come."
"This was quite possibly the best place my friends and I could've started off our trip in Chicago. We didn't get there until around 12am as we were all flying in from all over the country. We sat on the patio area that was tented off with heat lamps to keep us nice and toasty. We wanted some snacks and figured tapas would be perfect. Our waitress hands down made the meal AWESOME. She was hilarious and gave us great recommendations. I wish I remembered her name because I would definitely give her a shout out.The one thing I would suggest people order are the PIGS EARS!!!! Might sound weird and odd, but my gosh this was my favorite one of them all. There's an egg on top and you mix it in and its just scrumptious.Eggplant parm balls, artichokes, and tripe were also really good. Loved the ambiance and the location of this place. Like I said, it wouldn't have been a better place to kick off our trip in Chicago."
"The place is kind of crazy because it is super popular, they don't take reservations, and there is limited space to wait, especially when we went this weekend when it was POURING outside. We were seated on the patio, which was a little uncomfortable due to the not-so-watertight tent seating. I was seated near the edge of the tent and near the fans, so I was subjected to the occasional sprinkling of water from the tent. Not entirely the restaurant's fault, but still kind of icky.I went with a group of six people at 11:45 AM on Saturday. After a bit of confusion, we were seated within about 20 minutes. You can put your name in and then go shopping, and they'll call you when your table is ready. If we had been a smaller group, we would have gotten seated right away, as there were ample tables for smaller parties available. At the waiter's recommendation, we got three or four appetizers from the right side of the menu and three or four mains from the left side. We got the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta, eggplant parmesan balls, tuna croquettes, and pig's ear with crispy kale, pickles cherry peppers, & fried egg for appetizers. For mains, we ordered the braised pig's tails, veal neck with lemon, chicken thigh kebabs with smashed potatoes, and a tripe, pig's feet, chicken sausage thing. For dessert, we got the nutella panini, Sicilian iris (a doughnut-esque ricotta and chocolate stuffed fried concoction), and honey-infused cheesecake. The eggplant parmesan balls, veal neck, chicken thigh kebabs, and Sicilian iris were the standouts for me, but I don't think there was a dish I didn't like. Going with a group is great because other people might order things you wouldn't have ordered yourself (case in point: veal neck. It was amazing, but would I have ordered it myself? Not at all!)  Including tip, it came to $25 per person, which was more than reasonable for the amount of food and quality of food that what we got. I would recommend The Purple Pig for larger groups of people with adventurous palates!"
"IF YOU LOVE FRIED, HEAVY FOODS, THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU.  i didn't enjoy the fried-ness of almost everything as much.3.5 starsfried pig ear with krispy kale, cherry pickle -- the concept and the         fusing of the ingredients was a great idea...but chef needed to go         easy with the salt shaker!!milk braised pork shoulder w/mashed potatoes -- too saltyolive oil tuna with lima beans -- nice flavoring and pleasant dishroasted bone marrow with fried breadchicken kebab -- um, kebabs are grilled not fried. too many fried foods.  by the time i had the fried pig ear and roasted bone marrow on top of fried bread, i was hoping that the chicken kebab would be lighter.  on the contrary, the chicken kebab was the biggest downer.  we could have done without it.  plus, it was more expensive than anything else we ordered which i didn't understand cuz it's pieces of chicken.  =p  the chicken kebab was fried.  the bottom of the plate had a white, yogurt sauce with three flat pieces of fried potatoes.i was surprised that the food was that heavy since i have never been to a wine place with so much fried food.if you like fried food, this is a FIVE STAR place for you.oh, and the cheese (for the cheese plates) is from california.  just like the tomatoes from lou malnati's pizzeria were from california.  heheh. my favorite dish was the olive oil tuna with lima beans cuz it was not fried. recommended to try if......you want small plates as a happy hour or snack with wine.  don't go for lunch or dinner.if the bread wasn't doused and fried in olive oil, it would have been more enjoyable.  the concept of this place is good, but don't think food is supposed to be that heavy with wine."
"Make sure you have time to really go through the menu... be prepared to be overwhelmed. Seating... is European-style where you might have to sit with strangers.all that aside.. dericious. dericious. dericious. LOCATIONConvenient, great location in the Loop. AMBIENCESO LOUD, simple decor, seating is very dense so be prepared to talk a little louder than normal..... or not talk at all if it's your first date harharhar (which it was the case for us... but anyway that's a long story). By the way, if it's warm outside, make sure to take advantage of the patio.FOOD (tapas-style. Order 2-3 dishes per person... seriously. Also this review goes from Antipasti to A La Plancha.....)Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette: sounds funky, we know. BUT... a must try! the texture of the beats with the crunch from the pistachios and the creaminess of the whipped goat cheese... SUPERB. It's a cold dish... be forewarned. Roasted Corn, Mushrooms, Walnuts & Fried Rosemary: dericious. again. the fried rosemary can be a little intimidating but it was a good textural difference to the roasted corn and the mushrooms. It's a little on the salty-ish side for sure.Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries: not impressed in comparison to everything else on the menu. It was a pretty typical deviled egg... arugula is always a nice, semi-bitter touch. Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (smear): Again.. cold dish that I did not expect to be cold. Came with toasted bread, eggplant was delicious.. goat cheese was getting a little old at this point... it's creamy... and we love creamy. but it definitely gets overwhelmingMilk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: AMAZING. Melt in your mouth amazing. Pork+mashed potatoes.. it was all so buttery and delicious. I think it's honestly the BEST DISH they have. Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey: THIS IS HUGE AND NOT TAPA-SIZED. Figuratively... it is the size of my face. It's really almost a 10 oz. piece of meat... comes out a little medium but is a salty bite (well, lots of salty bites) of yumminess. Just be prepared that it's big. Share it. Save Room. Something."
"Crap, I lost my draft to my Yelp review.  I'll make it short and simple.  Came here with 3 other people, ordered about 11 dishes and loved almost every dish.  Wait can be ridiculous, as Omar L. says in his review.  We lined up outside before lunch to avoid a problem.  If you love pork, make a visit and FEAST."
"This place was definitely cool. It's motto is ""Cheese, Swine and Wine."" I, typically, am not a fan of pork. So when my friend dragged me to this upscale eatery with a hangover, I was not excited. We got there, rolling up in style on Michigan Ave on the CTA local bus service, of course. The atmosphere here is amazing. It's something fun and different and you definitely feel like you are in a ""nicer"" restaurant. We sat outside in a covered, and heated patio. The place is TINY so there is a wait, but I would say it is worth it. The wine list was so extensive, even I (someone who considers themselves to be semi-knowledgeable about wine) was overwhelmed. The waiter knew EVERYTHING about the entire list. I told him the taste I was looking for and he knew just what to bring out. The food here is more tapas style, small plates. We shared a few vegetarian options, all delicious. The highlight of the night was the bone marrow that my friend MADE us try. She had it before. I will admit, I couldn't watch when she scooped it from the bone and spread it on the toast. But with the capers, onions, parsley and rock salt, it was pretty good! I would definitely return. Great food, wine and atmosphere!"
I can't even begin to say how off the hook this place is. Way innovative cuisine. Wine menu is stellar. Service tip notch and staff very very knowledgeable about their products. Can't recommend more. BE PREPARED TO WAIT!!! No rezzys are taken so it's sort of a crap shoot. But worth it if you have the time!
"First let me say that this is definitely a place to go if you eat meat, eat cheese or drink wine.  As a vegetarian  I was able to eat their appetizers and salads except for the fact that their vegetarian salad is so popular they are always out.  We got their cheese plates with wine and they were great.A  good variety on the chef's selection.  We also got the curried cauliflower which is great! The corn salad is mediocre, I can probably do better at home.  It's a very lively place and next time I""ll definitely be trying their smears."
"I tried the Purple Pig for cheese and wine. It was cold, windy day and the restaurant's ambience provided the feel of being in a cozy European ski lodge - perfect! I can't remember the exact cheeses we ordered, but we were happy with our choices. The prices were a tad bit on the high side, but not outrageous.One thing that was disappointing was that when our waiter poured our wine, there was a little bit left in the bottle - just shy of one glass full. Instead of giving us each a little splash more, we watched the server pour the remaining wine down the drain. It was an opportunity to make us feel special as customers, but instead we got the message that the restaurant would rather throw something away than give us a little something extra."
"The recent pervasiveness of the pig has had me giddy ever since restaurants like The Publican and Purple Pig have been on the scene.  I'd like to consider myself swine chic and frequently drool over new and interesting pork-themed dishes.The Purple Pig is often packed, so expect a wait.  You cannot be seated until your entire party is present and they do not take reservations.   Have a drink at the small bar and enjoy the lively atmosphere as you wait for your table or guests.  You may be seated with ""new to you"" pork lovers, so be prepared to swap restaurant tips with those at your table.  I hesitate to call them strangers, because these fellow pig enthusiasts are just friends you haven't met yet.I've dined here 3 times now and thanks to their tapa portions, I've shared about 70% of the menu with friends.  This is comfort food at its best.  Don't pass up the pork shoulder, pig's ear, pig's tail or fried manchengo cheese!  And if you order the pig's tail, pair it with the burrata cheese.  It was a delightful (and for me, an accidental) combination.  You must try the fried deviled egg, if it is available.  They serve the dish after 5:00pm, and often run out.  I was finally able to try it on my 3rd visit, and it was well worth the wait!The wine list is extensive with a range in varietals, price points and portions.  Feel free to snag half a bottle of wine if you're pacing yourself.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I believe they have a nice selection of beers as well.  My only criticism of the restaurant is that they often run out of dishes, but I've never been disappointed in my alternate selections.  The Purple Pig offers a lively and friendly atmosphere.  The price is very reasonable and the food & drinks are of excellent quality and satisfying portions.   As an example, our total for 5 dishes and a bottle of wine was $77.  Don't miss out on this instant Chicago staple!"
"no, no, no! did I say no?! This is a grand misunderstanding on an aging trend. it is the McDonalds of organ meat, pork small plates, chic gluttony (yes, it is sexy, yes, there is a 1.5-2 hour wait, yes the cocktails are incredible, the wine selection interesting, and the staff is trying really hard to be hip and accommodating, but the food is just not keeping up with appearances).the bone marrow looks amazing. but it was smothered in so much butter, it was just tasting like butter. Oily Gross! the kale pig ear dish was soaked in oil and we returned it. the sweetbreads were good, flavorful but also deep fried and heavy. the blood sausage had so much cardamon and cinnamon that it tasted like a dessert. it came with fava beans, which sounded delicious. right? no. they were swimming in oil too. no freshness at all. this is the place for people who are afraid of the taste of organ meat but want to look ""cool"" by saying they've tried it. Sad!oily circus on wheels. not delicious. great promise, horrid execution. this food might have been remotely enjoyable if it came with a pound of lemons to neutralize all that oil and butter."
"foodwise, its amazing. definitely a 5.given it's tapas, prices/portions aren't that great. very small portions and each dish is like $10+DEFINITELY RECOMMEND:-milk braised pork shoulder-roasted bone marrow with herbs-wagyu sirloin tipALSO GOOD:-pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg-pig neck bone gravy with ricotta-pig's tail braised in balsamic"
"Cheap tricks done well..Atmosphere is busy and enjoyable, food was a little disappointing. Foir gras tasted like honey butter, no liver taste. However the pork roasted almonds with Rosemary was a nice treat. Wine selection is outstanding! Advice is, come for the wine and the atmosphere first, little emphasis on the tapas style food items."
"One of my FAVORITE restaurants in Chicago! The crazy thing is, my boyfriend and I do not eat pork. But I read the reviews and looked over the menu before-hand and decided to try it out for its non-pork menu items which I must say are FABULOUS! I will also say it is a very popular restaurant. We ate here on a Monday night and it was seriously crowded. They do not take reservations, so it is probably best to go a little before or after the dinner rush. We happened to get there right smack dab in the middle, but thankfully we only waited for 15-20 minutes until we were given the option of being seated at the bar (which we happily took. . . we were starving!).The bartender was super informative and patient. He made an intimidating wine list and menu seem less daunting. The problem is that everything sounds so delicious it would have been impossible to decide without his help! He knew the menu and wine list like the back of his hand (I just wish I could remember his name for you guys). Really, really great wine!Our menu: 3 cheese sampler (couldn't tell you which 3)Burrata Pugliese, Acorn Squash, Portobello Mushrooms & Balsamic (Unbelievable flavor and texture, sooo good!)Foie Gras & Membrillo (My first foie gras experience: so savory! Membrillo: some sort of home-made jam with real grapes in it! And some seriously good toast to slather it all on.)Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde (Do not be afraid. . . One of the best dishes of my life!)Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes, Red Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette (Rich and satisfying)Lemon Panna Cotta with Pistachio Croccante (I love this dessert! And I don't like lemon desserts. Light, creamy, just enough tart, with a sweet nutty bite from the candied pistachios. . . YUM!)Panino con Nutella (Very, very big. Especially after all that food. A straight forward dessert: what you read is what you get.)My only regret is that I don't live anywhere near Chicago to try the rest of the menu. . ."
"Purple Pig is GREAT!I recommend you try the big cold meat platter. You'll get everything! I didn't realized I ate cow's tongue ( eww) but was incredibly GOOD! they take No reservations and wait can be a little too long... just wait if you are a big fan of charcuterie, cheese and wine :)"
"Overall, the Purple Pig was a great dining experience, and I loved the comfort food served here and their large selection of wines (offered in 1/2, 3/4 and full).  I ordered a rather full-bodied bottle of chianti, and it went really well with most of my dishes.Ordered: pig ear, devilled egg, pork neck gravy, bone marrow, pork shoulder, brioche donutWould definitely order again: pork shoulder (easily the best thing I ate here, and you have to try it!)Deep fried pig ear:This dish was somewhat disappointing.  I got the feeling that the chefs were trying very hard to mask the pig ears rather than having the ingredient speak for itself.  The ears were thinly sliced and deep fried to a crispy, there was probably more batter than ear, and it could have been just batter sticks, and I probably wouldn't know the difference.  The intricacy of the pig ear comes from its natural textural contrast: the bone/cartilage is crunchy and the meat/skin is jelly-like and a little chewy.  Unfortunately, none of this was present in the dish.The runny egg was definitely the star.  As I've mentioned earlier, I love a runny egg on almost anything (except fish apparently), and the batter was in fact very good dipped in the runny yolk.Deep fried devilled egg:This was supposedly be one of the most amazing things served at the Purple Pig and it ran out frequently.  I was delighted to find out that it was available and ordered one immediately.  The egg was... rather average, nothing wrong with it in particular, but it was definitely missing a ""wow""-factor.  I would actually much prefer a scotch egg much over this one.Neck Gravy:The night turned around from this dish.  The ""gravy"" is actually a spread, and it was loaded with pork from the neck.  The bread was in fact very tasty and thick, perfect for loading up tons of the delicious spread.  The dish also came with a little cup of fruit compote was comprised of gooseberries, peach and raisins, which went extremely well with pork and gave it a sweet and salty tasted.Bone marrowI love bone marrow, or ""nature's butter"" as I like to call it.  This dish definitely had the right idea: bone marrow, salt and herbs on bread, however, the bread was toasted with quite a bit of oil, and the cilantro was drenched in dressing, making this dish incredible heavy to eat.  I ended up not using the herbs at all, and it was still very enjoyable.Milk braised pork shoulderThis thing was freaking amazing, easily the best dish of the night!  The pork was so tender, and (almost) melted in my mouth.  Flavours were good, the sauce was delicious, it was just a simple dish that was executed extremely well.Deep fried brioche donutOkay, this wasn't called a doughnut, but that's what it was in essence.  Yea, I love brioche, and using brioche for a doughnut was just a brilliant idea.  The outer dough was crunchy and aromatic (think of deep fried brioche), and the filling was delicious, but the layer of dough immediately under the filling was unfortunately raw, and I had to eat around that.  It was a very good concept, and could have been an amazing dessert had it not for the poor execution."
"Not only did we not get to eat, we edited 2.5 hours for our table, came back to find out it would be another 45 minutes. One hour later they called us for a table...forget it, there is not a restaurant ever that I been to that can treat customers so poorly! As much as I have traveled and have been fortunate to experience wonderful dining, this was a joke! Not an I am sorry, offer for a drink, nothing! Just a snotty little hostess that gave us the eye roll....so disappointing!"
It is as good as others say.  Many items on the menu there is related to pork as the name suggests.  The lack of reservations is a bit disappointing but fortunately the wait was okay.  The brussels sprouts and pigs ear turned out well. but the crowds and table sharing were a bit unwieldy.  I loved the bread pudding and plan to come back for more.  Food was good though and we'll be backc
This is a great place! We went at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and it was not crowded. The food was excellent! Let the waiter help you with picks. Everything was wonderful! This is a must stop! You'll love it!
"More like 4.5, but this place is delicious.  Both times I visited I was with clients, so no wine list for me, but I'm dying to go and eat without hesitation.I have had the pork shoulder with potatoes (wowzer amazing), the fried Manchango (a must-order), the butternut squash (with sage, best combo ever), the artichokes (meh), scallops, (pass) shrimp + clams in risotto (the risotto is awesome) and the purple pig platter.  If you're with 2 or more people you should order it because it is pig heaven.Great service, nice decor, its a total go to."
"While in town for work, I took my mom here for lunch. We had a fabulous time sipping the wine that came recommended with our entree pick, munching on fried olives stuffed with chorizo, and enjoying the glorious weather Chicago was having that minute with the sunlight streaming through the large glass windows. Here's what we tried:Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette - AMAZING, fresh, bright flavors, perfectly cookedBurrata & Micro Greens - good but a bit too subtle compared with the rest of our mealTaleggio, Fig & Onion Marmalade & Escarole Hearts - gooey, savory and sweet, and the most filling part of the meal (thank goodness, because I'm a hungry girl)Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Savory piggy goodnessI wish I lived in Chicago still so I could frequent this place. I'll miss you my royal swinish friend."
"If I could pick up just one thing from Chicago and bring it over to NYC it would be this restaurant. Hands down the best one I went to while visiting this past fall. Everything is served tapas style so we ordered about 8 different things, and each one was wonderful.It was a very long wait (about an hour on a Saturday afternoon) but totally worth it. We just went shopping on Michigan Ave and came back 45 minutes later."
"Great collaboration of a bunch of Chicago's best chefs!   Had lunch this week with a friend ""in the know"".   Here's what we ordered:  (1) roasted corn w/mushrooms; (2) artichoke/fingerling potato appetizers; (3) pork shoulder with yummy mashed potatoes; (4) THE most delicious bread with serrano ham, asparagus and topped off with a fried egg; and (5) finale was the marrow bones with more of the most delicious bread topped w/greens and kosher salt.   OMG.   Everything was amazing.   Beautiful day - sat outside at a communal table.   Staff was fantastic.   Just wish I could have had a glass of wine and didn't have to go back to work.  Definitely will get back soon.Second visit today.   Different friend.   One new item was the whipped feta with cucumber.   Too much cheese -- too little cucumber.  Could use maybe a touch of garlic.   Bread delicious.    I have been dreaming of the marrow bone dish for a couple of months and could not wait to order today.   UNFORTUNATELY -- just the top was finished -- the middle and bottom of the bone tasted like lard -- definitely not cooked through and through.   We mentioned (and showed) to our server and she took it off our bill but still.   So disappointed.   Maybe I'll try to make my own.   On the plus side -- the bread is still super delicious."
"We had a splendid time at the Purple Pig, a place I wanted to visit after searching Yelp for highly rated restaurants near my hotel. The Purple Pig kept popping up, then I read ""bone marrow"" and it was an immediate MUST TRY - - or in my world, a ""Just Do It"". The place is small and quaint, the seating is limited, but if you have a large group (we had 9), they do have optimal seating to accommodate you. The outside seating is actually pretty comfortable, not as hot or humid since it's covered. I put in our name and met the nicest hostess in Chicago - - her name was Austin, and she's also from Austin. Now that's pretty damn kewl. I was so stressed yet Austin was so sweet and said it was all good as she put me on the list and told me not to fret. I ordered a bottle of wine from the bartender - who recommended ""Vina Cubillo"", which had an array of reds mixed in...it was pretty good. Austin said it could be a 2 hr wait, but she had us seated in 45 min - - how awesome is that? Exceeding expectations! Now the food:  tops was the ""Fried Manchego with Membrillo Vinaigrette"", you better order more than one because you can pop these in your mouth one after another. The ""Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese"" was extremely good. Next the ""Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs"" was a close 3rd. I've never had Bone Marrow, it was so buttery and good - - be sure to mix in the sea salt or else it will be too bland. Another pleaser was the ""Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes"". All of these dishes were a delight. The dishes that lacked the ""wow factor"" were the ""Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg"" - - which I wanted to try so badly but was kind of a letdown as I was expecting a more robust and crispy piece of Pig's Ear. Instead it was shredded strips which kinda reminded me of durkee's french onion, it tasted good and I would order again, but it's just not what I expected. The ""Purple Pig Platter"" of meats was okay, only a couple of meats were exceptional. The ""Sausage Dish"" was average, somewhat bland, something I would not likely order again. The ""Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette"" was recommended to us, but it just wasn't that great. And the ""Shaved Green Asparagus with Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano"" was a bit too much on the tangy side for my taste buds, although some people enjoyed the crispiness and texture.  Our table service was just average. She was very loud when she spoke to us, and she would abruptly interrupt our conversations (almost Jersey Shore-like) to ask if we needed anything. And during those instances when we really needed her she would disappear for a long time. She also got into a rift w/ some customers sitting next to us about a bottle of wine, and she was very vocal and open about it - - even escalating to her assistant (who followed her around) ""DO NOT open that wine!!!"" - - yes, 3 exclamation points. Not too professional, I recommend next time keep it on the DL instead of the on Jersey Shore. But overall I had a pleasant experience here, a great place to gather with friends and have some tapas-like dishes, which allows you to try a lot more on the menu than you normally would. I would definitely go back here again for the nice wine, fried cheese, eggplant, bone marrow, and let's not forget the most sweetest, competent, and courteous host in Chicago - who goes by the name of Austin."
"Crazy busy and noisy, but great food. Thank god I was on my own, and could get a seat right away at the bar. Friendly bar staff and great service. Yummy sangria and great wine & beer list. I was on my own, so the plate size was a bit large, but the food was great!.A good place to go if you are by yourself, if you need to dine alone.Bottom line - highly recommended!"
"This place is interesting. For one thing, you can order a dish containing just about any part of a pig you could want. But if you're not a pork eater, there are other offerings like buttermilk braised rosemary quail. If you're just there for drinks (fairly impressive wine list), the meat and cheese platters are amazing. You can choose from over a dozen cured meats and a wide selection of delicious cheeses. The fried appetizers are not so great. The batter is akin to frozen mozerella sticks and makes the different offering taste very similar to each other. Compared to the quality of the rest of the menu items I would pass on those. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, but still nice enough to feel good taking a date there. Our service was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive. Expect a wait."
This place was simply outstanding. There is no other way  to describe it. I am a picky eater and loved everything that was put in front of me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 star all the way!
"When I arrived the only openings were at the Chef's Counter. What an experience! This is a great place to sit if it's open and you're on your own for dinner as I was while in Chicago on business. I got to watch the chefs like synchronized swimming just move in sync as if everyone knew where everyone else was.  With 5+ chefs all in this tiny space it was amazing no one ran into each other. I ended up sitting next to someone who was also in town on business and we commented through dinner about who was what and where they sat in the pecking order. It made for nice dinner theater type entertainment.I had the quail main course which my mouth still waters when I think about it and this was months ago that I was there!  Moist, fall off the bone, tasty... I could not more highly recommend this course.  Also the salad, who's name escapes me, with the jicama and asparagus... YUUUMMYY!!  And I am not the biggest fan of salad. Then I had the stuffed profiterole for desert. I'm allergic to wheat and dairy but that was well worth it! This is a do not stop at go recommendation.  Get there early-ish for dinner to avoid the lines and enjoy some wine with your dinner from the amazing collection they have. You'll walk out as fat as a pig at the end and just as happy."
Great food! I enjoy the tapas style. Terrific for groups to try different items. Small dishes which are creative and delicious! I tried The Purple Pig on a recommendation and was not disappointed. Don't be turned away by the name alone - there are even flavorful and inventive dishes for the vegetarians in your party.
"If you do not know or appreciate octopus, you will here- perfect grilled Mediterranean flavors of textured perfection :)"
"Small dishes for maximum flavor with the Purple Pig. After walking all over downtown I was looking for a place to stop and catch my breath. A bit skeptical since it was in a touristy area but after lugging around a 30lbs bag I was looking for wine stat.The moment you walk in your senses are overwhelmed with warm scents of Thanksgiving, or maybe it was just the smell of varied styles of swines. I only stopped in for the wine selection but was immediately encouraged to try the food. I was in full view of the cooks preparing meats and bread. My server suggested the coppa (see pic). Coppa is a pork shoulder/collar for FYI. They brine theirs overnight and use chili peppers and peppercorn to give it a spicy crust. It complements the sweet taste of the meat to greatness. It also mixed well with a red wine from Sicily. Definitely going back to try their main courses which appear to be served Mediterranean style and to give this place 5 stars!"
"Swine lovers rejoice.The best time to hit this place up is right after it opens on Sundays.  Minimal wait times.  If you stroll in after 12pm, your group might be in for a wait.Natalia was very helpful guiding me through the customer favorites and I pretty much stuck to her recommendations.I started off with the marrow.  ""Meat butter"" as she pointed out.  But you need the herbs and capers sprinkled on top of this to really enhance the intricate flavor.  The crunch of the bread is really great.I moved on to the testa.  Cured swine goodness at its best.  Slightly salty but yummy non-the-less.The pig ears hit the spot.  The crunchiness of the ears, crispness of the kale, combined with the gooeyness of the egg.  Who can ask for more?  Apparently I can.The best dish of the brunch would be the pig tail.  I was expecting curly morsels but this was even better.  It seemed to be the part closer to the base of the tail.  It has enough fat to keep you happy but not too much to feel like you're biting into grease.  As the fat gives way to bone, meaty goodness awaits.  The meat was very tender and flavorful especially if you spoon over the broth/sauce that it wades it.  Do be shy and eat it like a chicken wing.Finished up with the sweetbread.  Nicely breaded, but after the pig tail, the flavor was not that memorable.I'll be back for more in the future."
"Hubby and I first visited The Purple Pig last October for a lunch enjoyed outdoors on an unseasonably warm day.  We enjoyed the fried almonds and bone neck gravy smeared on bread ... the few other dishes we had were too forgettable to remember now.  But it was interesting enough, and open late enough, to make a second visit this week.We checked in to the hotel across the street around 10 pm after a long work day and 3.5 hour drive from Indianapolis.  It was so easy to just go across the street, and we were looking forward to a tasty and relaxing dinner as we started our mid-week Chicago getaway.  Unfortunately, the servers were super-rushed and really took the fun out of the visit.  There were no suggestions about how many plates we should order, or what wine might go best with our order ... even as we pointed to several wine bottles in the $75-100 range ... no help from the server.  Having made our selections, the food started to arrive.  When they bring it to the table, watch out.  A runner would literally run to the table, push our wine glasses and silverware out of the way to make room for the plate, and dash off again.  A butter knife landed in my lap, and I'm still surprised the wine glass didn't shatter.  As new plates came out, they just kept pushing them onto the table, and only when we asked did the runner clear away the empty plates.  Regardless of the crappy service, hubby and I managed to enjoy ourselves, thanks to an excellent Syrah and pretty good food.  We again enjoyed the almonds and the pork neck gravy, and also liked the chicken thigh kabobs in tzatziki sauce.  However, the wagyu beef sirloin tip was bland and no more tender than any regular sirloin I've had.  Several desserts looked good, but by that time we were sick of the service, so we went back to the InterContinental hotel and finished the night at Eno where we enjoyed lovely flights of wine, chocolate and cheese."
"How could I have not written a review for my beloved Purple Pig? One of my favorite spots in the city, and a must-go when any friends or family are in town visiting. They had me at hello with their appreciation for everything pig. I'm having a hard time getting this review going - just trust me when I say EVERYTHING here is good. Everything. The decor, the outdoor seating, the wait staff,  the bartenders, the beer and wine selection, and the FOOD. Everything is perfection. The menu is always changing, but I'll review some of their staples. pork fried almonds - seems so simple, but was life changing.anything from the fried section - pick your pleasure. Fried cheese. Fried pig ear. Fried Sardines. Fried olives (no thanks, but olive lovers loved 'em). purple pig platter of cured meats - a must for a group table. The fuet and jamon serrano are my favorites. CHEESE - always an amazing selection of cheese. Just tell them what you like and they'll pick out a selection to suit your taste. bone marrow - don't think, just do it.Dessert - the Sicilian Iris. ""ricotta and chocolate chip filled fried brioche.""  Incredible. A ridiculous dessert. Perfect with a cup of espresso."
"YUM!The GOODThere is outdoor seatingLarge wine listLots of small/medium plates that are easy to shareFood-we had the tuna prosciutto, fried BLT, pork shoulder, and shrimp and mussels....all of which was AMAZING.  Probably my fav was the BLT...weird I know but it was pretty darn good.  I thought the food was GREAT!  Each dish had amazing flavor.  We were not disappointed.The BADNo reservationsNot seating until whole party thereVery cramped spaceCommunal seating....not really sure if I think this is good or bad....The UGLYService is meh...The server recommended two different wines to come back and tell us they were out of both.  We also asked for recommendations, she said pork shoulder and beet salad....you see what we ordered above.  When the BLT came, she was like....that is my favorite thing on the menu....WTF....why didnt you recommend it???Waiting 20 mins for dessert....that was bread, marshmallow spread, nutella....not to hard to put together so why the wait????We ordered espresso martinis for dessert also and they arrived in beer glasses....WTF again....so we were like where is the martini glass....they said they were out, however, we saw several dirty ones at the bar.  We made them put it in a fresh glass.Overall, great potential....needs to work out some kinks.  Great food!  Its a pretty good scene also.  It was jammed on a Thursday and a Monday nite"
"The afternoon before I came to this restaurant, a New York Times article stated that the happiest man alive is a tall, well-off, married, Jewish Chinese-American who resides in Hawaii. Before I departed from work, I declared that I will somehow become happier than this man, since I already had a 3"" height advantage over him.This goal will never come true, as I will refuse to become kosher and deny the pleasures of The Purple Pig.Cured meat sampler? Yes please. Deep fried brusselsprouts? Omnomnom. Fried chicken with tzatziki sauce? I could die a happier man than the one mentioned above. Don't get me started on dessert.The Purple Pig offers a great atmosphere with pretty decent prices. The imported wine selection is pretty decent, as well.I am a bit sad they don't take reservations (though I completely understand), and i wish they were just slightly more affordable. I guess I'll just have to save it for special occasions."
"Went there for lunch. We managed to get a table pretty quickly, so wait was not a problem. I got a hot sandwich and it was very tasty and not that expensive. Too bad they don't take reservations."
"The first time I visited with a large raucous group of friends, and another with the hubby for our Anniversary dinner, and this place was perfect for both occasions.  The dishes that really stood out for me were the grilled octopus with green beans and fingerlings, the fried pig's ear with crispy kale and a runny fried egg, the roasted bone marrow, and the white bean spread.  I also love the beer and wine options, which veer heavily towards small(er)-production European options.  While normally I go for deeper, spicy reds, I asked the waitress to choose a tasty rose for me, and the French one she suggested--Whispering something--was complex and refreshing and not too sweet...perfect for the scorcher of a day we went on.This place is a bit of a splurge for us, but in all honesty, I didn't feel like anything was overpriced for the outstanding quality of the food.  The portions were definitely not skimpy, either, considering that this is a tapas-style joint.  I can't wait to return, for either a fun date night or a special occasion!"
"So cozy, great place for a date. Plus nothing tests the waters during the earlier dates like ordering plates of pigs ears (okay... almost like bloomin' onions, without the onion, with a fried egg on top... no cartilage involved) and bone marrow (interesting, for sure, make sure you eat it with all the accoutrement.) The milk-braised pork shoulder really was the best think we had. I wasn't a huge fan of the prosciutto balls, probably because I grew up in an Italian neighborhood with a deli that made a superlative version. These were just eh. Overall, I'd def go back. The service was great, and the dining experience is comforting - great winter spot."
"Got there super early (like before 5:00) to put our name in for a table since reservations are not accepted.  We were told we had to wait for our entire party to be present to be seated.  So we sat at the bar and had a quartino of wine (you can get some wines from the 'old vines' list as a glass, quartino or bottle).  The bartender was great in explaining the different varietals and even gave us small pours to taste to make sure we liked our selections.Once the rest of the party arrive we were seated outside at family style tables.  It was a nice weather so it wasn't a problem but whoever sat in the back had to make all of the other patrons get up to get in.Overall the food was good - basically pork and cheese.  Fabulous.  The cheese platter was good as was the broccolitini.  The pork ears were actually pretty good and came in a pg shaped bowl.  It is pricey - it ended up being about $400 for 5 of us (included about $150 of wine).  The service was good and even let us split different amounts on different credit cards."
"Really good restaurant. Amazing food!!! It does get really crowded  and you have to wait a long time for a table, but it is worth it."
"Great-Asparagus salad, jowl,wagyu sirloin tips.Ok-sepia & almonds.With half bottle of white wine.. $86 for 2 peopleExpensive, yes, worth it.. debatable. It's Tuesday and packed with a 90 minute wait."
"I actually ate here last month but it completely slipped my mind to write a review about how great the food was! We went there around 6pm on a Monday and the wait wasn't too long for a table for two.  We had our choice of where to sit but I thought sitting at the ""chef's table"" right next to where they cook would be interesting. It was nice seeing everything being prepared but I DO think you get a bit more of the food smell on your clothes so that might be something to think about. We ordered a bottle of red wine and now onto the food...It's great that they serve small dishes. I love trying a bit of everything so this is perfect!  Some dishes that stuck in my mind after all this time are the Prosciutto Bread Balls, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs smear, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and the Wagyu Sirloin Tip. They also have a nice selection of cured meats and cheese (which I'll just have to try next time).I will DEFINITELY be going back again, although this might be a restaurant I visit only once in awhile as a indulgent treat. Eating there too often might affect your waistline ;) I would recommend smaller groups and going earlier in the evening if you don't want to wait too long."
We went on a Sunday night and there was no wait but it was full. They have some tables with community seating so we sat at a table with 2 different groups. Let me tell you the food is not only unique but awesome.  We had the pig tails and chicken thighs. They come in small portions but 3 different plates for 2 people is perfect. The wine selection is huge! They have a huge patio overlooking the river. Please check it out!
"I could see how The Purple Pig would be really beautiful in the summer but I digress.Upon entrance The Purple Pig is equal parts cozy and cute with large wooden wine barrels that serve as decor, spanish style tiles on the wall with an overall ""chestnuts roasting by the fireplace"" feel.   Service was quick and attentive.  Wine glasses are sparkly and large, practically begging you to order one.  On to the food....When the food first arrived my first thought was, OMG, I am going to leave this place hungry....the portion just aren't huge.  But after splitting each one, I realized I was getting quite full.  Each dish I had was amazing and I was skeptical b/c some of them sounded interesting and sometimes that can lead you down the wrong path but these were killer:Eggplant parmesan balls (OMG soooo good)Meatball slider with parmesan, arugula on brioche (soooo delicious)Chicken thigh kabobs with fried smashed potatos and tzatziki (sooooo good)Some sweet potato appetizer with sunflower seeds (sounds weird but tasted delicious).Truly impressed with each thing that came out.  Didn't even end up making it to dessert."
"So nice, I had to come twice. You will notice a few 5-star reviews for my trip to Chicago..that's because they know what the hell they are doing over there. Great, great food city that rivals NYC. Purple Pig lives up to its name as it offers many different delicious parts of the swine as well as other unhealthy cuts of meat, offal, and spreads. First time we dined at the bar, decond time at a communal table (what's with Chicago and communal tables?) Had a great bottle of Nero d'avola both times for a great price..we fell in love with this wine and I will be looking high and low for it in every wine shop I enter. I run doen of the food we consumed ravenously--pig ears with crispy kale, cherry peppers, and poached egg-bone marrow-foie gras-pork blade steak-steak-fried deviled eggs-sweetbreads with fennel and apricot-chicken thigh kabobs--sicilian iris-desert panini with hazelnut and banana and marshmallowthere were one or two other things..drawing a blank..but it was all great stuff."
"i LOVED this place.  Great food, great wine selection, and great energy both in the staff and clientele.  I chose this place to go for my birthday dinner based on great reviews from friends and I was not at all disappointed. The only downside is that you can't make a reservation.  We went on a Friday night knowing we would have to wait.  They told us an hour and 20 minutes when we came in so we hovered over some people at the bar who looked close to finishing their meals.  We ended up sitting at the bar in about 20 minutes which worked out perfectly.  The servers are very knowledgeable about both their wine selection and menu.  We asked the people next to us and our server for some recommendations, and everything we got was SO good.  They have a large selection of cheese which was a big reason why I wanted to go in the first place.  We ordered 4 different cheeses and some other small plates.  Everything we ordered was just so delicious - fried deviled egg?  Yes please!  All of the unique ways that they use pork were awesome. I can't wait to go again!Just one note: the place has a bunch of communal tables, so if you are looking for a romantic meal, this is not the place.  I was initially disappointed by this, but by the end of the meal, I totally forgot because all I could think about was how great the food was."
"The food was indeed fabulous - but the service was lackluster at best.  We waited a long time to order and then our waitress forgot to enter parts of our order - so we didn't get our full meal - by the time we realized that she had forgot (small plates come out as they are ready - so it wasn't immediately apparent) it was too late to order more.   She was not at all apologetic and did not make any gesture to make it right.  For this caliber of restaurant, this feels unacceptable."
"This place opens at 11:30 am and we got here are 12 and it was near capacity for lunch.  This is a great Mediterranean / tapas place, as well as having some new american dishes.  I would 100% go back...too bad I don't live in Chicago.  Location is great and atmosphere is very lively.  We had a good time."
"My boyfriend and I had the Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda, chorizo stuffed olives, and wagyu sirloin tip dishes. All were very delicious. One thing though that I would change is rather then breading and frying the olives just keep it raw and stuffed with sausage. But at least my bf liked the crunchy texture... I took a star away because we ate at the bar and it was super cramped because they tried to stick as many chairs as possible in. There was literally no space between you and your neighbor. Didnt't make a great eating experience with a stranger's elbow randomly bumping into me."
"The wait for a table is very much worth it... while waiting on the patio area the staff comes and offers the wine list and you can order a bottle, glass, etc while waiting.  Perfect!  The smells from the kitchen are amazing.I'm not a fan of beets, but the roasted salted beets with goat cheese and pistachios were amazing.  The saltiness of the nuts and the beets was perfect with the creaminess of the goat cheese.Pork liver pate is awesome. Smokey and smooth.  Was a bit more of a mouse than a pate, but tasted like a smokey baloney spread for adults.The roasted bone marrow... is excellent.  Served with a nice crusty bread, it was like beef butter.  Pork and waygo beef stuffed pepper was good, but the mix was slightly loose.  Would like to see it a bit firmer but the flavors were awesome.Finally the Pork Secreto with roasted Pepper and pickled watermelon rind was stunning.  The meat is so buttery and flavorful.  YUM!The staff was great.  We sat at the bar, and Jamie took great care of us."
"Hurray for cheese, wine, and swine.  This new place on the miracle mile is a new gem in Chicago.  It's just been awarded the Michelin bib gourmand award for excellent food and value. We had a great time just a few days away from christmas as i felt lucky to get in.  Good thing that they don't take reservations and it's first come first serve...so we got there before the dinner rush.   The menu is Mediterranean inspired with lots of choices and small plates to choose from.  In general, they have an excellent selection of smoked meats, cheeses, and of course very unique ways to serve a pig.  We tried the Pig's ear with fried egg, milk braised pork, seared steak, big ed cheese, chorizo stuffed olives, braised pig tail with hard boiled egg, and smoked meat tray. I would recommend all of the them.  For dessert, i'd reco the banana and nutela sandwich.  Really good.They also have a monster selection of wine but we stuck with one - gavani, a Tuscan red wine.Great place. Go with some time because you need to sit and enjoy the food and atmosphere."
"One of the best meals I've had here in Chicago. The corn bread is amazing, as are the smears. You pretty much can't go wrong. It's a small place and they don't take reservations so get there early to put your name down. Kind of pricey, but it's so worth it. GOOOOO!!!"
"Finally! Took long enough for me to cross the street post workday for a little wine, cheese and charcuterie decadence. I can't imagine why, not only are these a few of my favorite things, but the sheer proximity to my office alone should really lend itself to visits of constant and recurring nature. Well, after this introductory rendezvous, I can tell you, they better set up a table with my name on it! I'm moving in. The Purple Pig certainly has the potential to be quite habit forming. Expansive, affordable wine list, delicious and unique menu offerings, cheeses that are positively TO-DIE-FOR, friendly, warm staff, cozy confines. What more could a girl want? Wine intravenously. Well yes, that still leaves some potential for growth, I assume. Absolutely treasured the ample salt-roasted Beets with tangy whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette small plate almost as well as the luxurious Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary and buttery roasted Garlic. Talk about fabu finger good! Moving on to our cheese plate, however, was undoubtedly the highlight of my evening. Meeting the creamy, gorgeous, slightly stinky, French (of course), Delice de Bourgogne fromage was a pleasure of epic proportions. It's luscious, earth shattering and comes with my highest delightful dairy recommendations. Then, of course, there's the meat. They don't call it the Purple Pig for nothin'. It almost feels unladylike indulging in such gluttonous, excessively meat-heavy dishes, but fortunately, the ingenious Purple Pig chefs know to portion things just so to keep both guilt and depravity in blissfully unaware check. Go for the delicate, crispy Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate or my fav, the Jamon Serrano with a perfectly Fried Egg and nutty Manchego. Wow. Just wow. I hear 'The Pig' also pulls off one of the best desserts in the city, a Sicilian Iris - ahem, Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche - my umpteen future sojourns positively guarantee I'll soon find out! Heck, I'm already racing full speed ahead to become a legitimate purple pig. I wonder if they'd pay well for a live mascot?"
Everything was great.  Just let the wait staff order for you.  You'll never order anything if you try to imagine it from the menu.
"Came here a little after 5:00 on a Thursday with a friend and his co-worker and it was already packed to the snout.  We got seated shortly thereafter at a communal trough and were ready to pig out. We shared the prosciutto bread balls, the Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, the Purple Pig Platter (a charcuterie plate), Charred Ramps and Scallions with Romesco Sauce, and Jamon Serrano with a Duck Egg and Asparagus.  I liked everything I tried and there were many more dishes I wanted to try but I did not have any more room in my pork belly.Four oinks up!"
"Delish Tapas, everything tickled our taste buds!  Long wait but def worth it!"
"We went there around 7 PM and hung out at the patio, had a few glasses of wine while we waited for the next two hours, we didn't mind the wait so much because it was sort of worth it, all in all a different kind of food experience. They have an impressive wine list which is decently priced. We got seated at a large table with other customers, this I believe is the only con for this place. We had the corner of the table to ourselves and everyone who walked past, nudged. Ugh. We ordered several small plates which included the infamous bone marrow, peas and bacon with spearmint, Berkshire pork chops and the fried pig ears. All our dishes were scrumptious but I wasn't a big fan of the pig ears, it turned out a little too fried and little too salty. I like the over all concept of swine and wine but I would say this definitely would be a $$$ place as opposed to yelp's $$."
"Came here for late night eats on a Wednesday while visiting Chicago for the first time. We heard about the bone marrow and the pig ears, so right away we ordered those. We also ordered the braised pork shoulder in mashed potato, cheese tray & wine, as their motto is ""cheese, swine & wine"" or something like that.Our waitress picked out our cheeses & our wines. We told her what we liked and she got it on point. I don't remember what 3 cheeses she picked, but I told her to go with hard cheeses & they were absolutely fab with the white wine she paired it with. Now, there is a trick to eating the bone marrow, which I didn't know about & the server let me in on. At first I was just smearing the marrow on my piece of toast. It was pretty heavy and oily. So if you get this, first smear the marrow, then add some greens, top it off with some salt, and the end result is a completely different flavor. It's so much better with all the the other stuff on it. If you order the pig ears, it comes with an egg on top. Break it and mix all the ingredients together. It's a bit salty, but it's pig ears, how else would they taste?The braised pork shoulder reminded me of the holidays. It just tastes liked Thanksgiving or Christmas. It is very tender and pulls apart very easily. But out of all the dishes we had that night, my favorite was the cheese. It's hard to find good cheese!"
"I found myself staying downtown with no dinner plans, so of course I turned to Yelp to direct me somewhere new. When a place called The Purple Pig showed up only steps away from my hotel, we decided to give it a shot. We had no idea we would be in for such a delight after we passed under the random gate off Michigan Avenue.Highlights for our meal:- Grilled Cheese of the Day - Since they offer a large variety of cheeses for cheese plates, they take the leftover pieces and melt them into one amazingly tasty sandwich- Braised Baby Artichokes with Fingerling Potatoes,Asiago & Salami Toscana - Just the right balance of vinegar- Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - This was SO good, I went back already and had it again. Eggplant is not a favorite of mine, but this dish changed my perspective. (yelp.com/biz_photos/boE4…)And the best part? We stuffed ourselves silly with delicious food and the check was still just over $20 each! Though we didn't drink wine, their wine list looks worthy of another visit."
"sunday brunch. 5 topI called in ahead to see if they took reservations and how busy they were and the host was less than polite - snappy and inpatient.Many of the dishes are small plate concepts. we shared:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami ToscanaSome salad with rabbit and Truffle VinaigrettePig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried EggSalami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive TapenadeCoppa with Provolone Cheese, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Creole Mustard (sub coppa with artichoke)Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive OilPork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & HoneyRamps with Asparagus, Fried Egg, over ToastThe rabbit salad and artichokes were refreshing - they were okPig's ear dish did not do pig's ear justice - battered and fried so the taste and texture was lostRazor clams and Pork Blade - juicy, flavorful, and differentRamps - all the elements worked well together. the toast soaked up the egg and pork juicesOverall everything would have been better with less salt including the bloodys we ordered. Service was semi slow and nonchalant. Coppa sandwich - the pork was substituted with artichoke because the individual did not eat pork. We were charged for the amount of the artichoke appetizer for it. The up-charge would have been more ok had we been notified prior to the bill but nothing was ever mentioned. The Salami Panini did not come out until we were almost done with our meal which ended up being comped. Nice concept and perhaps it was just not its day but with so many restaurants in our great city I was not impressed- too salty, not clear regarding there would be an up-charge, mediocre service"
"I was in town on business and had Yelped this restaurant ahead of time and put it on my ""to do"" list.  I was glad I did.  Although it was stiflingly hot outside and there was quite a wait for dinner, my companion and I waited only about 15 minutes before being escorted inside to a seat at a communal table.  I'm all for communal tables but I was seated on the leg and with a short dress on it was going to be difficult for me to sit comfortably.  Luckily my companion switched seats with me.  Before we even ordered my companion and I enquired about getting separate checks.  We were told they don't do separate checks but we can pay with separate credit cards *puzzled look*. Since we both were on business accounts that was going to be a problem.  Nevertheless, we ordered and shared our plates of peas and bacon (OMFG), cauliflower (meh), Taramosalata (yum), Octopus (delish) and Sepia with Almonds (ok).  I still dream about the peas.  I believe they were described as spring peas with fresh mint and bacon *drools*.  I have seriously considered hanging out at the airport and accosting someone travelling to Chicago to bring me this dish upon their return.  Of course there is probably a recipe I could get for this dish...I suspect I may even be able to make it myself.  But I digress.  I also enjoyed two glasses of Vinho Verde which were perfect given the summer heat.  I would have drunk the whole dang bottle but I was trying to impress my conference buddy.Go to the Purple Pig and enjoy.  If you dine inside, the key (Rosetta Stone) for the ingredients is above your head written on the lampshades - no kidding!"
"Every time I'm in Chicago, I make sure to stop by this place.  Menu is varied, food is amazeballs and prices are quite, quite reasonable for a great restaurant on Michigan Ave.  In true Spanish fashion, the kitchen is open til midnight.  This is the best food available in Chicago after 10, no doubt about it.  Of course, because of this, you are likely to wait a bit for a table.  Get yourself a drink and wait.  Peculiar thing:  The Scotch selection is second-to-none.  Better selection than most bars in the area, no joke.  This time I had the pork shoulder, clams, mussels and pork tripe...  all amazing bites."
"The headline: Overpriced for what you get, which is pretty ordinary.We headed over to the PP for a late lunch on a weekday.  We found an interesting wine list (no US wine, but plenty of Old World choices) and a very hard to navigate menu.  We were looking for lots of porcine options, but found surprisingly few.  We ended up with a range of four appetizer or tapas-like choices.While everything was OK, the quality was very ordinary and the prices very high.  For example, the Catalonian Fuet turned out to be a small plate of  small slices of salami.  Ok, fine, but not for $7. When I asked for some bread to go with it, I was told, ""we don't have bread service.""  Credit to the servier, who snuck out a few slices of toasted bread at no charge. The ""Fois Gras"" was not fois gras, not even pate fois gras, but a small cup of fois gras-flavored cream spread.  OK, but not for $15.  In all, we hade one glass of wine each, spent $75 and left feeling hungry.The outdoor seating area, just off Michigan Ave., was very pleasant.  On a nice day PP might be a good place for a glass of wine after work with a side nibble.  Otherwise, pass.  Perhaps the main mean choices are better?"
"They don't take reservations which means you get to be a wine sipping creeper either inside the small place or outside if the weather is nice. I had a hard time getting a table for just one---even a bar seat. I had to be that wine swilling weirdo waiting to see if people were paying their tab or not. Eventually, my creeping paid off. I got a bar seat right in front of the chefs and OMG! I had the beets with goat cheese-brilliant. The delicious crispy pig ear is inspired. The waiter mixed the fried egg into the ears for me and I went to town. For my last dish, I consulted the chef who was a very nice man. He suggested the octopus but I have a hard time eating octopus. They are so darn smart. So I asked for a second suggestion and he steered me to the manila clams with house made merguez sausage. The dish came with a lovely sherry and smoked paprika infused sauce that I sopped up with the crusty bread which was served alongside. I did not order dessert but a gentleman next to me shared a piece of chocolate cake which the chef said was his mother's recipe. It was divine. Of note, the staff are very friendly and make great wine suggestions. I explained they types of wine that I like and was steered toward some very nice selections. I dropped $100 bucks on dinner for myself but I did drink a good bit of wine :D Go here and eat everything!"
"There are some places you eat at where it's not all about the food...but not in a bad way. Purple Pig is every bit an experience as much as it is a great place for food. On our first trip to the famous restaurant, we arrived just 30 minutes after they opened and were hearing rumblings of a 45-minute wait. The very kind hostess told us 30 minutes originally, but then she was able to sneak us a couple seats at the end of the bar. This turned out to be a wonderful treat, because we were face to face with the chefs the entire time!We tried the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, which was a tiny bit underwhelming. As a concept and trend, you'd expect a lot of flavor, but it was more of a unique experience. Definitely tasty (comes with grilled fresh bread and a cilantro and onion salad with a lemon vinaigrette) but not a life-changer. Next we had the Eggplant Parmesan Balls, which were fried goodness. It's a very interesting and delicious take on the traditional eggplant parmesan. Finally, we had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. My husband was super pumped about this dish, considering it's something you rarely ever see on a menu, but again it wasn't so much that it was a flavor or taste we had never had before, but it was a delicious way to eat an ingredient we'd never eaten before.The environment is very loud and bustling, but again, not in a bad way. Sitting so close to the kitchen staff, we felt like we were witnessing an episode of Top Chef, and it was truly an unforgettably wonderful experience, even if it wasn't ALL because of the food."
"I was a bit apprehensive about visiting Purple Pig as I had heard it had a unique menu and was always packed.  After my first visit, I had to return - once the next week and again a few weeks later.  The restaurant was definitely packed at 6pm on a Thursday night (and the other times I was there), but on my first visit, I managed to snag part of the 'chef's table' which is located at the end of the bar.  It was a great spot to sit - right in the middle of all of the action - and it was easy to check out the dishes to determine what to eat.  The bone marrow was fantastic - I've had it at various locations around the city and the Purple Pig preparation was one of my favorites.  I also tried the tuna, and meat and cheese platters.The wine list is extensive, and has a nice selection from many regions.  Also to be found at the Purple Pig are hard to locate beers (which made my international work colleagues quite happy).  The staff is knowlegeable about the wine and food options and are more than happy to help.If you must have a table, visit early.  The bar is a great spot, but eating at a table or outside (with nice weather) are great options as well.  A perfect spot for any outing in the city.  The location can't be beat."
"Went to The Purple Pig about a month ago. This is one of the best tapas style/ small plates restaurants at which I have eaten. We had the stuffed olives, the eggplant parmesan balls, the meatball slider, the pork tripe, the antipasti calamari and a few other things. The calamari pleasantly surprised me: it was not your typical breaded calamari with marinara, but rather a light, cool salad of radishes, cucumbers and calamari. I strongly recommend any of these dishes, and consider the restaurant to be a must-visit if you're ever near the Magnificent Mile."
"I loved everything. It was a perfect night for our outdoor seating.Ordered: pig ears with crisy kale and fried egg.  By far my favorite.  Also order the buffalo cheese with salami. Very good. Enjoyed them both. Had the bone marrow. I've always grown up eating it but it was my husband's first time. We both enjoyed it. Finally had the wagyu and that was pretty good. I personally thought the vinaigrette over power the flavor of wagyu too much, husband loved it though. Everything was wonderful from service to food to atmosphere."
"very busy, long wait for seating, touristy cuz it's on Michigan ave, but a convenient place to have an afternoon meal after shopping on Magnificent milebut....YUMMY FOOD!good and would order again:pig ears: thinly slice/fried(almost like onion rings, you won't even notice the cartilage), with pickled peppers, and overeasy egg, and some other stuff (my favorite dish)octopus: with green peans and potatoes and some sort of salsa verde, yum!panzanella salad with rabbitgood, but probably wouldn't order again:roasted beetswould not order again:pig jowl: marinated jowl seared/crispy with over easy egg, asparagus, served on a crostini that i think i had some sort of pate on it...if you like bacon but only the fat part of bacon, you'll like this dish...but wow, its so heavy! it put me in a food coma. The jowl+pate+eggyolk was just to heavy all togetherwould go back, prices are decentthey have outdoor & indoor seating"
"This is one of the more unique restaurants I've been to! I took my boyfriend there for dinner this past week. Being a Wednesday, I figured that we wouldn't have to wait too, too long for a table (they don't take reservations, which is unfortunate), but the wait for two people was 1.5 hours! We debated going elsewhere, but the unique menu grabbed our attention so we ended up just getting a drink and waiting on their outdoor patio. The menu is big, and everything is very different. I'd recommend the summer squash salad, beets/goats cheese appetizer, and definitely the two ""entree"" selections (more like large tapas plates) we got - the octopus with potatoes/green beans, and the milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. We also tried the bone marrow spread due to the rave reviews we'd read, but it didn't really impress us too much...it's essentially like spreading fat over an already-buttered slice of bread. But hey, at least we can say we tried it!  Atmosphere is good, but rather loud and packed. I wouldn't want to go there on a weekend. Our server was fine but perhaps a little hurried, although she definitely steered us in the right direction regarding the octopus! Prices are reasonable but tend to add up quickly when you order several small plates. Don't go overboard...the food is quite rich/heavy and good for sharing. Not sure if I'd go back, but I'd recommend it for a cool and different dining experience!"
"I've gone here twice and both experiences continued the trend of being disappointed by over-hyped restaurants. I've tried the porchetta, beets with goat cheese,  eggplant caponata, milk braised pork shoulder, and one of the paninis. Of that list, everything was serviceable but nothing striking. The only redeeming qualities was the bottle of wine we ordered and being outside on a nice day. Other than that, I don't see myself going back.from my visits on 9/4/11 and 10/7/11"
Delicious!!!!!!
"the menu is very difficult to understand with all the uncommon descriptions; so, it is intimidating but the food is fabulous and very unique.  YOU MUST BE A FAN OF PORK TO EAT HERE!  I had the best pork shoulder ever!  The smashed potatoes aren't worth the price and neither is the neck bone rague. But the avocado salada, the cauliflower and meatballs are delish!  If you are a picky eater, don't expect them to change up your order. What you see on the menu is what you get - no changes or substitutions allowed. Kinda snobby if you ask me. But if you're willing to take risk, go for it!"
"Absolutely amazing! While on vacation we visited this great spot because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint! The wait was an hour at 7 pm on a Thursday, but we went shopping nearby in the meantime. Their signature cocktails were different and delicious (the fizz, and an orange vodka drink). We started with the fried deviled egg and the Greek cornbread. So different than anything I've had, but great flavors. They were small portions, but a good size for sharing between 2 people. We chose the ""JLT"" as recommended by our waiter, which is a pork jowl sandwich, and it sounded scary at first, but I'm glad we got it. The jowl tasted like thick bacon and was so scrumptious. For dessert, we decided on the Sicilian Iris, which was a fried donut filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate. Again, very different and rich, but I definitely recommend it! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very loud, but we sat side by side at a large table and it wasn't too bad. I would definitely recommend to try this place and to try something on the menu that you normally wouldn't try... I'm sure it will be worth it!"
"I'm rating this 4 stars due to the great ambiance, crowd, and service.  The food was tapas stye and the eggplant caponata was my favorite dish.  My friend and I tried the popular pig's ears appetizer but it was too salty for us.  We waited for about 30 minutes for the outside seating area.  The patio was heated so we didnt feel uncomfortable.  Great location for an interesting meal and its in a prime location."
"I've heard so much about The Purple Pig that I finally decided to go with a friend to try it out. The wait was 2 hours, which wasn't bad for a weekend night, and the service was great.In terms of the food, we ordered the most popular items on the menu: bone marrow smear, fried pig ears, and milk braised pork.The bone marrow smear was pretty much inedible. The bread was drenched in oil and the bone marrow had no taste. The fried pig ears were also a let down. Not very flavorful - mainly just tasted the fried batter. Per the server, the way you're supposed to eat the dish is by breaking the yolk and mixing it in, however the egg was beyond well done and the yolk was rock hard. The milk braised pork was the saving grace of the meal. It was really excellent - the meat was tender and the mashed potatoes were a good textural contrast with a lot of flavor.Overall, I don't see what all the hype is all about. The food was okay, but not worth the time or the money. Maybe we just had bad luck with our meal, but I won't be going back here."
"I can't say I'll be coming back here. The wait is stupid long and you have to stand outside while waiting because the inside is so packed and congested. We sit down and I'm impressed by the options with both drink and food. I give the place kudos for that. and really the prices are not that bad given it's right on Michigan ave. We made our orders and instead of them bringing us our food at the same time, each person got it at different times. I did not like this. It left some of us sitting at the table food'less while everyone else was eating, We're talking like a 15 minute interval between dishes. It's so cramped in there that people and staff coming in kept bumping me and the cold air from the door made me had to leave my coat on. The food was ok. It was over salted and ingredient that were more on the pungent side were tasty but overly used so you got annoyed with it after the third bite. Good service though. The waiter knew his stuff."
Been here a few times.  Unique and does not disappoint.  Right near the Intercontinental and location is great.
"Amazing, amazing place. Did I say amazing? Lol, this place is worth the wait. But try not to go on their busiest days which is Friday and Saturday night. Really pricey but if you want to splurge eating out, this is the place. There isn't much to be said again due to the consistently positive review on this fine establishment, so just try it. Oh and you must love pork and have an open mind, for it is some of the best pork you'll find in the city."
"I went to The Purple Pig late last Saturday night, well technically it was Sunday morning, and we had a great time there. Our reservations were at midnight because most of us work the late shift at restaurants as cooks,chefs or waitstaff. Midnight worked best for us night-owls. The overall experience was wonderful and I'd definitely come back again. We all ordered drinks and they came out promptly. We drank everything from their sparkling Cava to pints of Reissdorf Kölsch beer. Then we started with and shared their antipasti dishes. We enjoyed dishes like the Farro with Roasted Rutebega & Feta, Marinated Olives, Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic and all were succulent and delicious. Second course was the Fried Items and Smears. We had the Winter Squash & Goat Cheese Arancini with Sage Pesto, Prosciutto (fried) Bread Balls and the Pork Liver Paté and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs which we smeared on crusty crostini. Being late at night we didn't want too much food with our drinks. We had just the right amount and chef Jimmy Bannos Sr. (Chef/Partner at The Purple Pig; Chef/Owner at Heaven On Seven) served us many of our dishes and stuck around chatted with our table. The food was great, servers and chefs were top notch and the overall experience was quite amazing. See you very soon Purple Pig and definitely try the Smears."
"Been waiting to try this place for years and went twice in the last month (yeah it's that good). You really can't go wrong with anything off the menu. The bone marrow lived up to the hype and while it is pretty heavy, sharing with friends and having 1-2 pieces is simply amazing. Other highlight dishes are the octopus (pricey for how much you get though), the JLT, the cauliflower (the only vegetable in a pork fest), and the turkey leg was also cooked really well. Overall, just order a bunch of dishes and ""pig out"" =)"
"This place was my last meal in Chicago before leaving at the end of a weekend visit to my friend.So the two of us stopped in with fingers crossed, but low hopes of not having to wait for a table at 6:30PM on a Sunday night.  I couldn't afford a wait because my flight back was at 9:30, and we were tight on time, but I still insisted that I wanted to check this place out.Luckily, we were seated right away, and the service was very quick and attentive as well.  Very impressive.We weren't too hungry, so we decided to go with 3 dishes between us though we wanted to try an infinite number.  We got the following:roasted beet, goat cheese, pistachio saladfried pig ear with deep fried kale and an eggbone marrow spreadThe roasted beets were great.  My friend was quite surprised that we could be taught to appreciate such an unpopular item of food such as a beet.  He gave mad kudos to purple pig for that.Then the pig ear...the egg was slightly overcooked because there was no ""runny part"" of the egg yolk to break, but it was fine.  Still a good dish.The bone marrow...need I say more?  I just love bone marrow, and they do it well.When I come back to Chicago, definitely stopping by here again, but properly next time for the full wine and dine experience."
"Wouldn't recommend this place.  The food is VERY salty and VERY oily.  Nothing we had was great or even good. Over rated, over priced and not with the wait."
"This place is BUSY and there's a GREAT reason for it! Hear me out. I am going to start off by saying, I'm a sucker for anything Pork. I think it's fair to say, they celebrate pork here in a way that truly does this fine diversely flavorful animal justice. What a delicious meal we had here...from apps, to wine to cheese to cured meats...even the service was so very knowledgeable and passionate about the offerings. Starters: Wine. We asked what would go well with pork since we knew that would be the main event. The server recommended an Italian Red called Vesevo Taurasi 2003. This wine was the perfect pairing for our meal. Wrote that one down. Saved it for later. For the price, the complexity & balance was all there. Bold, Earthy, Smooth to the finish. Well. Color me impressed!Pig Ear & Kale salad to start. This salad comes with a poached egg on top steamed kale & crunchy fried pig ears. The combination of the crispy & tart kale along with the savory gooey egg and the crunchy smoked bacon flavor of the pig ear? OH ME OH MY. What a dish! This alone could garner 5 stars in my book. This was the superstar dish of the evening and is a MUST must must try. If the idea of eating a pig's ear makes you squeamish, try and ignore your former preconceptions and give it a try. I guarantee you, you will not be sorry you did!Next up: Lardon Iberico, house cured. Lardon is my most guiltiest of pleasures. I guess the pigs of this region eat a lot of acorns, giving the Lardon a particularly nutty flavor. The Lardon is thinly sliced and laid over a thick toasted baguette with slightly charred edges. The buttery, nutty, pork flavored...sinfully rich...melt in your mouth Lardon was just to DIE for! Although we had been told about several amazing entrees the Purple Pig is known for, we HAD to try the cheeses and meats. They had a glossary of meats & cheeses clothes pinned to lamps hanging above the tables. Each meat and cheese offered that night was described on this list. I found this very helpful & clever. Meat (in order of most favorite to least) 1. Prosciutto di Parma. Heavenly razor thin slices of exceptional Proscuitto. 2. Jamon Serrano3. SopressataCheese (also in order of most favorite to least)1.Manchego - Spanish hard cheese nutty with a slight sharpness. paired great with the spicy Sopressata & the Prosciutto. 2. Cave Man Blue - sharp blue cheese from Indiana. Really tasted great on it's own and also with the Proscuitto di Parma. 3. Podda - soft goat cheese from Italy. Very subtle flavor, almost too much so but paired very well with the fig preserves.For Dessert, we ordered the Lemon Panna Cota. I have always been a fan of panna cota. It's light, it's fluffy, it's well...a no brainer when I see it on the menu. So naturally, the Lemon Panna Cota came and I was quite excited. I was not let down. The lemon flavor was there, but not in the least overpowering. The pistachios gave the dish a much needed texture contrast with the ""crunch"" they added and a slight bit of nutty & almost caramelized flavor. Candied lemon rinds were added in for an extra aromatic & sweet punch. Panna Cota perfection! What an understated beauty. The best kind, in my book. The Purple Pig is an establishment that harnesses great respect from food lovers like myself. Why? The devotion to true taste, flavors, tradition & expert execution to top it all off. How can you not like a place like this?"
"Purple just happens to be one of my favorite colors (NU alum).   While I usually prefer fish instead of pigs, this place has been calling my name since they opened their doors a few months ago.I've been trying to get my friends to dine here for several months, but the menu didn't appeal to most of them (sigh). Fortunately, Johnny T was ready to ""pig"" out with me here at lunch last Friday.We skipped the wine since we had lots of work waiting for us post lunchtime. Sigh.  And so good eats it was:Butternut Squash3 cheeses (parmesan, a mild cheddar and monchego)And then we really went crazy by ordering the meat platter (we were inspired by the peeps at the table next to us).The butternut squash was delish...the pumpkin seeds in it were a nice touch.  I couldn't get enough of all 3 cheeses. And the meat platter was really interesting! As mentioned above I'm typically more of a pescatarian, but if any restaurant is going to convert you into a carnivore it's The Purple Pig.The meat was served on a platter shaped like a pig and I could just feel the head oinking at me as we pigged out, but this meal was well worth the extra few miles I'd have to run on the track.Service was just so-so. Our waiter was pleasant enough, but ignored us most of the time and it took forever to flag him down for the check.  I'm already looking forward to my next trip here, which will hopefully include a glass (or 2) from their incredible looking wine menu."
After seeing all good reviews finally tried it  and disappointed .
"My. God.Part 2 of a perfect day I recently spent in Chicago. Perfect vibe, amazing food, great wine list all make for a perfect canvas for good friends and better conversation.It's a wrap, this and Potbelly will be permanently on my goto list in Chi town.oinkers."
"Very unique restaurant, serving all kinds of meat!  It's a meat lovers delight!  It was crowded for a weekday lunch hour, but still got seated within 20 mins, not bad.  However, the minute we got seated, our server kept coming to us like within 5-10 mins asking if we had questions, etc.  The first few times was like ok, great customer service, the few after that quickly turned into, ok we are fine! we will order food and ask more questions when we need to!!  Wish our party of 3 could have tried more food, but one of us was too full from alcohol the night before!  So all we got to try was:Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - tasty!Two different kinds of cured meats - can't go wrong with thinly sliced salted ham!It's a fun place, but I need to definitely come back and try a whole lot more!"
"With all of the rave and amazing things I have heard about The Purple Pig I was expecting a long wait and to be blown away by their pork dishes.  We did have a long wait.  My BF and I went with another couple and we got there at six and sat down at around 7:30pm.  However, I wasn't blown away by their dishes.  Don't get me wrong, Purple pig is good, just not amazing.Here is what we ordered:Fried Devil Egg:  My favorite thing on the menu, deep fried devil egg..I mean what can go wrong..that is right..nothing :)Bone marrow smear: bone marrow tasted as if they just filled the bone marrow with tons of melted butter so it was a little watery and not as velvetly and rich as the marrow I have had at other places.Cardoons: Cardoons are artichoke thistle and are deep fried (don't worry I had to google what cardoons were) I would pass on these, they just tasted like anything fried so nothing that original.Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio smear: smear was different than I expected, it was two pieces of french bread topped with this full pink smear with some crushed up pistachios.  While it looked kind of suspect, it tasted somewhat like home.  I told that to my friend and she mentioned that it tasted like baloney and I agreed.  It was pretty tasty!Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: the pork shoulder was tender and when you sliced it with your fork, it fell apart like butter on a hot knife.  I do agree that it was good, but I expected a bit more flavor after reading all of the awesome reviews on thisPork Saltimbocca with Rainbow Swiss Chard: bacon is placed on top of a pork tenderloin and is pounded all together..and that is exactly what it tasted like.  Not impressive.We also order the special of the day which was razor clams, I really liked this dish.  My only complaint was that there wasn't more clams on the plate.Jamon Serrano, Oyster Mushrooms, Fried Egg with Grilled Bread:  I can't say I remember too much about this dish, so I would say to skip this and spend your time on another dish :)For dessert, we all shared the affogato, the bread pudding, and the nutella pannini.  I really liked all of the desserts.  I was especially impressed with the bread pudding since I didn't expect to like citrus bread pudding.I had a good experience at Purple Pig, but I can't say that I am quick to get back to the Purple Pig.  I would like to try out Publican to see if their pork dishes compare with Purple Pig first."
"Good but not really impressed. Strolled up to the bar at 7:30 on Saturday night and snagged to seats. Bartender was awesome and made some great recommendations. Had a nice bottle of red. Beet salad good but how can you F that up. Fried deviled egg was decent but again, how can you F up anything deep fried. Foie Gras was awesome. And the pig jowl was decent.Onto dessert which was a real kicker for me. I didn't realize the Nutella panini was in fact bread with bananas, Nutella, and marshmallows. Really. I could have made 12 of these at home for $8!! And the Verdi chili stout was in fact gross or their beer lines are really dirty."
"I'm honestly not sure what all the fuss is about. We stopped by around 5 on a weeknight to grab a bite on the way home from work, and were promptly seated outside (the inside was already full). Our table was adjacent to a heater, but also adjacent to the bus stand, and all of the servers and bussers congregated basically on top of us for the duration of our stay. The service was just okay - our server was a little abrasive. The food was just okay - we ordered a selection of cheeses that were delicious, but minuscule portions for the amount being charged. The bread served with the cheese was delicious, The wine was just okay - and I'd expect something at least *good* for $15/glass. We left without ordering more food - it wasn't worth the discomfort of the experience, the poor service, or the price point - and I probably won't be back."
love it.  I always go during semi-off hours to spare myself the wait.  My favorite dish is the fried cheese.  Go try it.
"I went here last night with my boyfriend (who was against tapas until last night- he prefers 'full' meals). We arrived around 6:30 and had a 45 minute wait- not surprised at all, but they did have a cocktail server walking around so you could have a drink while you waited. When we were finally seated we ordered:- chorizo stuffed olives- fresh spring peas with bacon & spearmint- meatball sliders- milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoesAll of them were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (especially the fresh spring peas, I'm still dreaming about that one!). I could've done without the olives, though. They were good, but not as on-par as everything else. While the food was delicious & the atmosphere was nice, the service was what turned us off. We had to wait about 5 minutes before our waitress came to the table and when she finally did she didn't offer any suggestions, ask us if it was our first time, etc - but she did that with all other tables surrounding us. Then when she realized we weren't ordering any alcohol our service completely went down. During our whole time there, she came to our table 4 times. 1) to place the order2) to refill our sodas (she didn't even bring them out to us)3) to give us our check4) to return our cardIt wouldn't have been so terrible except we both wanted refills on our soda and she walked by 3 times- looking at the table, mind you- and she didn't do anything.I will most likely be back to try more things, but if you're coming here- don't expect the best service for the price you're paying!"
"i'm a pescetarian (don't eat meat, but seafood okay), so i was prepared to eat nothing but bread and salad while going to the purple pig with my wife and friend. he worked with the chef a while back, so his one goal was to come here while he was in town.when we first showed up, around 6pm on a tuesday or something, it was already packed. the hostess said it'd be a 2+ hour wait. we stood around outside their patio, drinking some wine and chatting. ten minutes later, we were brought into their outdoor seating area to eat!we got some unbelievable food. and though a quick glance at the menu gives you the impression it's only meat, there's quite a bit of pescetarian awesomeness at this place. lots of veggie dishes, some great shrimp and crab dishes, etc. highly recommended, but beware the long wait."
"In Pulp Fiction, Samuel L. Jackson's character explains his position to John Travolta on why he ""don't dig on swine."" Jules Winnfield, clearly never ate at The Purple Pig.This is an one of a kind collaboration restaurant by three renowned local chef's who all have successfully flagship restaurants. I'll avoid any cheesy trio references like the Stooges or the Musketeers, but I'm blown away by The PP. The location is in a great part of the city, lot's going on and easy to find. The decor is lively, communal, and full of interesting piggie furnishings. My girl and I came on a busy night, unable to get a rezo anywhere on short notice (even at the Purple Pig). We were headed to another restaurant, but then a sign that said ""The Purple Pig"" was standing right in front of us as we were about to cross the street. After grabbing a seat at the bar, we ordered some wine and appetizers. A guy was paying his bill and about to leave, when another appetizer was placed in front of him. He begged us to enjoy it and now allow them to throw it away since he was already full and on his way out. We thanked him for his kindness and for starting our experience out in a unique way. The roasted red pepper sauce with warm goat cheese was phenomenal. The bread couldn't have been toasted any better. Shortly after we finished we were told there was a table ready for us. As we sat down our appetizer of crispy pigs ear with fried egg and the bone marrow were placed in front of us. Both were fantastic. The bone marrow had a really nice parsley salad that I enjoyed immensely. I've had marrow enjoyed marrow at home and some other places, all good. But I've never had that nice herbal salty (from capers) salad.We both agreed the pork blade steak and the milk braise pork shoulder were good, but nothing that we would keep coming back for. However, the total experience and diverse menu is worth coming back and back for. They have great cured meat and cheese selection, an abundance of interesting small plates and antipasti that aren't all pork related. Plenty of good use is made with fresh vegetables done in creative ways. The Purple Pig is certainly one of the best new restaurants in our great city and his hopefully here for years and years for people to enjoy time and time again."
"There are 4 bar seats in front of the kitchen. Snag them! Dinner and a show for the price of one. We ate a TON of food here. It was all really delicious.The beer list was not too great, and definitely expensive for what it is. The wine list, however, is great, and offer the wines by glass in different sizes. I definitely recommend going with the larger size which comes in a little carafe. Food wise, we got:Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley: Cornichons were a great little sour additionSalt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette: AWESOME Roasted Heirloom Carrots, Avocado, Fennel Toasted Quinoa, Sunflower, Sesame Seeds & Winter Citrus: Nice combo of flavorEggplant Parm Bites: Kinda greasy, but goodDeviled Egg with Arugula & Capers: Almost like a scotch egg, very good, but also greasyFried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes: awesome and deliciousEggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Smear: HUGE portionCheese plate: I forget which cheeses I picked, but they were all great. We got a cow, goat and lamb, all different hardnesses. They have a wide selection of cheeses. ENJOY!"
"Absolutely love this place.  A must dine in Chicago.  Our waitress suggested some great wine pairings that we never would have picked otherwise, including a very dry moscato to have with dessert.  Wonderful evening, great food... Slow-ish service, but the place was packed."
"I really do not like community seating.  No matter what I know ppl. are listening to my conversation, and the women across kept trying to give us there food suggestions - which we did not want/need.  I think this place is a bit overrated.  The food was okay, but nothing that I am eager to go back for. One tip: I did not like the bone marrow.  I read the reviews before going .... gave it a try, and now when I reflect on eating it I want to PUKE!  I also thought it was a tiny bit snotty.  Not really my style, at all."
"I took a friend who was visiting Chicago for the first time, from Buenos Aires.  I had watched a great segment about The Purple Pig on the TV show 24/7 with Catie Keogh and Pete McMurray -- everything looked great.  Key word, ""looked.""  We sat at the bar and I asked about the Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg app.  The ""waiter"" said he never heard of it, didn't know anything about it.  I thought this guy was joking but he was just that clueless, a very rude little man with facial hair.   After he disappeared we began ordering from a stocky woman with a big frown on her face, very unenthusiastic to be working there.  I was embarrassed to have taken my friend to such a unwelcoming place as that's not how Chicago should be represented.  Not only that, but the food sounded great on the menu, but they failed in the execution.  Everything tasted like they'd poured sea salt all over it, the cheese menu is uninspired and the meats, dull.  As we ate the plates began to pile up and they were never removed.  I had to push them to the side myself and as I was doing so, the little man said, ""Oh did you want me to remove those?""  Hmmm.  Did I want him to remove  a bunch of dirty, empty plates?  Um, yeah, Einstein!   Ridiculous.   As I was picking up my car across the street at the hotel valet I asked if he'd ever been to the Purple Pig and he said no.  I said ""Don't bother!""  He said most people say that.   So what's with all the great reviews on Yelp?  Are they paid to say this place is great?Bottom line:  Over-hyped, overpriced -- skip the Pig."
"Top notch everything. Pork heaven in all shapes and forms. Everything's great like multiple people have said  here.But honestly, why they earn the true 5-star rating is because of the educational service they provide by introducing the US to this type of menu and variety. Luckily, Chicago is sophisticated enough and continues to support this place. EVERYDAY.Will be one of my go-to places for 'small plates with friends' any time I'm in the Windy City."
"No lie--this might have been the greatest food experience I ever had. I knew going in that it would be hard to get a table: they don't take reservations, but you can book  a number of seats in person. I went a couple of hours early, put my name in, and since the bar was packed (as it is on weekends apparently), I went elsewhere to spend some time. Their recommended time was spot on and they called me on my cell. None of this does justice to how much it was worth the time. I know it's packed and the spaces require some deft navigation, but the food---everything I've tried and everything friends I have talked to have tried--is phenomenal. I tried the pig ears (with crunchy kale), chorizo stuffed olives (eat them whole--it tastes completely different from when you cut them), the pomegranate honey ribs with mint cauliflower (make sure to get all in one bite--that's the taste that will push you over the edge) and the pork shoulder with smashed potatoes (a dish whereby any and every bite is heavenly). I'm pretty much satisfied and might as well eat dog food until I get back again because nothing will compare."
"We thought we would give it a shot to see how well it compared to their competition on the west loop. First we had no issue getting a table for two at 5:30, it pays to come early. We ate outside on the communal table and it was a bit loud but was nice otherwise. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Overall a nice experience. The food was good, not great. Nothing blew me away and everything was average. We started with olive oil cured tuna and was light but it could have used more punch. The neck gravy with ricotta was very good and the bread was perfect. This was the best thing we ate. Next was the octopus and this was the worst dish as it was overcooked and chewy. The fingerlings and the verts where way over seasoned. I would also add one more portion to 4 pieces of octopus. We had the short ribs next and those were good but once again I was looking for more. Over it was a nice experience and it's a fun place to try different things. As I only come to Chicago  a couple of times a year I would seek out my other favorites."
"For the adventurous eater. This had been on my list for a long time, and I attempted to go there twice before finally being able to get in on my third try with an old coworker who was in town for the week. People LOVE this restaurant, so we were very excited to check it out. Unfortunately, we were completely underwhelmed by everything we ordered (which were the most popular items on the menu - salt-roasted beets w/whipped goat cheese; milk braised pork shoulder; and pig's ear w/crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg). Every dish we tried was ridiculously salty to the point where you couldn't taste much else. Maybe they were having an off night? Either way, very disappointing."
"I do love this place. Hidden in the back of the 500 N. Michigan building, the Purple Pig is an ideal place for a casualish (but still nice) date or after work cocktails. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, and you kind of don't want to leave once you've sat down. We sat at the bar and talked to Lucas, our adorable server. I asked for a super dry red wine, and he poured me a glass of their Campania Fidelis Aglianico del Taburno. And it was perfect. We split the roasted beet salad with goat cheese, and three different cheeses (with delicious fig spread). We pretty much devoured it. Service was excellent, and I will definitely return again."
"Just went to the Purple Pig last night for Rioja Restaurant Week.  The place was definitely a haven for foodies and ""porkavores"" alike.  The best dish by far was the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes!  The shoulder meat was tender and well-seasoned.  Coupled with creamy mashed potatoes.  It's making my mouth water again!Food (4.7/5)- Hits: Milk braised pork shoulder, Octopus with acini, Pig's Ear with Krispy Kale- Surprises (good) - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese- Misses - Roasted Bone Marrow, Mussels with TrevisoThe seating arrangement was quite interesting as there were several big tables in the middle of the restaurant that allows for different parties to sit together at the same table.  However, if you go there with 5 or more in your party, it will take a while for you to be seated.  Since I went there with one other friend only, we were able to be seated in 20 minutes despite the long wait for groups of 3 or more."
"Wow. Talk about an experience. The food is the best that I have ever had. Their drinks are great as well. I have eaten here several times, and I have never been disappointed. The broccoli dish and  pork secreto are highlights for me. But really, you cannot go wrong with anything you order. Be prepared to wait; however, sitting outside and having a cocktail is part of the experience, so enjoy it."
"Overall I give 4 star for the food, if I were a big cheese person and had I come here with a bunch of friends instead of by myself, I could have given it a 5 star. The food is good, but because the portion size is designed to share, I found myself fed up with the cheesy dishes quite quickly."
Accidentally found this wonderful gem of a restaurant. The food and wine selection was great. Would be an excellent place to sit outside and enjoy some people watching. The bar tender was wonderful and so proud of this food menu and wine. It was obvious that everyone working was proud of their jobs and the excellent quality of food.
"Well I finally made it here twice in the past few months.  And let me tell you... I am amazed.The service sucked.  And when I say ""sucked"" I mean, both times I was there and it was beyond flagging-down-my-waiter-because-I'm-tired-of-­being-ignored bad.  The second time we sat at the bar while about 6 people behind the bar refused to make eye contact while cleaning glasses.  Hello!  Can I order a drink?  I'm a big tipper.  Besides that, the food was good.  Between my two visits, I had one of the panini's and two of the smears and the mussels.  Everything was yummy.  The wine selection is very god.  I might be more excited to talk about the food and drink if I didn't have to beg to get a glass of wine."
"We stopped by the day after the 4th of July for a late ""light"" (3:00PM) lunch and put in our names on the wait list. We were seated in about 30 minutes. The location is very scenic and has a great patio view. Not being expert at wine or cheese, we went with the servers suggestions, and then ordered a few meats and some plates. I did not remember all the names, but I do remember the standouts. The Jamon Serrano was amazing as well as the Prosciutto di Parma. The dish that was standout (very rich and decadent) was the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale. This place definitely has a lot more on the menu and deserves many repeat visits to explore the menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
Never disappointed with this place. Its got a very european feel with great food.
"Oh my gosh. Excellent wine, delicious bone marrow and fun little place! Absolutely loved my experience here and will go again when I get back to Chicago! Love this windy city!"
"We had to wait 3 hours before getting a call for an available table. Ridiculous. No food is worth waiting that long. After checking in at 6:45pm on a Saturday we were given a wait time of 1 hr 45min for a table for two. We were expecting this and went to a nearby bar for a drink to wait. After that time there was nothing and we were told another 30-40 min but to check again in 20 min. After, that, another 30-40 min and we gave up. This restaurant is pretentious enough to enjoy making people wait for their average food. Their front person was rude and unforgiving. They need to start taking reservations - this is no way to ensure good customer service and I will not attempt to go there again."

"My mama used to make cheap cuts of meat for us. It was kind of an homage to her own childhood which was filled with some ""Spartan"" living. That's a nice way of putting that my grandfather really didn't see the need to provide proper food for meals more than maybe once or twice a week despite having the means and the access to decent food. He would go out and hunt squirrel and raccoon and snake and all sorts of odd stuff, bring it home, and request that the girls (his wife and four daughters) do something with it. Needless to say, when there was some part of an animal that wasn't odd to find in a normal American grocery store, my mother was quite happy. Pork necks was one of her favorite things, I guess because on the one hand it was still an incredibly cheap cut of meat and so she didn't feel guilty about having it, but at the same time it was pork and not snake or squirrel or raccoon. Fast forward a bit and my mother's love of pork necks lived strong into her adult lift and on into marriage and motherhood. To put it bluntly, pork necks became something my father loathed. He was usually not a picky eater, but this was one item he openly spoke out against, only allowing my mother to make it once in a blue moon. In his defense, the way my mother made it was a bit of an acquired taste. The only thing I could compare it to was a soup I have had at a famous Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (yelp.com/biz/lao-beijing…) with ""sour pork."" Basically she would slow cook it with a bunch of tart Bavarian-style sauerkraut and we would be left to pick the meat off of the bones and eat the whole vinegary mess with a couple pieces of white bread while we all sat around talking about how we are spoiled now days with our prepackaged chicken and our Stove Top stuffing and not having to kill our own food and so forth... I was so happy to try the special ""smear"" for the day we went to the Purple Pig.  As soon as I heard it was made of pork neck meat, I knew it would positively change my perception of just how good it could be!  It did too.  Made with a tomato-based sauce, it was slow cooked and shredded nicely, and mixed together with some riccotta.  Used to spread over some freshly buttered and toasted bread and it is such a nice way to start a meal filled with wine and other beautifully executed servings.It was so good it made me want to slap my mama!OK- not at all, because that phrase is pretty stupid.  It did however give me further appreciation to the old way of creating something good out of those ""nasty bits.""Everything else was very good, with notables being the mortadella smear, the butternut squash with sunflower seads and crisped sage, and the faro and riccotta was a great alternative to rice pudding (and the size and texture of the faro I now prefer).Impressive selection of wine, including quite a few by the glass, 1/4 liter, and 1/2 bottle.  Many affordable options too.I don't see too many people having a problem with the food here.  It is oddly familiar, though in my case much better than how I remember it to be."
"Cool vibe, good food, friendly service. Menu: asparagus with parmesan - refreshing. Mussels - yum and maybe a tad salty. Pork braised in milk - weird but yea totally tender and delicious. Get their bread, and dip it into the mussels' broth. Should be set, let me know what you think!"
"The place was packed.  We ended up sitting at the bar and eating dinner there as well.   The wine selection is excellent and it looked like there were no domestic (e.g. California & Oregon wines).  The bartender provided very good wine recommendations from Portugal, France, and Spain.  The food is good but I noticed they put lemon on everything."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The service, food, wine selection, amazing cheeses. Heaven, really. They have a very comprehensive and well researched wine list. I love the options glass/carafe/half bottle/bottle. We ordered many wines, mostly the little carafe size which is enough for two people to share. The allows for many tastings, and we played around with them - pairing with their fabulous cheeses and 'swine'.Our waitress was amazing and we took her advice on the cheeses, as the list was extensive. The buffalo cheese was my favorite of the evening.We tried many small plates (there were 5 of us), taking our time to savor each - I guess we were there a couple of hours. Easy to lose track of time there! The rabbit salad was just fantastic (told the kids it was chicken and they couldn't get enough),  the stuffed fried olives were tasty, eggplant was delicious, We had the 5 cheeses and the pig platter. So amazing. I can't wait to return to Chicago to visit this place again. A perfect evening!""one jillion stars"" -my 7 year old. (and he didn't even get any wine)"
"We went on a Wednesday at 6:00 pm and were surprised to be seated at the long communal table immediately.  The service was excellent, quick, and attentive without hovering.  The food was delicious, but very rich.  I would go again if I didn't have to wait long."
"Few friends of mine have already recommended this restaurant for a long time. The food here was good, but the portion was really small. Unlike other ""this style"" restaurant, they don't give you bread before the meal. So I feel the food here is little bit pricy. Also, the tables are close each other, so you can hear strangers' conversation easily and vice versa.Personally, I prefer to go to other restaurants if I have to spent this amount of money!"
"Being the biggest foodie on my business trip, I counted on Yelp to find me a new place for my coworkers and I to try. The menu consists of an assortment of dishes from all over Europe. I can't attest to their taste authenticity since I'm obviously not European, nor have I sampled all of them in Europe, but my self-proclaimed discerning taste buds liked the food!There's both outdoor and indoor seating. We sat at the bar inside because it was windy outside (go figure, it's Chicago), but there are also smaller tables in side. After trying to decipher what some of these dishes are, we looked up and saw... a glossary! We were relieved that we weren't the only uncultured patrons who don't know what Mortadella (type of salami) is. The glossary is pasted next to the menu on both sides of the light fixture right above us, how convenient.Here's what I loved: Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio Smear (right) - I'm not a fan of eggplants but I can barely taste it here. The taste combination is semi sweet, and uniquely savory.Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda Smear (left) - The lean, tender, and slightly saltiness of shredded pork neck meat, layered by pork fat topped with a smear of sweet and gooey mostarda.yelp.com/biz_photos/boE4…These were okay:Olive oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans - wish the tuna was less seared, and it was too oily for me.yelp.com/biz_photos/boE4…Prawns a la Plancha - nothing special.I'm glad I tried this place out. I've to admit, it was the unpretentious name that first captured my attention. It's just so much more memorable than, say, ""Cafe _____ insert French word""."
"Such a good lunch experience.  I was in town for the weekend and had a free lunch so I decided to pop in.  Fortunately, I got in a little before 12 and was able to easily find a spot at the bar.  I ordered the whipped feta and cucumber spread and asked the bartender for a wine recommendation.  Neither disappointed.  The bread the spreads come with is to die for by itself and the whipped feta only made it better.  Note: the spread was easily enough for 3-4 people.  For my entrée I was craving a Panini so I ordered the Slow Roasted Ham, Scamorza Cheese, Pickled Portobello & Sundried Tomato Panini.  It was all kinds of good with the sharp portabellos and sweet sundried tomatoes- it was also large.  I ended up taking half the sandwich and most of the dip with me for seconds later in the day. The bartender was very helpful and knowledgeable with the wines. I will be back at The Purple Pig the next time I'm in town!"
Great food. Affordable prices the only negative would be the portions. It's a most go if you are in Chicago.
Amazing Wine selection and outstanding food!!  A must go!
"The first two words that come to mind about Purple Pig are European and unique. You get the European feel the moment you step inside. The decor is great with a long, right angle white marble bar, wines on the rack all over the place, wooden tables with the menus hanging from the lights and chalkboard menus on the walls. Our server/bartender was European and reminded us upon handing us the wine list that they do not serve ANY American, New Zealand or ""new world"" wine. I can't recall perfectly, but they don't serve non-euro beer either. The food, rightfully so, also screamed Europe with the liberal use of olive oil. Carson and I had a great experience with good beer and some ""oh my god"" good food. We did not order a single cheese or meat sampler because we just assumed it would be good. This was our lunch so we wanted something more substantial.The menu is structured for small plates and sharing. We choose three: Olive oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans, Charred Scallions with Romesco Sauce and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. We would have ordered the Deviled eggs, but they are not served until dinner. Fortunately for us, each dish that came out was better than the last. The tuna and lima beans were good, but a very unique flavor. I probably wouldn't order them again, but the food was fresh and made well. I couldn't re-create the flavors, and I appreciate the dish as a cool, healthy way to start a meal. Next came the grilled scallions, served on a very interesting curvy red brick plate. It came with a red topping  sauce. Similar to the first dish, I would not think to make scallions a solo offering, but it turned out well. I have no idea what was in the Romesco sauce and it didn't matter, I ate all that I could. We enjoyed the scallions more than the tuna and sent back a clean plate. At this point in the meal we had one good dish, one mediocre dish (to our liking, not quality) and some tasty German pilsner beer. I was content, but couldn't quite figure out all the great buzz. That ended when our final selection arrived, the braised pork shoulder. I shouldn't be surprised that the pork dish was our favorite; The Pig, after all, is all about ""Cheese, Swine and Wine."" It only took one bite to realize this was a ""tell your mom about"" delicious. No knife needed as the meat just melted. Not shown in the picture is the mashed potatoes hiding under the meat. I know I've had mashed potatoes 100 times, but I couldn't tell you what made these taste so good. As Carson commented when we were finished, he doesn't usually scrape the bottom of the pan, but in this case we practically did the dishes from our seats. I now understood what all the fuss was about. I suspect that if I returned and tried more plates, I'd find more treasures. I'd bet the cheese and wine are second to none. The Pig will have enormous success because the concept hits on all cylinders. It's perfect for working class drinks and small bites after work. The Mag Mile location and patio space will bring in the travelers, while the late night hours cater to the nearby hotels. The hype and publicity are warranted and I love the European taste and feel. I highly suggest checking out the Purple Pig for Cheese, Wine, Swine or anything else they serve."
"As nearly all the other reviews indicate, the food is amazing. I especially enjoyed the pork shoulder, the salt roasted beets and the scallop dish. The only negative part of my experience was the service. One of the servers knocked a full glass of water in the lap of someone eating with me. It was an accident that could happen to anyone. That was not the negative part. I was shocked by our waiter's response of ""bummer"". He didn't offer to get extra napkins or help in any way. He was happy to watch us clean up.Despite the poor service, it was still a great meal. I will definitely go back when I am in Chicago."
"favorite restaurant in chicago!  Such a nice place, great service.  So good that we went twice in a week!  hard to go wrong with anything, but our favorites include:pork ears and crispy kalecauliflowerspearmint, spring peas and bacongood, but overshadowed by the abovefava beans, hardboiled eggspork shoulderoctopus"
"Okay, so before you judge me based on the 2-star rating, let me explain myself and break it down a little:Food: an enthusiastic 5/5 starsAmbiance: a solid 4/5 starsService: a miserable 0/5 stars. And miserable enough to weight this category higher than Food and Ambiance. It's pretty bad when the poor service overshadows the stellar qualities of such a fabulous restaurant, but that is exactly what happened. My love and I stopped here for lunch on the day after Thanksgiving, and after a short wait we were seated on the enclosed patio. Our server, who we'll call ""E,"" did not like the fact that we asked questions about the menu items, and seemed to be in quite a hurry to rush off and do more important things, such as stand around the busy front door with his hands behind his back. It's relevant to note that we were seated at the tail end of the lunch rush, and by the time we got our first plate the patio crowd had thinned out considerably. Busy restaurant/busy waiter is NOT the reason for the poor quality of our service. We shared a 1/2 bottle of wine, and ordered the pigs ears, marrow smear, prosciutto, and salt roasted beets. AMAZING. All of it. We pretty much devoured every last crumb. Each course, save one, arrived in perfect timing, and the runners who brought the food were pleasant and efficient. Lucky for ""E"" that we enjoyed it all, because not once did he stop to ask how everything was. ""E"" was not around enough to answer any questions about he menu.  In fact, the waitress who was serving the table right next to ours took such good care of her tables that we eavesdropped to hear her explanations and recommendations, and stopped her twice to ask questions. She even filled our water glasses one time without being asked. We filled our own water glasses one time. Our waiter filled our water glasses zero times. After our first three dishes had been long ago eaten and the plates had been cleared, we sat for a while waiting for our pigs ears, mouths watering in anticipation. As we waited and waited and waited some more, ""E"" finally wanted to know what we were still waiting for (but really, shouldn't it be HIS job to know what we were still waiting for?). He clearly forgot to put in our pig's ear order, so we had to wait another 8 minutes for it to arrive. No apology, no acknowledgement that our last dish was served 30 minutes after we finished the first dishes. As we were leaving, and standing on the opposite side of the glass of the patio/dining room door, ""E"" did not open or hold the door for us, but instead waited for us to open the door FOR HIM. Service: fail. Usually, I'm a very generous tipper. In fact, you don't have to do very much at all to get at least 18% from me. But you do have to show a baseline level of courtesy that you would even expect from someone random on the street. Despite the succulent marrow smear, roasted beets with heavenly dallops of whipped goat cheese, melt-in-your-mouth prosciutto, and crispy, salty, lip-smacking pigs ears, our experience at the Purple Pig left a bitter taste in our mouths."
"I wanted to love this place. I really did. I am all for restaurants that are able to use different parts of the animal in a creative way. I also love pig feet or ears or internal organs. Yum.However, I just could not stomach the ridiculous amount of grease that the food here contains. I do think of myself as a relatively healthy eater, but it's not like pork belly fat is foreign to me. I have eaten plates after plates of that stuff; it's just that adding more fat to the ingredients by frying them or accompanying them with other fried things or rich sauces that contain copious amounts of butter... is just a bit too much."
"Having read all of the great reviews both on-line and in the press we were excited to be in Chicago over Thanksgiving and went for lunch the Friday after. When we arrived there was an hour wait for a table so we gave our name and phone number and were told they would call us when our table was ready. An hour later, after having recieved no phone call we went back and were told that they had given away our table.....with NO phone call. No appologies, nothing. After another 15 min they grudgingly gave us a table in the far corner of the awning covered patio. With wind blowing through the corner, the temp at the table hovered near freezing. After waiting another 15 min for the waitress to appear I asked to be moved somewhere less fridgid.We were moved to a table in the middle of the Patio which was much better. A new waiter arrived, who did a great job despite being screwed over by the line and the front of the house, and took drink orders. These were handeled correctly and our lunch orders were taken. As the apps started arriving we were given both those items we ordered and a couple we didn't.....which turned out to be the first of many mistakes.These were promptly removed when finished and then began the wait for the main courses. 25 min later two of the four entees arrived. Assuming the other two would be right out, which the waiter assured us, we weren't concerned. Though it seemed odd to not bring all of the orders at once. After another 15 min of no entrees the waiter appeared, apologized and said the other two dishes would be right out. 10 min later when we still hadn't had our entrees, and the other two had finished long ago the waiter arrived with a Meatball Slider, we hadn't ordered, and told us that the Kitchen was out of what we had ordered and it would be another 20 min. That was enough.I told him we were out of time and just wanted the check. Yet another 15 min went by before the GM appeared and asked us if there had been any problems with service: really?After politely explaining how the front of the house had screwed us with the table and how his line had failed to communicate with his staff and screwed up the app order he seemed perpelexed and offered to take the two entrees we hadn't recieved off the bill. That was it. Nothing comped and really no appology. I'm 52, have eaten in hundreds of restaurants around the world and understand that service isn't always perfect. But in every other case I've been appologized to and offered at least somthing. Not here.Needless to say, turning tables was more important than dealing with the problems of the restaurant.Let me be clear, the food that did arrive was great and the waiter did a good job. Unfortunately the front end needs to hire somone over 22 who has actually run a room and the line needs to communicate. We will not be going back."
Highly recommended!! Wish i could order everything on the menu.
"This was a fun place and a place that has a good concept and executes well. Surroundings were fine and seating family style so don't go here if you're looking for an intimate tete a tete. Tapas style allows a lot of sampling and sharing. Good wine list relatively reasonable. A colleague and I went to the purple pig on the recommendation of a friend. It was busy but we were seated immediately at a high stool table for 12 with 10 other folks there already. Our newly found family to the left could care less about us. The folks to the right were voluble and friendly and made some suggestions as to our selections. They departed half way through our stay. Our first course was good but didn't exceed my expectations, a pigs feet and?? sort of fritter. I'd be more turned on to a ""huspanina""  pigs foot serving. This was followed by chorizo stuffed fried olives, good, some great rillets and marrow bones. PIG??? Who knows. When our new family to the right left a new group of locals moved in. We passed on our tribal knowledge. and they responded by sharing wine with me, thus adding to my belief that Illinois is the friendliest state of the union. I just could not picture this experience happening in NYC, which I do consider a friendly pace... This place is worth revisiting and exploring their interesting and good valued menu."
Waiter was not attentive. Food was excellent. Atmosphere was loud and friendly.
"Great food, great staff, great service. Ordered the bone marrow smear and it was delicious. I also recommend the Manila clams. The sauce is amazing.  Definitely make a reservation."
"I had read the wonderful reviews and when I realized this gem was right across the street from my hotel when I was in Chicago, I couldn't be happier! When I arrived on a Tuesday night, the place was packed but I was able to find a spot at the bar. I had the snap peas with bacon, and the braised lamb for dinner. Both were excellent, and I was tempted to order another snap pea dish as they were a little on the small side but oh so good :-) The only down side to my experience was the overpriced wine that I ordered. I guess it was my fault as I did not ask the price, but $32 for two glasses seemed extremely steep for a pinot noir. Besides the surprisingly high bill, my overall experience was very good. I will definitely return when I'm in Chicago again."
"a LAist and NYer visiting home to chicago at the same time; I texted A that i was ""cracking (damn autocorrect) bone marrow"" In search for the best that Chicago had to offer, we came across the purple pig. We did find bone marrow and plenty of other dishes, but was barely impressed. Every dish had the same flavor: salty. though no regrets trying the purple pig for the company was excellentbe sure to read anna k's review for it's thoroughly more intriguing than mine."
"The food is amazing. I can't add more to other reviews other than a quick tip. If this place is slammed, go to the bar and you can usually get a seat in 10 to 20 minutes."
"This place rules.  Really.  I mean, it dominates and probably one of my best dining experiences I have had in a while.I came here with a group of family and friends, 6 total, Sunday night around 8:30.  This place was hopping!  We had to wait for a table but who cares when you can order a nice bottle of red and enjoy it, all while in a great conversation?  We got a table by the window (and warm!) and started perusing the menu.Now this is the dilema.  How does one decide what to order?!  Everything looked fantastic and we had questions.  Our server, and I am sorry that I didn't catch her name because she was awesome, was only happy to answer about the cheeses, meats, and whatever else.  The hubs and I ordered the Purple Pig Platter (all the charcuterie), three cheeses, the rillette and bone marrow.  All were to die for!  The charcuterie was presented on a wooden pig!  It was so long that we were embarassed for taking up one table! The toasted bread was perfect.  The cheese.  That damn fromage.  How I love thee!  I could have eaten all of them alone but had to share.  We got a cheddar, a blu, and one soaked in bourbon.  Enough said.The rillette was the one thing I didn't try but the hubs was all over it!  I, on the other hand, was dying for the bone marrow.  Scoop, place on bread, a pinch of salt and bite.  I was on cloud 9.  Seriously, does it get any better than this?  I stuffed myself on the charcuterie, bread and cheese that I couldn't finish all the marrow.  What a waste.This is a great place.  The ambiance, the music, the service and the food and drink.  From beginning to end, it was exceptional.  Listen, if you want all of the above, come here.  Fast!"
"They have a very wide selection of wine if you're into that. The food menu has a lot of interesting dishes. We ordered the roasted bone marrow, razor clam, pig ears, and a cheese platter to go with our wine. These items sounds like something that came out of  a fear factor show...lol...BUT they were good! My favorite was the roasted bone marrow. That's a must try."
"If you like over-salted food, then this place is perfect for you!The menu reads nicely but the food doesn't match up to its descriptions. All the flavors are there, but if they'd pull back on the salt it would be so much nicer. Overall, I was disappointed.On the positive side, there are many small dish options which makes it easy to find something for everyone in a large group. But only if everyone in the large group is really into salt."
"Friendly and knowledgable staff...broad array of menu items...quality ingredients served quick and fresh...but I don't just get the all the Woohoos.  Shaved brussel sprouts were tasty but an *extremely* small portion for the value.  Sardines didn't order them but they were ordered on either side of us due to the communial seating...one order looked good the other one smelled *very* fishy.  Also, by mistake they delivered fried brussel sprouts to our table and they smelled terrible too. Tried the bone marrow and all it tasted like was the soft and fatty part of a steak.  Also, the marrow came with toasted bread that was *drowned* in butter and oil...total turnoff and keep in mind fatty food is one of my basic food groups!  Razor clams...smaller ones were rubbery/chewy and the larger ones were nice, but, they too were *drowned* in oil WTFish?!?!  Grilled scallops were cooked *perfectly* but three scallops for $15 is not a good value no matter were you are eating.  Blood sausage with apples was the best dish we had and the pork chop special (which we didn't order, but, was recommended by our server) was huge and looked filling.  Also, the furniture was very uncomfortable and the quarters extremely tight.  To top it off they were out of their signature fried dough for dessert but was told if we wanted to come back in a couple hours they should be ready.  Really?!?!?!?"
"So what happens when you give a pig too much wine? Why he turns purple, of course. And so goes the joke about the name of this new Mag Mile hot spot , The Purple Pig. In all seriousness, in talking to Jimmy, the owner, the name reflects the vast wine selection they have (purple) with the high incidence of pork (pig) on the menu. I don't care what they call it- this place was amazing! Open for only two weeks- the Purple Pig didn't seem to have any of those ""new restaurant"" blues that many of them suffer. Service was spot on and the food? Well, the food was the star. Communal seating is the norm here with the exception of about 16 seats along the wall. And in the Spring there will be another 40 more seats out on the patio. The wait on this Friday night was an hour (they don't take reservations) but if you ask- they will serve you a glass of one of their wines off of their extensive list as you wait by the door or down the hall. We were seated at the bar (seriously the best place to sit if you can get one of the seats) as you get the benefit of impeccable service (thanks Yvonne) and we got to meet Jimmy, Jr. (the executive chef). Mossimo (the pastry chef) and Jimmy Sr (the owner). The menu is a series of sharable plates. From charcuterie and interesting cheeses, to salads, to ""smears"" to entrees. As is my norm with any new place-we wanted to taste a little of everything. We had a wide range of foods to start. Cheeses and meats with toast were tasty. We had clams with rosamarina which was a cold rice dish, as well as shaved brussel sprouts with Parmesan cheese. I never knew brussel sprouts could taste like this! On to the entrees- we split the cuttlefish with toasted almonds and rosemary (amazing),  prawns, and the wagyu beef (so tender you could cut it with a fork). And if that wasn't enough- Mossimo came over and lured us into dessert. We ordered his reccos which were the Iris (almost like a donut stuffed with ricotta cheese and chocolate, and the gelato with olive oil and a pinch of salt. Obviously we were not eating the Iris right as Mossimo came over and cut it up for us mixing the flavors. And the final calorie crusher- we had a brioche that was split and filled with chocolate ice cream. Be still my scale! The biggest issue with The Purple Pig may be in just finding the place. Located in the 500 N. Michigan Ave office building- proceed past the security guards (I think they like all the activity as they are very nice) and head to the left of the desk down the hallway. I just followed the noise as the sound of people having a good time reached the front door.Service was spot on and it was great to meet the owner and staff and hear the pride that they have in their new venture. Jimmy Sr. also owns Heaven on Seven and T-Bones out in St. Charles. Dinner with a bottle of wine, and all that food (plenty for three) ran about $170 which was reasonable given the quantity and quality of food.   And within a few weeks they will also be serving lunch and they currently serve food until 1am on the weekends.Check out The Purple Pig. And soon you'll be asking, ""You know what happens when you give a pig too much wine?"" . . . . . . . . ."
"Was in Chicago for 2days and went here twice. First tried the bone marrow. As another reviewer said, don't think. Just do it. Like butter. Herb salad cuts the richness. Place was a buzz on a Sunday night. I sat at bar and watched chefs. So fun went back on Tuesday and tried the castelfranco salad and liver pate. Both delightful. I could feel my cholesterol rising but it was worth it. Don't miss this. Something for everyone if you don't dig swine like I do."
"purple pig ... hmm. well, i went there with my boyfriend to have dinner because we heard its really good here. we got there but the wait was 1 hr so we waited. Anyways when we got there the place was packed in and outside the patio. We got the patio sitting because it was too pack inside and it was raining a lot too. We got wet from the rain pouring down on us. But anywho, when we got there we order the bone narrow it was so greasy and salty. And there was barely anything in there for $18 ! It's like sipping on oil. I also ordered the turkey leg, deviled eggs and another appetizer but none of the dishes were edible to us because it's either super salty or oily. It was a failed experience. Never again !!!! Ugh. We barely ate our food but none of the waiters/waitress ask how was the food even when it's like full plate wasted. Was so disappointed. We spent $120 for 2 entree and 3 appetizers."
"We have returned to the Purple Pig about three more times and each subsequent visit was worse than the last. One time we had a 3 hour wait, no exaggeration. We were crammed at the corner of a table and bumped elbows with diners next to us. The smaller plates and the smears are consistently good but the entrees are just not that great. We have come to the conclusion that this place is not worth the hype or the wait and have not returned since 2012."
"*Could easily get 5 if I go more than onceWent here for an anniversary dinner and left without paying anniversary prices. Sat outside and yes, it's crowded and busy but I honestly thought it fit the whole atmosphere. Who wants to eat in a stuffy quiet place anyhow? I can't remember all we got, but it was a variety that was all wonderfully tasty and the things we didn't order sounded just as scrumptious. The dessert, however, I do remember. It was a neutella and banana panini dusted with powdered sugar and I was happy the BF was too full to eat his share.Also, I am not the most graceful of creatures and knocked my wine glass over, thus cutting my finger and literally bleeding all over the table. Our waiter (oh yes, I bled on him too) was super nice, got me a towel and variety of band-aides and when I got back had brought me another glass of wine. Risky, but a good move."
"Absolutely fantastic!!! Everything our server recommended was perfect-the fried manchego, braised pork shoulder,roasted corn and the meatball slider were all delicious.  The corn was by far the best I highly recommend this place!"
"Yum. Seriously, Yum. The food and servers at the Purple Pig get 5 stars, at least. I love the variety of food on the menu. At first the menu looks like it's not that big, but as you take a closer look there's a wide range of choices on the menu. My friend and I ordered a bunch of small plates, they were all delicious, but my favorites were the bone marrow, beets with whipped goat cheese, pigs ear with crispy kale, and the skate wing. I get the feeling everything on the menu is good. I look forward to a few more visits so I can find out, and I will report back! I'd give the 5th star except the hostesses didn't really seem to have it all together. We arrived at 7 and anticipated a wait, there isn't really anywhere to wait comfortably if the bar is full. They said 45 minutes, no problem. An hour later we asked about our table, we were told we'd be seated in 10 minutes. Another 30 minutes later we were finally seated. At least 2 parties of 2 (which we were) arrived after us and were seated before us. When we were finally seated our table was next to the restrooms and waitstaff station. Not ideal. Considering the look on their faces when they saw our name on the previous page of names I think they just missed us on the list. I'd be more than willing to give 5 stars if the seating situation is better next time around."
The Purple Pig has been another place on our long list of places to visit. It was a really cold night that my husband and I decided to have a date night. We never did make it to the movies since we ended up in a food coma! lol We had ordered several dishes Fried deviled egg was one of the firsts. We ordered one egg to share but after tasting it I knew I needed one of my own! So I ordered another for myself. Bone marrow smear.- This was something I had never had before and OMG boy have I been missing out. It was delicious. When the Marrow hit the bread it melted like butter. Neck gravy with ricotta smear- So typically I am not a fan of Ricotta but this was unlike any ricotta I ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Thanks to the Hungry Hound for this recommendation. Milk braised pork shoulder- This was so tender they served it with a spoon. So you think spoon and pork no way. Umm Yes Way! The spoon was able to get through the pork shoulder and then was so soft and tasty in your mouth. Dessert panini- Now this was ordered just because! We were already full but I just can not leave without dessert. I took one bite then saved the rest for later. It was so good I kept opening the bag all the way home. We did have some wine and beer which was really good. My first wine selection I did not care for but the second recommendation was right on target.
"I thought the style of the food servings are like tapas. Pricier than tapas tho, but very delicious. I had the pan fried chicken thighs with tzakiki sauce, roasted bone marrow, grilled wild tuna, and my favorite, Caesar salad with a whole anchovy.  Everything was tasty!Not a place for the ""non-adventurous""."
"The ambiance here is quite chic - you just feel cooler being around here.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and the service was gauche, albeit not in a bad way.  The food ordered isn't particularly plentiful, so don't come here if you're starving and don't want to order multiple dishes.  I got the Porchetta with Salsa Verde, which was tasty, and luckily I wasn't that hungry as it came with only 2 little slider like sandwiches.  No garnishing, so I'm not sure what I was really paying for (besides the location and the cool factor)."
"I went to this highly anticipated restaurant the other week. I really admire what they are trying to do but some of the execution just didn't make it. I'm not saying I'm cheap but when I pay $7 for lardon, it do expect to see something besides 4 razor thin strips of fat on toast.  Is it just me?  Also the sausages I had were so small, thin and lonely.  I loved the bone marrow and the blood sausages.  I could have passed on the chicken thighs as it lacked flavor and the steak was ok but once again, I felt i could have gotten a strip steak for the same price.The wines are great and I do like the fact they have the different prices and sizes, glass, 1/2 bottle, etc. My French friend looked at the prices and was amazed.  Too expensive for what you can get in Europe, but I say, this is Chicago. We had the wedding cakes for dessert and it was very good. Do not get me wrong, i don't want take away plates but I felt the portions were a bit too small.  It's definitely a crowd to see and be seen, but if you want some food that will make you come back for more, i think you need to look elsewhere. Once the novelty wears off, what is there?"
"The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they don't take reservations and they wait is crazy long so go early and just walk around while you wait. The turkey leg, and chicken kebobs are amazing. Leave room for dessert the panino con Nutella and Sicilian iris are to die for."
"pinot grigio and delicious tapas in the afternoon? can't get any better!the wait will be long. what do you expect from such a fantastic place? we put our names on the list and the host was kind enough to jot our number down and gave us a call when we were up (we ended up going to the turkish fest across the street)menu can be overwhelming because you don't know what to quite order. so we asked the waiter and went with his suggestion. overall, great laughs and memories and food was delish! will come back when the opportunity presents itself."
"Hmmm...I really wanted to be in love with this place.  After all, my biggest fear in life is that I will become lactose intolerant and no longer be able to enjoy delicious cheese.  No lie.Don't get me wrong, their heart is in the right place.  I love the fact that they make some of the cured meats in house and that they offer some unusual items, but unfortunately they just didn't deliver for me.Our server was extremely helpful and patient with us as we just couldn't decide what to get.  He matched us with a good white and red according to our tastes.  We asked him for his recommendations on food as well.  He recommended the Lingua Agrodolce, Pork Neck Rilette smear and the Podda, Bucheron and Delice cheeses.  We also decided to go with the Salt Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese.  The Lingua tasted a lot like my mom's favorite...braunschweiger.  I'm not a tongue connoisseur, though, so I'm really not familiar with the taste.  I felt like the cheeses and the smear with both ok.  But I do have to say the the Delice cheese and the beets were amazing.  I could have eaten those all day.It is entirely possible that we just ordered wrong and I still want to like this place.  I'll be back to give it another shot...and try those fried deviled eggs.  But for right now, it's just OK for me."
"Still a fabulous, unique place to meet on a Friday evening.  But... I loved being able to go through three different Greek white wines, 1/3 bottle and 1/2 bottle servings, to taste them one after the other.  My favorite was the Skouras Moscofilero.  We had the squash again, still fabulous.  The roasted bone marrow was a skimpy portion but tasty.  A small dish of olives were soaked in a great brine.  And the gabagool/coppa meat was excellent.Once again, a delightful exploration of food and wine.  I'd love to make it a regular meeting place BUT... it won't happen.  Not the way they're doing things now.  I arrived, meeting my wife on her way home from work, to be told ""Sorry, we don't seat anyone until the whole party is here.""  This meant standing around waiting 15 minutes for my wife to arrive, in a space with no waiting area, dodging groups coming in the door, moving for waitstaff and busboys.  I understand waiting in the bar before being seating in a top restaurant.  But not in a packed ""cheese, wine, and swine"" bar.  It's a bad system if you want to meet people there after work, which is what many people will want to do here.  So as much as I like the place, it'll get limited usage from me."
Food was good. The waiter recommended we share so we did. It's a good thing we weren't starving because one small plate at a time ( we ordered them all together) was painstaking
"This restaurant was so popular that we must wait for 15 minutes outside on Easter Day before its opening. It has very good location on Michigan Ave. They cooked a lot of special food based on unusual part of pig, like pig's ears and foot. Maybe it was very novel thing for Americans, but it was very common in China. Some dishes here were very salted, but most of them were delicious."
"Heard it from my friends. Finally gave it a try. Love the pork shoulder with mashed potato, awesome. We tried the famous bone marrow as well. A little greasy for me, but my guy friend  liked it. Worth a try!! Definitely will go again."
"Although the place was very crowded, we actually got seated within about 15 minutes (despite the cited 45 minute wait time) because everyone on the list before us wasn't there.  Lively, boisterous, with communal seating as well as some smaller tables, the atmosphere is definitely very upbeat.The wine list is extensive, and there are several options from all parts of the list where you can choose to order by the glass, quartino, half bottle, or full bottle.  Wine options are available from around the world, including many bottles from Greece and Portugal, which are not typically available in other restaurants.The food is meant to be shared, which I love, and they usuallly recommend ordering 2 dishes per person, which I agree was the right amount.  My friend and I were full by the end, but not stuffed, and even had room to share a dessert.We had:- Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette:  Great balance of sweet, salty and tart, with a nice combination of fluffy, soft, and crunchy textures.  Very good, but I wouldn't say it was as amazing as other reviewers have rated it.- Prosciutto ""smear"" with basil and grilled figs on toast:  Also had a good balance of flavors and textures, with sweet plump figs against the salty prosciutto on crunchy toasted bread - an overall good combination, if not a particularly new and inspired one.- Pork blade steak with 'Nduja and fresh greens:  My favorite of the night perfectly tender, juicy pork with some sweetness from honey, and the delicious smokey-salty-porky-fatty 'nduja, one of my new favorite discoveries from a few months ago in London's Borough Market that I've been obssessed with finding.- Homemade greek sausage with rapini and grapes:  The sausage itself wasn't bad, but it was the bitterness of the vegetables and sweet juiciness of the grapes that brought out the balance of contrasting flavors.  - Sicilian Iris dessert:  Fried dough stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips.  Our waitress highly recommended it, citing how it amazing it was and how it was by far the best dessert on the menu.  Overall, though, I wasn't particularly impressed with this dessert.  But as a caveat, I have found few desserts that really get me hooked (the torija at Degustation and chocolate-peanut butter semifreddo at Gramercy Tavern, both in NYC, being two of the notable ones)Overall I really enjoyed the entire experience, and will definitely be back to try more plates, and definitely more wine.  I'll just be sure not to drive next time so I don't have to worry about how much I drink!"
I loved everything I tried here. The food's for sharing... order as a group instead of an individual.
"The Purple Pig was soooooo good!!  We loved it here!  They had an awesome Muscato Wine that I was very happy with and lovely food options!!  The cheese selection was fabulous and I really enjoyed their pate as well.  I am not sure what made their bread amazing, but it was so tasty and went well with everything!I have to say that I fell in love with their American Waygu!  Simply amazing!  It was so delicious and melt-in-your-mouth amazingness! Thumbs up!  Five stars simply to their yummy steak!  Whether you are here for a night out, dinner, first date, dessert and drinks - The Purple Pig will satisfy everyone!!"
"Finally made it to The Purple Pig last night and I definitely enjoyed myself.  Firstly, I was happy to discover that although this place is downtown and has delicious food it is not hoity toity which I appreciate!  It had a bustling but down to earth vibe.  Secondly, we went on a Monday night and had to wait about 45 minutes.  I cannot image what a wait would look like on Friday or Saturday.  They do serve drinks to people while they are waiting which is nice.  Finally, the food, was good, better than good.  Especially the jowl.  Oh man!  it was gooooood.  The cheese was delicious.  The pork gravy was okay - nothing I haven't had something similar to other places.  The pate was different and good.  The dessert (we had the chocolate lemon thing) was fine but nothing I would need to have again.  Overall, I would say go here prepared to wait, drink and then eat some goodness (in that order).  Side note:  This is definitely more in the $50/person (especially with drinks) price range rather than $20."
Pork trip was Too salty. Not worth the hype. Octopus was uncooked
"Been here once and hesitant to go back.  The food was decent enough, but I had some sort of allergic reaction that - get this - turned me purple.  Maybe it was too much cured meat for me to handle."
"""Live deep and suck the marrow of life"" -ThoreauFantastic waitress recommended marvelous plates. Fun to sit at a table with new-friend strangers and enjoy everyone's dishes!"
"Either you show up right at 11:30 or prepare to wait upwards of an hour and a half. Located in a pretty tourist-y part of town they literally have throngs of people trying to grab one of the few spots for a bite.We tried a couple of times to stop by during our weekend but the two hour wait made it tough to swing.  We finally got our chance on a Monday (holiday) morning.  The restaurant itself is small and cozy with cute two tops along the wall.  I don't really enjoy that whole communal eating style so if you come with 3-4 people I think you might have a different experience since they seemed to sit those groups at one very long table.The food was excellent. Sepia, roasted bone marrow and a great selection of cheeses.  We didn't drink since it was still a bit early but they had a nice wine list.Great music playing in the background rounded out the cool vibe.I would give it five stars if the wait wasn't so ridiculously long!"
"The Purple Pig is a great find, still relatively unknown to the many tourists that crawl Michigan Avenue. The appetizers are wonderful - on two occasions, I went with the shaved asparagus and was not disappointed! They put together fantastic cheese plates and are more than happy to make recommendations for ideal pairings. I also recommend the deviled egg and chicken thigh kebabs.It can be quite crowded at The Purple Pig, but I've gone several times without a reservation and haven't had any issue finding seats at the bar. My recommendation is to order several plates and split them amongst the group.Overall, I happily return to The Purple Pig time and time again - the waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable, their food and wine selection is fantastic, and their prices are reasonable."
"I came here with my girlfriend based on yelp reviews as soon as we arrived in Chicago for a wedding weekend. Fortunately, we arrived at 5 PM and were able to get a table right away. It's best if you can arrive early! When we left a couple of hours later there were tons of people standing waiting for tables, and even more on the walkway all the way out to Michigan Ave. At least they let you take a glass of wine out there while you wait!The wine and food were great! We had a bottle of a Bordeaux blend from 2007 which was $45. At first it was a little bland, but it really opened up after breathing a while and ended up being a great pairing with everything! To start we had a soft cheese as well as their house-made Coppa, both of which were very good. We had 2 more small plates after, the pork secreto and fish wrapped in proscuitto. I loved the pork and girlfriend really liked the fish. Finally, we finished with their iris desert (can't remember exactly what it's called) -- it was incredible and definitely a great way to end our first meal in Chicago!"
"What animal is my favorite? Well, after going to this place - its definitely the Pig! All things porcine and delicious, starting from the crispy Pig's ear to pig spleen (sweetbreads if you want it to sound more palatable). But I kid you not, spleen or shoulder, ear or tail or whatever other part of the pig we had was divine. And its not just about heart-stopping (literally) piggy goodness, their seafood is fabulous too. We had the razor clams, which lightly infused with lemon and herbs, were fantastic. The prices for the small plates ranged from $5 - $18. So quite a range of sizes and tastes. Also their wine collection is superb - having 100s of different varieties available. A word of caution for Salt Shunning Nazis out there - the overall taste of the dishes were leaning towards the salty side so beware! But why would one care...I would rather poke a hole in my artery an relieve some blood pressure, than forgo this meal. Heck, countries have fought wars over salt...it is the epicenter of taste! Anyways on weekends be prepared to wait long, REALLY LONG for a seat- for they don't take reservations. Our wait was 2 hrs or so! But not to worry, after all its Michigan Avenue - the Magnificent Mile...so loads of things to do around here...we went down the stairs a block away to the Billy Goat Tavern and hung out there for a while. But I must tell you the Purple Pig was worth the wait and worth every grain of salt!"
"Hands down our favorite place of our entire week-long visit from San Francisco.  So good we went back again later in the week! (it helped that it was only three blocks from our hotel.) Both times the food was near perfect, all the way through. We took some good advice and arrived at 4:00 p.m., got seated outside right away, avoiding the interior which plays music a bit too loud for us for a meal (fine in a bar, but not during dinner). The patio was great. We had (first trip): Burrata Pugliese, Grilled Kohlrabi, Apples, Mustard Greens, Crispy Speck & Beer Agrodolce; Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers; Fried Manchego with Membrillo Sauce; Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta and toasted bread; and the Pork Secreto with Roasted Red Pepper, Leeks & Pickled Watermelon Rind. and (second trip): the asparagus, with Arugula, Treviso & Hazelnuts, fried Chorizo Stuffed Olives with a yogurt roasted garlic cream; fried pigs' ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and a sunny-side fried egg; and Pork Osso Bucco with soft Polenta and Gremolata. Suffice to say that everything was excellent-to-perfect - except maybe two items, which were simply good, not great: the fried deviled egg (breading and frying masked the point of a deviled egg - it didn't taste like much, but it had a nice fried/creamy texture contrast; and the fried Manchego - this tasted more like any fried mozzarella stick appetizer - again, the breading muted the flavor of the manchego. Other than those two, everything was outstanding - great depth of flavors, wonderful contrasts, good balance between richness and tart... I couldn't even pick a favorite. The secreto was amazing, especially as a cut I'd never had. The pork neck sugo had the deepest, richest flavor - and was probably something I wouldn't have ordered, but our waiter recommended it. the pig's ear! wow - like the nicest, crispiest chicharron, perfect with the tartness of the pickled cherry pepper and the bitter kale - rich and tangy all at the same time. The osso bucco was to die for, ordered extra bread to scrape every bit off the plate. We finished off with a dense and deep dark chocolate almond cake with an orange marmalade and almond brittle. Honestly, we are very jealous this place isn't in San Francisco. Quality food, fresh ingredients, great preparations, friendly, warm and expert service, in a casual yet special setting, and a fantastic bargain. Ridiculous, to go to the same restaurant more than once in a city full of great restaurants? We're only sad we didn't go again."
"WOW! And that's for the food, the wine and service! My daughter-in-law suggested this place and the reviews here confirmed we should give it a try. Never have so many been so right!We were told it would be 30-45 minutes for a table and that we could wait on the terrace where drink service is offered and handed a drink menu. With the help of the server we chose a glass of wine and settled in. After a few sips of wine and taking a few selfies  about 20 minutes after putting our name in, we are told an outdoor table is available and we snatched it right up.  Our server arrived at our table within seconds of us being seated and asked if we had been here before. She let us know they serve small sharing plates and said she would give us few minutes with the menu.  Those ""few"" minutes were one of two factors  of  this experience that kept me from clicking on that 5th star. The few became several and moved into the where the heck is she territory. About that time she breezed by and said I'll be with you in a ""few"" minutes. ""Several"" minutes later and we're still waiting. When she finally stops by we ask a few questions about the menu items and she gave us her complete and full attention. Between her suggestions and our curiosity we make our choices. We started with something from the Fried side of the menu. A Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers. (Am I the last person to know of this dish? I came home and GOOGLed it and found recipes all over the place!) The Pig's version is a whole egg with yolk mixed with a bechamel sauce, lightly breaded and deep fried. It was awesome!!! The filling reminded me of the white gravy I ate tons of when I lived small town Iowa. You gotta try it!Next up the Iceburg Wedge with huge chunks of blue cheese, heirloom tomatoes and blue cheese dressing. I LOVE this simple little salad....at most places. Here not at all! (and the 2nd factor a 5 star rating was not given) The blue cheese was way to salty and I'm a big fan of salt.   Pass on it. Next up the Chicken Thigh Kebabs, fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki. Excellent choice! The chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection, the fried smashed potatoes were more like chips hidden here and there (not the huge pancake things we expected) and the tzatziki was tasty.  By the time our next dish arrived I was getting full and wanted to save room for dessert. But I did taste the Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. And who knew...I like Octopus! The remainder of this dish is sitting in my fridge and will become my lunch today. Hubby loved it. Speaking of Hubby, he's not a dessert man. Usually he takes a bite of what I order and is satisfied. But once again curiosity came into play. We ordered Bread Pudding and Sicilan Iris. OMG...both were exceptional! And Hubby, well he ate his half of both!! I've NEVER seen that happen in 18 years!  My latte and his coffee were both very good, but gone by the time the desserts arrived. The Iris takes longer than the other desserts. I was a bit leery about coming here, having checked out the menu online. I saw everything from pigs ears to pigs tail and everything in between. We played it pretty safe in our selections this visit. We will go back and be more adventurous.  The online menu is not up to date. For instance the Iceburg Wedge isn't on it, and the Pork Osso Bucco that is, isn't available. Both seasonal items so may be an website update is in order. The food was wonderful, great drink selections and our server had a great personality.  We will go back, we will recommend it to friend and we will be talking about this dinner for along time!"
"Crowded, small, hard to find.   Otherwise super awesome place to dine!!!!!    Best kale dish ever.  Pork belly was also a 5 star!!"
Amazing! I was visiting for a work trip and this place was close so we thought we would give it a shot.  Well the first night was over a 2 hour wait at 7:30 so we decided to skip it and try another night.  The next night we waited an hour but it was so worth it! Pigs ears were great and so were the fried olives!
"Very unique menu with a truly great, educated wait staff.  A bit of a tourist trap, but the food is hard to beat."
A party of four attended this place for the first time in December while visiting the downtown area for the weekend. We were seated at a high top table with six others. Extremely loud environment. We were instructed to order many dishes due to the idea of sharing each one but only later we found the dish sizes to be small even for one person. So it proved to be an adjustment. It's not a place to have a relaxing dinner experience. The hustle and bustle of the wait staff and customers bumping into you left it as an unpleasant experience.
"Very unique food,  very good flavors, and not too expensive :) We ordered the bone marrow, Wagyu, Pork platter (Sampler), and these thin clam things that were REALLY good. Seat is communal, which is fine because everybody in Chicago seems so friendly!"
"I took a visitor here with me for dinner on a Saturday night.  We waited for a table for about twenty minutes before being seated in the tent-thing outside the front of the restaurant.  Surprisingly, given the cold weather, the space heaters in there kept us nice and warm.Vegetarian dishes are a bit sparse on the menu, but I was able to make do.  The creamed feta and cucumber smear was amazing!  The feta itself was deliciously unhealthy, and the toast that came with it was lightly oiled.  That course alone made the trip here worthwhile.The restaurant itself is very loud, other customers were sat very close to us and sometimes their shouted conversations in the small space were off-puttingly loud.  Still, that's not really such a bad thing, it just goes to show how popular this place is."
"I would give this place 10 stars if possible. I am impressed...My friend's husband recommended we eat here and I must say, the menu is unusual and I was not planning on taking his advice. I am so glad we did take his advice--it is unusual in a good way.  We ordered a bunch of food and shared and frankly, that's my favorite way to eat:Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios--Out of this world! the pistachios really make this dish unique. I highly recommend trying this dish.Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana--Again, out of this world! The asiago and salami put this dish right over the top. They turn what would have been marinated artichokes and potatoes to something worthy of being on the menu at the Purple Pig. Highly recommend trying this dish.Eggplant Parmesan Balls--very good! I eat eggplant at every opportunity. This was good but not like the rest of the items which I rated as out of this world and highly recommend. These balls were very good but the other items were better....Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes--sounds basic doesnt it? This was out of this world! I don't know what they do to make this pork melt in your mouth good but god! they did something. HIGHLY recommend trying this dish.Decor--very cool and hip, service--very good, helpful and friendly. The only complaint I would have is this place is rather LOUD. the music they played was great--old classics like Van Morrison etc. If you are looking for a romantic dinner, this is not the place unless romantic for you means lots of other people talking really loud.I HIGHLY recommend this place! Try it, you'll like it"
"Purple Pig is an over-rated tapas joint, with communal seating that reminded me of an elementary school cafeteria.The good: The JLT (Jowl Lettuce Tomato) comes with a fried egg on top and is tasty. The mussels were fresh and served in a tasty broth. The chicken thigh kebabs bordered on dry but thanks to the delicious tzatziki sauce ended up being one of the meal's highlights. The Wagyu sirloin tip was pretty tasty, but the potatoes with olive and bone marrow vinaigrette really left the dish on a positive note.The meh:  The charred cauliflower was a salty mess.  The fried Brussels sprouts, while not as disgusting as regular Brussels sprouts were still not something I'd want to eat more than a forkful of. The bone marrow is average at best, and probably only raved about on this site about because it's now hip for yuppies to eat the food their grandparents escaped Europe to avoid. The calamari (or possibly octopus) came grilled and served in a bowl full of some sort of beans, but if there were more than 6 pieces of calamari (or possibly octopus) in that dish I'd be shocked.All in all I'd say this place is in the 2  1/2-3 star range, and I'm rounding up because the service was good.  I wouldn't say to avoid the Purple Pig but I definitely can't understand why people are waiting for over an hour to eat average tapas while crammed next to strangers. I'm glad I had the chance to see what all the hype is about, but I don't see myself going back to Purple Pig unless you're paying."
"A wonderful reason to go to Chicago -  Wine, swine and cheese at the Purple Pig.  I LOVE good, amazing, fresh, unforgettable food.   I would expect to find this in a hole in the wall family owned place in Southern Italy, not on the Magnificent Mile.  i was in town for a conference and yelped/googled possible restaurants for a small dinner with co-workers.  This place lives up to the hype.  8 of us went for  a long lunch.  I was worried about waiting in line, since they do not take reservations, but we walked right in.  We put ourselves in the hands of an amazing wait staff and enjoyed the best meal.  The atmosphere is inviting and open, each small plate (we had 12 of them) was more delicious that the next.  We ordered two of the fried deviled eggs (yes, that's what I said), and the pork neck with ricotta, which is the cook's family recipe.  We are an eclectic bunch of 8 and every palate was delighted.  Oh and don't forget to try an interesting wine.  I had a Spanish red recommended by the wait staff.  I can't wait to come back."
"I have been here a couple times now and have to say I am torn between whether Purple Pig is just ok or whether I like it.   I am going to say I like it because some dishes I had were stellar.   Some dishes were just so-so in my opinion, but now that I know what to order, I am a fan of Purple Pig.It was packed when I came for a weekday dinner.  Good thing I had a reservation.  Not sure if a table would have been possible without a reservation.   It was pretty empty when I came in for a Sunday lunch at noon.I have had a lot of dishes here, but will just group the more memorable ones.Dishes I really liked:-Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - may sound boring, but this pork steak was one of the juiciest steaks of any kind I have eaten!-Purple Pig Platter-Sicilian IrisDishes I thought were good:-Grilled cheese-Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate-Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio VinaigretteDishes that were disappointing:-Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Too bland for my liking.  I have had stellar versions before."
"Personally, I think this place doesn't worth even a star. Came here after reading hundreds of positive reviews from Yelp, but turned out to be so disappointed with every single dish we ordered. Pork shoulders are too salty. Pig ear - salty, just tastes like McDonald's French fries. And the beets - yuck."
"Tried the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs and felt they were way too saulty, greasy and super unhealthy...the menu selections were interesting so i still would recommend 1st timer to give this restaurant a try."
"I have never been in a restaurant this loud.  It was pretty cool.  This is considered one of the top restaurants in the country, so I might have been a little outclassed.The alcohol was expensive but good.I showed up with my gf, and I was seated at the bar immediately.All of the food that we ordered was interesting and tasty.  It was a place that I was happy to go to, but I doubt that I would return on my next trip to Chicago.  We had:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - my favorite.  It was about a one cup container.Chorizo Stuffed Olives - Again, this was a very flavorful dish, one I would have never considered. 6 olives.Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - This was tasty, but honestly I could have made this.  It was a big pork steak well-cooked.Manila Clams, House Made Merguez Sausage,Manzanilla Sherry & Tomato - Again, it was good, but the portion was small.  IWe actually left the restaurant still able to eat more.  The food was good, but the portions were small."
FUN FUN LOVE IT LOVE IT----Its a no brainer... just try everything the server recommends----the pork shoulder---pig ears---marrow----the turkey leg------and the Panino......... my mouth waters every time I think of this lovely lovely place :)OMG don't ever miss it when ur in Chicago.
"The Purple Pig did indeed live up to the hype.  I was with one other person and the wait was literally until they closed so the only way we could get a seat was if we found one at the bar, which luckily we found one quite fast.  We received full service while sitting at the bar and even got to sit right in front of the cooks and watch them make everything.  Turned out to be the perfect spot!  The food was amazing and the drinks were insanely strong.  The place was packed and if you want an actual table, you will be waiting hours but it is worth the wait.  I actually suggest going with a group so you can order a bunch of different things on the menu to share.  There were so many items I wanted to try and plan to when I go back."
"I must say, my friend and I expected to be turned away or at least told to wait for 30 min to an hour, but miraculously we were shown to a table immediately (on a Friday night!). The waitress was bubbly and happy and tattooed - a rare combo, plus very knowledgable about wine. She suggested a nice red for under $40 and we enjoyed her choice tremendously. We also got the Charcuterie plate, mussels, olives, and the skate. All were amazing, except the skate, which tasted like a cheap fried fish. Overall, I loved the place, even though it was loud and packed (My and my neighbor's elbows were almost touching). I'll definitely be back!"
"Located right on Michigan Avenue, this restaurant is definitely worth the stop! Usually there is quite a long wait to get a table, but it is worth it. A very unique place to eat at in Chicago. In addition to its unique dishes, the wine menu is great. The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Pig's Ear are my favorite.Keep in mind that the portions are not large, but ordering several items will fill you up and give you a satisfying experience."
"I went to Chicago with my husband and baby last week and we had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant for lunch. The restaurant was crowded but we were seated right away and they even accommodated for the stroller. We started off with the Calamari with Fregula, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios. It was so refreshing and delicious. There were different textures to this dish from soft to crunchy and very satisfying to the palette. Next we had Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese smear. This was absolutely delightful. The goat cheese on the bread was creamy and salty mixed with the hearty tomato based eggplant. A very good combination. Finally we had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. This was the highlight of the meal. The pork was so tender and juicy. All of the portions were more than enough for sharing. The service was excellent and the quality of the food was great. Next time I am in Chicago, I will go to this restaurant."
"If I could eat here everyday, I would. If you're not into trying weird stuff like octopus, it's probably not the place for you. Foodies only. Lots of small plates/tapas/wine selection is excellent.  Expect a long wait, it's almost impossible to get in here unless you know the chef or come in between rush hours.  I would put this up there with the Girl and the Goat, two favorite places in the CHI!"
"So, many raves befuddle me.  This is neither a pan of the place, but nor is it a glowing five star review.  Take a hunk of pork shoulder and braise it until fork tender.  Then, whip up some potato with a tad more cream than needed. Throw on some gravy and serve with a parsley garnsh.  Now, make-up a few dozen similar tapas-like things, serve in a walk-in closet wired for sound and you have The Purple Pig.  I'd go back after a hard day at work and needing to blow off steam, for sure."
"""The Best Things In Life Are Pork."" -MePig ears. Get them. Now. Go. Get them. Seriously. NOW.Solid service and I got to try Greek beer for the first time.3 dishes split between and a beer each for $25. Amazia.Can't wait 'til I get back to Chicago now..."
"Excellent Food! Ok...this place is impossible to get a table at night (regardless of weekdays or weekends)...Attempted three times on a weekday. Finally decided to go there for lunch and was able to get a table right away. Go there for lunch if you can! Here is what I would reocmmend: The pig ear is amazing! The pig tail is amazing! The Chicken K-bob thing is amazing! Here is what I think you should try (just because I did no enjoy it doesnt mean that you will not as well): Bone  Marrow and Pork Shoulder. Overall, a great restaurant that serves great food at a great price! Must go if you can get a table. They do not take reservation and their place is small....either go early or be prepare to wait for a while."
Tapas style restaurants are not really my style but I have to give it to purple pig for doing a great job. Mixing tapas portions and at times full entree portions with their menu. I tried the shaved brussel sprouts which were fantastic. Tangy and a little sour they were a great starter. Than had the foie grois spread which was extremly rich and delicious. Make sure to ask for more toast!The lamb milanese was pretty good slightly gamey but still overall delicious with a hint of sour from the yogurt that it laid on matched with roasted chic peas. The only order that left me questioning this spot was prob the pig tail. It wasn't terrible but the sour saltiness of the chese mixed with fluffed scrambled eggs on top of the licorice pig tail left me puzzled on the flavor combination. It was tender but the meat itself wasn't as delicious as say... oxtail. It was very lean and hence a little more on the dry side. I' have to order the pork shoulder with the arugala. That looked much more appealing than the pig tail. In the end it was an awesome place to eat. Great location near shopping and the marilyn monroe sculpture.Service was great as well!
"The pork shoulder, chorizo stuffed olives, and salted caramel soft serve were amazing. The pork shoulder was really soft and melted in my mouth. The olives were a little salty, but yummy. I repeat, the salted caramel soft serve was awesome. We also tried the pig ears (which was honestly a yummy kale salad with what tasted like fried onions) and the bone marrow which was also pretty good. I'll be back for the ice cream. : )"
We decided to eat lunch here one afternoon during a recent trip to Chicago.  it was exactly what we were looking for......good beer and good food.  Tried the Whipped Fetta with Cucumbers and was not disappointed.
"On a recent visit to Chicago, I chose the Purple Pig as our one big ""splurge"" place to eat.  I was looking for a place with small plates, read hundreds of reviews here, and felt pretty confident that we would be blown away.  Unfortunately, we weren't.  It was good, but it wasn't amazing like most people here are saying.  We visited Zaytinya, a Greek inspired small plates restaurant, on a trip to Washington D.C. two years ago, and I remember that we were literally moaning as we tried each new dish.  Not so with the Purple Pig.  (Zaytinya was considerably cheaper as well.)Yes, it was packed and incredibly loud, but I expected that.  Our server took quite a while to take our order and the first couple of dishes were slow in getting out as well.  The wine he recommended was okay but a bit on the sour side (we drink a lot of wine and it's not difficult to find a decent wine for the price we paid).  The first three dishes that came out were: a selection of three cheeses, broccoli, and the pig's ear.  Later, we had the bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, octopus, and the turkey leg.  Best flavors, hands down: the broccoli!  All three of us LOVED it.  Definitely get it if you go, even if you don't like broccoli that much.  Was the pork shoulder everything I expected it to be?  Well, no, it wasn't.  Yes, the flavors were good, but I was expecting to be overwhelmed when I took a bite.  The octopus was cooked well, and the turkey leg was better than the pork shoulder; it was the best meat dish we had, and I would definitely recommend it.   We liked everything we ate (though I'd probably skip the pig's ear and the bone marrow; the flavor profiles were not very complex).  However, it wasn't as incredible as I thought it would be, based on the reviews here.  I seriously found myself wondering if I'd grown pickier in the past few years since I've started cooking more myself, particularly dishes that involve braising.  I remember thinking to myself, ""Hmmmm...I could make this,"" as we were eating several things.  I gave the Purple Pig four stars because the food is very good. However, if you don't visit Chicago much and you're looking for a special, memorable meal, I would go elsewhere.  I'm still dreaming about Zaytinya in D.C., and even with all the restaurants in that city, I will go back there the next time I return, even if it's years from now.  I know that, if you're reading this review, you have likely made up your mind to go to the Purple Pig.  Just don't be surprised if it disappoints you a bit."
"I loved this restaurant and thought it had a great, original menu. Crowded, noisy but in a pleasant way. A real 'happening' place. Tapas style portions but each with a unique and interesting blend of textures and flavors. Mind you, this is not gourmet or very refined cuisine but the service was surprisingly efficient and wait staff very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to just about everyone and will definitely come here again when I next visit Chicago."
"Before coming to visit Chicago, I researched for a bunch of restaurants that I should try while i'm there. There were numerous sites and reviews that said the purple pig was a must try, so i made a mental note to try my hardest to squeeze that into my schedule. The restaurant itself was at an amazing location. It was right in the middle of the downtown area, with outdoor seating near the Chicago river. I visited during late August, so I was able to sit outside without any issues. Everything on their menu were small plates, all designed to share with everyone. I've never been a huge fan of pork, and the purple pig is literally almost everything pig, but i have to say everything tasted SO good!It's been awhile since i've eaten here, so I can't remember exactly everything that I ordered but the milk braised pork shoulder and the JLT pork jowl is a must! I don't think they take reservations so be sure you arrive EARLY  if you don't want to wait. I came around 5:30pm on a weekday and still had to wait about 30 mins for a table."
Best sausage and beets salad. The scallops were so tasty probably the best I have had! What a treat! People share communal tables as it gets cozy.. Walked in and put your name on the list and expect a wait time of 20-30 minutes. You can get a drink while waiting! Good for people watching as well.
"**Probably closer to 3.5 stars for me overall**After hearing all of the hype about this place, I decided that I should give it a try. I went for a lunch with some coworkers, and ended up sitting outside on a pretty nice, breezy day. That definitely made it a more pleasurable experience.FOOD:Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg: This was pretty interesting, and they definitely like their fried egg here. The pig ear was chewier than I expected, and left a greasy taste in my mouth. The fried kale was fine...although I feel like that's just too much fried ""stuff"" in a bowl. Never thought I'd say that. Overall, a mediocre dish that I probably won't get again.Pig ""JLT"" (jowels, lettuce, tomato): Where people may refer to a good pork belly as being roughly half meat, half fat (with it leaning toward a higher percentage of fat), pig jowels (basically the face/cheek meat) is probably 90% fat, 10% meat. I was told this would be better than pork belly. It is not. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine...for the first bite. But I was definitely overwhelmed by the amount of fat. A little too rich and greasy for me.Milk-braised pork shoulder: Juicy pork shoulder, and fork-tender. I wasn't impressed by the sauce, and tried to get at the middle of the pork shoulder to get pure, untainted meat, which was awesome.Beets w/whipped goat cheese: Strangely enough, this was one of my favorite dishes of the day. Who woulda thought, beets? No complaints, this was a good pairing of beet and goat cheese, and it was good to eat something that wasn't all oil and grease.Proscuitto bread balls: I remember these as having very little flavor overall. I might have also been fried-food'd out by this time of the meal. Next time - less fried foods.SERVICE:Service was good here. Very attentive staff, frequent water refills, and they spent the time going over the menu with us. OVERALL:I don't think I did as great of a job ordering dishes here, but I'm definitely willing to give the Purple Pig another try. I just thought that overall, it didn't really stand up to the crazy amount of hype it's gotten. But I'll reserve final judgment until I've gone again. It's worth going to, but not if the wait is longer than 60-90 minutes."
"I have been here twice now..........and I can assure you of two things.1. The Purple Pig (TPP) will be packed.2. The food is excellent.If you love small plate offerings & cheeses & meats (pork centric obviously) AND enjoy a nice wine or a fortifying beer ...then you need to visit TPP.Realize that you will sit with ""strangers"" as this is community table seating. The beauty is that they will be ""strangers"" no more. What better way to meet other folks then to eat and drink with them?When you come in (a very small space) put your name on the list and then head straight to the bar where you can wait for a bar seat or just stand behind them.You can eat and drink (duh!) at the bar.I enjoyed:*Brasserie Dupont...a Saison beer that goes well with the fatty/rich meats/cheeses.*Braised Baby Artichokes with fingerling potatoes, Asiago and Salami Toscana (finely diced). Beautiful.*Pork neck Gravy with Ricotta-on recommendation from the lovely bar hostess. one of the cook's grandmother's recipe. Toast points accompany.I also enjoyed watching the chefs work their magic. Extremely small work area but the chefs really crank it out.The is s top spot that will be here for a long time. Especially when you consider the dearth of fun/fine food options on Michigan Avenue"
"I'm not an offal guy. Organ meat and cheap cuts of meat don't really do it for me all that often. So maybe this isn't my type of place and should have known that going in. That being said, this place has all the hype in the world and neither the food and the service lived up to expectations. Some things that were a disappointment. Whipped feta w/ cucumbers - nothing whipped about this. Standard feta with diced cucumbers. Silcian Iris - standard fried fair food. Braised baby artichokes antipasta - much like any supermarket cold case antipasta. THE SERVICE was terrible. One would think that in a tapas style restaurant the wait staff would stop by frequently. Not the case. 20-30 minutes between visits. Overall, a disappointment. I doubt we will be back."
"My friends & I tried this place out during our trip to Chicago and we all fell in love with it. We had a two hour wait but decided to go back to our hotel to change during that time, so the restaurant offered us a courtesy call which allotted us 15 minutes to get to the restaurant and keep our reservations. The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual yet really classy. The service was attentive and friendly. We ordered multiple plates with various types of food ranging from clams to the bone marrow. I would rate the food four out of five stars. This is definitely the type of place that you want to try at least once in your life because the food is unique, very tasty but keep in mind that it is pricey and you'll be spending at least 30 dollars a person (not including alcohol)."
"This place is spectacular. Having lived just a few blocks away, I have repeatedly come to the Purple Pig over the past 4 years and have never left feeling any less than completely amazed by the quality of the food and service.First some basics:- During dinner time from 5-9pm be prepared to wait at least 1.5-2.5hrs for a table. They don't take reservations or spots holds over the phone. The kitchen is open late though, and after 9-ish you can usually get a spot immediately, making it a good option for after-show/movie meals.- Dish portions are on the smaller side similar to tapas. Be prepared to order 2-3 appetizers or entrees per person if you are arriving hungry!As for the food, I have tried almost every single item on the menu and nothing disappoints. Some of my absolute favorites that are consistently on the menu are:- Salt-roasted beets: Rich, earthy and sweet- Pork Neck Bone Rillette: Basically a pate of the meat braised off of pork neck bones. Very rich and tasty.- Deviled Egg: This always sells out in the evening- Milk braised pork shoulder: Extremely tender pork on a bed of mashed potatoes with rich gravy- Grilled Octopus: Tender charred tentacles with a balsamic lemon vinaigrette.- Sepia: Grilled tender cuttlefish with almonds and a rosemary vinaigrette.For drinks there are always an assortment of microbrewed beers and an extensive wine list on hand.Try whatever sounds good and come back to try more!"
"I've been hearing about The Purple Pig for some time, so when friends suggested it for brunch this past Sunday, I was eager to try it.Looking back, I should have waited.  Of course it didn't help matters that I was very hungover and extremely hungry upon my arrival.  It also didn't help that all I wanted was a big plate of eggs, bacon, toast and more eggs, bacon, and toast.  Anecdotally, if you are looking for traditional brunch fair here, do NOT try The Purple Pig.That said, I tried my best to enjoy what was available, but at the end of the day, I was just underwhelmed.  The fried Brussels sprouts were well seasoned, but not very satisfying.  Also, I was not too impressed with the green cauliflower (just tasted like broccoli).In addition, I tried the ""JLT"" (jowl, lettuce, and tomato with a fried duck egg), the chicken thigh leg kebabs, the milk-braised pork shoulder, the Waygu sirloin steak, the bone marrow, and the mussels.  Of all of these dishes, I was only really impressed with the mussels.  They were prepared in a delicious cream broth that I couldn't help but sop up with the bread I was given.  Yet, everything else was just... well... okay.I really liked my 2 bloody Marys and the service was good, but at the end of the day, I left The Purple Pig still hungry and with no burning desire to return.Please take what I've said with a grain of salt because, after all, I was hungover.  Nevertheless, I stand by my experience here."
"Not my cup of tea. My friend and I stumbled into this place while celebrating St. Patty day in the city. Although it was busy, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. The seating arrangement is somewhat awkward since you could be seating at the same table with people you don't know. With all the hype and ratings, I had high expectation for this place. However, the food was rather disappointing. We ordered Pig's Ear (it tasted like thinly onion ring and a bit too greasy); Bone Marrow (I'm a big fan of bone marrow and I wasn't impressed. It tasted like nothing); Slider (this was decent dish), Pork Shoulder (this was tender and had lots of flavor, but the sauce was too heavy for me). After the meal, I seriously felt so gross. The food is not bad but it wasn't great. Maybe I tried the wrong dishes???"
"It was our first night in Chicago, it was super cold, it was very late, and the restaurant was packed. When we walked in they immediately sat us in a small table towards the back. We were soo lucky. We started off with the braised baby artichokes. THis is where the flavor started to pour into our mouth. Also tried the pork secreto which was so tender and flavorful. I am not sure how they did that. The sauce for the prosciutto crusted cobia was perfect. Also tried the pig's ear which was also very good. This place was an awesome find on our first night in Chicago. The waitress suggested sottimano wine which is a dry brachetto. We fell in love with this. The service was top. It does get loud in here though. It felt like a tapas bar but with fancier and delicious tasting food."
"I was visiting Chicago for the 5th time and always wanted to try this place! I was there on Tuesday night and it was a full house. I sat on the counter where I can see the staff preparing the food I was so impressed at how the food came together to perfection!! The entire staff from start to finish was amazing,,,even though it was a full house the detail was there (called me by my name every time).  Started off with the Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Foie Gras & Membrillo, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano, ""JLT"" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg, Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraîche & Marjoram, and let's not forget dessert Bread Pudding with Marsala & Citrus.  After the 1st couple plates I just had to try more,,,I was so impressed by every single thing at this place (Staff and food)!!! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"
"Did not know what to expect especially after going over the menu. My wife was not sure how this experience would work out and how we were very pleasantly surprised and actually had our best meal in Chicago. We went early and was sat right away. Unfortunately for us our table was outside next to the door where the wait staff go in and out so the noise was a bit uncomfortable. Our waiter was very good and explained the menu and gave excellent recommendations. We chose the beets for an appetizer, pork shoulder and sirloin tips all was mouthwatering good. The desert was amazing with the Nutella fried pastry and lemon custard."
"This place was delicious but some of the dishes were a little salty and pickled for my tastes. I loved the diverse menu and most of my dishes specifically the fried deviled eggs, the chicken thighs, and the crispy pig ears.  The pork shoulder was mediocre (Avec has a great one if you're into that kind of dish). We ordered more but they don't stand out. I agree with some of the other Yelpers about the community sitting. We sat next to some obnoxious patrons who acted like they've never seen a group of Asian women before. They were facing us while we ate and talked about us like we weren't sitting next to them.Fortunately, the food made up for the akward seating arrangements. Sad to say some of my dishes were forgettable."
Awesome food. Worth a wait if there is one. Fast and friendly service. Price is appropriate. Main dishes between 12-20 bucks. Can't go wrong. Delicious food !
"I am a little claustrophobic and I obviously didn't read about sitting at the same table as complete strangers.  It did not put a damper on my dining experience since my hubby and I sat next to some people who worked for Obama and Feinstein and one of them was dating an assistant college basketball coach who apparently doesn't make that much money as an assistant, and that she wants to marry someone else who makes more money.  Yes, my husband and had a completely silent dinner as we listened to an entire conversation next to us.  Our only real conversation was with our eyes.  Did you hear what she just said?!Anyway, on to the food.  We ordered the bone marrow, jamon serrano, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, mussels, and wagyu beef.  The bone marrow was excellent.  I've had bone marrow at another restaurant before, but this was really good.  A bit on the oily side but it was a good smear with the salt and salad.  My husband enjoyed his jamon.  Our little toddler, who accompanied us to a fancy dinner on a Friday night, really loved her pork shoulder.  I thought it was good, although not my favorite.  She devoured it.  The wagyu beef was also tasty, although we ordered it to be cooked medium, which is a big mistake if eating wagyu.  Must get it rare so that it melts in your mouth like it's supposed to.I am currently suffering from pregnancy brain so when a server brought scallops to our table and asked if we ordered scallops, I just looked at him and said yes.  Turns out, we ordered mussels, not scallops.  Anyway, after I took pictures of my scallops and blinded our neighboring politicians, I took a bite and it was to die for!  Best scallops I've had and the sauce was amazing.  I'm not sure if it was creme fraiche or not because I didn't order it.  Whatever it was, I was ready to lick my skewer clean.We ate so much food and it was one of the best meals we ate in Chicago.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the tight squeeze at the tables.  Do you know how embarrassing it is to ask two people to scoot their chairs in even more so a pregnant mama can get through?  It's definitely getting 4.5 stars since we were not charged for our surprise dish.  We also fled the restaurant in a hurry when the table on the other side of the politicians just got an apology for their scallop order that just came out after a very long wait."
"I have gone here multiple times and tried many things on the menu and honestly, everything is great. Even foods I don't like taste good at the Purple Pig (for example olives). My favorites are the bone marrow, the pig ear, the pork shoulder, the turkey leg confit, and the chicken kebabs. Yes, I know the wait sucks, but the food is well worth the wait. Also they make really good drinks at the bar. It's just sooooo good. You must try this place!!!"
Ok so just be prepared the wait is going to suck.  Also this is not a great place to dine alone.  Ideally you come with a group of people and you can order a bunch of dishes and sample them each.  Also this is a hard place to keep kosher.
"I don't know what Chicago's infatuation with the color purple and pigs are (oh, and revolving doors too. But I digress), but I am sure GLAD this unusually strange obsession exists! The Purple Pig was suggested to my boyfriend and I while in Chicago for work and vacation; and I am oh so glad it lived up to its hype.Pros:-Delicious cuisine in European style portions.-Full bar.-Attentive service.-The Bone Marrow Spread, and Milk Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes is pure genius. Both meals melted in my mouth. I highly recommend the two dishes.Cons:-Super busy. We went on a Wednesday night. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a Friday or Saturday!-Cramped. Really small restaurants, such as The Purple Pig, are cursed with this attribute. All in all, simply DELICIOUS! The negative factors did not phase me at all the moment I tasted their food. All is forgiven, Purple Pig, 5 stars for you."
"Easily lost in the sensory overload that The Magnificent Mile provides, the Purple Pig is tucked back and to the side of the 500 Building, just above Illinois St. Our group of 6 was told there was a 20 minute wait, but ended up waiting less than 10. Shortly before that, I left to run back to the hotel thinking I had time... my tardiness was not missed by our server, Darma.If you are lucky enough to sit with Darma be prepared for a quick smile, great sense of humor, passion for food, thorough knowledge of the menu and no mercy for late arrivals. The atmosphere is casual with easy conversation at the long table that we shared with another, smaller group. Dim, but adequate lighting and music at a pleasant volume. Once we placed our order the first item came out in a matter of minutes. We shared a number of recommended items, small portions perfect for sharing, with the highlight being the Roasted Bone Marrow & Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. We had about 8-10 different items. I lost count with the great wine & conversation. Everything I tasted was very good and the overall experience was one of the best I've had. Good food, good wine, great service and the company of amazing friends is always winning combination."
"A fun, casual way to enjoy some cheeses, small plates, fine meats and a nice glass of wine. It isn't ""fine dining"" - it's casual flare that is just fun and good. I had a bunch of stuff but the most memorable was the whipped feta cheese. Service wasn't very good - friendly enough...when it showed up! But i think it's a unique spot with flavorful food that doesn't need a lot of dressing up."
"Great food!  I thought there would be a huge wait but we arrived a little before 7pm on a Saturday night and the place was only half full.  We sat at one of their long communal tables.This is sort of an Italian tapas place, with lots of small dishes to choose from.  And of course a specialty in cheese which is not my favorite so we sorta tried to stay away from those.  Although they do have a wide selection for those that like frommage.We ordered the following to share:Prosciutto Bread BallsRoasted Bone Marrow with HerbsWagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow VinaigretteMilk Braised Pork Shoulders with Mashed PotatoesScallops SpiediniFor dessert we had:Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce (NOT my favorite... it was like oatmeal with chocolate sauce?!)Nutella Panino with marshmallows and bananasEvery dish was amazing and a good sized portion to share (we had 4 people and ordered 1 of each of the above).Service was fast and efficient and there was never any hurry to kick us out the door even though it started to fill up later on into the night.Definitely recommended."
"We went for a late lunch and only had to wait about 10 minutes. We had the cauliflower, bone marrow, and octopus. All were excellent, but the marrow was the best I've ever had. Beer and wine selection was great, and the service was friendly and attentive. We can't wait to go back."
"I echo all the other posts that talk about the uniqueness of the menu offerings - things I didn't even know I would eat, such as beets!  Between the three of us we sampled at least ten different choices - not a bad pick among them.  My fav was the grilled octopus. - incredibly crunchy texture with a great smokey grilled taste! Unbelievable!  All in all we stayed for some 4 hours and had a great evening.  We started at the bar then moved to a communal table where we met some great folks from CA, and a few locals.  The waitstaff was great, especially Molly, and the vibe was exciting.  Lots of fun and can't wait to return on my next trip.  J"
"Love this place. Swine wine and cheese. Great wine menu and amazing pork. Always love the bone marrow, great wine selection"
"There were multiple dishes that would contend for the spotlight on Best Thing I Ever Ate. This had to be, hands down, the best meal I've had in a long, long time. I would even go so far as to say that... wait for it... it changed my life.We started with the Pig Ear with crispy kale, pickled banana peppers, and a fried egg on top. It was delicious, and not what I was expecting (I think I was expecting a whole pig ear on a plate... or something that would be visually unappealing). It was presented very nicely and the pig ear reminded me of chicharron... deep fried, crispy, and salty. Delicious but I doubt I would order this one again.Next came the Charred Cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons, and parsley. This was SO good. All the flavors and textures were spot on.And this is when it gets even better:After the cauliflower came the Bone Marrow with herbs. This dish is definitely on my Best Thing I Ever Ate list. It was so deliciously indulgent... a perfect physical manifestation of ""umami"" - SO savory, and with a little sprinkle of the rock salt, mindblowing. Next we had the Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese. My friend and I are goat cheese fiends and were actually dying while eating this... Like it was so good we stopped breathing for a while. The wonderful little pieces of bread were generously slathered with just the right amount of goat cheese, and the eggplant caponata was the perfect complement. My friend actually took a picture of my face while eating this.Finally came the JLT. Oh my GOD this was fantastic... Everything about it was flawless. The jamon was so juicy and flavorful, and the outer edges were slightly charred and crispy. The runny egg on top and whatever tangy mayo/aioli they had going on mixed perfectly to round out the saltiness of the meat. The bread too, was toasted and was the perfect thickness to retain its shape and texture while soaking up all of the delicious juices.Besides the food, the service was good and the dishes came out at a good pace. Looking around at everything else coming out of the kitchen made my mouth water, even after we were totally full and waiting on the check. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this experience and I can't wait till I'm back in town to come here again!"
"I can't say enough good things about this place. Three of us came in on a Thursday night, and there was a wait but it was worth it. We started off with a cheese plate and the waitress was very excellent at helping pick 5 great cheeses.We also ordered:Roasted bone marrow-- amazing with the herbsDeviled egg with arugla- the arugla was fresh and spicy and the fried egg was a great complement to the coolnessSardines with lemon VinaigretteWagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette-- seared on the outside, rare on the inside, great!The wine list has lots of affordable options and getting two bottles really was pretty affordable."
"The only (small) gripe I might have about this place is that they don't take reservations. On the other hand, I've never really had to wait more than 30 minutes, and it's pretty easy to get up to the bar to get a glass of wine while you're waiting. They have a great outdoor area to eat (also to sit and drink your wine while you wait for a table). It's sort of small and cramped inside with communal seating, (communal seating outside as well)..but has a great vibe and atmosphere inside and out.The wine selection is large and I've always been given great recommendations from the staff. Plates are small, but filling. Never had a bad experience here. Also an excellent place for groups."
"This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Chicago, and its still my favorite. I haven't had a bad plate and I go here almost every month. The wait times are cray, from the outside it looks like it might be a tourist trap since its on Michigan Ave. but its not, I recommend your meal with an Estrella beer, from Spain since you'll be eating spanish food. I think they're accessible tapas, non experimental food gringos will equally delighted as adventurous i'd eat anything, I'd eat this snail walking on the street people. One of the best in Chicago. Wait times are insane, make a res, or expect to wait at least an hour."
"One of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Chicago!Came here on a whim with my fiancee a couple months ago and had one of the best ""in between"" meals we have had in a long time.  We were not looking for a full sit down meal, and saw that the Purple Pig had a great wine selection as well as some particularly appetizing tapas.  We ended up discovering this great Spanish wine (Naia) that is now one of our favorites and had an assortment of cured meats and Spanish cheeses.  As someone who loves his cheese, I was in absolute heaven.  We loved it so much we decided to order a couple more plates and all of the sudden our ""in between"" meal turned into a 90 min culinary voyage that left us wanting more.The ambiance is great, quaint and friendly, and the staff was great.We make a point to come here every time we are back in Chicago and can't wait until we get another chance to visit."
"This place was amazing! The guy at the hotel said that we need to make a reservation two months in advance, but my girlfriend I just walked in and sat at the bar.Great food and really good wines."
"YUM! there's always a long wait, but now i understand why - pigs, pigs and more pigs galore! even if a dish doesn't have pork in it, it's brought out in a pork-shaped bowl so it's still porky! i came here yesterday afternoon past 2PM and had to wait 45 minutes to get seated for a party of four. we were starving, since that was the first thing we'd eaten all day. we quickly gobbled up all the food:- clams in tomato sauce with sausage: the sauce was oh-so-soppable- beets with pistachio vinaigrette: i'm not a huge fan of beets or pistachios, but i have to admit this was quite tasty- milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: this was the money dish- cheese platter: so-so, not my favorite- cauliflowers: delicious morsels of fresh green and purple leaves- fried brussel sprouts: perfectly salted- eggplant parmesan fried balls: not my favorite, but decent- pork sammich with egg: well-seasoned guilty pleasure- burrata: so-so, the cheese itself didn't have a ton of flavorwow, those were quite a few dishes for four people. and trust me, there wasn't even a crumb left at the end of the meal..."
Really enjoyed this place.  Pork shoulder was tasty!  Minus one star for how small it is and first come first serve seating.  Good eats.
"Expectations for me were: good food, overpriced (tourist area), good service.I was honestly disappointed. The menu is surprisingly complex: don't bring any picky eaters.The waiter failed to bring extra bread (had to ask 3 times) and then proceeded to wait at our table while we got our credit cards out.For the quality and quantity of food, I was pretty disappointed."
"One of the great small plate places. I had a chicken kabob plate and a deviled egg. Thoroughly enjoyed the food. This place has great beer choices. Would love to come back and try more items on the menu. Busy place, but they seated me quickly."
"There is one thing Chicago without a doubt has over NYC: the fact that you can find great restaurants like The Purple Pig in the middle of the most touristy part of downtown.*The bf and I popped in here, famished and eager, right after checking into our hotel just a few blocks away on the Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend. Luckily there was no wait for a party of two as it was just 5pm, although the restaurant was already quite packed and definitely poppin'. We sat on one of the inconveniently high communal-style bar tables, which turned out to be a surprisingly good time and quite enjoyable. Being a gastropub-like establishment, they have a pretty intensive list of beverages, with wines from different countries and many European beers on tap. The bf and I went with 1/2 bottle of the Pinot Grigio, which was just perfect for a hot and humid afternoon.As for the food, I love the small-plate concept here, which allows for easy sharing and optimum pleasure of the palate. While the menu is certainly pork-centric (which is absolutely fine by me), they do have several antipasti and vegetable dishes that can round out an otherwise rich meal nicely. - Raw corn, Heirloom Tomatoes & Arugula Pesto: this cold antipasti was the epitome of summer on a plate. You could really taste the freshness of the sweet corn and heirloom baby tomatoes that are at the peak of their season, dressed ever so simply with a light arugula pesto that's just slightly bitter and herbaceous.- Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana: calling this a braised artichoke dish may be somewhat misleading, as the baby artichokes are mostly just brined. It is very good however, and unmistakably Italian in flavor, a friendly complement to the pinot grigio we were sipping on.- Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta from the ""Smears"" section: this was again very Italian in preparation and flavor; what is essentially a Sunday red gravy contained tender chunks of pork neck meat and fresh ricotta was served bubbling in a ramekin and oh-so-comforting. The grilled filone bread served with the smear was great as well, liberally brushed with olive oil with just a little char.- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: it's no wonder that this is the signature dish at The Purple Pig. I don't even think words can do this amazing pork dish justice, so I won't try to, besides just say that it was one of the best pork shoulder preparations I've had in a long, long time.This place is a serious party. Swine, dine, wine baby. Swine, dine, wine.--*Yeah, NYC, get on that! Before the Second City catches up to ya!"
Thanks again @Yelp! Loved this little spot.  Ahhh the liver pate and those damn scallops OMG!! The server--who provided excellent service but gave me space as I was also reading--recommended a delightful wine (I wish I could remember what!). It was just a wonderful afternoon! I'll most definitely come back!
"Before I visited Chicago, all I thought of was pizza and hot dogs. Now, I think of purple pig too. We ordered a few things from each section and EVERYTHING was good. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, Turkey leg were both really tender. Bone marrow was creamy, and the bread served with it tasted really fresh too. From the salads we had something with corn, and the beet salad with goat cheese. Pig ear with banana peppers were probably my least favorite, but even that was fresh and flavorful and still recommended. AND the service was amazing. The servers were attentive, quick, and really friendly. Oh, the website also features a monthly recipe, with seasonal ingredients. I'm excited to try one of 'em."
"Omg!  I was not hungry to start with but everything was too good to pass up:  Whipped feta, shaved Brussels sprouts, eggplant caponata, roasted cauliflower... Not a loser here.  Try everything."
"I came here with a few friends before Louis CK a couple weeks back, just to add to the epicness of the evening. The meal ended up creating a hassle, and while it was delicious, it was definitely not worth the wait. We got there at around 6:50, hoping to eat around 9 for the 11 PM Louis CK. We were quoted a 2 hour wait, which we anticipated and seemed perfect at face value; again, we know Purple Pig is one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, so this was not a deterrent by any means. We showed up a little before 9 PM and were told that we were going to eat ""in 15 minutes"". 20 minutes later, we asked again, and they kicked the can down the road. This happened iteratively until around 10, at which point we asked them what the honest situation was, because we had a show to make and needed to know whether we were going to eat soon due to time; fortuitously, we were the next table on the list and thus were able to eat. While I understand that it's difficult to give an exact quote when there's a massive line, Purple Pig's lowballing and subsequent fudging of the wait time very nearly resulted in our going to a highly anticipated 11 PM show on an empty stomach. I very nearly relegated them to automatic one star land on this basis before my first bite (but in retrospect, this was an example of hungry rageaholism)Once we finally ate, the food was very good, although I was forced by the circumstances to eat it so fast that I remember very little of it. Most of it ranged from very good to exceptional; high points included the milk-braised pork shank and the fried pig's ear. Still, waiting situation aside, none of the dishes were superlative - Publican, Quartino, and Gilt all blow this out of the water in my book, and carry much more reasonable waits. I will say that it was thoroughly impressive that the waitstaff was able to get it all out of the kitchen so rapidly; they more than earned the truly massive tip that we gave them.We wound up making Louis CK, so by the end of the night, I was happy we'd come here for dinner. All in all, I recognize the popularity of Purple Pig, and that this necessarily creates suboptimal eating conditions; I do not fault them for their popularity. Furthermore, lowballing our wait times on several occasions (the only ostensible unforced error committed by the restaurant staff itself on this occasion) is a totally understandable shortcoming. Still, the fact of the matter remains that these circumstances make it difficult, even mildly unpleasant, to eat at the Purple Pig, and while the food is very good, it isn't nearly good enough to justify the ordeal involved in obtaining it. Given the huddled masses this restaurant seems to (mostly deservedly) attract, they will not miss my absence!"
"Go for lunch in the summer sit outside drink lotsa wine eat the almonds and anything else on the menu, it is all good. Enjoy the sunshine and avoid the overpacked restaurant in the winter, unless you really need some pork."
"Why can't Philadelphia have a place like this? Lovely warm vibe, interesting food served without pretension, unusual wines by the quartino. I had the fabulous marrow, a baked pork tripe/sausage gratin (nice dish for a cold day), shaved Brussel sprout salad to cut the fat, and a Greek white. Would come back often if I lived less than a couple hundred miles away."
"The Purple Pig is a definite winner!  Walking through the ""Magnificent Mile"" toward what (apparently) is now called the ""Gold Coast,"" and my childhood home -- I always thought I used to live on the Near North side -- we spied the Purple Pig, complete with its cool and, yes, campy wrought iron gateway (""Cheese, Swine, Wine"") and, with a mental apology to my grandfather, a Kosher butcher in old Chicago, Lynn and I had a late lunch.We asked to sit outside, as we are here during those two weeks in the Fall when Chicago weather is glorious, and were immediately shown a table for two . . . yes, there are some communal tables, but not all are, and this little table was perfect.  So was our waitress -- blonde, flowers-in-her-hair, and ""with child,"" as they say.  Asking if we had ever been there before, she explained most of the dishes were ""small plates, similar to tapas,"" and suggested that five dishes between the two of us would be about right.  This place does indeed have an impressive wine list, and a very nice approach as well.  Some selections -- although only available in full 750ml bottles -- are indeed available in half bottle amounts, as they will open the bottle at your table, decant half of it, and take the rest off to be poured by-the-glass.  So we enjoyed a Syrah from the Northern Rhône as we proceeded to ""pork out.""At our waitress' suggestion, we had the fresh corn salad with a light pesto that was exceptionally fresh, sweet and delicious.  This was followed by a crispy pig's ear and crispy kale salad, topped with a fried egg . . . thin slivers of pig's ear and flash-fried kale, couple with pickled peppers, that was then coated in egg yolk -- YUM!Then, we chose the ""Purple Pig Platter,"" a selection of seven different kinds of pork, including lingua agrodulce, jambon, and several different salumi -- all served atop a l-o-n-g wooden pig . . . amazingly good, BUT (just to be technical) this is not a small plate.  Not with some three dozen individual pieces of meat!  Good thing we have a small refrigerator in our hotel room . . . But wait, there's more -- we then had the roasted bone marrow (OMG!), followed by the ""JLT"":  Jamon Serrano, an assortment of Lettuce, perfectly ripe Tomato & topped with a fried duck egg, all served over grilled bread . . . .Four.  Four plates would have been fine, but every dish we had is something I would definitely want to eat again, and I'd be hard-pressed to choose one to drop off this list.(Someone remind me why I left Chicago again?)"
"I love chorizo, so of course I LOVED the chorizo stuffed olives! I love the location, decor, and service.  I am not sure what else we ate because it was not good enough to be ingrained in my memory...that's just it! Definitely worth the wait for the outside tables in the summer!"
"Delicious and interesting food, amazing cocktails and great service. Just be prepared to wait.My friend and I came here on a weeknight for dinner and waited about 35 minutes to be seated. I liked the waiting area and a server came by with drink menus to get us started. We sat under the canopy and started with drinks. I forgot what mine was called but it had fresh sage in it. Very refreshing. Our server was good about answering our questions.We ordered 5 dishes and all were tasty and good portions. I think we ordered too much since we didn't finish all the dishes but it was worth it to try a large variety of the menu items. Our favorites included the rabbit salad (well balanced flavor), tongue charcuterie (my personal favorite) and foie gras spread (rich and indulgent).A thunderstorm started dumping rain down half way through our dinner and soon water was coming through the seams of the canopy. Luckily we were seated at a middle table so we didn't get splashed right away. We eventually had to move our heavy  marble table on our own across the floor to try to stay dry. It was about 5 minutes later that a manager noticed and and said a table for two just opened up indoors so we could move. We gladly darted into the restaurant which was still packed with people and a lively ambience. To make up for our troubles, he even brought us another round of cocktails on the house. That's what I call attentive service! We enjoyed the rest of our dishes and even got more bread brought to the table to accompany the foie gras. Now that the rain was at bay, we stayed for dessert and espresso drinks too. The chocolate cake was moist and decadent and big enough for two people to share with some left over. I recommend The Purple Pig!"
"This is my favorite go-to lunch spot in Chicago.  The food is absolutely delicious, I have not had a single bad dish.  The food is fresh and creatively prepared.  The Broccoli with Garlic and Anchovy Vinaigrette is superb, along with the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  Both perfectly cooked and delicious.  The atmosphere can be quite loud and busy, but a small price to pay for the quality of the food.  The wine selection is terrific!   When weather permits outside seating is lovely."
Went here with out of town family. We had to sit outside which was fine since it was a beautiful night.  It was a nightmare trying to get wine! Terrible service!
"The restaurant says that they are soy free except for the smoked pork products that they don't make in house, and those are labeled on the menu. The food was AMAZING! Wish this place was in DC. They got me hooked on raw kale salads..."
"This started out as a happy hour on Friday and turned into happy hours and hours and hours!!! So, while Dionysus may have clouded my memory of the last hour a' la three bottles of wine... I can tell you the first couple were grand. It's right at Michigan Ave and City Front on the west side of the Ave. There is an arch above the walk way that reads Purple Pig and you will see people dining al fresco as they have outdoor seating. The seating is communal which seems to be a popular trend these days. I thought I would find it annoying but I didn't. Inside is as charming as it is sophisticated. I have been to Barcelona and one of my companions had lived there so we both noticed the decor had a very authentic Spanish look and feel with the communal seating, the tile work, the use of wood, the place settings and even the napkins. The decor inspired our appetite for Spain and we started with some Cava, a delicious blend of marinated olives, Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic served salty and the roasted garlic was a great accompaniment,  we sampled 3 excellent cheeses including the manchego and of course some Jamon Serrano. Everything was delicious. This is simple, rustic European fare so the quality really has to shine and it does. The service was top notch. The manager is extremely attentive and visibly making sure that people are happy and things are running smoothly. Our waitress was charming and made some great suggestions. The menu is extraordinary and lengthy so I suggest going with a crowd so that you can share and try many things. That seems to be the point and the fun of the delicious Purple Pig!"
"Cheese wine and swine!! If you love those things you will love The Purple Pig!! I loved every bite. We tried the crispy pig ear, chicken thigh skewers, pork cheeks, and meatball sliders, and the octopus. We sat at the bar Liz was great! Thank you for such an awesome experience!!"
"I was in hog heaven! (sorry, that was corny)But seriously, to quote Anthony Bourdain when it comes to food, ""My body is an amusement park, not a temple."" I ordered and savored everything I could fit into my stomach in one sitting from the bone marrow to pig's ears and feet.  It was divine and I cannot wait to go back!  Wine list is vast and fairly priced. They also had interesting cocktails available.It's packed, but posting up at the bar and feeling the warmth of the kitchen with a Malbec in hand as I waited for my orders to arrive is my idea of a good time.  Great location on Michigan Ave., too."
"For some reason I didn't like this place the first time I came here (thought it was overrated given the wait and all), but one day I just randomly started craving the roasted bone marrow and the nutella dessert. And now I come back as often as I can!My favorites:Roasted bone marrow: super flavorful bone marrow spread on toasty bread with cilantro salad and a sprinkle of sea salt--best way to start the dinner.Panino con nutella: s'more sandwich with marshmallows, bananas, and Nutella instead of regular chocolate. Can't go wrong with Nutella!Get there before 5:00PM and you'll only have to wait 15-20 minutes. After 5, the wait is 1-2 hours."
"By far,  one of the most interesting food experiences I've ever had! I went with a couple of friends to Chicago, for fun, and with no expectations. The Purple Pig was a recommended place to eat at, so we decided to give it a shot, and eat there for dinner. The hostess that was helping us was very friendly, so that was already a good sign. The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was expected since the place was popular, and the space was very small. I really liked how everything in the restaurant was wooden, I kinda felt like I was in a farm. There were barrels, the tables and seats were all wooden.. it was cool! Since there were 6 of us, we decided to each order something different. Everything was tapas style, so it was easy to share amongst each other. It was my first time trying bone marrow, pig tail, and pig ears! LOL. Doesnt sound appealing, but the presentation and the seasoning made everything look so darn appetizing. The pig tail was nicely cooked, and sweetened, with a few green toppings. The pig ear was what I found most interesting... it was chopped up with a fried egg on top. Delicious!! Bone marrow.. I had no idea how to eat it. I learned that it tastes good as a spread on bread, and to top it with capers. Amazingg! On top of those dishes, we had the turkey leg (very tender), octopus (kinda rubbery, but good, if you like that), wagyu sirloin (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), green onions (surprisingly good), and garlic broccoli (Amaaazing).As you can tell, we went a bit crazy with the food, but it was all worth it. The bill was high, but it was expected. Be sure to have a full wallet, and an empty stomach when you visit The Purple Pig. I would definitely eat here again!"
Love the shareable plate trend purple pig is utilizing. Wine menu is wonderful and this is a great place for a first date or meeting with a small group of friends. Pigs feet was my personal favorite. Fun watching the kitchen cook from the bar tables.
"What they said.  The food is excellent, a monumental menu that makes deciding or limiting yourself quite difficult. Service was very good.I don't see myself coming here to wait in the winter, but sucking back some Alborhinia (sic) staring up at the Tribune tower is quite nice.Great wines by the 1/2 bottle.Very fair portions for a Tapas type menuPig based cuisines always keep out the vegan/religious whackos.A great place to duck into when an out of towner insists on Michigan Ave shopping.This place can easily hit the five star mark, some of our choices were a bit salty or a bit too acidic, not far off but just kept me from that elusive five star rating. I will be back for sure."
Food is pretty good but it is VERY expensive for what you get. Good place in the summer with the patio on the water...good beer selection
"Oh, how I love the Purple Pig. The restaurant itself is actually quite small, and with the no reservations system, be prepared for an hour plus wait. Totally worth it though. Just put your name and number down, and stroll around Michigan Ave for a bit until they conveniently call you when your table is ready. Get the roasted bone marrow!Service has always been great. and I'm always pretty happy with the final bill. I also love how you can order 1/3 bottles of wine, which is just enough for two glasses."
"Great food, great wines, even better crowd. Overall I would say this place has an awesome vibe. The only downside is the wait time. Give yourself at least an hour before seated, so maybe a walk before dinner won't be such a bad idea."
"This place was incredible.  The feel is friendly and communal.  My wife and I sat at the bar to wait for a table and we ended up meeting different people, visiting with bar tender and just ate at the bar.  Everything was unique and delicious.  The bar tenders are more than willing to let you sample wines to find the wine you're looking for to go with your swine.I go to Chicago a few times a year and this will be one of my regular stops when I am visiting.  I highly recommend it"
"Went here when some friends were in town visiting Chicago. It is amazing, but you are certainly going to pay for it...the atmosphere is really cool, but it did take about 20 minutes to get the beer i ordered and that is the only reason it is not a 5 star."
"Had a great time here when visiting Chicago.  Extensive wine list and great service.  They don't take reservations but I was able to walk in w/ my brother around 10pm on a Friday night and get seated right away.  Don't get me wrong, it was still packed but seats were opening up.Had the bone marrow(always delicious), broccoli (really garlicky but great), jamon de negra and a pecorino and St. Agur blue cheese (great blue), prosciutto balls (nice, but not a must have) and the pork bucco (fall off the bone wonderful).  They suggested a great Greek white wine that I can't remember the name of but loved.Place was nice, not pretentious, I'd feel comfortable there in work clothes or just walking in w/ jeans and a sweater (which is what I did).  Will definitely come back here next time I visit."
"So disappointed in this place.. Its so hype up! The Crispy pig ear, was greasy and way to salty. The bone marrow was just GROSS, it wasn't Marrow, it was pure FAT! .. The sirloin was ok, nothing to write home about. The only thing me and my hubby really enjoyed was the scallop dish, we ordered two, because you only get 3 scallops per-order for 16 bucks. That was the best dish of the night. Save your money,  you would have a better time at Girl & the Goat!"
"Brussel sprouts were great. Cheddar & manchego we had was also nice.  Chicken skewers were good.Farro and ricotta tapioca-like dessert was amazing.Great atmosphere, and service.Felt more tourists than locals but that's okay.  Had to wait a while for a table."
Tasty food but not much variety other than pork. Given the name I guess that should be obvious. If you like pork and tapas then this is the place for you.
"This place is awesome!  The bone marrow and pig's ears are a must. The atmosphere is lively but cozy. Our server, Alan, went the  extra mile. My husband and I left the restaurant and were getting ready to cross Michigan Avenue. All of a sudden, we heard someone saying ""excuse me"". We turned around and it was our server.  He handed my husband the credit card that he forgot on the table.  The restaurant was packed and he still came running after us. I will definitely return when I am back in Chicago."
"Purple Pig, I love you. But really, how could you NOT love a place who's slogan is ""Swine & Wine""? Whats not to love?So, my wife & I stopped here looking for a really great meal and we found it! We sat at the bar & asked the bartender what the ""protocol"" was. What she said was like poetry: ""Well, you just keep ordering small plates one at a time, and we will just keep refilling your wine glass. Take your time"".And take time we did! 2.5 hours later, we walked out full, tipsy & completely in love with everything about the Purple Pig. I would NOT miss coming back here next time we are in town.Thank Yelpers for the help finding this place!"
"Came here awhile ago, but loved it so much that I made my boyfriend (at the time) take me there again. The place is a bit too trendy for me, and the menu is very trendy as well.HOWEVER what you should keep in mind--do not order the sliced meat, you pretty much get three slices of pepperoni for $15. Not worth it at all. But what I loved was the spreads, and my favorite dish was the balsamic pork tail (I think this is what it was). You absolutely have to order this if you come, because honestly this dish, on its own, would warrant me to fly back to Chicago and go here."
"This unassuming, out-of-the-way spot on Michigan avenue caught my friends and I all by surprise.  We are all already on a purple high as we prepare for purple weekend in Vegas and we run into this gem.Inconspicuously placed behind the Verizon store, the out-of-the-way venue lends to the explorer in you except you don't have to be that good to spot it since the big arch emblazoned with it's name catches your attention as you walk by.  Oh wait, you have to turn your head to see it.I wasn't expecting anything being that this was my first trip to the Windy City.  We just had a great time at the Cubs game sitting in a 97 year old historical venue.  Anything else is icing on the cake or, in this case, bone marrow on the bruschetta.We were told our wait would be 30 minutes.  Whatever.  It was a restaurant with the name purple in it and we had to eat there at any cost.  A couple friends take advantage of the wait time to go back to their rooms to drop off some shopping packages.  5 minutes after they left, the hostess comes out to tell us their getting our table ready and we should be seated in a few minutes.  Nice.  Just as we were told, we were seated within 5 more minutes after the hostess tells us.We make our way in and the place is cozy.  I wouldn't say tight because it didn't seem like anyone was inconvenienced from being in such close proximity.  Looked like a few board room sized tables were taking up most of the space.  Surprisingly, we were seated at one of these board room tables.  Nice, high tables.  Not sure if this brings the child/toddler out in me but I love sitting in high tables where I can dangle my feet.  So not only are we at the table but we're at the table with complete strangers...HUH?!  In a society caught up in privacy and personal space, this was strange.  Turned out not to be so bad.After looking over the menu and not really knowing what to order, we're finally approached by Darma.  So Joanne (Elite Yelper in tow) asks her for recommendations of the place.  It was over.  Darma was sooooo enthusiastic and passionate about giving us the run down, I felt like a proud father listening to my son regurgitate the Boy Scout creed by memory.  EVERYTHING Darma said sound FANTASTIC!!  I swear she said Kitchen Sink and I drooled a little.  The whole presentation was about, I swear, 10 or 15 minutes!  We make some decisions and the order is placed.Our friends that dropped their packages off return and Reg sits at the end near the door where Darma returned to greet them and promptly scolds them for being late and missing the presentation.  Yup, Reg got an earful.  Darma made him go to the corner but the cone shaped hat was too small so he was allowed to return to our table.The food was all served tapas style as Darma explained.  A nice change from engorging yourself with a plate full of food or too little food for the sake of presentation.  Each of the dishes were as advertised.I've had pig ears before but the mixture of it with an egg, krispy kale and the peppers were magnificent (Magnificent Mile?).  We also had 2 servings of bone marrow and bruschetta that were just phenomenal.  Something that good should not be bad for you.  Wagyu tips were tasty and didn't last too long.It's been a few weeks since we've been there so I'm sure I missed some other dishes but those were the highlights.It's a very casual yet refined dining spot to sit with friends and catch up, gossip or just shoot the ish.  The food was excellent but I was more taken back by how passionate Darma was.  As an aspiring chef, I'm sure I'll be seeing her on FoodTV sometime or running her own restaurant in San Diego (right, Darma?!).The experience was great, the food was better but everything mixed together with the best group of friends ever was priceless."
"What we ate (3 of us):Burrata Pugliese, Acorn Squash, Crimini Mushrooms & Balsamic; Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg; Sardines with Shaved Fennel Salad & Lemon Vinaigrette; Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda; Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic; ""JLT"" with Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli; Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes; Festa di Santa Lucia Crema {Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce}What you should eat before dying:  Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg; Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic; ""JLT"" with Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli; Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesService was laid back but very good.  They offered great suggestions on food and wine.  I loved the communal tables.  Great music selection.  Noise level is loud but fit the energy of the restaurant.A great way to end Thanksgiving weekend after several days of turkey leftovers."
"Get there right when they open and on a day during the week and you won't have any wait issues.  The food was great, but the helpings are a little small so it might be best to approach this venue tapas style so you can share multiple dishes with your whole party.  When it gets crowded, the space can get a little tight, so if you don't mind being outside, the patio seating is much more spacious.  This would be a great restaurant to try new menu items that you've never had before or weren't sure about in the past...something like bone marrow, perhaps."
"As always the atmosphere is perfect, the drinks breathtaking and the service to match. The food is made to share with good portions and perfect flavor. The menu is uniquely Mediterranean with just the right amount of home. No matter what your taste, The Purple Pig won't disappoint."
"Bring 3 things when you come here: curiosity, open-mindedness, and a good attitude! Seriously, the Purple Pig might be the funnest food place I've been to in years!! We showed up an hour early and STILL had to wait. This better be good, you'll think. And it is! We sat outside at a community table with other adventurous foodies, and compared tastes. We started with the fried almonds (flavorful!), and asparagus salad (crispy cold!) I had the sweet italian sausage, which was out of this world, and my wife enjoyed a couple of meatball sliders, which were just the tastiest ever! My brother and his vegetarian friend found plenty of items to share/eat with us, but remember, it's called the Purple Pig! I can't describe all the combinations of flavors that these dishes allowed us to taste. The chefs must truly experiment with different ingredients to get such wonderfully different mixtures. We shared a bottle of cool Leth Gruener Veltliner, which was a dry white that was strong and clean enough to mate with our meals. If you're a foodie who likes to experiment with new things, you simply must check this place out!"
"I travel a lot (A LOT) and have been blessed with the opportunity to try a lot of good restaurants all over the world.  I can honestly say this is the best restaurant I have ever experienced.The menu is indecipherable - but it doesn't matter because everything is spectacular!  In my last 8 days in Chicago I ate here 4 times!  For a foodie who normally never goes to the same restaurant twice - that is a testament to how good everything is.  I ordered something different every time, and was never disappointed, or even indifferent.  It is all excellent.  Just close your eyes and point.Between my wife and I we tried at least 12 different menu items, and each was as good as the last.  Particularly awesome are the artichoke antipasto, the pork neck spread, the whipped feta spread, the milk braised park and the turkey leg.Special mention must go out to the mixed berry pastry.  It was so good we tried to order another (again - not something we would ever normally do) but they were sold out!  We returned the next day hoping to have it for brunch - but alas they were still out.  One can only hope that it comes back again someday soon...  Apparently they have a new pastry chef, and this was her first desert.  I still dream about it."
"Found this place thanks to YELP on a solo late dinner two weeks ago while on a work trip to Chicago. Amazing. Service was awesome, Atmosphere was very convivial.I ordered the Pig's Ear, Brussel Sprouts, and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, all on the recommendation of my waitress and have not been able to stop thinking about them ever since. If you can find this place, don't miss it....."
"Stopped in for lunch after arriving in Chicago. It was suggested by a friend, and I'm glad I tried it out.Food: Had a pork steak (I think?) I remember it being very good and very flavorful! The menu was very comprehensive, and there were many dishes that caught my eye.Drinks: Being that it was a summer lunch, I was feeling beer, and there was a great selection of lesser known brews from around the world.Atmosphere (weekday lunch): open and very comfortable, people were enjoying themselves. It wasn't overly busy, but there was a nice buzz. Final Thought: Good food, good drinks, good prices. A great place to grab lunch, and I can't wait to try dinner!"
Very trendy ambiance.  This place had a unique menu.  The food timing was very good.  I never felt rushed even though the place was packed.  My girlfriend got the heirloom carrot salad..it was excellent.  Stuffed olives with chorizo and chicken thighs w potatoes was delicious.  The place is small but worth the wait if you want a table.
"AMAZING!!! On our first trip to Chicago we wanted something out of the ordinary and we found it. Considering the smaller portion size and lower cost (for being in Chicago) this place is perfect for trying new things. My boyfriend and I order all of the follow and it was all very good: fried pigs ear, roasted bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, pork secreto and chorizo stuffed olives. There was enough on each plate for us both to try and enjoy. The bone marrow is a must!!!! The pork secreto is also fantastic, it's like a perfectly cooked bacon flavored steak! Make sure to arrives earlier than you plan on eating by about 45 min to an hour because it is very busy but worth every bit! Can't wait to go back."
"Finally got into this place after a 45 minute wait at 4:45 in the afternoon!I guess the most apt comparison is to the Publican, though in my opinion the meal I had here was better than any single meal I have had at the Publican.  However, the Purple Pig also never hits the highs of the Publican.Our order consisted of a broccoli dish in an anchovie vinaigrette, fava beans and leek with prosciutto, a neck bone gravy smear and the milk braised pork shoulder.  The broccoli dish was the clear favorite being the most unique and the tastiest; it drew comparisons to the GIrl and the Goat's broccoli (probably the best thing there).  Then we got the smear which had nothing to do with gravy and everything to do with a marinara sauce with neck bone meat in it.  It was good, but it could have been any part of the pig, not necessarily the neck bone.Next up was the pork shoulder which weighed in at smaller than I expected.  It's about as good as the quintessential meat, gravy and potatoes dish can be; yet, in the end it is still meat and potatoes.Finally, they delivered the fava beans.  I expected this earlier but it was a nice refreshing way to cap off the meal.  Unfortunately, I would have preferred larger pieces of prosciutto and pieces that weren't cooked rock hard.  I was afraid my tooth had chipped at one point.For dessert we tried the highly recommended Sicilian Iris.  I expected more after all the hype.  Still quite good.I would go again, but try to be more adventurous.  I had heard too many good things about the neck bone gravy and the pork shoulder to pass them up.  However, in the end, they just felt a little blase when I could have been eating bone marrow."
Delicious!  But very pricey!  3 people for lunch and the bill was $100 including tip and tax.
"I think this place is hit or miss depending on what you order. While the shaved Brussels sprouts was divine, the eggplant caponata was super rich with the cheese and overly tomato-y and needed acid to the cut the intensity of it. Sizes also vary. The Brussels sprouts wasn't that large, and I could have eaten five of them (I ordered two) whereas the caponata is filling because of the bread that accompanies it. Oh yeah, our party sat outside, which, despite the best of intentions, isn't really warm enough (the air slices through as soon as someone walks in). You can't really enjoy your meal that way, and for the price you are paying, you should not have to deal with the cold."
"LOVE the Purple Pig. They should open at 11!!! It was fantastic and filled out the door only 20 minutes after opening for the day. I thoroughly enjoyed the Butternut Squash Arancini, and the fresh salad with sunchokes. The 4 of us sat at a group high-top table that had 12 chairs. They sat other people there as well, but we had plenty of space. The fast paced, trendy environment really solidified our downtown, big-city experience. Try the purple pig if you enjoy an eclectic menu and have an interest in gourmet cheeses & intricate piggy dishes."
"Not sure I can add anymore to the reviews already posted, but here are two tips.1. Get there on the early side or else you will be waiting for a long time.2. Bring friends and a big appetite. Portions are small to medium so it's perfect for sharing.  I wish my stomach had more capacity because everything I had was great and made me want to try the rest of the menu."
"Tasty tasty! Portions seem really tiny because it's tapas style, but we ordered 5 dishes for two people, and we were more than satisfied.We got an antipasti dish of tuna in olive oil. It was actually pretty delicious, considering it only consisted of tuna, olive oil, and beans. Very herbaceous tasting.We ordered the bone marrow smear. It was super interesting; definitely something you should try. It comes out legit inside a bone, so once you get past freaking out about it, it's actually pretty good. A very subtle taste. The bread was really good too. We also got the pigs ear. It was fried and very flavorful. Kind of reminded me of fried soft shell crab.The clams were whatever. Should have just gone with another pork dish.JLT- Soooo delicious! Seriously a party in my mouth. It was a huge burst of flavor. Very tasty, but I dont think I could have eaten a whole order by myself, which is good cause it's tapas style and meant to be shared! The egg matches so well with the pork and tomatoes. The tomatoes were awesome!! SO sweet! And the ham was like melt in my mouth tender and flavorful."
"I'm in between 4 and 5 stars because of the price/portion for a couple of the dishes here (cheese portion especially).  I'm giving it 5 stars though because of the price for the location compared to other restaurants in the area (if it was outside of downtown then it would be 4 stars).  Plus the food is so rich I got full quickly (came starving) and spent less than I was planning on.   The food-delicious!  I'm still thinking of the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the lemon panna cotta (and I'm picky about my panna cotta).  Everything that we had was perfectly made and seasoned (chorizo-stuffed fried olives, salt roasted beets with goat cheese, fried brussel sprouts, the pork jowl JLT, Wagyu sirloin tips).  Our server was so friendly and helpful.  She saw we were out of bread for our cheese and meat course and came to tell us she already put in for another order of toasted bread.  I figured we would be charged for that but weren't.  Food came out fast once we ordered that we were never out of food waiting for our next dishes.  I liked the communal seating and the vibe it has.  It is very relaxed yet full of life.  I didn't feel like I was on Michigan Ave.  I will definitely be back!"
"This is a great place to go if you want to be up on what is hot on the Chicago food scene. The menu is large, so it quickly gets overwhelming to choose. I loved the bone marrow and the neck bone gravy dishes. So rich though!! You probably won't eat the rest of the day, which can be very sad in a place with this many fab places to eat.Another recommendation would be arriving at 11:30 when they open. After that it gets so busy, and with such a small place you might not have a very pleasant dining experience."
"Let me preface this review by announcing that I AM the QUEEN of bacon!  Don't put it past me to have a plate of bacon for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  No joke.  So I was more than just a little esctatic to sample the Italian tapas menu @ Purple Pig.Sat down at a tall communal table a little after lunch time with Beth W. & company after some intense Power Point slide editing.  Didn't quite beat the lunch crowd but then again only waited 2 minute for a table.  Service was definitely just right.  Our server didn't give us the evil eye for turning her away about 4 times before we were finally focused enough to stop chit chatting and have our orders down.Plates are small yet made for sharing, so order plenty!  Items from the a la plancha portion of the menu are slightly larger.  Never had brussel sprouts before and boy, is this the right place to try them!  They were served as fried crispy flakes with a refreshing dash of lemon flavor.  I couldn't get enough!  Tried & loved:*fried brussel sprouts*bite sized fried aracini balls stuffed with winter squash & goat cheese with sage pesto*Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki  (they should bottle up & sell their tzatziki sauce!)*Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes (mmm....tender porky goodness!)Didn't try but will go back for:*prosciutto bread balls*pig's tails braised in balsamic*wine!!  how could we not try the swine but not the wine?!*Affogato dessert...this is my new found favorite sweet treat!Truly cannot wait to return to this cozy spot off the Mag Mile!"
"One of the top 5 restaurant experiences I have had in my life. The food was beyond amazing. There was a 1.5 hr wait but the atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed wine as we waited... Came with 6 other friends and ordered about half the menu and 5 bottles of wine. None of it disappointed.  Favorites included the rosemary almonds, pistachio encrusted beets with goat cheese, eggplant tapenade with goat cheese and toast, bone marrow, turkey leg confit (my personal favorite), and the osso bucco to name a few!  In total we ordered about 20 dishes with a couple repeats... I can't wait for the next opportunity I have to visit this place again and relive eating these dishes and trying a few new ones."
"Here piggy piggy...  wait no, I go to The Pig, it doesn't come to me...  dang it!  I went here with some friends a while back as the first spot in our ""supper club"" meetings.  The food here is great and the atmosphere is A-MAZING!!  It's warm and welcoming in the winter and vibrant and easy-going in the summer.  I had tuna with lima beans, veggies, cheese, homemade breads, olives...  and it was all finger-lickin good.  I can't wait to go back here again sometimes soon!"
"Yay!!! I can officially upgrade my rating!!! So, the second experience here was far better than the first. I fell bad that I dont remember our servers name because he was amazing. Mike? Chris? Sorry I dont remember. He came around to greet us and grab our drink order and I was not sure which wine I wanted but gave him a couple of references. He came back a couple of seconds later with one for me to try and it was PERFECT. On the first try, good job.     He was definitely more knowledgeable about the menu and so much more enthusiastic about it, which can make all of the difference. He suggested their grilled cheese of the day which was great, a really great suggestion. Other than that, it was basically a repeat of the food we had before. For desert we added the Affogato, it was so yummy. I think I could have had one or two more.      I would definitely suggest going here later in the evening, I think that is when they have their A-gamers on."
"The thing about going to Lollapalooza parties is that they sweep you up in their arms and fill you with vodka and Pop Chips and hairdos and fancy hair products and face washes and so on and then they spit you back out into the world and you are at a total loss for what to do with yourself.Unless you're me.Because my first inclination is to go eat weird meats - which is PERFECTLY NORMAL so all of you can shut the hell up right now.So my friend and I left the Lollapalooza parties on Sunday and wandered up Michigan Avenue until we arrived at the Purple Pig. Because after 36 hours of free vodka, bone marrow and sweetbreads sound like heaven.Hell, after 36 hours of vodka, everything sounds like heaven. Shoe leather sounds like heaven. The only thing that does not sound like heaven is more vodka.Anyway, we sit on the patio and order three dishes:Melrose Peppers - Which were covered in sea salt and had awesome flavorBone Marrow - Not as good as The Bristol's, but you get more of it.Crispy Sweetbreads - Which have a deceptive name because offal is neither sweet nor a bread.Everything was fantastic - especially the marrow. Our server seemed a little annoyed with us, but it didn't get in the way of the service or our enjoyment of the food."
"This place is amazing. The food is great, service it terrific and the atmosphere is unique!!! Highly recommend it during your visit! We went twice within are visit!!!!"
"I heard nothing but great things about the PP, but was somewhat skeptical about the Mich. Ave address (as most restaurants tend to be overpriced, and low quality).  Purple Pig scored big in all criteria: food, wine, ambiance, and price.  The menus (food and wine) were fantastic, with lots of unique offerings.  Everything we was amazing:- Rosemary, garlic pork fried almonds- Roasted bone marrow w/ herbs- Crispy Pig Ear w/ peppers and fried egg- Pork Jowl...AWESOME  **must try/have**The wine menu was super diverse, with tons of esoteric varietals.  This makes me happy!  Pricing was very reasonable, and anything under $40/btl you could order by the half bottle.  Great concept, as I'm a fan of letting people try a lot of new things on a list.We will be returning many, many times!  Oink oink..."
"First stop for me as soon as I landed at the O'Hare airport. I really wished they allow reservations but I had a nice little stroll down Michigan Ave while waiting for my table. - Bottle of William Fevre Chardonnay: light, crispy. Paired perfectly with the small dishes to come and gave me a nice little buzz- Roasted bone marrow with herbs: I've tried the bone marrow dishes at many restaurants and needless to say, many butchered it and the bone marrows turn out to be overly oily and unappetizing. But the bone marrow here is SO GOOD. It smears nicely over the toasted bread and the herb salad cuts through the fat nicely. The sea salt that they serve on the side also enhances the sweetness and flavor of the bone marrow. - Prosciutto di Parma: Fell in love with cured meats after Barcelona. Prosciutto here was good, really wished I ordered some cheese and toast to go along with it- Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad: Opted for the healthier version of the brussel sprout and went with the salad instead of the fried brussel sprouts. Nothing spectacular here, good old fresh brussel sprouts and parm. - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT. The pork shoulder melts in your mouth, flakes with the slightest touch of your folk. So so good. The mashed potato on the bottom is so smooth and creamy, pairs perfectly with the pork shoulder. I really should have ordered another serving of this just cuz it was so good. - JLT: Anything with an egg on top is honestly good, especially an open-face sandwich like the JLT. - Pork & Sweetbread: I ordered this dish cuz I hope it was served in one of the little piggy bowls so I can take a picture of it. But it wasn't. Huge disappointment on that part. It was good, nothing amazing and it wasn't served in a little piggy bowl =[- Sicilian Iris - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche: Ah yes, the perfect finish to a good night. The ricotta and melted chocolate chip go together so well that I wanted to lick every last drop off the plate. The server definitely gave me a 'good choice' look when I finally decided between this and the panne cotta. The fried brioche was delicious, perfect for sopping up the liquidly ricotta and chocolate!What a way to start off a Chicago trip!"
"The culinary delights of The Purple Pig were the absolute highlight of our recent trip to Chicago.  The milk braised pork shoulder was one of our favorites. The pan fried brussel sprouts were a pleasant surprise, but everything we ordered really was exceptional.  The atmosphere was inviting and although one might initially think that sitting so close to other dinner parties would be uncomfortable, it provided a unique banquet-style dining experience.  We made quick friends with various parties that were seated on either side of us, half local half out of towners.  The restaurant is a rare combination of casual and elegant.  For us, the overall experience must include a review of the customer service by the staff.  Their friendliness, knowledge of the menu and unintrusive attentiveness were all on par with their cool cuisine.  This will surely be a return spot for us on our next visit to the Windy City."
"No, we were not impressed with anything in this place, don't know what all the fuzz about.FOOD: A-OK, we had much better in Girl and the Goat and some other places.SERVICE: average, not bad, but not particularly good ether.AMBIANCE: NOISY, crowded, unappealing.VALUE: would be good if the food and service delivered what was expected from the raving reviews.No coming back for us."
"I have been here twice in  3 days...and may go back Thursday. Completely in love.I wasn't expecting anything fab, because I'm not into these crazy 'swine' spots that are hardcore pig. But, the menu sounded intriguing. I am SO glad I gave it a whirl.The atmosphere reminds me of a french/italian bistro, with communal tables and wine everywhere. Great wine list, which has something you rarely see...you can order a glass, 1/3 bottle, 1/2 bottle, or a bottle. Love this.Onto the food...it's small plate style, although they do have some larger plate items. I've stuck w/small plates and shared. The shaved brussel sprout salad is ridiculously good, the fried deviled egg is beyond, so are the fried proscuitto balls & fried walnut squash bites, salted beets & salami panini were yum, and we also had thew hipped cucumber/feta spread on some of the cripisiest, sweetest bread of my life. These are obviously the less 'swine' adventures you can take there...everyone around us was devouring pigs ears & bone marrow. Not for me, but they seemed thrilled about their food. Highly recommend and plan on being a staple here as I've only gotten into a quarter of the menu..."
"The best word to describe the food here is delectable. They have things that I hadn't even heard of before, and everything was delicious. Everything pig is absolutely amazing, and even the salad I ordered was quite good. The only problem was the service was a little slow, but given how busy it was, it was understandable. They also told us that the wait would be an hour initially, but we were seated in 15 minutes. We were pleasantly surprised."
"Positives: Bone Marrow, Pig EarsNegatives: My stomach can't fit more!My girls and I came here after reading the amazing reviews. As the lovely Yelpers suggested, we dutifully ordered the bone marrow and pig ears before our bottoms even sat down. The bone marrow was stupendous. Can you imagine? Hot, roasted bones erupting with rich marrow, served with buttered bread, parsley, and sea salt. It just melted in your mouth. Like butter, only BETTER. Yes, apparently, there IS something better than butter. My mind is still blown. It was so good. In fact, it was so good, we ordered a SECOND serving. Just three little girls and yes, we had MORE marrow. That's how good it is. My personal favorite was also the pig ear. Deep fried strips of pig ear with kale, banana peppers, with creamy egg mixed in, it came in the more darling little pig dish.  I know it's just dinnerware, but it was so adorable!The pork jowl was literally fork tender. It tasted so flavorful, and I'm sure it would have been delicious if it hadn't been eclipsed by the glory of the marrow. I loved the carrot and lemon puree which added a lovely tartness to dish. The creamy pork shoulder tasted like flavorful pork roast. It was the last of all the dishes to come out, and, quite honestly, we were full by that time, so it was barely touched. The potatoes were really delectable as well."
"I don't understand all the rave reviews about this place.  First, you can't get a reservation because they don't take any.  Next, the wait literally is over 2 hrs--especially when the hostess conveniently ""forgets"" that you have been waiting seemingly forever.We were placed in the outdoors area.  Which sucked.  The high chairs are very hard and uncomfortable.  And maybe it's because we had a large party (8), but I felt like the tapas-style wasn't very good for such a big party.  By the time the plate came around to you, there really wasn't anything left for you to try.  And I blame it on the server.  We were going to order doubles, but our waiter kept telling us that we should order just one of each thing--and that we could order many different things.  I dunno--I don't think that system works.  Service was sub-par, by the way.That being said, the food is overall too salty.  The pork butt and marrow were good but couldn't overcome the limitations mentions above.  I wouldn't recommend this place."
"I used to live in Chicago. This is by far my favorite place to eat, and I am not even a pork fanatic. Whenever I come to visit Chicago, stopping here is on the top of my list! First off, all of their dishes are small plates. This is my favorite way to dine. I like to eat a small amount of a lot of things. Every dish is amazing. The braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes is to die for! Comfort food to the max. The prosciutto stuffed deep fried olives are heavenly. The fried pig ear with a fried egg, kale and peppers is also one of my favorites. I never could have imaged pig ear could be so good. I am salivating just thinking about it. The location is very convenient for visitors. It is nearby many nice hotels (Conrad, Embassasy Suites). If you are visiting Chicago this is a must!!!"
"Get the pork fried almonds! My colleague and I lucked out and got a table for lunch without a wait. Great service, lots of energy, highly recommend. It was a little loud; they had music playing that could have been a few notches lower. Definitely recommend."
"""Cheese, Swine & Wine"" how could you possibly go wrong?!Call me bias for my love of pork and wine, but the Purple Pig is the place to go if you are looking for good food, amazing wine, and a great atmosphere. Though it's not great for groups, the small plates concept is great for sharing and trying different items from their diverse menu. Keep an open mind, some of the plates served are of disparate nature, but amazing nonetheless. Hands down, my favorite dish is the crispy pig ears with fried egg! You must try this; it was my first time having pig ears and I have no regrets- in fact I have returned to the Pig for solely this dish on multiple occasions. Other favorites of mine include the fried sardines and the pig neck rillette. I must say that I was disappointed with the bone marrow, being such a huge fan of bone marrow I was a expecting fireworks from a place this good. The portion was small and there wasn't enough of a sweet aspect on the plate to balance the richness of the bone marrow.  Other than that I would highly recommend trying this place if you haven't done so already. Having most of the wines available by the glass, third, half or full bottle allows for a truly unique meal. I wish more restaurants had this option. Though some servers don't know much about the wine list, if you do happen to get an awesome server let them guide you through it, you won't regret it. The food is worth the wait, but there is a wait.The only reason I did not give The Purple Pig 5 stars is because of the sad bone marrow, and my last service experience, the waitress we had was slightly clueless and didn't care much about our intrest in the wine menu."
"The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because they don't take reservations and the wait was an hour and 45 minutes. But let me tell you.... the wait is totally worth it. What an AMAZING MEAL!!! The meal itself gets 5 stars!The dishes are VERY rustic, its sort of like peasant food with a gourmet twist. All of the dishes are tiny, including the entrees. Although most people would normally complain about small portions, we kind of like it, we were full when we left but we weren't so stuffed it was uncomfortable.My husband and I ordered several dishes and split everything.When you get there they take your name and cell # and hand you a pager. They page you about 15 minutes before your table is ready so that it gives you enough time to walk back to the restaurants from the shops on Michigan Ave. We were paged about one and a half hours later. It took us about 15 minutes to walk back and then we waited about another 15-20 minutes before our table was ready. It was a long wait but the staff was actually really fantastic about getting us drinks while we were waiting.When we finally made it to our table our waiter quickly brought us drinks and went through the menu. He was fantastic! Described all the dishes in great detail, in fact, my mouth watered when he was describing dishes.We settled on the eggplant and parmesan balls with marinara for an appetizer. It was delicious!!We shared a heirloom carrot salad. WOW!! I know it seems silly that one of my favorite dishes from this trip was a salad but OMG! this was salad perfection. The dressing was perfectly sweet, perfectly sour and perfectly savory all at once. I was a little bummed that I was sharing this salad because I wanted more! We also ordered the Octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes. This was the most perfectly cooked octopus that I have ever had. The flavors were just fantastic.The next dish was a milk braised pork shoulder served over potato puree and the most delicious gravy I have ever tasted poured on top, garnished with fresh parsley.This is all we ordered, aside from drinks and we were perfectly content and really didnt have room for dessert. I am a little disappointed that we didn't order the marrow bones. I just didnt think that would be something we would enjoy, but i saw several of them come out of the kitchen and they looked fantastic! Another dish that I saw at the table next to us was the shaved brussel sprouts, they looked really good.I think this place is a MUST if you are in chicago. Dont let the ""different"" style of food steer you away from this place. I promise you the food is fantastic, even my picky husband who hates seafood or ""strange"" foods, loved this place. He even enjoyed the octopus!Fantastic place!"
Place is phenomenal! You can't go wrong with anything.
"Get the mussels! I know it sounds cliche since you can get mussels just about anywhere, but the addition of creme fraiche and pancetta and marjoram made this dish amazing.  I was literally sitting on my hands to restrain myself from drinking the sauce like a soup.The other rock-star dishes are the homemade sausage with cannellini beans and the burrata cheese with mushrooms and balsamic was delicious as well. The only thing I wasn't as jazzed about was the olive oil poached tuna with these giant beans (I think they were some kind of Greek bean). It was cold and the tuna was not as melt-in-your-mouth than you'd imagine for something poached in olive oil.For a born and raised Chicagoan, the wait didn't stress me out as much as it seems to have frustrated others. You do have to be aggressive and hover over people in their bar stools, but I really feel those are the best seats in the house. You can watch them add all those delicious pig parts to each and every dish, and finish every dish with a drizzle of olive oil or even better, a spoonful of butter. :)"
"Hit and miss, I was in town on business and heard this was a good stop. I went there and had fun good food and drinks, sat outside great day. I went back a few days later and got sick. You decide"
"This place is a gem. Great food, somethings were a little salty but hey, it's pig.......go here and prepare to be cozy with you table neighbors."
"I spent a good chunk on of a Wednesday afternoon here having munchies and wine with a friend.  Both being vegetarians, we stuck to the veggie sides and schmears. The food was pretty tasty, though sometimes was a bit on the oily side - not a place to go when you're trying to be healthy.They have a long list of wines available in glass, 1/3 bottle, 1/2 bottle and full bottle. It seems like a great selection, though the menu is a bit lacking in that it does not describe any of the wines. I could be wrong but I think they are only divided by red and white, not even sweet, dry, etc. I picked a wine and googled it, then ordered a bottle and it turned out to be a winner.The service was good, attentive but not hovering - though for some reason we seemed to have three different servers in the time we were there. The place doesn't seem very big, so if you go during a busy time there will likely bee some waiting involved. Perhaps in the summer they'll have outside seating.  It's worth a try."
"""I like it when I like a place so much that I look forward to coming back before I leave."" Those are my wife's words about Purple Pig and I don't think I can say it better than that.When we got there about 6:45 on a Saturday night, the place was nearly full, except for two seats at the counter. From there, we could see everything being prepared from right next to the spot where the servers pick up the food. It took a couple of courses for us to realize how lucky we were to have such a good vantage point. The cooking staff, including the head chef (present throughout) clearly took pride in their work and seemed to really care whether my wife and I enjoyed our food.We enjoyed the deviled eggs and seared quail the most. The mortadella spread, which is on toast with pistachios, was also very good. I recommend those three. We also had the feta and watermelon radish salad, which was good but leaves a spot in our line-up for next time. Surprisingly, the Wagyu sirloin was our least favorite of the night. I never thought I would say that about nearly Kobe-quality beef. Maybe I'm just not a Kobe guy.From our spot by the server station, we saw several other dishes that looked delicious, particularly the pig's ear with fried egg on top and the beet salad. The next time we're there, we will definitely have to try those."
"Ah, great find in Chicago. Dropped by the bar to dine alone while in town for a work meeting. Enjoyed some great seafood little plates and a delicious glass of wine. Fun, festive setting. Cannot wait to return with friends and dine at the communal table. Love this place!"
"I wanted to love Purple Pig so much as many friends love this restaurant & frequent it often.  But after a rather disgusting dining experience & disappointing customer service from the manager, I will definitely be urging friends to try other great establishments in Chicago, such as Girl & Goat, instead. Ok, so here we go w/ the review... After much anticipation, we popped into the Purple Pig for an early dinner bc we wanted to avoid the dinner rush & have a chill dining experience when it wasn't crazy busy. We ordered a handful of dishes but before we could dig into the second dish delivered, there was HUMAN HAIR in the food.We just flagged down an employee & told him there was hair in our food. He was one of the guys bussing a nearby table & was really nice about it. He said he'd have the manager come over (standard protocol for a restaurant). I saw the manager walk by, flag down a server & point to us while whispering in the server's ear. Instead of coming by like any manager would, he had a server do the dirty work for him. I felt bad for the guy bc it's not his responsibility to come deal with customers who are unhappy with finding hair in the food. It's the MANAGER'S duty to take responsibility for & address what is I'm sure a HEALTH CODE VIOLATION.He wasn't busy, he was standing by the front chatting with the hostess & stopping by tables around us asking how their meals were. IF YOU CAN MAKE TIME TO GO TO THE TABLE NEXT TO ME & REFILL THEIR SODA OR ASK THEM HOW THEIR MEAL IS, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE TIME TO ADDRESS HAIR IN YOUR FOOD.I can't even say the food was by some grace of god so good that I could suck it up and eat it, human hair & all. The milk braised pork was really salty. We all walked away feeling like we chugged down some MSG or sucked on a salt lick. The roasted corn antipasti (w/ hair) was pretty legit since I'm a HUGE fan of corn :). The flavors were subtle and it was a light dish. The eggplant parmesan balls were also really light in flavor and had a nice crunchy texture on the outside. You can't really go wrong with fried. And the last dish I can remember were the sweetbreads. The server said they were very ""McNuggety"" & he was right. Soft on the inside, crunchy fried on the outside. It came with some sauces/smears but I didn't really feel it added much depth to the dish. The food was fine, but the experience was pretty much ruined because the customer service (aka manager) SUCKED."
Rocking good spot.  I love this style of dining.  Delicious small plates with interesting ingredients.  Flavors that wow you.  Excellent tap beer selection and a thoughtful wine list.  Service was spot-on.  No wonder it is so popular.
"Probably one of my favorite places in Chicago. Food is consistently great and at really good pricepoint. Standouts are:-Salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio-Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg-Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatos-Pork liver pate-Pork neck bone gravy with calabro ricotta Lots of people rave about the bone marrow... i've had it, its not bad but i've had better. I prefer the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta.Word of caution, the wait times can be long and they don't take reservations. Don't come here with more than 4 people during peak hours."
"Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Amazing menu. *Delicious food. Fun atmosphere. You must go here. Must."
"You know the now-defunct parenting strategy of making your kid smoke a whole pack of cigarettes when they get caught taking a puff or two? The idea being, make them so sick that they never want to so much as look a cigarette ever again. Yeah, I had a similar experience at Purple Pig yesterday... But let's back up. For the last few weeks, I've been getting cravings for meat. Serious cravings. Like, drive to Taco Bell in the middle of the night for a 10 pack of tacos cravings. And then maybe stopping at Mickey D's for some McNuggets on the way home. As a committed vegetarian, I felt shame at these lusty, beefy thoughts. I decided that the only way through this problem was to do the gastronomic equivalent of smoking an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting: Eat so much meat at once that the thought of even looking at a burger would make me want to hug a soybean. I feared that sheer quantity wouldn't do me in, since as a 110-pound lady person, I can't each that much. So I decided on a different tack: Eat so many unusual, seemingly gross animal parts that my stomach revolts and goes on a meat strike not even In-N-Out could scab its way through. But where could I find such a place, I wondered. Enter Purple Pig. I gathered my party of five and launched a full-scale assault on pork. We ordered almost everything on the menu, the grosser, the better. Pig tails. Pig ears. Pig shoulder. Pig bone marrow. Eight different kinds of pig charcuterie. Throw in a giant turkey leg, razor clams and prosciutto for good measure. If you'll pardon the pun, I went whole effing hog. It was a massacre. A sh!t show. There were so many varieties of pork that we could have reassembled the contents of the table into an entire new franken-pig. At long last, I threw my napkin to the table and sat back. My brow was damp from meat sweats. My mouth was a cotton ball from the sheer salt quantities I had eaten. And my fingers stank of swine. Do I feel shame at the damage I did that day? Yes. But think of all the animals it saved me from eating in the future. Because, walking away from the smoldering, porky wreckage, I know one thing for sure: It will be ages before I want so much as hear the word meat. Although I wouldn't mind a cigarette..."
"Yes, it's fantastic. But 1425 reviewers have already said that.  Did they tell you to try the JLT?  We enjoyed every single bite, but the JLT and the bone marrow were my faves. Enjoy!"
"Came here  for anniversary dinner on a thursday evening. It was great!  I wanted to try this place  for 2 years...haha. The European tapas is fun!They don't take reservations.  The wait was 1 hour 10 mins. (you can grab drinks and wait out on the patio)We had the CHEESE PLATTER to start.  It was delicious.  The waitress recommended the Lincoln Log, Gouda, Caveman Bleu .  Loved the cheese & grape jam pairing. (hint: they provide extra slices of toast!)Your Best Bets are the BEETS & GOAT CHEESE SALAD & MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER.  The ground up pistachio nuts sprinkled in the salad was delish.  The pork was flavorful and paired with creamy  mashed potatoes.  good portion!the BONE MARROW with HERBS was stand out.  (cilantro, onion, capers, & dash of salt to enhance the flavor.  eat it all together in one bite on a bed of toast. I was eyeing the giant GRILLED SCALLOPS at the table next to me...looked mouthwatering.   Skip over Tuna & Lima Beans..nothing special.The crowd is hip, young professional types.  We dined indoors...it was LOUD and cramped.  In hindsight, I would ask to be seated outdoors for a quiet, intimate meal.  The decor was warm & hip...fun date place or special occasion.Attire? Casual (not gym shoes-like..but don't have to doll up to dine.)Fun Fact: Why do the owners call it ""the Purple Pig""?  apparently, pigs turn purple when they drink alcohol..haha.  Overall, lovely experience.  Will be back for more pig!=D"
"I have to say I am sooooo sad to write this review but also pretty angry. My girlfriend and I have been really excited to try the Purple Pig out. We've heard great things and decided to take go today, a Monday afternoon at around 3pm. We were seated right away at a two-top outside which was great.. what was NOT great is that after over 10-15 MINUTES no server had approached us. What made it sting is that a few servers had made their rounds between the few customers they had and slowly passed by us, made eye contact, and walked on by.  So we left!What a let down. A server should approach your table between 30 seconds and 1 minute after you have been seated (we work in the industry as well and work right down the street). Someone could have at least said ""I'm sorry I'll be right with you"" , but nothing.  Our server missed out a pretty decent sale as we were going to order a ton of food and a bottle of wine and a fat tip would have come their way.  I sure hope other people don't get the same treatment."
"SIGH.. I came here with very high expectations. I tried my best to REALLY REALLY like this place but I just couldn't. And I am a huge pork lover too.So my two words for this place. SALTY. OVERRATED.Let's just jump to the food:* Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette - Probably the saltiest thing I have ever eaten in my life. One bite and I literally spat it out. I know anchovies are generally salty and I've eaten anchovies by themselves. This one beats it all.* Rabbit Salad - Not bad. Good amount of rabbit but it's just a salad. I came here for meat.* Deviled Egg - Fried deviled eggs! Sounded yummy enough but it tasted just like that. A fried deviled egg so nothing super special for the price.* Pig's Ear - The first dish was amazing with the fried egg. Destroyed this quick. Ordered another one and guess what? Came out super salty.* Prosciutto di San Daniele - Good but it's just prosciutto.* Pork Liver Pate - Good* Pork Neck Bone Gravy - This came out looking and tasted like it was tossed in marinara sauce. * Roasted Bone Marrow - A huge let down. The marrow was oily, fatty and very bland.* Foie Gras & Membrillo - A foie mousse spread. This was good.* Pork Tripe - Came out kind of like the pork neck bone gravy. It looked and tasted like spaghetti sauce. * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - The pieces of pork not drenched in the gravy and sauce was good. The rest of it (around the center) was too salty.* Guinea Hen - This is a huge dish. Again, some parts were good and some were salty. The skin was nice though. Overall, it was cooked nicely and not dry.* Pork Blade - By the time this came out, I was done with this place. My friend said he enjoyed this dish the most though.So there you have it folks. 6 people with a total of about 20 dishes and not a single of us walked out satisfied or would even recommend Purple Pig to anyone. Not to bash on the service, ambiance or anything else -- all of which were amazing. The food is just not what we expected.Practically every dish came with bread. I guess that means everything is supposed to be eaten with bread because it's generally salty? I don't know. I know I was sick of bread half way through the dinner and I probably drank an entire reservoir of water.If you want an amazing pork dish, go to Girl & The Goat and get their pork shank. It is 10x better than any pork dish I tried here.3 stars would be for an OK place I would return to. I would not return here. Total per person was about $60 with tip.Sorry, Purple Pig. The 1.5 hour wait was not worth it. I still love pork though."
"A few doors south of Nordstroms is a restaurant with such colorful and tasty choices that they take no reservations! I arrive at 11;30am when they opened,there was already a line. My BFF and I shared several plates. The whipped feta with cucumbers and roasted cornwith heirloom tomatoes and arugula pesto disappeared quickly. The charred cauliflower was my BFF's pick. I don't eat cauliflower but was intrigued by the different colors in  the small bowl. It was delicious! Although we were sharing, my BFF did not share her Wagyu sirloin tips with a bone marrow vinaigrette! I must try that next time. The octupus was tender and so flavorful! I have a sweet tooth, so dessert is always a must. The bread pudding was the perfect end to a lunch that ended much too quickly. I will find any excuse to return. It is my new go to place on Michigan Avenue!"
"I really liked the atmosphere here. The outdoor seating is great for lounging and there are plenty of counters and bar stools as well. I really appreciated the tapas-style menu. There are many savory options on the menu -- coming here with a big party and sampling all the dishes would be a good idea. I had a taste of the slow roasted ham panini (the sundried tomato sauce was excellent), milk braised shoulder (most tender indeed!), prosciutto crusted cobia (the lemon sauce was a bit too tart for my liking, but the dish was still savory). I left satisfied and I hope to make my way back here if I'm back in Chicago."
"Second Pig restaurant I'd eaten at within a two week period.  Sorry Purple Pig, the timing was not in your favor.  While the Pigster doesn't hold up to the fabulous Cochon, I may be biased since Purple Pig is very wine-centric.  I am not a wine drinker.  Though I believe that the food should be able to stand alone...  Pig ears were cool.2.5 Stars, rounding up to 3."
Service was great. We waited 45 minutes for a table and ended up sitting at a community table. Which was not our preference. It was very noisy and hard to converse for lunch. Bone marrow and neck bone smear was the highlight of our meal. We would definitely go back!
"Took another friend back during the labor day weekend. We were told the wait was about 2 hours so we hovered around the bar area and were able to get seats within 20 minutes. Salt-roasted beets - not really a fan, tried to give it a chance but it just wasn't for meRoasted bone marrow - much better the second time around...not really sure whyOctopus with green beans - one of my favorites of the night, really a must-tryScallops spiedni - also one of my favorites, the chickpea aioli really made the dish even betterAffogato - I forgot what flavor soft-serve we had, but it was really good. The dessert redeemed itself since my last visit."
"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  My husband and I try to get here once a month, and now that we are moving out of state, we joke that we'll come back to town just for a meal here.  Seriously, you must order the following:1-Beet salad w goat cheese2-Eggplant shmear (to die for)3-Milk braised pork shoulderWe get those three basic dishes each time and order a few other things to sample.  But those are staples and million dollar dishes!It's also really fun to sit bar side near the cooks and watch them prep, cook, and QC.  Nothing comes out of that kitchen without complete perfection.New tattoo idea...just have to think about appropriate placement. :)"
"Yet another one of my favs in Chicago. The food is wonderful and yrs they know their pork. I love the seasonal menu and had a great dish last fall that was made with butternut squash, ricotta salata, sage brown butter, and pumpkin seeds. Amazing!! If you get a chance to sit outside do it."
"I love this place. the food was delicious. The portion sizes are decent and the seating inside is cute. We have the stuffed squid. Good to share with one other person. We had the panna cotta, DELICIOUS. Our other dish had sweat bread, it was very good. We definitely want to come back for more. Next time I am going to try the bone marrow. It wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Definitely will come back to this place"
"The Purple Pig is one of those refined family joints that you just can't help but fall in love with.I mean honestly, is there anything better than cheese, wine and swine?It gets super crowded so I recommend going after work for happy hour, grabbing a few drinks and be prepared to wait. It's worth it.What I like about the menu is that it is flavorful, approachable, a balance of rich, fatty, fresh and earthy all in one bite. Delicious.Some favorites include:-Bone Marrow-Peas & Bacon -Charred Cauliflower-Beets (!!) - there are good beets and then there are great beets, theese are the latter-Deviled egg-Pig's Ear-Pork Shoulder - one of my favorite dishes in Chicago-Sepia-Razor clamsI could go on and on and on. The point is that whether you're veggie or major meat lover, on a date or with a large group of friends this place is a perfect destination."
"Hats off to the pig...Had pigs ears, an absolutely delicious pork shoulder, and some wine and cheese.  Everything was well executed and the service was fantastic.I definitely want to come back."
"Outstanding food, and service wasn't bad either, especially when you consider they were dealing with St. Patrick's day crowds.  Diverse menu for the adventurous carnivore and especially for the porkovore. The food here almost made me sick...... Only because I could not stop eating. Went back later the same night for the pork sweetbreads and the roasted bone marrow.  Simply stunning. The turkey leg will defy all expectations. Was going to try to hit The Pig for a third time in one day but threw in the towel at 11:30 pm when I was still full from earlier.Will definitely return for more!"
One of my favorite place in Chicago. Food is amazing. Well presented and very tasty. They have a great wine selection as well. Just  the perfect place to try the culinary skills and creativity of some great chefs.
"Be ready to wait when you show up at 5:30 on a Friday night but the weather was great and the house wine was very good. Dinner was very good and so was the server, explaining and being patientwith a bunch of virgin/first timers. The ""Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes"" total awesome..."
"During my last trip to Chicago we stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel. We wandered around the first night in search of a place to eat and just happened upon The Purple Pig across the street. Being from out of town, I never heard of this place before, which apparently has a following in Chicago. What really caught my eye was their campy entrance--a wrought iron gate with the words CHEESE, SWINE & WINE. You only live once, so that was good enough for me! Holla!Then when we got inside, we realized that this place actually means business. Don't let the corny entranceway fool you. Roasted bone marrow?! Fried sardines?! Crispy pig ear (so effing good)?! It was all delicious. All dishes were served tapas style, but with a unique twist and with innovative recipes.They also have a wide selection of wines."
"Great service, and great food. The pigs ear was delicious, and so was a couple other plates we received, though i forget the name now."
Excellent.
"i had a few friends go here for the first time and absolutely raved about it after their first experience there. they said if i were to open a restaurant, 'the purple pig' would be it. needless to say i had high expectations and was excited to try out this place.they're known for their smears, or so i've read... so i guess it was a huge mistake on my part for trying to want to try something no one else had had (out of the group i had gone to the purple pig with)i got the JLT, one friend got the milk braised pork shoulder, and my two other friends got salads. the JLT sounds so good on paper, and it was good... if u can get over how salty the jowl was. it was surprisingly salty and i was truly hoping to really like it however i just could not get over the saltiness. however, the pork shoulder which comes with mashed potatoes was delicious the salads were pretty good toothe only thing is that this place seems to be more of a tapas place so the portions of the dishes are relatively small (and aren't that cheap either for the amount of food given). we definitely weren't completely satisfied walking out of the purple pig and i was quite honestly disappointed.the atmosphere is great tho and would definitely still go back to try out the smears (specifically the bone marrow) next time around."
A haiku:Pig's meat not enough?Then come here and feast on theinside of one's bones
"We arrived around 5:30 on Wednesday night before a musical. We were seated promptly and the service was great. We started with the calamari. It's served with fregola, radishes, cucumber, and pistachio. They complement the calamari very well. I probably enjoyed the toppings more than the calamari itself. Then we got the pig liver pâté and the bone marrow. The pâté was SO good. (I'm a sucker for good pâté.) It was rich enough to show off the flavor but not too rich that you wanted to wash it down with something. The bread was buttery and crisp. The bone marrow was good too. It seemed too greasy in my opinion but maybe that's the way it's supposed to be? My boyfriend LOVED it and was scraping every single bit, so it's probably a matter of preference. Lastly, we got the milk braised pork shoulder. This dish was a little too salty for me.. Really just a TAD too salty. It was still enjoyable though. I think next time, we will try balancing the rich, savory dishes with some light, acidic ones.A good dining experience and the awesome decor is a plus!"
"The location is a win / lose situation for them if you ask me. With it being a newer, trendy place to check out they get droves of locals. With their Mag Mile location, they also have herds of tourists stopping in. This all leads to a very crowded, elbow bumping atmosphere. It's a nice space but by the time I left I was feeling claustrophobic. Tried a few of the small plates and everything was pretty good, but we had to ask the bartender (we sat at the bar) twice to check on part of our order. He was apologetic and seemed to genuinely care, but somebody dropped the ball. Yes, you can order a drink in the bar area (which is small and cramped) while waiting to get a seat, but it's very awkward leaning over seated patrons to make and receive your drink order. Servers constantly trying to get through, politely bumping into you.I'd probably like it a lot more if I knew a time to go when it wasn't completely packed."
"Since the last review, I've gone back a few times and it get better every time. Delcious:)  The trick is to time it well so you don't have to wait!"
"This was my first visit to the purple pig. I have to say it was a good experience. Like with almost all restaurants nothing is perfect. My friends and I were a little over excited to eat here so we ordered 9 items. We started out with the bone marrow. Bone marrow can only be cooked so many ways and still come out tasting the same. It was pretty bland without the sea salt that came with it. Our next two items were the quail and pork sweatbread. The quail was a bit on the rubbery side. The seasoning on the quail overwhelmed the quail a bit too much because I could not taste the fowl at all. The sweat bread was really plain. The batter was flavorless and the presentation was pretty disappointing compared to the other dishes were received. The next two items were the meatball sliders and the chicken thigh kabobs. The meatball sliders should not be on the menu. Its a bit on the prego sauce side and should be left for the lower restaurants  like  applebees. The chicken kabobs were excellent. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The next two items were my favorite of the night, the turkey leg and the pork shoulder. JUST ORDER THESE TWO ITEMS. These are the best dishes on the menu along with the turkey leg. I have never tasted such juicy pork. Pork is a very difficult meat to master and these guys have done very well. I was impressed with the turkey leg and the pork shoulders."
Great date place. Love that you get to try a lot of different dishes.
So good. Best place to eat in Chicago.
You gotta love a spot that tucked away from the craziness of a busy downtown area. The Purple Pig is a hidden gem. In the midst of tourists and shoppers on Michigan Avenue you have a delicious little restaurant with a good wine list. You might have to wait for bit to get in but aren't all good things worth waiting for...
"What can I say..YUM YUM YUM...everything on that menu is ridiculously good. I've had both lunch and dinner here and they never disappoint. The bur rata, the octopus and the bone marrow are my favorite things on the menu."
"Had a wonderful earlyish after work dinner with some colleagues.  We were seated despite missing one from our party and even moved to the end of the table without incident or complaint from our hostess.  The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable we gave her suggestions on what we were looking for in our wine options and she recommended 2 great wines.  The Pig Plate and cheeses were just what we were looking for and the brussel sprout ""salad"" and beets were just what we were looking for.  We split the milk braised pork shoulder and ended with the panne cotta which was AH-MAZING and a chocolate cake.  We did have to sit by the door so as the night wore on and it got more and more crowded that was slightly annoying, but our bellys were full the wine drunk so we were content and left before we were too irritated."
"Came here one night in late November with a couple friends.  We sat outside in the covered area with the heat lamps, though it was very windy outside.  The lamps were doing an ok job keeping up... we made up for the difference by putting on our Prosecco and Wine jackets and continued ordering a smorgasbord of food to share.  The cheese plates were delicious, nice and creamy goat cheese, the olives were great, and so were the eggplant spread and chicken kebab.  I liked the atmosphere, it wasn't too upscale and overall the service was pretty fast.  We ordered our dinner items in a couple rounds, and everything came out pretty quickly.  It's a great place to go and have a casual get-together, and I liked how the seating allowed for some cross-conversation with your neighbors.  Give it a go!"
"Wow, what an amazing experience. I went with my boss for a lunch in between some appointments downtown (he lives in NC).  The menu was a bit different than what I was expecting, which kind of freaked me out. I think our server sensed that and, without us asking, delved into describing the menu, that items are meant to be shared, and recommended we get a few plates for lunch.We tried the bone marrow, balsamico ""smear"" and one of the antipastis (which I can't remember right now). Everything was delicious and was the perfect amount of food to fill us up but not too heavy.The restaurant it'self is on the river. So, we took advantage of sitting outside. However, there were bees flying around from the potted plants, and I freaked out since I'm allergic. There are natural bee deterrents they could use. Just a suggestion...The outdoor seating had wonderful umbrellas, and there was a group of 10 sitting outside. So, I would definitely recommend this to a group. The inside is pretty extensive, with a nice bar area in the center of the space.Everything looks clean, Euro chic and just inviting. The Purple Pig sign is big enough that you can't miss. I'd encourage you to try this place!"
"Dined twice at the Purple Pig. The last time was an hour wait. Hype is a dangerous thing..Anyway, this time I came with a friend from college that I hadn't seen in at least 5 years, so I was willing to wait around and talk and catch up. I had the lambrusco while waiting, which wasn't that sweet (I was bummed, because I like sweet wines.. but that's just me). Once finally seated, we ordered the:Roasted bone marrow: fatty & delicious as expected, though I felt that they could have given us more bread to go with it.Roasted beets with goat cheese: I'm on a relatively new beet kick, and these were pretty well done. note, they are served coldFried sardines: crispy on the outside and good in the way that sardines are supposed to taste.. they have a strong taste though, not quite fishy but briney, so take noteRazor clams: this was my first time trying them. they have an interesting cuttlefish like texture, sort of chewy. They came with the shell and were done with a wonderful sauce. yum.Mussels: very good mussels, flavorful. we ordered extra bread to soak up the brothPork shoulder with mashed potatoes: I thought this tasted like Thanksgiving turkey. It was tender and moist but didn't taste like pork. so, unless you're craving turkey..Turkey leg: really tender and flavorful, especially the skin. For dessert, we had a fried donut with ricotta and chocolate chips topped with powdered sugar. Rich, but delicious.Recommended for groups, but just remember to come early"
If you don't mind the 2 hour wait it is well worth it.
"This place is pretty good, but the customer service is horrible. I've been several times and the food is consistent. However I have called on three occassions and each time the hostess or person who has answered the call has been rude, short and has hung up on me in mid conversation. I understand this is popular place, but that is no way to treat patrons who support your business. I will not be going back."
"I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for The Purple Pig. It's been my one true standby ever since it opened. I go there to show off Chicago's culinary ""street-cred"" to out-of-town guests, to catch up with friends for a quick after work meet up, or to simply get my fix of good wine and great food.The secret to the Purple Pig is timing. They don't take reservations and the wait tends to be 1-2 hours in the evenings. I usually like to go right after work (or even leave work a bit early to beat the crowd) or at odd hours in the afternoon (who's up for some razor clams at 3PM on a Sunday?) When I absolutely have to dine during peak hours, I stop by the restaurant an hour or two before my preferred dining time to put my name on the list. That way I can come home, get ready, wait for them to call me, and count my lucky stars that I live not far from the Bannos family's latest and greatest. The other reviews did a great job of covering the dishes and ambiance of the place. My personal favorites are the pate, charred green onions, and pork shoulder but honestly with a menu like that you can't go wrong (yes, I've tried most of the menu and no, bikini season isn't going so great as a result). Come here with an open mind and ALWAYS ASK THE WAITER WHAT THEY LIKE ON THE MENU. They will not lead you astray and I've discovered most of my faves that way. PS - If you're lucky enough to snatch the ""chef's table"", two seats at the end of the bar that faces the kitchen (think Avec), you'll get a front row view to Jimmy Jr. doing his thing. He's kind of hot in a ""wow you make a mean romesco sauce"" kind of way."
"HELLLLLO!Mama I've died and gone to HOG heaven! If you could imagine pig, pork, bacon...Miss Piggy cooked in  every and any delicious way possible...The Purple Pig is the the place to be!From the nommy bacon fat roasted, rosemary, garlic almond app to the bone marrow spread on bread to the greasy-buttery jowel with apricot dressing...this is the place to be for any pork lover out there! I was hesitant on a few dishes, but my boyfriend (who I NEVER trust, when it comes to food) convinced me to give these dishes a whirl. And, I am so glad I did. Every bite was as scrumptious as everyone around me described. I looked forward to the next bite like a fat kid who loves chocolate!Ambiance was great! However, if you are not a socialite, like myself then I recommend you ask for a table for deux. As seating here is informal and you will be sitting next to a grandma look-alike, or Indiana neighbors visiting for the weekend. I loved ""The Purple Pig!"" I can't wait to go back! Nommy Nommm Nommm nommm nommmmnommmmm...."
"Wow, a great all-around experience.Most of the plates were delicious.  I would highly recommend the razor clams, the Pig Ears, and the Turkey leg.The pig platter is a nice starter as well.Presentation is outstanding but service could be a little more attentive.  Also size of the restaurant causes waits to be somewhat long and difficult for bigger parties.I plan to return and try more plates!"
"""Cheese, Swine & Wine""Yea, that's pretty much all you need to know!This place is an awesome hang out for groups.  I can see how easy it'd be to sit around for hours with beers/wines and an assortment of tapas that they offer.The razor clams had to be my favorite dish.  Savory, tangy and chewy.  I love the texture and the natural ocean flavor of clams.The fried pig ears seem to be a favorite with reviewers, but I wasn't wow'ed.  I mean, you couldnt really taste the pig ears.  I could have been eating pieces of fried dough for all I know.Local or tourist, definitely a place you should check out.  I wish they had a place like this in SF.  Hey, someone open one up!  NOW!Oink oink."
"An unexpected delight! Yelped the area for some good eats and found The Purple Pig... being a pork connoisseur, I was SO glad yelpers weren't lying about this one... Didn't get a chance to try the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder that was raved about, so was sad about that but everything else was pretty pleasing!Service was great as very pleasant. She was super knowledgeable about the menu and had great at recommending items and helpful trying to pair a wine to our preferences and ordered items.We ordered the Eggplant Parmesan Balls and Pork Fried Almonds to start... deeeee-lish... Next came some Charcuterie and Cheese, also pleasurable... and then finished with Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin ""Bread Crumbs"" and Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde... The Pork Tripe was probably the least favorite of the day because of the texture? I think we were expecting something different... flavor was fine tho, just wanted more of a tripe texture. I do like my tripe cooked down, but perhaps it was just too cooked down for my liking, matter of personal preference on this one.  The octopus was really great, I love a place that knows how to treat their cephalopods! You don't see that very often, so kudos for nailing that dish.I would definitely come back to see about consistency the next time I'm in town."
"I had a couple horrible dinner experiences here, both related to the service.  I have now been back several times for lunch, and the difference was like night and day (haha.) Basically, everything I've had was amazing: from the pig tail to the various vegetable dishes, and the more relaxed service at lunch lets one enjoy them, they way one should.  The communal tables let you chat with other people, and I think people are more in the mood for that when they're day-drinking, too!"
"Amazing. I feared I was falling out of love with food after a disappointing experience at Quartino, but Purple Pig reminded me how it feels to have an out-of-body experience with each bite. Located smack dab in the middle of Michigan Ave., this wine bar boasts a gorgeous patio and a unique menu of small dishes.We ordered:Potato and speck croquettes: Good, but nothing special. My friend raved about these, but I've had better, more authentic croquettes.Charred cauliflower: Really lovely. The sourness of the cornichons was surprising but worked well with the cauliflower.Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta: Amazing, amazing, amazing. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. The spread is almost like meat sauce, and it tastes delicious on the bread. The melted ricotta on top was a nice touch.Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: Probably the least interesting of the dishes we ordered, but by far my favourite. The pork was unbelievably tender -- I've never tasted anything like it. Chicken thigh kabobs: Again, nothing remarkable about this dish, but it was another one of my favourites. The fried potatoes were almost like pancakes. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could've eaten three more plates of this.Scallop spiedini with chickpea aioli: The priciest and my least favourite of the dishes. I guess I'm just not really a fan of scallops. Didn't like the flavours on this one.Service was great throughout the night. The bill came out to about $25pp without alcohol for the three of us. Not cheap, but definitely worth it."
"I felt like at Bizarre Foods.. seriously. I went nuts on the menu. Neck, tail, ears, sweatbread. We got lots of bizarre things. I ate them all, loved them all. This place is still the talk at work for the non adventurous people.PLEASE OPEN ONE IN TUCSON PLEASE!!!!"
"What can I say that everyone else has not said?  This place is beyond fantastic!  Some of the best food I have ever eaten.  It is tight quarters, but it didn't bother me a bit once the food started coming.  Not one of the 6 dishes we ordered was a misfire.  Loved them all, and can't wait to return and try some more!"
"A-mazing!  Crowded, cramped but a foodie's must!  Small portions allow for sampling of the culinary expertise. WILL BE BACK!"
"My cousin took me and her sister here at 5 PM for an early dinner, since she wanted to avoid a long wait or god forbid getting turned away. We waited only a few minutes, but was very pleasant as they have a waiting ""hall"" in the back of the restaurant to help us escape the cold.I started with the Belhaven Scottish Stout, an awesome dark beer with lots of strong, toasty flavor though fairly strong at 7% abv. As for the tapas, some were fairly good, some were absolutely amazing.Roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios: Delicious start to the meal! The fresh taste of the roasted beets contrasts very well against the fluffy whipped goat cheese (which was was not too pungent, often the reason why people may dislike it) and the crunchy pistachios.Roasted Bone Marrow: YES. Anthony Bourdain was right, this really was God's Butter. Spread some of that fatty, oily goodness onto buttered/toasted thick bread with some capers and onions and you got Garlic Bread times 10.Butternut squash arancini: This was only okay, nothing particularly special about this.Pig ears: Very unique, tasted like pork rinds with eggs and pickled veggies; this is a must order, though would not be something I'd order a second time just because it seems like something you could whip up at home.Pig's tails: Just like oxtail, this was a very tender part of the animal. In fact, for those of you who've had it, it is very much like the chinese version of soy sauce braised oxtail. Brought me back home a little bit :)Milk-braised Pork Shoulder: Tasted just like pot roast. Don't get me wrong, I love pot roast, just not at tapas prices!Mussels with pancetta, creme fraiche, and marjoram: We added this item on last as we were finishing we because I was still a little hungry. I love seafood, so this hit the spot, though don't expect much if you're comparing it to seafood in New England or San Francisco.After going through this, there's only two things I would go back in anticipation of: Beets to start off fresh, and then dive in head first for the bone marrow!"
"The first thing you have to do is control yourself. CONTOL! DO NOT EAT EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU CANNOT FIT IT IN YOUR STOMACH!Once you have that mantra down make sure you come at a convenient time. I recommend anything after 10 PM because you will be rubbing against strangers and be up to your elbows in asses. You might question my understanding of anatomy but you'll understand once you get there.Their menu doesn't change too much; Asparagus & Hazelnuts with Arugula & Treviso - Light and flavorful. The arugula adds a good mix with the sweet hazelnuts that just evens it out! Damn good! Chorizo Stuffed Olives- Great! It's a staple and again they do a great job mixing up the flavors so it's not too sweet.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- If I have one complaint, it was over too soon. The portion is good but I just wish I could have had more. The egg isn't too runny and mixes with the pig's ear. Kale is lightly salted and tastes freaking awesome. Going to be honest and say I'm not a huge fan of vinegar so I could have cared less for the peppers but they were weren't as sour as I would have imagined. Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette- They wagyu wasn't anything special and the combination of fingerling potatoes and red onions made it more of a western ""meat n potatoes"" kind of dish but it was good. Wouldn't say it's something you'd have to get.BONE MARROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!SCOOP OUT MARROW, SPREAD ON BREAD, CRUSH SALT POUR OVER MARROW, SHOVE IN MOUTH. DROOL. Word of advice; don't be shy and sparing with your marrow. SLATHER THAT S***.Desert has always been the Panino con Nutella for me.- It's like a fancy shmancy s'more that has the perfect texture and consistency. Crispy on the outside, gooey in the middle, light because of the bread, heavy hazelnut chocolate sauce and creamy marshmallows to boot. I NEVER think I have room for it... but I always end up finishing it."
"Ordered the bone marrow, wagyu beef, cheese platter, cauliflower, hazelnut and asparagus salad, and pigs ear and LOVED EVERY SINGLE BITE.We sat right at the bar, in front of the kitchen and chatted it up with the staff and owner. Superb staff and great food!"
"The portions are big, the service wonderful, and the food creative.If you like the various parts of pig...you must try this place.  They have everything from pig shoulder to pig ear to pig tail.  We had the pig tail, pig shoulder, bone marrow spread, and beets.  The beets were delicious and a good change to all the meat.  I would recommend doing a 1:1 ratio of veggie to meat dish as the meat dishes are heavy.We also saw someone order the turkey leg which was enormous for the pricetag!"
"I would give it a 4 star except it's very uncomfortable--crowded, noisy and the seats are squashed together so you can barely move. Fortunately we came really late on a week night and there was no wait. I have tried to come in the past but I refuse to wait 2 hours for any meal. (It's not worth a 2 hour wait.)The server was pretty aloof at first and she was asking for our order within 2 minutes of us sitting down. Also, the wine list is extensive so you really need to provide more than one list per table if you want to take orders that quickly. I will say that the server warmed up after a while and I was glad she gave us honest opinions on some of the dishes. We had the Iberico ham smear, which was fantastic! Not a good choice for anyone on a diet or with heart problems. I love Iberico ham and this is pure fat melted on toast--I would like to know where they get that extra fat and just buy some to keep in the fridge! The fried manchego cheese was also very good but a fairly small portion (6 bites). We got a panini, which was a substantial portion but pretty average flavor--nothing special.The wine was fine. Not sure why everyone is so impressed with the wine; the restaurant doesn't make it and it's certainly not a great value for a 4 oz. pour.I would go back late at night or early evening for a small bite and try another dish or two. I would not go back if I wanted a long relaxing dinner with friends."
"This is one of my favorite places in Chicago!  I love the food, casual atmosphere and affordable wines!  I have tried just about everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.  When it gets to packed you can give your cell number to the hostess and grab a drink at the hotel across the street until your table is ready."
"I'm surprised by the rave reviews here. Really?!Went here for a girls night out, thank goodness it wasn't too cold outside because we had to wait about 45 minutes (they don't reservations unless its a large party). The service was slooooooow. Also, asking for bread was a huge faux pas apparently but we were waiting so long for food we needed something so we wouldn't starve! Also, our waiter seemed to be annoyed that not all of us were drinking (the wine selection wasn't amazing) and I guess he thought his tip would be affected from mostly a food bill.The food is so mediocre. We got several of the plates and they were meh. The chicken was overdone, the scallops were overdone... nothing we ordered was bad, but nothing really seemed to be worth the price either. It is not for those trying to eat on the healthier side either.All of us girls left hungry. We would have ordered more food, but it was so sub par that we needed to spend our money elsewhere.I won't be back."
"Venue is great, nice location and outdoor seating. We had a super discourteous server which makes me question ever coming back here. She was patient when we placed out order then screwed up our order when she came back."
"Top scores on food, service and value. That alone would earn them 5 stars in my book, but there's more.Anthony Bourdain would love this place. The menu offers things you don't find very often - peasant dishes like pigs tails, pig's ear with kale, sardines with shaved fennel, tripe, bacon fat pork belly confit, and the very popular roasted bone marrow. Don't be afraid, there are many items that even the most conventional would enjoy.Another favorite of Bourdain's would certainly be the kitchen. It's all right in front of you. I watched in admiration as the crew (hispanic, as Bourdain points out, are always behind the scenes of the best restaurant) hustled non stop and showed great care in preparation and presentation. It made me glad to see often they tasted what they were preparing (not to worry, they practiced impeccable kitchen hygiene). Very fun to watch.The wine and cheese menus, like everything else, were excellent but limited (in a good way) to fit the cuisine. And, if all that wasn't enough, the desserts are an experience unto themselves.This place is really small, which IMHO is what makes this place so special. No factory kitchen. No encyclopedia-type menus to slug through (one-page with everything on it). And, no banquet hall style dining room."
"Fun atmosphere for lunch with friends, alone, or a date with a sense of adventure. We ordered six dishes, sat on high chairs at a communal table, ordered a glass of wine each and enjoyed beyond belief! We ordered ...Salt-Roasted Beets withWhipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette (5 stars)Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes,Asiago & Salami Toscana (5 stars)Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (5 stars)Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta (4.5 stars but OMG!!!)Jimmy's House Made Italian Sausage with Braised Escarole & Cannellini Beans (4+)Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (3.5)and 4 different glasses of white wine, all of which were well appreciated with no complaints (although a little pricey - $10 to $16)Oh what a feeling!!!!"
"Best pork of my life!This place has an incredibly fun and diverse wine list, with some some obscure varietals from France and Spain to Greece and beyond! Amazing service at the bar (which is where we decided to dine.) A wonderful opportunity to people watch, as well. I would suggest budgeting AT LEAST two hours to include wait time.Chorizo stuffed fried olives are proof of a higher power that loves us, and wants us to be flabby.Cheese and meat sampler plates are a must."
Crowded but worth the wait...We stood behind ppl at the bar area that were working on their dessert or paying expecting them to leave soon. We waited and once they got out we sat down. Gotta move fast! Dishes was small but delicious. I never liked Beets salad w/ whipped goat cheese but now I lovin it! I also like the sepia it taste like calarami. The bread pudding was delicious. My friends didn't like the bone marrow & pork shoulders...They said it was salty and fatty. Cocktail was refreshing too! I order about 3 drinks. :)
"gourmet, melt-in-yo-mouf, delicious. on our menu for that snowy evening in january (after waiting for ~45 minutes)- castelfranco+sunchokes+hazelnuts+apple cider vinaigrette salad, skate wing, chorizo-stuffed olives, bone marrow, camembert, pork sweetbreads, and affogato and bread pudding for dessert. oh, and wine (Mas de Gourgonnier ""Les Baux de Provence""). and beer. lots of it. highlights from the pig's tiny kitchen: bone marrow-textured kind of like pate. flavored mostly by the spices and seasoning. definitely worth trying; it's kind of what this place is famous for. affogato-delicious peanut butter ice cream with espresso poured over it. soooooo good. as it was snowing and freezing, we expected no one to be out (us Californians assuming everyone didn't leave their houses when it snowed). On the contrary; this place was packed with a crowd mostly older than we were. I can't imagine how crowded it would be during pleasant weather! Would definitely go back."
Tried some pig ear and tail and a couple of other sides with a nice bottle of wine. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was wonderful in helping us to select a variety of plates to taste. We went early Friday evening about 6pm and didn't have to wait for a table though it was already very busy.I would definitely go back!
"WOWEEEE WOW WOW WOW!!  I don't know where to begin!  I was a little skeptical when my boyfriend told me he wanted to take me here from dinner during one of our vacations and boy was I wrong (and I don't admit to that very much!)  When we got there, we were definitely NOT prepared for how small this restaurant is and we were told that there would be an hour-hour and a half wait for a table and there was no available seating at the bar but we were more than welcome to wait for something to open up.  My feet (in brand new heels, mind you) were not happy at the sound of that, but we put our names on the list and first look at the extensive beer and wine list eased my pain.  The bartenders were VERY attentive and for as crowded as the place was we were able to order and receive our drinks in a matter of minutes.  We waited just a mere 20 minutes before the bartender who was serving us flagged us over to two seats that had just become available at the bar.  Talk about service, right?!  We ordered four of the small plates and they were AMAZING!  If you go, please - you owe it to yourself! - try the deviled egg, fried pig ears, and the pig tail.  All three are a life changing experience for your taste buds!  I could go on for DAYS about how great this restaurant is, but I'll save you the rambling and time and just tell you that this is by far one of my favorite restaurants, if not my absolute fave.  The service is GREAT, everyone is so friendly, and the vibe is energetic and contagious!  Check it out - you won't be disappointed!"
"Oh, Purple Pig. See, I'd heard about you all around town and it was all such perfumed words of praise. I had to try you! I made plans several times, but things always fell through. And then it was my anniversary and it only seemed right to give that dinner to you. So off we went, me and my man.We nibbled on your pig ear with kale and an exquisitely fried egg. It was crisp and complex, and I enjoyed it far more than I expected. Smeared some roasted bone marrow on bread and swirled the familiar flavour all around my mouth. Luscious. My mother used to boil bones and feed me marrow with a sprinkle of salt; she said it would make me strong. Well, strong desire is definitely what I'm feeling for you, Pig. Oh, and then we ended the night with the sumptuous Sicilian Iris. It arrived plump and ready. We gently prodded the brioche together; such an act can only be shared! It oozed out a silken and sexy concoction of ricotta and chocolate. Pig! You are just too much. Cannot wait until our next encounter."
"Love it!  OMG!  The bone marrow with cilantro, marinated onions and capers over garlic bread was to die for.  Even my husband, who doesn't care for the texture of bone marrow loved it.  My picky Nicky daughter really liked their butternut squash with fried sage and brown butter, pork fried almonds, cheese plate, mashed potatoes, and faro with chocolate sauce.  The Sicilian Iris had the perfect balance between the chocolate and ricotta against the gooeyness of the fried brioche.  It's definitely worth the 1 hour wait."
"I wanted to like this place, but just couldn't get past some of the flaws. -Food-This may have been caused by some of the disappointment we experienced from the beginning of the ordering process.  Wanted to order the butternaut sqaush (as I heard great reviews on this dish), but it was a seasonal item so was not available.  I will not hold that one against them.  Prior to coming here on Friday, I had looked at the menu and had been excited about trying their Proscuitto Bread Balls.  That was one item that they were out of and had informed us before we even looked at the menu upon being seated.  THEN, they came back after we placed our order and said they were out of the Deviled Eggs (another item my friend and I were excited about ordering).  So just from the ordering process I was already disappointed and needed them to redeem themselves through mind blasting food.  Did not happen.  We ended up getting:Bone Marrow - not impressed by this dish at all and do not know why people are raving about it.  The bread that was used to smear the marrow on top of it, was the highlight of this dish. Tuna and Lima Beans - I have never had lima beans before and was surprised at how much flavor a bean can have just by the seasoning of it.  But this dish felt short when we tasted tuna that was not seasoned at all.  Chicken of the sea would make the tuna from this dish ashamed.  Pig's Ear - The biggest disappointment of the night next to the striking out fest we had during our ordering.  Both parties (communal seating; will explain below) sitting to the left and right of our table had ordered this so we made sure we ordered it.  I didn't see any items or ingredients that highlighted this dish.  It just did not work.  Too greasy.  Egg on top did not work well with the salad that came mixed with the pig's ear strips.Scallops and seared Aioli - This was probably the best dish we ordered during the night.  But it came towards the end of our meal, and we were probably excited about it as we couldn't see how anything could be worst that what we had already ordered.    -Seating-The seating at this place literally consists of 4 long dining tables (2 inside and 2 outside).  Each table seats around 8-10 depending on how much elbow room you are able to win between the people next to you.  I don't necessarily hate the idea of communal dining tables (as our night actually turned our better because of this as we had talked to everyone around us about the food and other restaurants in the area.  Shout out to our friend Carlos from Mexico), but communal seating did not mesh well with the style of this menu.  There was barely enough personal space to enjoy eating off your own dish, but all of the items on the menu were meant to be shared as they were tapas like dishes and just being seated in a communal table having to reach in the middle every 5-10 minutes made it very uncomfortable and did not complement what the owner of this place wanted. This place may have fell victim to the amount of hype I read about it in our local paper and other food websites and ""best list"".  Not sure if it is even date friendly.  If you have a group of friends in town that want to try the latest restaurant hype, definitely give it a try."
"Cheese, Swine, and Wine. The Purple Pig is a place that I will visit over and over. Tapas like style so ordering 2 dishes per person is enough to share with a group size of 6 people. (3 dish maybe if you are hungry.) Don't be scared to try new things! I had the opportunity to try bone marrow, (Thanks Natalie and Derrick) and fried pigs ear. Gracias Juliann. Fried pigs ear is now my favorite dish there. Why? its sliced thin and does not look like an ear, doesn't taste disgusting at all, and there's a fried egg on top. Fried egg people! Everything is good with fried eggs. One more quick tip. If you don't know what the hell some of the ingredients are, don't worry. Look up at the light on your table, there is a list of what they are. :) Enjoy!!"
"This restaurant was recommended to us and it was amazing. Kind of a cross between a tapas restaurant and fine fare establishment, the food was unbelievable. The atmosphere was busy but warm.We started with some nice wines, specifically the Gamay, a Sancerre, and then a Vinho Verde. We ordered the brussel sprouts, which were out of this world. We also ordered a charcuterie board with meats and cheeses, specifically a Gouda, cheddar, and Camembert. It came with a sweet mustard-based sauce that was nice as a drizzle with the bread and cheese.All of the cheeses were tasteful and mellow. The food just kept on coming based on our order.  Next, we had an order of grilled scallions and an overwhelmingly succulent pork chop. It was so good, I wanted to pick up the bone right there in the restaurant and get it all! A bit about the waitstaff - knowledgeable and encouraging. He explained some of the dishes but then he BEAUTIFULLY left us alone to savor and enjoy. He always came by at the right moments - like when we needed more wine or may have had a question. He was charming, friendly, and very good at his job.We were visitors from out of town, but not tourists. My partner went to the University of Chicago and I was there to see it all. Purple Pig will be on our destination list when we next return to Chicago!"
"This place is definitely not somewhere you want to go if you're in a hurry since the seating area is pretty small and they don't take reservations but it is absolutely worth the wait. Our waiter was great and basically ordered for us (the menu can be a little daunting) but we ended up with:Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - incredible goat cheese smear on bread that went really well with the eggplant relish Slow Roasted Ham, Scamorza Cheese, Pickled Portobello & Sundried Tomatoes - I didn't try this one because I don't eat red meat but my boyfriend claims it was ""the best panini in Chicago."" Take that as you will  Pan-Fried Skate Wing with Beets, Turnips, Mint & Blood Orange Balsamico - great white fish, the beets were fantastic Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli - Perfectly cooked scallops that went really well with the unexpected chickpeas Plus tons of wine (obviously) - I definitely recommend it and can't wait to come back when they open up the patio seating"
"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in the city. My favorite plate is the beets with goat cheese and pistachios, also liked the octopus and surprisingly liked the fried pigs ears which were unique and tasty. The staff is very knowledgable about the food and wine menu.The prices are very reasonable...especially considering the location. Only draw back is the crowds. Try to go at off peak times."
"Food is A+, but I've got to tell you the service, specifically at check in with the hostess is a mess.  Tragic.  If as much training went into service as it does the kitchen, this place would be a gem.  If tables are free, seat your guests.  You shouldn't need to hold the restaurant 1/3 empty, just to look like you are a hip spot.  We went on Saturday (4/20) and actually left because the hostess was too bothered to seat us at any of the dozen empty seats."
"It's an okay restaurant, but nothing special - I was definitely expecting more from this team.  Potato croquettes were fairly bland, the coppa was very disappointing, and the only hit of the meal was the pork saltimboca but even that was too salty and had room for improvement.  The wine choices and service at the bar were good but I definitely have no need for a return visit based on the food."
"Simply put: if there is a good and loving God, he will send me to spend eternity here, to feast on fried pig's ears, chorizo-stuffed olives, fried manchego, and the neckbone gravy for ever and ever. Amen."
"This restaurant would get 5 stars if I didn't wait two hours to sit in the tent outside and eat while we all froze with our coats on. But the food was so good it made none of that matter. The foie gras was worth a second order. The pork shoulder was absolutely delicious. Definitely will return, in the summer."
I went here the other night. I was suprised at how much I enjoyed it. Ordered 6 or 7 dishes and all were very good. The wine selection was decent and the server was somewhat knowledgeable.I will be returning.
"This is one of the best, hippest restaurants in Chicago. The wine list is deep, interesting, and, surprisingly well priced, by the glass 1/3 carafe half carafe and bottle for many vintages.  I asked the waitress to choose a couple for me.  I had two Riojas that I'd never tried before that were out of this world.  The food is tapas style. About five dishes make up a meal pretty well for two. The filet on the bone was exceptional, as was the Serrano ham and duck egg on the piece of toast.  You can get a cheese and cured meats plate, and more than a dozen other exotic combinations of this and that that were all tasty.  The deserts rock too.  Try the sandwiches with the bananas and Nutella. They were a wow. The only let-down in our sampling were the sardines. They were fried (not indicated on the menu) and the frying did not do them well. I would have preferred a bit more of the salad underneath and the delicacy of the sardine that wasn't toughened up by the frying.The Purple Pig is small, with big elevated family style tables and a healthy number of tables for two.  Two big purple umbrellas cover the front of their patio in the summer, which is where you should be.  The other part of the deck is line to get in. There you should not be. Come early (before 6) if you don't like waits in the summer. I'm not a Chicagoan so I can't say what works in the winter.The individual dishes are not badly priced, but together with the wines or the bar the evening can get a bit spendy.If you visit one restaurant while in town, depart from the traditional and head down Michigan Avenue just a couple of blocks before you get to the Wrigley building."
"The food could have been dipped in gold but we would never know. We went to put our name on the list 6pm we were told it would be an hour and 45 minute wait, we put our name on the list and found a place to have drinks for an hour and 15 minutes up the street, we went back and checked where we were on the list and was told it would be another 45 minutes and was told to go stand in a back hallway with about 30 other people. I'm sure there was a fire code being trampled on in that back hallway. But we ordered a bottle of wine and waited. Well, the wine gone and still no call, so we went to see where we were on the list again and the little restaurant was so crowed we barely made it to the host stand. The answer about another 45 minutes because people just aren't leaving. We decide that it was all ready 9 that we would be better off eating some where else. Trying to leave was so hard because of the amount of people crowding in to get on the wait list that you could no longer even see the tables around us. I had to ask people to trade place with me just to get out the door. It was horrible."
"Ate here recently on a business trip and my only complaint would be that they pack a lot of people into lot a lot of space with communal tables.  This can be tough since it's small shared plates.That's the extent of my whining...check that...the beer was also over priced.  Food was excellent.  For me the highlights were the beet salad, pigs ears, and the milk braised pork.  I need to find me a recipe for that one.I would definitely hit this place up again if in Chicago."
"When you come to a city like Chicago, you'd like to end up with a dining experience that you can talk about with the folks back home. Sorry ... deep dish pizza is not noteworthy. The Purple Pig is. Wine, cheese ... and pig ... done with style. The trendy spot just off Michigan Avenue, offers shared tables, eclectic selections, and shoulder to shoulder crowds. It's fun. Here are three things I like about the Pig: 1) Different Food: I tried the Chorizo stuffed olives (yum) but passed on the pig's ear and the bone marrow spread. There are lots of other adventuresome ... but not that adventuresome ... treats too. Prosciutto Bread Balls anyone? 2) Good Different Food: For all the adventure built into the menu, you don't have to be an over the top gourmand to eat here. 3) Energy: When the crowd presses into the compact but airy space, you are imersed in the talking, laughing and general carrying on. Its exactly the way you'd cast a boisterous crowd in a big city restaurant find. The flip side of all this is that there is likely to be a wait unless you arrive early. At least the experience should be worth the wait."
Great place n food but small. My favorite dishes are the roasted beet salad with goat cheese & the fried manchego cheese with membrillo. Love these two!
"Visited the place at 3 pm which should be slow time for restaurant but it's packed.  We waited for 10 minutes and be seated at the bar. I really enjoyed the vibe and it's menu. Wine list is quite reasonable, not too expensive, well selected. I order a kale salad and grilled pork with red pepper. I was delicious. I will go back for sure and possibly bring more friends."
"Cozy, busy place on Michigan Ave.  Great selection of wine, cheese and meat!"
"You get at it all at this place.  The location off Michigan, great trendy decor that was more fitting of one of the neighborhoods than downtown, interesting wine list (got a Croatian, yes Croatian, wine that had so much flavor) and oh yeah, the food.  It was delicious.  Small portions, priced that way, that allow you too have a diverse tasting."
"This is a cozy, tucked away little gem just off the Magnificent Mile. Their menu is unique and flavorful.  I would suggest trying everything from  the olive oil-poached tuna to the roasted bone marrow.  They even provide a glossary to help explain some of their uncommon ingredients on their menu. The staff is very friendly and helpful too.  Even the chef prepping salads was happy to share with us what she was making and what she recommended. Great outdoor dinning too!"
"Excellent---menu choices,portions,wine list,atmopshere and service all make for a really great meal. You will have a wait on the weekend but lots of shopping around the corner to do while waiting for your table."
"Warning this place gets very crowded! Luckily, my date and I were able to get a table ASAP! Poor guy he assumed there would be burgers with a name such as the Purple Pig..yep no! The food was pretty good...loved the chorizo stuffed fried olives! I would recommend ordering 2 small plates per a person, the waiter said 3 or 4 but that's just way too much! Their salami paninni was amazing as well. Pass on the pig ear. It tasted exactly like calamari just without the marinara. The service was okay, the food came out at different times instead of at once. Overall, nice place and good food."
"wow. worth the 45 minute wait. we were totally starved but got some drinks outside while the delicious smell of food wafted all around us. finally got seated, shared a table with other patrons, and ordered dishes that i never thought i would like - which im glad we did! we got the roasted corn/walnuts antipasti, fried pig's ear with kale, pork neck bone gravy smear, manila clams, fried potatoes with sheep feta sauce, and octopus with green beans. i was initially skeptical that we'd be satisfied with such small portions, but for three people, these six dishes were more than enough! the flavors were amazing and the food was so tasty!! i was so surprised how well everything was cooked - im not huge on seafood and this was probably the first time i actually enjoyed the clams and octopus. they were seasoned really well and the octopus was sooo tender it didn't even taste like octopus! i highly, highly recommend the fried pig's ear with kale - favorite dish hands down.i will be coming back. the patrons next to us had the most tender-looking turkey leg ever.. yummmmmmmmm. yes, this warrants another visit."
"Fabulous atmosphere, incredibly busy, spectacular snout to hoof food.Wine list is expansive, yet approachable, lots of whites which i was surprised at...most restaurants pass by so many good ones and concentrate on reds.  Spectacular selection of rose available for summer days.Pork shoulder tenderized by soaking in milk... absolutely fork tender and fabulous flavor.Octopus with haricot vert and potatoes, delicious but a little salty.The meatballs were yummy. Don't be scared that they are a pinkish color, they are fully cooked.  THE best though, was the neck bone gravy (just like grandma makes) served with some delicious bread.  Absolutely a warm your heart dish.The atmosphere is really cool, very nicely put together, and apparently the restrooms are kind of crazy..check it out.  I will say that it does get super loud in there, and loud music doesn't help that, but its party of the enoteca atmosphere.We had the pleasure of sitting right in front of the kitchen where Chef was doing his thing, and even had some words with him, super nice guy.Bravo!"
"Since I was in town on business, I just went solo and sat at the counter.   I wanted as much as possible, so I stayed away from the spreads and large platters.I stuck with one antipasti (fresh raw corn right off the cob made into a salad) and 3 ""a la Planchas"" - pig tail in balsamic, pork jowl with a fried duck egg on top, and pork sweetbreads with fennel and an apricot jam.  For dessert, I loosened my belt and had soft serve with something awesome on it... but I can't quite remember what.The service by the counter was very attentive.  The waitress was incredibly helpful and took the time to go over the best menu options with me according to my preferences.  She was honest about particular dishes and didn't just try to give me the ""they're all great"" approach.  Also, she would bring me wine tastings before each course to help me narrow down my options.I would love to go back with a big group and really get to try as much as possible.  However, even on a lonely business trip, this was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had."
"CHEESE, SWINE & WINE!!!!!!!!!i take words like these all in the same breath seriously and OH THEY DID NOT FAIL TO DISAPPOINT!from Marrow to pig's ears (its good. my husband was apprehensive but he ate a lot of it. it does not look like pigs ears as it is sliced thin and fried to crispy perfection. not gummy, not gelatinous, just way good to chomp with your wine)everything we had in here is excellent and the prices for the food and the service cant be beat! yes, drink wine! although we did not eat cheese (had to save space for swine! haha) it was an experience that i will hold dearly and very close to my forever craving heart.ah, i wanna go to chicago again!flickr.com/photos/janjan…"
"Took my girlfriend here for dinner while we were in Chicago for her birthday.  Portions are 'small' compared to other restaurants as it is tapas style, but each dish was simply orgasmic. Naturally, based on the name, the restaurant centers on swine, but their seafood dishes are equally high caliber. Perfectly seared salmon on a bed of blueberries, a flavorful squid ceviche-style, nothing disappointed. Service was great, with our very knowledgeable waitress who was able to give us several recommendations for my indecisive girlfriend =)While the place is no Montreal Au Pied de Cochon (drool), and the focus again, is on smaller tapas dishes, Purple Pig stands a worthy second on my list of swine eateries. Or swineries. :)"
"Small dishes at a reasonable price considering the high quality & great flavors. Haven't ordered anything bad here yet. Great for brunch, lunch, and late night eats. Nice feel with all the wood and communal bar tables (there are small separate tables, too). It's a socializing kinda place, so don't go if you expect quiet and privacy.Favorites: Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Smear (the bread is SO good!); Coppa; Affogato."
"Excellent food. Crazy busy with communal tables, so expect to be asked about what you are eating. The bone marrow is very good and sure to get comments."
Awesome comfort food....  They open at 11:30 AM on the weekends & I would suggest getting there at least 20 minutes before they open.  A typical wait is 1 1/2 hours in the early afternoon......still worth it if you are really hungry.....
"How could you pass up a place called The Purple Pig when the phrase to describe the food is ""Cheese, Wine, and Swine"" and not stop in?!?!We started with a Pinot Grigio for our luncheon on our first day in Chicago as a mini vacation prior to a wedding this weekend. Wine list was very nice and they were fairly priced (I am used to NYC where you really have to search for the deals).To start we had the charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichones (really?!?!) and parsley. To my surprise the briny little pickle slices added a pleasant twang to the flavor.  We love roasting cauliflower at home so this was a must for us to try. We also love beets and goat cheese but missed out to order it. I must have missed it because I was busy trying to convince myself to try the Lingua Agradolce (cured tongue slices).  We have never tried tongue so this would be a first step in broadening my palate. Our cured meat plate included Coppa - both made in house. They were both delicious, I only wished we had more slices of them to enjoy. Our next two plates were the ""Chicken Thigh kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki"", and ""Jamon Serrano w/Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Egg over Grilled Bread"".  The chicken thighs were cooked to perfection. They had a small piece of crispy skin on each piece which I didn't expect.  Tzatziki goes with anything so it paired nicely. The Jamon and Mushroom were good and even better for me because my wife does eat eggs which allowed me to enjoy an entire duck egg with my half of the sandwich.We ended the meal with an assortment of five cheeses which I paired with a bottle of cider beer... Great choice with the cheese by the way. All the cheese was awesome. Also, for this thirty something year old the music was fantastic.  Our service was great (especially our server, Jill) and they made sure to get us a table with room for a baby stroller.  I will always remember eating here with my cousin and her daughter - my first meal with my closest cousin as a mother."
"This place deserves all the hype - I ordered way too much food for me and a friend when we headed here for lunch one day right when it opened so we could avoid any wait (in December - woops, sorry!). We only paid about $25 per person (decided not to drink at lunch). For some reason I have a harder time writing reviews of my favorite places compared to those that I'm less satisfied with.All of the food I loved with the exception of one dish: braised artichokes - but I'm OK with that. When they saw that we weren't eating our 'healthier' option - our server kindly asked us if we had enjoyed the dish. I'm honest -and said that it wasn't really what I had been expecting (one reason- it was cold and I was expecting warm), and The Purple Pig comped it for us. That's true service - especially because we hadn't been ordering drinks and our bill wasn't too high to begin with!All of the other food we loved: Brussels sprouts, bone marrow smear (brought extra toast points when they saw we were running low), chorizo stuffed, fried olives (love love these), and my favorite pick - the ham, egg, and mushrooms over toast. We wanted to try more dishes since the menu is so extensive but already had too much food on our table.Make sure you bring people who enjoy trying different dishes- I know for a fact I'll be back again for the great service, prices, and atmosphere. It's also very easy to access since you know you'll be shopping on Michigan Ave anyways."
Was visiting Chicago and came across this restaurant and boy what a find. I had the Confit Turkey Leg and it as delicious. A must have.
"Atmosphere is fun. We came here for lunch and were not disappointed. The turkey leg was fall off the bone good, huge too! Also had a meatball slider. It was ok. The cheese platter was tops and they didn't skimp on it like some other establishments in the area.  It's worth checking it out for yourself."
"Nestled in the super touristy Miracle Mile in downtown Chicago, The Purple Pig was a pleasant surprise.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating -- the atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a small neighborhood and not in the bustling part of the city.It's best to go with more people so you can try more of the dishes!  We tried a couple of the veggie dishes, bone marrow, pork shoulder, cheeses, some wine, etc.  All delicious and served at a good pace so we weren't served everything at once.  Will definitely visit again when I'm in Chicago and highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for unique pork dishes. :)"
"My first lunch during my first (of many) vacation to Chicago. What a delightful choice!!! Slightly off to the side of Michigan Avenue lies The Purple Pig. I came on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy. We got seats right away... also it was pouring outside. So maybe that's why people didn't venture in. The waitress was very hospitable and she had such wonderful suggestions as to what to eat and what to drink.THE ROASTED BONE MARROW is to die for! I have never tried such a dish and I am so glad that I did at PURPLE PIG! Two delightful bones came with capers, herbs and sea salt. Smear that bone marrow on the crispy, buttery bread... sprinkle some sea salt and top it with capers! HEAVEN! SERIOUSLY! HEAVEN!I tried to go there two more times during my visit, but the wait was CRAZY! I went during dinner time. The wait was about an hour to an hour and a half. Sad to say, I wasn't able to get my last fix of bone marrow.(The other stuff was good too but the bone marrow was good. Try the CRISPY PIG EARS WITH KALE. My second favorite dish)The pricing was reasonable too. PLUS!"
"I should've reviewed this place after I ate there, but I never got around to it.  The reason I'm giving them a review now is that I've come to realize that they're the standard at which I hold pretentious restaurants to.  Most times when I eat at a restaurant that is trying to ""be something,"" I come out wishing that I had just gone and gotten tacos somewhere instead.  This wasn't one of those places and was overall a great experience.Is this restaurant a little bit pretentious? Yes, but they can also back it up (See ""Ego"" by Beyonce).  They have a unique menu and everything tastes awesome.  I would definitely like to try more things on their menu someday."
"I'd say this was a 4 star restaurant though I had a 3.5 star experience. Good wine selection and good food selection, but I'd recommend tryin some of the stuff others have recommended. We went a little off the beaten track and didn't like all of the stuff we ordered. Some were GREAT. Others were just Meh. I can't remember now what we got but it's an uber trendy joint, and I'd recommend to try. Does get a little loud. Very unique dishes and some are executed very well. Can't go wrong with that!"
"I really enjoyed eating here.  It really reminded me of meals I enjoy from Cali.  This place is a great tapas joint and you can tell the local people enjoyed it too. We got recommendations from the Sommelier and our waitress on what to order cause everything just sounded good.We started off with their Antipasti of Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette.  I love beets and just loved the combination with the goat cheese and crunch from pistachio.  We then ordered a Salad-special for the day but can't really remember what was in it but it had radicchio, some nuts, etc.  The dressing was what I remembered that it tasted very asian/thai like.  It was really good and enjoyed it very much.We also order two Smears, a Pork Liver Pate and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs.  Wow is all I have to say!  I would have been okay having the pork liver pate as my meal.  It was so good and just was amazing in taste.  Doll it up on crostinis and my smile was ear to ear.  This lasted us throughout our whole meal and what they give you is a great portion.  We had to order extra sides of crostinis cause we could not just waste it.    The roasted bone marrow was also great and was very butter like in taste, melt in your mouth.  The herbs help cut the richness and was different from how I usually have marrow.We then order from the a la Plancha section and ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey.  My hubby and I regret ordering two items from this section as we were just getting full.  The pork shoulder was very different and great but just didn't really enjoy it as much as the pork blade steak.  This steak was good and the touch of honey was a nice touch of sweetness.  It was a great portion too and is a great portion for two.  Hubby and I washed this down with a bottle of Wine from Spain- Malbec.  The whole bottle was a great price for about $35.00.  The Malbec in the beginning had a great taste but as you eat your meals and the wine airs out, the wine changes and get bolder with the meals.  Really went well with the food.You would think we were full and we were but we really wanted to dessert that was nice and light to cut the richness of the meal we just had.  We ordered their homemade Soft Serve Ice Cream {Vanilla with a touch of honey}-special for the day.  It was just great and the honey was a nice touch.  Hubby washed this down with limoncello.  Chicago definitely has great restaurants and really was not expecting this. This is also one of the best tapas place I had a great meal.   I am so excited to return and for food I will.  All this meals our tab was $114 dollars.  This was a steal.  I just wished I had friends to help me eat all of this food.  To the owner of purple pig, bring this restaurant to Cali....seriously!"
"food was very good but salty, service was great.  But I to dock them a couple stars for the seating and hard core rap and hip hop music they played at a high volume.  Made it kind of hard to talk.  Tables are too close."
"Oh, boy. The famous Purple Pig I've been hearing from all my friends who've visited Chicago. I came here last week as a means to procrastinate from doing work for grad school with a friend. We jumped on the Northwestern intercampus shuttle and walked about 5 blocks to get here -- the fact that it's so convenient is bad for my wallet.The ambiance:Jeeze, was this place packed at 7:30pm. We walked our way into the restaurant, which was a feat in itself since everyone was outside socializing and drinking wine, and was a bit difficult to traverse without being rude. Once inside, we waited a few minutes for a small booth to open up -- seeing as how busy the Purple Pig was, I was surprised we got one so promptly. This is a mix of tourists, yuppies, and older couples from what I could tell. Everyone was having quite a time, and it reflected in the amount of alcohol being ordered and the never-ending ruckus of laughter. Perhaps not a great place to go on a formal date ... you'll have a hard time hearing each other. For a nice dinner with a friend or a party, this would be awesome, though.The food:Tapas tapas tapas. I quite enjoy any eating establishment that encourages small plates and/or sharing. I'm not shy about the amount of food I eat, so I pretty much ordered 6 dishes and my friend was just stuck with my choices. As with every other Tapas place, I always start with marinated olives to pique my appetite. The olives here were nice, but we honestly got too many green olives and not much else -- perhaps 75% of the small bowl was green. We ordered the carrot and fig salad ... what can I say? Salad is always forgettable when you're eating this much meat-centric food. Pig ears were great: excellently crispy, salty, and topped atop yummy kale/chard. We split a salami and goat cheese panini -- maybe paninis aren't the best choice at a Tapas Bar, but we weren't sure if the other plates would fill us up, so we went with a more filling choice. It was decent, but the sandwich was carried by the goat cheese -- the salami felt a little rubbery and had a tendency to fall out of the sandwich when pulling it from your teeth. The morcilla was perhaps my favorite plate. Blood sausage is one of my favorite foods in the world and this place was no exception; their take was very different from the typical Argentine-style morcilla I get, which is richer and plumper -- here it comes out more like smoked and pan-fried chorizo. A nice variant from my usual. Lastly, we split an order of mussels. The creme broth it was braised and cooked in was divine; if that could be ordered as a simple soup, I would probably have gone with that. The mussels were hit-and-miss: some perfectly cooked, some slightly over.The drinks:I ordered two Old Fashioned cocktails and my friend ordered some Bailey's espresso cocktail that was made especially for her. My two drinks were on the generous side of the alcohol (typically I prefer this), but the strength of the Bourbon was really taking a toll on my ability to taste some of the subtleties of the food. I'll just go with a lighter wine the next time I'm here.The service:It was a busy night and we had a sweet girl as a waitress. I realized it was busy, so I don't want to reflect the relatively slow service since I can understand how difficult it is to take and bring out orders when it's hard enough just to walk through crowds to get to the bathroom, much less with plates in your hand.All in all, I'm a huge fan. We came out extremely full and adequately buzzed for a little less than $90 after tip, which was a lot less than we expected for that quality of food. If any of my friends decide to visit Chicago, this is almost certainly a must-eat spot."
"Just got back from a late dinner here.  My cousin and I are in town from CA for work and this place on yelp sounded just perfect!  Incredibly busy for a Weds night. We showed up around 8 (they don't take reservations) and still had a 45 minute wait.  You can order drinks while waiting however which is nice. Food is SO good! Great service too. Really eclectic menu of small plates. Roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios was delicious.  Lots of crispy pork parts. I don't usually order chicken out but the chicken thigh kabobs with smashed potatoes and tzatziki sauce was a delicious reason to break that rule. Prices are reasonable.  Large and interesting European wine selection from all over.  Only reason I didn't give them a 5 is that I spent 15 -20 minutes of my wait attending to an ill patron while waiting for the paramedics to come.  I did appreciate the staff's thank yous for my assistance but I think a glass of wine or dessert on the house would have been an even nicer gesture.  Maybe I'm just old fashioned. However, this is an excellent place to come for an interesting, eclectic, fresh and vibrant dinner. Fun atmosphere, great energy, delicious food."
"Deep fried pig everything. Cannot taste anything, but crunchy and salty. Disappointed. Will not go again."
"Damn, well, just wow. Vegans be damned (you know who you are!). This was my first time here, and despite the mixed the reviews I'd heard from friends, I was highly impressed.  First off, the service was excellent, we were treated very well, our waiter kept us entertained and informed. We were also moved to a better location before we'd even asked (we sat outside and the wind was whipping the tent flaps just behind us very noisily).  So props to them for making sure the customers were happy.For the food, we had a lot of swine (and some tuna), and all of it was excellent (except of course for the bit with the onions on top, I opted out of that bit...).  The menu didn't mention onions, and I didn't ask for no onions, so this is a minor faux paus on my part.  Still, all in all, for a quick stop for dinner after St. Patty's day, not a bad place to stop, and enjoy some decadence.  I'll definitely go back."
"Who can exist a place named after a purple pig come on especially for a person who loves anything purple!! Found this place through a friend what a cute little cozy place that serves up a fine fare. This is where I had my first experience with bone marrow dip. Not that big of a fan of the marrow but love the rustic presentation. I would recommend getting the squid appetizer, pork rilette, grilled chicken skewers. Of course don't forget the wine. This place is perfect to bring a girlfriend to whine and dine and share small tapas style bites. Would love to find something similar back home. The pork rilette is like a pate style spread served with warm brioche and a sweet pepper jam. The perfect marriage of salty and a touch of sweet from the red pepper. The squid was grilled to perfection just the right amount of bite and the herb sauce went perfect with the roasted potatoes that came with it.Tip:not good for groups at most 4 is perfect to share and try everything. The food can be a little bit on the heavy side since they serve mainly anything pork. So come with an empty stomach."
"Last night on a whim, after work, my wife and I walked from my office to Purple Pig to get a glass of wine or beer and a couple small plates to share. We were so close to PP and it had been a while since we've been it was hard to just hop in the car and go home to making fish tacos or pasta. I forgot how much I loved this place and once and for all declared last night that Purple Pig is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It just is. I haven't found a place in the City that combines exceptional service, tremendous food and drink and inviting atmosphere like PP has. Last night was no exception as our server was fantastic and attentive but not overbearing. She immediately noticed that we were getting low on the wonderfully toasted bread for our pork neck gravy and our mussels and had some more sent out. She said to us we would need more bread to soak up the milky and spicy broth goodness of the mussels cooked with pancetta. The runners and the bus boy also recognized when we needed new plates and silverware and brought those out.I have not had a bad dish at PP and one of the best things is the pork neck gravy. I don't know what else to say besides there are few things that taste as good. Thin shreds of pork neck submerged in a fantastic tomato sauce with perfectly creamy ricotta. Heaping spoonfuls go on very very tasty and crisp slices of bread and you are in heaven.PP also has a great wine selection from around the world by the glass, half bottle or bottle. They also have a great selection of spirits and cocktails and a small but diverse beer selection.I really love the atmosphere at PP as well. There are a lot of communal tables and small 2 tops and the space is rather small and sometimes you feel you are on top of each other, but I really don't mind this at a place like PP. It just adds to the atmosphere and lends to the enjoyment you have while dining here. The atmosphere is all part of the experience and just seems to make the food taste better. It's a lively joint where you end of talking to your neighbors.I don't believe PP takes reservations but I haven't checked with them in a while. Sometimes they will make a special exception.""Cheese, swine, and wine"" is a true summary of what PP is. The selection of dishes, drinks, service and atmosphere is unmatched by anywhere in the City."
"I had a late dinner at The Purple Pig on a Saturday night. I said ""late"", because the wait for a table was 2-1/2 hours! The food and wine were good, but not incroyable like the nourritures and vin at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal. The pig's ears, jowls and sweetbreads were all delicious. More than anything, I really appreciate the uniqueness and availability of the items on the menu. It's rare that you'd find them anywhere else. There are so many appealing dishes on the menu that I'll have to go back. When I do, however, I'll be more strategic and put my name in for a table well ahead of the time I want to eat."
Loved it .  Went on a saturday about 5:00pm less than 1hour wait.  Food was amazing . Can't wait to go back so many more plates i want to try.
"I love this place! I go here every time I am in Chicago and it is always perfect. They specialize in cheese, wine and swine - life is good!!They have these fresh roasted beets with creamy goat cheese and pistachios on it that make me dream of these beets all the time. I swear they are addictive. Then the fresh cured meats and cheese and little toasts - there is not one thing on the menu that I hate! I love it all!!!!"
"Fantastic meal! Small dishes can sometimes leave me wanting more but we did 2.5 dishes each and were stuffed.  The portions are large for small plates. The highlights were the milk braised pork shoulder and the beet salad(which I'll attempt to duplicate at home).  Skip the mussels, they were good but save room for the incredible here.  We decided on the fois gras instead of the bone marrow and while it was excellent, next time I'll try the marrow.  We got here on a Sunday at 11:30 and were seated right away .  I also got the lemon panna cotta for dessert which was a deliciously perfect ending to our glutinous lunch."
I was visiting from out of town and heard about this place from a few people. The place is awesome...good food. Our waitress (Heather) was super friendly and nice! My fav was the butter squash
"My husband and I visited Chicago New Years Eve weekend.  We traveled with our 2 year old son which made restaurant choices difficult.  Somehow this restaurant caught our eye.  We walked in and they welcomed us right away.  Although the place isn't exactly a ""child"" restaurant, they did not make us feel out of place.  The food was delish.  The wine choices were good. If I lived in Chicago I would visit this place over and over."
"I have been trying to come here for a while and I am so happy that I finally got to go. This was much more than a meal. This was a culinary experience.My only complaint was that a lot of the items on the menu had sold out before we got there. I guess they had a really busy Saturday night.The best items we had were the braised pork shoulder, the octopus, and the bone marrow. These are all items that you must have.The soft serve pistachio ice cream was a great way to finish off a total masterpiece of a meal. It's not cheap but I feel like you get your moneys worth.This is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. GO NOW!"
"If I had more time to enjoy my meal or if I had the opportunity to return this could turn into a 5 star review. I was staying at the intercontinental right across the street and refused to eat convention food for my last meal in Chicago. I hopped out for lunch and grabbed a seat at the bar at The Purple Pig. First of all, the service is great- friendly and accommodating. They have a large selection of drinks (but as I was all alcohol'd out and still on the clock, I opted out). I ended up ordering the whipped feta with cucumbers to start my meal. It was, to quote another review I read right before ordering, light, refreshing and delicious! It's also large enough to share and they'll gladly bring over more bread to dollop this spread onto. For my entree, I went for the milk braised pork shoulder with mash and this too was a hit. The pork was so incredibly tender and mixed with the mash and gravy sauce made for a satisfying meal. My total came out to $27 including tip and worth every penny. If I'm ever back in the area I'd go out of my way to snag a meal here."
"I went here with my fiance and his mom when she was in town. There was an hour wait but we just left our name and they took our cell phone number down.The food was amazing! I love tapas style and everything we had was good. I liked the broccoli and milk braised pork shoulder the best. The main thing that was negative was the atmosphere! We waited over an hour and then when we got there our table wasnt ready even though they called.. So we waited another 20 minutes. Then they sat us outside.. Keep in mind, it's like 20 degrees outside! They had a tent with heat lamps but it was not enough. We ate dinner outside with our coats still on. It was crowded and there was no room to get in or out of our seats."
"Finally, worthwhile hype! I hoped to love The Purple Pig and wasn't disappointed. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch the week after Christmas around 2:30-3:00, and the place was jumping, very crowded, but we were seated right away. It's a really small space and I can't imagine waiting on a busy week or weekend night, especially in the winter when it's too cold to stand outside, but, it's such a cozy and inviting place that I can't imagine that I'd mind. I guess I'll just have to go back and find out. Our waiter explained the menu, expect for the part that the deviled eggs were only available at dinner (BIG SOB), and we proceeded to order everything on the menu. Well, not quite, but we did have quite a lot. We had the Lardo Crostini, White Bait ""French Fries of the Sea"" with Lemon Aioli, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Chorizo Stuffed Olives, and, an a la Plancha that was a special of the day, greek sausage. In addition, we had the Truffle Tremor and the Quadrello di Bufala, and yes, we were starving when we got there. Everything was delicious, well-prepared, beautifully presented, and absolutely divinely tasty. My favorite was the roasted bone marrow, which I could have eaten more of. I was tempted to pick up a bone and scoop out any remaining marrow with my finger (or tongue) but didn't want to scare the people sitting next to us. Their wine selection is fantastic, although we stuck with beer. I'll definitely do some pairings on my next visit, which will be soon. As if the experience wasn't perfect from the food alone, the service? Phenomenal! Our waiter was so nice, so pleasant, so helpful, yet without being the least bit hover-y. The best part of the day: I had a horrible attack of raging allergies that day, complete with sneezing, red & watery eyes, coughing, sneezing, stuffy nose, did I mention sneezing? Because I was, about every 2 minutes, which was scaring the bejesus out of the couple next to us, or it was until I assured them it was allergies and not Ebola. Our waiter brought me a HUGE pile of bar napkins for my sniffles, and the host brought me a box of kleenex..love them!! Such thoughtfulness goes a long way with me, and it made our experience 10x better."
AMAZING! Four stars instead of five only because we had to wait 2 hours for a 5 person table on a Wednesday night.
"I am a fan of game and the Pig has it in spades. The wait can be a tad painful and the seating is a little cramped, but the unique food experience is worth it.  We tried a few different dishes and just shared them.  Best way to go.  Bone marrow? Yum!  I feel like this place is better for a small group of people or a double date vs. an intimate first date as it can be crazy busy and somewhat overwhelming.  P.S.- Our server sucked... I've never seen someone so freakin' out of it.  But since I was with a great group of people we were able to look past it and not let it blow our experience. Just be prepared for a little chaos. But it's worth it."
"Yuck! I could see how some may like the wine and cheese, but the famous bone marrow was tasteless. Mussels were the best, but why do they serve greasy toast with every order. Definitely request normal bread instead. We left there feeling nasty."
"Good service at lunch. Nice presentation. Unusual foods.Be aware that it is VERY loud and tables very close, it's like you're eating with the people next to you. Can be fun if you are in the mood for that, but not so great if you want to actually speak with the person you are with."
"Yay! I love the Purple Pig! I hate pork, for the most part, so I was a little skeptical about coming here at first.  But I have to say, absolutely everything I ate was amazing!! It was perfect for a nice lunch with a friend where we were able to share 4 different items. We ordered fried brussel sprouts which were not at all what I expected, tangy, crunchy, and overall amazing.  I also highly recommend the Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta smear. I'm not sure what's in it but my mouth is watering right now thinking about it. And don't leave the Purple Pig without trying the Sicilian Iris, their amazing donut-filled dessert, it was like a piece of heaven in my mouth.  If I could go back and change anything I would not have shared the Sicilian Iris but rather would have gotten a whole one for myself."
"So much good food here! The butternut squash arancini balls and the quail with pomegranates and salsify would be my favorites here, but also fantastic are the burrata (with mushrooms and balsamic vinegar), the crispy kale with pig's ear, the bone marrow (the coarse salt is a great addition), and the milk-braised pork shoulder.I would recommend getting the charcuterie and cheese platter over the Pig Platter (only meat). The latter was just a little too...piggy...for me."
"Happened to be heading to lunch to another establishment today when we stumbled across The Purple Pig! We decided to see if we could get in, as it's sometimes hard to get a reservation. Seeing it was a Tuesday around lunchtime, we were seated very promptly.  We sat community style, which was fun, and we weren't crowded.   Although we were in the covered patio, it was still pretty warm with the heaters, and the staff graciously turned the heat down for us. The service was impeccable- our server was knowledgable, friendly, and made some fabulous recommendations.  Four of us girls got to taste and sample a variety of the menu, and our palates were very pleased!  Highly recommend trying it out (and go outside of your comfort zone, as I did:)"
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. If you get there at the right time (like 5pm ish) the wait isn't too crazy. Best thing on the menu is the egg plant smear! Everything pork is great too! The fried brioche is the perfect dessert.
"Sirloin (medium..the way it comes) and milk braised pork shoulders... It is to die for. The food here is unbelievably good. The night before I had dinner here, I ate at a highly recommended place from James Beard called ""The girl and the Goat"" and that was no better than ""The purple pig"" and I paid about half the price. And our waitress Gil and Heather are super cool. I'm coming back. Maybe tomorrow."
"Always loud, always busy, always fun. I come here a lot with industry friends. The wine list is superb - even the random Croatian red. We always order a bunch of dishes and nosh away. Some of the ones I've particularly enjoyed: - calamari and fregola- grilled green onions with romesco- all the panini- BONE MARROW (although Gilt Bar's is better)- Nutella panini -- yes. yes. yes.- the fried donut thing filled with ricotta and chocolate. Nom nom nom. The meat eaters I tend to roll with like the turkey leg and the milk-braised pork. (Yes bone marrow is technically animal. I know). Service is as quick as it can be with so many people and so little space. They're always sweet and fun and well-informed!"
WOW!What a treat. I must say my expectations were pretty low considering that this restaurant is on MIchigan Ave. I ended up being very impressed with my meal. Please try the pork shoulder and the toasted almonds and garlic.  This is my new brunch/lunch place in the city.
They don't take reservation so we tried to go there twice.  1st attempt - told a 2.5 hour wait.  2nd attempt - 30min wait so we did wait.Love almost everything we ate.  Small tapas portion Must order pork blade!!  most fav dish there.milk braised pork shoulderfried pig ear
"I can't say enough good things about The Purple Pig! One of my favorite spots in the city and great any time of the day. The tapas style menu lets you try a bunch of different things and the portion size allows you enjoy more than the standard 1 bite per person. There menu is very seasonal so there is always something new to try. A few of my favorites include the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki, but seriously everything is amazing!"
"Was not impressed. Went there excited with some friends based on the 1000+ really good reviews and from hearing about it from friends. When we got there, there wasn't a wait which was nice. After we were seated, our service went downhill. Service was slow and the food was disappointing. The fried pig ears were too salty and mostly breading. We tried a caesar salad with a sardines and quail egg which would've been ok if the dressing wasn't drowning the entire salad. the sardine was house cured and was pretty good, but wasn't enough to make our experience any better. After a dish was completely forgotten, we gave up and asked for the check. Our total was about $24 plus some change. My friend put down $40 and the exact change. The waitress opened up the check and saw the $40 and asked if we needed change. Does that mean she thinks she deserves a $16 tip for a $24 meal?? She saw that my friend left change and said that they don't accept change and that she would round down. When she finally came back with the change (I couldn't understand why everything took so long since it wasn't very busy), she had rounded up.I had an overall great experience with the Chicago restaurant scene but The Purple Pig really stuck out to me as less than stellar."
"I went here after the great reviews on yelp and the mention on Eater.com. I was kind of underwhelmed. The food was fair to fine, but maybe I just didn't order the right things?1) Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette:  The addition of pistachio gave a crunchy texture which enhanced the dish. We appreciated that the serving dish was rubbed with goat cheese, so it was everywhere already and we didn't have to take the time to spread it ourselves. 2) Chorizo Stuffed Olives. I was most excited about these. They were breaded and fried. I have no idea how they get the breading to stick to the olive, but whatever. These were flavorful bites!3) Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda. I was mixed on this. There was a LOT of rillette for the serving. I felt bad for wasting it, but we really couldn't eat the whole jar. I appreciated the flake salt and the well toasted bread. It was tasty, but nothing I'd go home dreaming about. 4) Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic. This was very good. The tail meat was very tender and fell off the bone easily. You must love balsamic, though, to handle this dish. We had great service, but I left feeling ""meh"" about it all. It was good, but not, as my friend would say, ""slap your momma good."""
"In Chi Town on business and found this place on Yelp. Seated right away as I was dining solo but it was very busy for Thursday night at 9:00. Started with braised baby artichokes my GREAT server recommended. VERY GOOD although could have used a little more salt on the potatoes.  Next came the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (also suggested by my GREAT server Darma). First bite = flavor explosion. Perhaps a little too much salt on this one but delicious!!!Still a little hungry (big apatite not small portions) so I ordered fried manchego with membrillo. Unique as I have never eaten Quince but it was not outstanding...  Good but not great..Last but certainly not least was a dessert they call the Iris.... SOOOOO delicious!!  Get it even if you think you can't fit another thing in your stomach. Well worth the pain and calories!!!  YUM!!Overall exceptional place!  Fun, friendly great food/wine and phenomenal service!! Thank you Darma and the purple pig...  I shall return!"
"This place was sooo much fun and great!  If only they took reservations...it would be perfect.  It is in a very very small space.  There are a lot of tables and a lot of people filling those tables.  In the center there is a long table where you may some strangers sharing their table.  This is NOT a good date place...but good for small groups.  But beware it is very loud.The food was amazing!!!  Note:  This is more of place where you share...everything is small plates.  So if you are bad at sharing, do not come here.  Now getting back to the food...I can't remember everything that we had.  But there was eggplant smear with toasted bread and goat cheese.....by far my favorite thing on the menu.  The eggplant was not over-seasoned and marinated to perfection.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about it.  We also had some type of pork dish and the meat just melted in your mouth...it was cooked to perfection!!"
"The Pig is a must go to in Chicago. Just North of the River on Michigan St. Walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel.  While the space is small and packed with people. The Chicago vibe and food are worth the experience. Small plates and MANY choices. ALL are good. Pork shoulder is a MUST. Great wine list as well. A complete package and the bill won't hit you as much as expected. If you visit Chicago, GO!"
"I really loved Purple pig!   All the meat that came out was tender and moist! If I got back to chi-town, I would love to go back to try different variations of the food they have here."
Don't know what else I can say about this place that hasn't been said.  Get the Pig Platter.  Get all the cheeses you can.  Loosen your belt.
"Loved this place. Went here with some friends for my birthday and it met all expectations from the cozy/comfortable/sofiaticatedly-casual atmosphere to the food, it was wonderful. I wish I remembered our servers name bc she was great, very knowledgeable and made some good recommendations. My favorites that we ordered were the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, the butternut squash and the fried brussel sprouts. I will definitely be returning"
"It was my 3rd date with this guy, and we are both into food, especially pork so we really wanted to try this place. The wait was surprisingly not that bad. We were able to order wine while we waited, and so many people were scared off by the hostess's ""hour wait"", that it ended up being about 30 minutes. We had never been inside the restaurant, so we were kind of shocked when they sat us at a large communal table with several other couples. This would have been fine, but the table was so wide that since we were sitting across from each other in the middle of the table, we couldn't hear each other talk! This maybe is ok for friends, or even a couple who had been together for years, but it totally ruined our early-on date. Most of our date was spent either yelling something and saying ""what?"" back, or overhearing all of our neighbors' inane conversations.The food was good, I highly recommend the pig ears - but really how can you go wrong with fried pork bits. It was so crowded that our order got mixed up with the people next to us so we were accidentally given their pate (which we ended up loving, so thank you random couple). The server was apologetic and kept it off our bill, which was great. Wine list was a bit overwhelming (and the server had no clue about wine to offer suggestions), but if you pick a region and stick with it, you'll find some good gems in there. I do agree with the other reviewers that the timing of the plates coming out is off - sometimes too rushed, sometimes a huge wait - and they really try to rush you out of there, but we were so anxious not being able to talk that we were alright with them hurrying us through our awkward date.All in all, I would say if you're going to try this place with one other person, ask to sit on the end of the table so you can have a conversation... or just try somewhere with a better atmosphere. Food was good, but nothing that really floored me. Very similar style menu to Girl and the Goat, which I wasn't really a fan of either. I'm glad I tried this place, but doubt I'd go again."
"This place has been on my radar for a while, just don't get downtown as much as I'd like. Well, this weekend while at a three-day seminar, my wife called and said she and her friends were headed to the Purple Pig.  Just happened to match up with our dinner break on Saturday and with my head full of copyright, usage rights and digital archive management, I needed to allow my brain to cool off.Well, The Purple Pig was good for the gastronomic break, but with so many awesome dishes on the menu, I'm not sure my brain really got itsmuch needed rest. Still in my workshop hangover, so I'll dumb down the descriptions, the meatball slider was insanely awesome, the fried chorizo stuffed olives... a salty, crunchy goodness. The pickled beets with goat cheese and pistachio vinagrette... Yum-O! Everybody loved all their dishes, the service was outstanding (didn't hurt that she looked like Anne Hathaway!)OK, back to my hangover...."
"This place is a want tio be ""avec""......sub par, not well thought food. Also for the price of a glass of wine the pour is small."
"This place is great but not for everyone.  I went with a large family gathering and had mixed reviews. Personally I loved everything I tried. My brother was a chef here at the time and we tried everything!It is a very unique place and I would love to go back even though my bro doesn't work here anymore.As another reviewer stated, how can you go wrong with Cheese, Swine and Wine!"
"They can make simple ingredients to tasty dish , very impressive ! The price was also reasonable , will for sure to go back"
"Wine and swine. Seriously? It was divine. Could it get any better than that? I don't think so. I had been jonesin to go to PP for quite some time considering it is LITERALLY right across the street from my work. Better late than never, I suppose. Last night, I finally had the chance to check it out  after work for some happy hour refreshments and noshes. The food was AH-MAZING and receives 5 stars alone for that. The service on the otherhand was definitely not, therefore, I was forced to scale it back to 4 stars overall. Elvis, my server, was not friendly at all. My friend and I seemed to be bothering him with our questions about wine and recommendations. And, God forbid I ask for a taste of a wine before committing to a quartino, half or full bottle. It's not like I was asking him for his kidney, just a taste of the rose or whatever. But, this has not deterred me from returning. Oh hell no! I have a feeling I will be a swine junkie this summer. The quaint and cute patio offers seclusion from the bustling Mich Ave crowd,  but also allows for prime people watching. Plus, the food and expansive wine list were top-notch and offered a little bit of everything from select artisan cheeses (from Pastoral), charcuterie, small plates and even vegetarian options, now that's a great menu Jimmy Bannos. I was schooled on some of the faves from friends who have had the chance to dine here and went with some of their suggestions: - Chorizo stuffed olives- Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio- Prosciutto Bread BallsWe decided to focus most of our efforts into the wine and not so much the swine this dining experience. It was a hot and humid day and we were looking for some liquid refreshment. My dining companion Lisa S and I tried the Domaine Skouras Moscofilero and the Italian Moscato. Both were cool, refreshing and totally hit the spot. The prices are on-par with other gastro pub places and I felt like I walked out a little bubbly and pleasantly full-- not stuffed like a pig.Purple Pig you better be kind to me next time, because I KNOW that the piggie will be calling my name for a follow-up appointment with you soon!"
"Service - negative!The hostess was curt/rude when we had returned to the restaurant as the time got closer. I tried to tell her that we were there and there's no need to call cause I'll probably miss it due to the noise and crowd. She insisted that she'll call. Well after waiting for 2 hours, we got the worst seat ever. The one by the entrance with the cold coming in, outside where the tent and outdoor seating is set. There was a breezy gust coming through on the inside of this tent and a heat lamp in the center. While my head and right arm was comforted by this warmth, my left side and legs were still cold. The service created a bitter experience when they ignored my request to place a chair in the corner of the tent to prevent the wind from coming through the gap. Then they had the nerve to ask me if I want to get back on the waiting list for an inside table. I wasn't going to any longer so I sucked it up.Food- moderateThe fried manchego cheese and pork shoulder was great! Bone marrow was ok, I've had better. Octopus only came with 3 pcs and the rest were veggies on the bottom that were WAY OVER seasoned. The octopus was cooked perfectly though. Wished there was just 1 more pc. The food comes out fast.In the end, this place is not worth the 2 hour wait. Especially when you spend less than 30min dining. Accommodations are horrible because you are rushing to eat your food so it doesn't get cold. Service needs an upgrade for the hype yelp is giving."
"We saw this place advertised with what's hip in Chicago. We also found out that it was literally across the street from our hotel so we decided to give it a go. The staff, ambiance and food were AMAZING! Definitely worth a trip to this place on N. Michigan Ave! Staff was completely friendly, knowledgeable and made great suggestions.  Best food on the menu:-Pig ears with crispy kale-Testa-Sopressata-Lardo Iberico-Roasted bone marrow-Albacore Tuna-Pork Shoulder-Pork Blade Shoulder-Wagyu Sirloin SteakWent twice on our week long stay in Chicago - so, we definitely enjoyed it! Oh and on a side note - the music on Saturday night seemed as if they'd stolen my iPod which was a nice touch!"
"I think the Pig might be one of my fav places in Chicago. I love the vibe and the food is so tasty you might drool just thinking about it. Some of my new favs: milk braised pork shoulder, octopus with green beans, beets with goat cheese and of course the bone marrow. If you love bone marrow you need to get this, if you're freaked out by bone marrow or have never tried it you need to man up and get this because it's amazing. Downside: it's become super popular which makes it a hard place to get into. My advice is to go during off-hours to avoid waiting for ever to get seated."
"I've been to The Pig twice in the past month and I'm a fan. First off, let me say that this restaurant having a location right on Michigan Avenue might detour us locals. Don't be scared because I think most tourists will make their way to T.G.I Friday's down the street. This place is for real. If you want to grab a nice glass of vino with some fun sharing plates. I don't see this establishment being comfortable for big groups as it's so small. I think more of an intimate dining experience between 2-4 people would be more appropriate. But then again that's just me being the type of person who needs space. The dining room itself which also includes the bar is basically just one room. It looks like someone's expensive country kitchen with beautiful tiles on the wall and it's very inviting.In the warmer months, they've got choice patio property to enjoy the breeze and people watching. The service has always been very friendly when I've gone and I always hear more than enough suggestions of the server's favorites.The food was really tasty and savory. I would suggest just splitting plates between two people so you can really enjoy the portions. Style of food is a mix between Italian, Mediterranean and Spanish. That's the best way I could describe what I was seeing and eating. These are the items I've tried so far:Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes &Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (very tasty!)Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade Panini (Awesome!)The Cured Meat Platter (seriously the way to go if you want to try it all!)They've got Smears which you can dip bread or crackers in and I believe I've tried all of them. My absolute favorite though is Pork Neck Bone Rillette & MostardaThis place is worth checking out for sure. It's nice to stop by after a day of shopping and running errands,"
"We arrived after a long day of travel from California and had an amazing meal.  Everything was fantastic- service, food, wine, decor and atmosphere.  We are still talking about several of the dishes- the sweet salt balance was spot on, prices were utterly reasonable, or possibly too low, for what they were.  The pig ear salad & smears will be in our memory for a long time.  We opted to have dinner outside, which was quieter and slightly more chill, but then moved inside for dessert. All 3 servers were excellent and attentive, we even got to meet the chef and tell him how wonderful our meal was.  They gave us pointers on where else to eat, and we were so taken with the restaurant, that part of our party came back the next day for lunch.We can't wait to come back to Chicago and are telling all our friends to put this on their ""must do"" list."
"Go to the Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig! For very reasonably priced fine dining in a very comfortable casual atmosphere and food that will knock your socks off.Here's the scoop.1. Go early (5-5:30pm) so you don't have to wait and then complain on Yelp about it. 2. Try a small plate from each of the different categories (Anitpasti, Smears, etc)3. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice now and the stand out items on the menu for me were:- Butternut Squash- Bone Marrow- Fried Manchego- Pork Neck Bone Rillette- Milk Braised Pork ShoulderAny day is a good day to eat pig! So enjoy!"
"My fried took me to lunch here, and I LOVED IT!The food is just incredible...you can't go wrong with anything you order. AND....they have Rijoa!!!! I was in heaven!!!!!"
"I was lucky enough to be treated to an awesome meal at Purple Pig, and I'm digging it.  I mean, let's lay down the facts: 1) The tagline for this place is ""Cheese, Swine & Wine""2) It's one of Bon Appetit's best new restaurants of 20103) There is a whole section on the menu with the heading ""Fried Things""What's not to love?!?  Here's just a few that I savored:Salt roasted beets, goat cheese, and pistachios.Fried melrose peppers with sea salt and garlic.Housemade sopressata.Roasted bone marrow with herbs on crostini.Pork blade stake with nduja and honey.Housemade Greek sausage with rapini and grapes.Literally, everything was delicious.  I could have ordered anything on the menu (well, except maybe the blood sausage, that still kinda creeps me out.) and been happy.I like the shared small plates concept, and the place had a cool vibe.  Disappointed they didn't have the fried deviled eggs, but all else was great.  It was pretty loud, over the music and the patrons, and at times it was hard to talk over the table, but overall I was impressed.  Cheese, Swine & Wine.  Sign me up."
"Worst service ever! We were on waiting list on Monday nite, told it would take about 40min to get a table but ended up waiting an hour and twenty minute!!! While we were waiting outside patio, I found other ppl who came later than us were called to get in earlier....I was suspecting something is not right after waiting over an hour...walked in front desk and asked how long should we wait then a waitress said they are cleaning up our table so one more min...but apparently they didn't call us another 15min. Walked in and asked one more time...at the moment I saw the lady who's hiding waiting list from me...I have asked to see the list who gets the table and who are still waiting and found they served people came behind our list first and lie to us. She made lame excuse over and over.... Figured they intentionally served other ppl first and push us later...messy, rude freaking 'PIG' restaurant waitresses. Such an unpleasant experiences. In the end of the day, food wasn't worth for and hour and half waiting time outside of cold. Definitely over rated place...if you believe long line up guarantee better taste, rethink one more time. Seems like this place just abuse line up for showing off..."
"If I can, I would here almost everyday (alternate with Davanti Enoteca).The first time I went to the Purple Pig was during the summer around 4th of July. The outdoor seating was perfect. We sat there for hours just enjoying the small plates and awesome wine selection. The best dish? BONE MARROW. Such a simple dish but it will blow your mind away. Suggestion on how to eat (which we were educated by the owner/head chef himself). Spread the bone marrow goodness on the toast, sprinkle some sea salt and top off with herb salad. This dish will change your life forever. Just don't eat it too often because none of us want to take the highway to a heart attack right? I have never had a disappointing dish here. Maybe one OK dish? But it's one of those ""I don't dig this so much but it doesn't mean it tastes bad"".Service is excellent. Food served promptly, staffs are not over-attentive (I hate that, you know, when they check on you every frikkin' 10 minutes?) but are always there when you need them. The downside? It's so popular, sometimes you gotta wait for an hour. Luckily, I'd just go stroll in westfield mall which is right next to it.This is one of the places on my list of ""Bring people here whenever you can!"""
"Yes, great location but what a bunch of stuck up people...if you have a stick up in your ass then enjoy!Didnt like the atmosphere neither the service..."
"Wow, what a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!Our wine and beer was excellent and there was a unique selection of small plates on the menu. Everything we ordered was full of great flavors. We cleaned each plate. Our server was attentive and knew his wines and food.table favorites:Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & ParsleyCalamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios(they ran out of the fried deviled eggs- heard they were awesome)Now I know why it is so hard to get a table at this place."
"Once again, I ordered something different and it did not disappoint (but then, how could it, its pork!). I got the pork chop this time, and it was plated with a yummy sauce and spinach(?).  Not sure... But it went well with a Belhaven Scottish Stout."
"The Purple Pig is a Michigan Avenue wine bar that specializes in eating parts of pigs. And any place that specializes in eating parts of pigs is okay in my book. I'm not a huge fan of the communal dining tables though. What is it with Chicago restaurants and communal dining tables? I guess they're trying to promote being social, but I mean, c'mon, talking to people? Next thing you know they're going to expect me to leave my basement and deal with that giant burning ball in the sky. Pfft."
"We were in downtown Chicago for the evening and had heard a great deal about the Purple Pig... and we thought, why not?Here is what we had:The pigs ear:  This was really good.  Salty, meaty, pork goodness, with crunchy kale topped off with a perfectly fried egg?  A.Maz.Ing.   Seriously, there was some crunch, some tang, and a touch of sweetness... a great way to start off the meal.Salt Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese:  I love beets... I grow a garden in the summer specifically so that I can grow beets... and roast them.  These beets were cooked well and the creaminess of the goat cheese topped it off perfectly.  Tasty.Fried Brussels sprouts: This was interesting.  I have never had anything quite like these... very light, almost an airy quality about them, great flavor, with a touch of lemon.  Tasty!JLT: More ooey, gooey fried egg goodness on top of Jamon Serrano, lettuce, tomato, and bread... We got the egg running, and sunk our teeth in.  Quite tasty.Turkey Leg:  Ok, nothing screams good eating quite like a turkey leg the size of my arm sitting on a plate.  Cook that bad boy in pork fat and not only does it scream healthiness, but it screams eat me as well.  My wife and I tore into the turkey leg and it was all that I could do to keep her from licking the plate.  I was skeptical at first, because it is a turkey leg, and I will get one in a month at Thanksgiving... but this was probably the best turkey leg I have ever eaten, and I may need to kidnap the chef for thanksgiving so that I can get one next month.We finished it up with the Sicilian Iris.  Let's talk about this... imagine a freshly fired doughnut, stuffed with chocolate and cannoli filling.  Hot, gooey, amazingness that is worth making the trip from Long Island to Chicago for just about any night of the week.  This was really the star of the night for us.This was a great night, our server was fantastic (Kelly), she even gave us breakfast tips for tomorrow morning."
"I thought the Purple Pig was a pretty average restaurant. Aside from an interesting menu collection (so many meats), there was nothing really that stuck out about the establishment.I ended up trying the Salami Toscana. The waiter had told us that most of the dishes were relatively small and urged us to try multiple things. Unfortunately, the salesman ship was lacking based primarily on the fact that he took about 5 minutes to touch base with us initially. At least 10 minutes total before we could actually place an order. Food portions were good for lunch (friend had one of the salads) unless you're a regular super giant burrito fan. Then you may want a couple extra dishes. I will say that the salami portion was a bit of a disappointment (1 or 2 slices?) but overall the sandwich was solid.I would say above and beyond the redeeming thing about this place has to be the location/building itself. Decor is awesome and they already had seating outside with heaters running to make it no-jacket-friendly. There is little better than sitting outside in Chicago restaurants during spring-type weather."
"Unbelievably fresh and unique.  My favorites:-Grilled calamari with couscous, thinly sliced radishes, cucumber and pistachio.  How could so many disparate components go together so well?  The texture of the calamari and couscous are shockingly similar and are punctuated with the crisp crunch of radish and pistachio.  The whole thing was lightly dressed with something a bit acidic that brought out the flavors of everything and it all came together perfetly-Beets (salt roasted) with whipped goat cheese and some kind of vinaigrette.  When I make this at home, it isn't nearly as light and fluffy.  Perhaps not as novel as the calamari dish, but a home run nonetheless-Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and a tzatziki sauce.  First of all, I have been trying to fry mashed potatoes for two years and have consistently failed where the purple pig succeeded.  The thighs were grilled perfectly and the tzatziki sauce was so unbelievably flavorful that we found ourselves using everything on the table to scoop it up.  Delicious yogurt flavor but light and tangy as well.We had a couple more items, of which the only real 'miss' was the prosciutto bread balls.  The description appealed to me pretty well but the dish itself was pretty salty and without any real punch to it.I would come back here in a heartbeat and cannot wait to explore more of the menu."
"Another one on my ""list"" of places to try in Chicago. The place was packed, but we were able to get seated in a fair amount of time. The wait time for food/drinks was a little slow and for some reason our waitress got our drink orders wrong a couple times, but I'll give her a break since it was busy. We tried a couple of appetizers and I got a delicious salad with hazelnuts, which doesn't seem to be on the menu any longer, so they must change it up. This would be a great spot to meet for drinks and if you want a small meal."
"Went here with a friend on Monday night and was surprised at the atmosphere.  I was happy that the food was still great because the loud club music made mew ant to pull my hair out.  It was near impossible to hear each other and to carry on a conversation.Because of the food they get 4 stars and my return visit, butI'm hoping it won't be so unpleasant to sit inside."
"Cool menu for sure!!  Everything we tasted was good.  And al very unique.  Great for the Chi-town Foodies.  It is super tiny...which was a shock.  So get there early if you want to get a table.  We sat at the bar, which was good. It was a full restaurant and it was a Tues at 6 PM.  The bar surrounds the also very tiny kitchen.  For all this tasty unique food it is amazing that they can cook it in this very small open kitchen....and all electric...no gas stoves (interesting).Pick a wine from their large selection, share some small plates of food, and talk to your neighbors.  Enjoy!P.S. The wait staff could use a little more training on when to notice empty glasses...we wanted to continue to order drinks and food, but they were really slow!"
"This is a must try if your in ever in Chicago! Not a pace for groups larger than 4 and def go when you have time to wait, but will be we'll worth it!"
"Wow. Just moved to Chicago.. my husband & I decided that we'd really get the fullest out of this city by trying out as many restaurants that we could. Have heard many good things about this place. Went in on a Saturday night at 9 o'clock. There wasn't a free seat in the house (understandable!) so we got comfy at the bar. Quickly ordered wine, and asked the bartender his favorites. He was RIGHT ON POINT. My husband & I shared everything. Started off with prosciutto (which if you're Italian you'd love!) with cheese! That was the best I've had since I've been to Italy! Then we had their pigs ear with an egg on top with kale. that was my favorite. Then the entree was the sirloin. VERY nice. then to end a perfect night.. Their Sicilian Iris. STOP IT. like the most perfect chocolate filled donut. But better! Two thumbs up from southern Ohio natives! We'll be back! Many more time."
"If you are just skimming reviews, then just read this: don't sit in the outside tent if it's raining or possibly going to rain! You have been warned...OK now onto the full review:This restaurant was awesome and really helped me step out of my comfort zone food-wise! Here are some examples of what we tried:- Pig ears (yummy but I only ate 2 bites because of my weird food mental block)- Pig's feet (good, but not as good as the ears, only ate 1 bite due to my mental block)- Milk pork shoulder (my fave!!)- The almonds (a big hit with the entire group)- Fried olives (not bad, whatev)- Bread pudding (so friggin amazing, your mouth won't know what hit it!)- Cinnamon soft serve ice cream (literally tasted like pure cinnamon in ice cream form)Everything is served as family style tapas, so for our party of 4, we each got like 1 olive or 2-3 small bites of pig ear, etc.  Our bill at the end of the night was a little hefty, but nothing too crazy. What I liked is we weren't limited to one big plate of food. We got to sample and slowly get filled up on little tapas. The server forgot one of my tapas that I ordered and we never ended up getting it (we thought we would eventually get it, but it never came), but other than that he was good.The only reason why I give the restaurant 4 stars is due to the first sentence in this review... It was a nice evening out so we decided to sit in the fully enclosed outside tent. It was REALLY nice with the low lighting and heating lamps, nice cushy chairs, the works!  HOWEVER, we were sitting by the seam in the tent where the two tents connect with Velcro and it started raining... About 2 minutes into the rain, the seams split and our table got torrential downpoured on! Our food, jackets, bodies, all got wet (especially my poor husband!).So they rushed us inside, and got us comfortable at a big shared table. No biggie, we were in good spirits, no harm reaaaaaly done. Our new waiter definitely wasn't as good, and he didn't really seem to care about us. He made some lame joke about staying dry, then pretty much ignored us for the rest of the night.  THEN at the end of the night when we got our check, I was hoping to see something comped on our bill... dessert, a drink, anything? Nope, not a dang thing. Normally I would have made a bit of a fuss (I mean, come on, we got soaked!), but we were with relatives from the UK and we didn't want to show them an ungrateful/poor/snotty American attitude, so we let it slide.So all in all, the food was delicious, our first server was great, and the ambiance was nice.  I guess I'm just a little annoyed at the customer service and the lack of comp-age on our bill.  If I ever go there again and something happens like that and we don't have guests from the UK, then I'll throw my little fit and I'm sure they'll make it right =)"
"The staff was very knowledgeable, funny, accommodating, and willing-to-educate.     : )  The food and drinks here are AMAZING, but you don't need me to tell you that; I'm sure many of the other yelpers are raving about that.  Since it was our first time here, we told the server in general what we like in our cheese and our wines...left it up to her to choose.  SO glad we did!!  She chose things for us we would have never considered and they were STUNNING!!!  We went in ""just for a quick drink and cheese"", but ended up staying a couple hours and having a good amount of food items.  Friendly, delicious, unique, cozy, I could go on and on about The Purple Pig!  But instead, you need to stop reading this and get over to this place NOW!!  (oh, but do make a reservation....they get busy really quick!)"
"I want to like Purple Pig, I do.  Heck, I want to love it.  All the fabulous reviews and recommendations told me not to miss it on my foodie excursion to Chicago and promised to offer a great experience.  it was quite the opposite, though.  Purple Pig is in a great, central location and the vibe is fast-paced, bustling and fun.  We sat inside on a Saturday night - around 9 PM, so a little after the dinner rush, but still prime time for this restaurant which offers late night dining.  As expected, getting a seat might be tough.  We were up for the wait & excited to try this supposed gem.  We couldn't sit at the bar, so we sat at one of the communal tables.  Fun, large tables with others like us who wanted to try some great wines and interesting tapas.  Upon being seated, our waitress never came over to us to say hello until about 15 minutes after we had been seated.  Luckily a bus boy brought us water, but with an incredibly overwhelming menu for food & wine, we were eager to ask for recommendations and understand the best approach to enjoying our experience.  My friend got up & started stalking some seats at the bar which seemed they were going to open up.  Unfortunately, just as two seats were opening, the heavens opened up & the group leaving decided to stay & wait out the rain.  My friend came back & was shocked the waitress still had not approached us.  Finally, she did - no apologies, no nothing.  Wanted to take our order and when we asked for recommendations based on what we like, she just seemed disinterested.  Busy Saturday night, probably just swamped & burnt out - this is what we told ourselves.  I waited tables in a busy restaurant for many years and my dining companion has a bar & restaurant in her home city.  So, we are both more than compassionate about busy nights on the floor.  Anyway, we finally got some wine about 35 minutes after we were seated.  It was ridiculous.  15 minutes later when our waitress finally came to check on us, we asked about the menu and ordered a couple of bites to start out with.  Those arrived & were delivered by the bus boy, thank god.  They were pretty salty & on the greasy side, but we were just happy to finally have something.  We had finished our wine & wanted another glass - again, waitress nowhere to be found.  We also wanted to order some cheese.  So, the waitress finally made her way back to us and we ordered our cheese and 2 more glasses of wine.  The waitress did recommend a fabulous bleu cheese, so she gets points for helping us with that!  Sadly, our cheese arrived and our wine had not yet.  So we waited & waited and finally, we saw our waitress coming with our two glasses of wine, about 10 minutes after the cheese course arrived.  For a restaurant that prides itself on being a wine & tapas place to enjoy good pairings, this was just unacceptable.  Again, no apologies from the waitress.  We asked if she was slammed & she stunned us by saying, ""No, this was actually slow for a saturday night"".  She admitted her shift was ending & when we offered to pay our bill, she told us it was unnecessary, as they pool tips & our new server would be with us shortly.  Well, we never once saw our new server - our cheese was finished and our wine glasses sat empty for a long time before new server came over & asked if we needed anything.  It was not closing time, the bar & kitchen were still in full swing, so we weren't lingering or anything.  We asked for our bill & got it...16 minutes later.  Again, beyond unacceptable.  The others at our community table were suffering from the same kinds of delays and frustrated by incredibly slow service - even though we all had to watch our servers laughing & yucking it up with other staff while we all waited without drinks, without our checks, etc.  The couple across from us was smart & when the waitress dropped the bill, they didn't let her walk away until she had their card so they could finally leave.  One couple at our table sat with a finished dessert for about 30 minutes before they were able to pay & leave.  For what was apparently a ""slow Saturday night"", this was appalling. All in all, the menu looks great and the wine list is really extensive and interesting.  But, this also makes it overwhelming.  The servers need to help the diners navigate the menu and wine list, but to do that, they have to be attentive.  The couple at our table sat for so long that they started asking others at our table to help them with the menu & make recommendations because our server was nowhere to be found.  I am sure the Purple Pig on a good day is a fine choice.  But, in a city with so many other options for delicious tapas and great wine, I would recommend one of those other fabulous restaurants above Purple Pig.  It was an unfortunate experience and I would say ""pass"" on this one."
"This is a great little place to come to on a breezy summer night.  If you're up for lounging, eating cheeses and little dishes, you're going to be in love!Also, don't be afraid to order a botle of wine to enjoy your people watching!Service was OK, but nothing too stellar.  If you come with more than two people, there is communal seating, which I'm not too fond of."
Awesome spot. Everything was absolutely delicious. Great service too!
"Really fun atmosphere (good, hip music & the kitchen crew in the open kitchen look like bad *sses in their headbands and uniforms) Went here with a buddy and ordered numerous drinks/appetizers. Everything was delicious and brought out with nice timing. Don't come here for intimate conversation because its loud and the seating is communal. It's more of a party atmosphere but definitely a fun place."
"50 bottles of wine for under $40...at a 4 star tapas restaurant....nuff said.  This place is great and they are always making changes to their menu to keep it fresh.  If you want the deviled egg....come at around 4:30 and make sure you place your order because it's amazing and they only make a small number of them everyday!  Also, the pig ears....yes pig ears are amazing and their signature dish is really the milk braised pork shoulder.  Get that and a nice glass of their Rose and you'll have a good time.For dessert they have this chocolate fried dough concoction that I can't remember the name of...but get it!  It's sooo good.  Try that with a glass of their dessert wine and you won't regret it.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the service isn't always great...and by service, I mean the one shorter and very thin hostess.  She always seems miserable and put out by any question you ask.  The servers and bartenders have always been very good and attentive, but the one hostess is just unhappy with life in general...so hopefully you wont get her when you go.Bottom line is this....miserable hostess or not this place deserves a stop or two for sure.  Jimmy Bannos Jr. is the chef and he's young and inspired.  Bring a bunch of friends and have a good time."
"loved this place!Perfect stop for a drink and a snack.  I would have loved to have a meal there as other diners' food looked amazing as well.we just had wine and the cheese plate as they were out of the deviled eggs.  all of the cheese was stinky and delicious.my only gripe was service was a little slow, even when sitting at the bar.  this was especially surprising since it seemed like there were a lot of employees at the time (i think we were there at shift change) and many of them were talking at the end of the bar."
"Place was packed, but we immediately got a table.  Fun, boisterous vibe, perfect for a chilly night.Food was delicious: jamon serrano with duck egg, pork saltimbocca, octopus (so tender!), neckbone gravy, chicken thigh kabobs, and the sweet fried Iris.Service was top notch, and the wine selection extensive.Will definitely make some repeat visits to finish off the menu!"
"I don't like community seating, but PP made up for it by by seating us next to cool people;) The food was awesome. I have been searching for lardo and finally found it, it was delicious! The bone marrow was also fantabulous. My lady and I mouwed our way through 6-7 courses, plus a bottle of wine and only racked up an $80 bill.... not to shabby!The service was great even though they were very busy. Kudos Purple Pig!"
"Pretty good, but worth the hype? Meh... Milk Braised Pork Shoulder was the best dish on the table.  We had a reservation and still waited about 45 minutes. I would call this place a tourist trap."
"This place is delicious, and we didn't even try any pork.So a friend and I went to lunch here in the midst of a (mostly) failed day of shopping. We were seated after a brief wait at the central communal table went about ordering the roasted beets with goat cheese, the eggplant camponada on toast points smeared (smothered) in lardo (that's pig fatback, in case you're wondering), the fried olives, and the stripe bass with a celery and blood orange slaw.First of all, the fried olives were pretty meh. Fried and super salty - exactly what you expect. Luckily the beets came out at the same time, and they were a welcome and delicious lightly sweet contrast.Then came the eggplant camponada - my favorite dish. Chunks of fresh eggplant and tomatoes with pinenuts on top of toast points drowned in lardo. The amount of lardo was overwhelming in spite of being delicious - probably 'cause I was thinking about where it came from - so I scraped some of it off. The camponada itself though was oh so good. A perfect mid-afternoon, early spring burst of flavor. You must order this.The big chunky filet of stripe bass was very good in and of itself, but I wasn't a big fan of the slaw on the side. It was just neutral and there, and it's not like the fish was overly salted anyways to need that.Our tall european server was super friendly and helped us out with the menu. He enthusiastically tried to get us to order wine and get dessert, but we rebuffed his charming efforts. Only downside is that it seems understaffed as it took a while for our cards to get processed.So the food's great. Service is good if a bit harried. It's bright and tastefully decorated inside - like a sussed-up cabin in Switzerland with the lighter wood and tiles.On top of all that, we didn't wind up paying more than $20 each. Best deal on Michigan Ave."
"Five stars for the delicious food! I took away one star because our waitress was so rude. She clearly does not like her job and shouldn't be working in the service industry. Now that I got that out back to the fantastic food. I won't list everything we got because it was all good so you can't go wrong. Some stand out dishes were the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce (must try), and my husband and Dad love the pork shoulder. The atmosphere is fun, great place to go with a group of people. It gets really loud. Prepare to wait for a very long time since they don't take reservations. Enjoy!"
"Amazing!I am in Chicago for my first time and have been trying restaurants based on location yelp searches and walking around until I find a place that seems good. Well on a warm Monday night, the two collectively led me to the Purple Pig. I was most definitely not let down. I could hear the buzz from the street and saw groups of people walking onto this terrace with a front gate. I knew that this seemed like a place I needed to check out. 5 minutes earlier in my location search on yelp from the nearest free wifi, this restaurant came up first. So I walk up and at 6:30 there was an hour wait for a table and 35 minutes for a seat at a community table. I was almost ready to turn away when the hostess mentioned that the bar was first come, first serve and that lurking around wasn't frowned upon. So that's what I did. It took me a little while to figure out how to get the attention of a bartender so at least I could have a drink while waiting. The moment my glass of wine (an amazing Sicilian red) got into my hand, I saw a women get up and leave. PERFECT TIMING! I sat down and got myself a menu. What a maginificently appetizing menu. I couldn't believe the variety of things a mediteranian BBQ could offer. The antipasti all sounded amazing and were appropriately priced. The salads all sound fantastic (a rabbit salad with mixed greens in a black truffle dressing with shredded egg and roasted capers, for example. The fried options! It took me 15 minutes staring at the menu before I had to ask for some help. The bartender/server was great. She went through all the favorites with me and even explained the ones that would or wouldn't have dairy. I would never have known that most of the meats were marinated in buttermilk. I settled on a blade steak, with a spreadable sausage and an arugula salad. The steak was seared in honey, perfectly cooked and tasted phenomenal. The only thing that made it better was spreading the sausage (I can't remember what she said it was) on top. The flavours were perfectly savory with a hint of sweet. Even the basic arugula salad blew my mind. Not to mention that even with how busy this place was, my food arrived in shockingly good time. Everything about this place was perfect. On my next trip to Chicago, I will most definitely be visiting again. I will also tell anyone I know that is visiting this great city to enjoy some of their amazing food and friendly, fast service."
"While I love working from home, I get sad sometimes because I am no longer within walking distance of this marvelous all-things-pig heaven. The Purple Pig is so good, I could easily drop $80 on wine and pig treats and not bat a lash about it. I'm by no means wealthy, but this place is JUST THAT GOOD. I love that you can do 1/3 bottles of wine, cheese, antipasti, and PORK NECK RILETTE. I never thought I would say this, but BRING ON THE PORK NECK!!!! We all need a little more pork neck in our lives. One bite and you will agree too. I could write sonnets about my love of the Purple Pig and maybe one day I will. Until then, I just hope you take the plunge and give it a try because it is realllllllllllllllllly good."
"Being a family of Middle Easterners, I was a little timid anout heading into this establishment. We stopped at the door and looked at the menu with some reservation as none of us ate pork and worse I have shellfish allergies to make life furthermore complicated.The host and the wait staff were super nice and friendly although lunch time was long past, they welcomed us in and showed us the dishes that would agree with our dietary restrictions.Our waitress was wonderful. She guided us through the menu and made some great suggestions.The food comes in small portions and is great for sharing. Everything that was laid on our table was fresh, well prepared, delicious, sinful but oh mi god so good.We ended up eating more than we planned but this establishment went out of their way to make our afternoon late lunch a delight.Add to this impossibility of impressing my mom who is a total Coco Chanel Reincarnate, and having her smile and praise the food and you have yourself a culinary success moment!I can see this space getting crowded fast. It is a small restaurant. The prices awe not cheap but the food is well worth it. The restaurant is strategically located on Michigan Avenue. I highly recommend for lunching / dining with friends and colleagues whenever there is some ice to be broken -- this is the place.The music and the ambiance is a bit bar- ish. So romantic date destination this place is not as you will most likely fall for the wait staff or the food and leave your date feeling neglected."
"Marrow? Octopus? Pork shoulder? Beets? Beer? Wine? Anyway you eat it, and anything that you order it seems, is perfection, set within a casual gastropub like space that's bustling enough to be an ideal spot for a small group who loves to share, yet intimate enough for a date. How'd they cram so much into one space?Love the outside seating. Even on a crisp autumn evening, outside still felt summery, aided by heat lamps. Purple Pig, you've got me crushing on you."
"OMG!  I've been dreaming about this meal ever since I went last Friday night.  I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went with 2 of my girlfriends.  I wouldn't recommend going with a large group, as they don't take reservations and the place is pretty small, but our group of 3 worked out well.  When I got there, one of my friends had already put our name in and ordered a bottle of white.  We were told the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half.  I was expecting this since it was 7:30 on a Friday night.  We made ourselves comfortable under the heat lamps outside to wait.  Exactly 1 hour later we were seated.The place was packed and we were seated at a communal table right in the middle of the restaurant.  It was a bit of a tight squeeze, but nothing that ruined my meal.  We ordered a bottle of Rioja and a meat and cheese plate to start, which was the perfect beginning to a great meal.  Then, in no particular order, we tried the shrimp and clams antipasti, the pig's ear, the fried manchego, the whipped feta smear, the roasted bone marrow smear, and the milk braised pork shoulder.  Absolutely everything we had was spectacular.  The standouts were the fried manchego (I could eat this everyday), the pork shoulder (very tender), the pigs ear (something I never would have normally ordered, but it was really unique and rich tasting with the fried egg on top), and also the bone marrow (again, something I would never think to order, but was very savory).We ended our meal with a bottle of Prosecco and the Sicilian Kiss dessert....so yummy!  Basically a fried donut filled with chocolate and ricotta cheese.As fas as service, our waitress was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable despite how busy she was!Between the 3 of us, we ordered quite a bit because we wanted to try so much, so our bill at the end was pretty picey, but you could just as easily go here with 2 people and get a bottle of wine and 4-5 plates and have a very reasonably priced dinner.  This really was one of the best meals I've ever had and I will be making regular returns to this place for sure!  It easily just took over the number 1 spot on my list of Top 5 Favorite Chicago Restaurants!"
"Right across from ENO which is a favorite of mine - this was a fun stop as well.  We were looking for a little snack and a glass of wine and this fit the bill.  We enjoyed the beets with goat cheese and a lovely wine from Greece that our waiter recommended (nice call!!).  We had the pleasure of sitting out side, but the indoor decor was nice.I was a little disappointed that a few items I was interested were not available, although the comment was made that they did not turn out as the chef hopped, so perhaps I was saved from a bad experience.Give this place a try!"
"Stopped in at the Purple Pig over Thanksgiving weekend.  Wait time was quoted at 45 minutes but we were seated after only 20 minutes.  The space is very cozy and the tables communal.  The waitress was very helpful in selecting a wine.  The food came out as it was ready with the cold things first.  The shaved brussel sprouts were a standout.  They packed a fresh and intense flavor, a bite of summer at the start of a long Chicago winter.  The fried pig's ear topped with a fried egg was also a highlight.  Best thing we ordered would have to be the roasted bone marrow, gooey and gluttonous and oh so flavorful.  I will definitely be returning to the Purple Pig, if you are planning on going, be adventurous, try a pig product that you've never had before!  You can't go to a place called the Purple Pig and order chicken! (but you will be surprised how many people do!)"
"After a viewing of Waiting for Superman (a great documentary about the inequities of Public Schools- a must see) at the AMC on East Illinois, I decided to try Purple Pig. It was definitely worth it!!Ambiance- excellent, the place was buzzing and it was a Wednesday night.Food: I ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, which were also deep fried. It is a good choice for anyone who loves olives, although I could not taste the chorizo. And then I had the Braised Pork Shoulder, which was to die for. It was so soft and moist that it melted in your mouth. They even served it with a spoon as to say 'it's so moist, you don't need a fork."" I would go again and again and again.Four Stars!!"
"Came here for a friends birthday on a Saturday....the place wasn't too packed and we got seats after a 10-15 min wait. I was actually expecting it to be more then that. I came with 3 other friends and we order a total of 5 dishes to share. My favorite dish was the fried pig ears. They were crispy and favorful. Loved it! The bone marrow was also very good. The oil from the bone marrow was amazing on the bread that came with the dish. If you like wine this place has a huge selection, but I'm not a huge fan of wine...i'm sure that the selection is good enough that most people will find something that they'll like. I would love to come back if i'm around the area for a quick snack = )"
"Chicago is truly the city for the epicure enthusiasts . And The Purple Pig did NOT disappoint. The menu is ideal for the adventurous. No really, if foie gras makes your face pinch up, than its best you go some where else. WIth that being said, for you brave foodies, try the Bone Marrow, Milk Braised Pork shoulder, and Bacon Fat Pork Belly. Pass on the Pig's Ear ( tasted identical to  fried onions crisp in a can)  and the bread pudding ( Nia's is WAY better. Probably THE BEST in the world). To sum it up, If The Pig and The Goat had a fight. My bet is on the PIG!"
"We waited 30 minutes longer than the restaurant had suggested to us... which was fine.. but I suppose it put a slight ding on the meal.We started with a salad, which was nothing special, and cheese.  The cheese was DELICIOUS, I want to be made of that cheese so I can eat my fingers when I get hungry.  It was goat cheese with a truffle, but had a different name that I can't recall.  Anyway, get it, it was so good.Among dishes I liked: Pork shoulder, yummy ... Eggplant on bread with goat cheese, also good... Scallops... very good.That's about it.  We had 30 dishes and I thought 4 were exceptional, maybe 3 or 4 were good, and the rest I could have done without.The bone marrow was nothing special, I was also dissapointed in the pigs ears, jambon, and some others that are now escaping me.They offered us free dessert because of the long waits for our food and service, but none of the desserts looked good... SOOO we asked for money off our bill instead, and they obliged.  That was nice of them.  So bonus for that."
Salt roasted beets and whipped goat cheese... Yum!
"Went here for brunch, right when it opened. With 7 of us there, we basically tried the entire menu! My favorite dish was ""Raw corn & heirloom tomatoes with arugula pesto"" (not in the menu online). It was soo flavorful and delicious! I also tried bone marrow for the first time. The looks of it was kind of scary, but it tasted great with the toasted bread. Too bad I have the worse memory ever (of what I ate), but at least I remember they were all delicious! :D"
"I don't know that I can say anything others haven't. Freaking awesome. I've had practically everything on the menu (or at least it seems that way). Faves: pig's ear, bone marrow, jlt, and pig's tails. Communal tables are fun if you're cool with that kind of thing. Met some fun people and it made for an entertaining evening. I love that Chef is always there and stops by the table. Last time I went he made several suggestions I probably wouldn't have otherwise tried. Go. Eat. The End."
"Went with friends who have it on their must go to list of foodie joints when in Chicago.  We sat outside in the tented area....it started raining and was dripping on us. The temp dropped so our legs and feet froze (they do have heaters in the tent, but it only seemed to warm from the waist up) The inside was jam packed.  We were told an hour and 45 min wait, which was really only about 45 minutes.  The food was very salty for my taste.  We had the smear of cucumber/whipped feta, shaved Brussels sprouts, and the chicken thigh kebabs.  I would not go there again for the money."
"Very good meal--we did have to wait an hour and twenty minutes instead of the promised 45, but no big deal with a good wine list like this restaurant has.  The neck bone rilletttes were fantastic, as was the butternut squash with fried sage and the pork blade steak.  The tempranillo we tried was also excellent.A very nice surprise, especially in this location, where there's a lot of chees and over-the-topness."
"First visit to Chicago, and a friend recommended this spot for good tapas and wine. You can't make a rezzy, so be prepared to wait for about an hour. The good thing is they will serve you drinks outside while you wait. The first thing we ordered was a cheese plate (we asked the waitress to put something together) and it was AH-MAZING! We ordered the Sirloin, Bone Marrow, Meatball Sliders, Eggplant parmesean balls and Pork Shoulder...and all were to die for. I think I'm leaving some of the items out, it's hard to remember it all now. We ordered a panini which was just ok and they comped us for it which was great. Dessert was the affagato which we loved. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll be back, we didn't get to try everything, which was sad."
"A ton of fun. The pork bellies were great, jamon serrano ,mortadella, and beets excellent. Panna cotta to die for."
"Came here to celebrate a buddy's graduation and found the food, service, and overall experience to be lacking.  Sure, it offers up some interesting, uncommon dishes, like that bone marrow scooping dish, but it falls flat on its face with some of the others.To make the experience a bit worse: the entire place was ultra noisy and cramped.  The service was really slow and we ended up waiting quite a while between down times for our waiter to show up.  The dishes also came out in spurts, sometimes too much together, sometimes a good five minutes between the last finished item and the next one in the queue.I'm not sure how this place is relative to other Chicago restaurants, but it's just not great when compared to dining at places with a similar price point elsewhere in the US."
"This place is absolutely fantastic.  It's a bit on the small side, and can generate a very looooong wait time.  However, the food is certainly worth the wait!  I have come several times and it has been absolutely amazing each time.  The wine list is pretty nice...the braised pork shoulder is fantastic and the incredibly tender!  You cannot go wrong with anything on this menu."
"Amazing food, great atmosphere, knowledgeable bartender. Ask to try wines and they allowed it until you found the right one, which is great. The outside is totally cute and we sat at the bar to eat. The Caesar salad was fantastic and so was the bone marrow (amaaazing!) Will DEF go back here when we visit Chicago again."
"I love Purple Pig.  I realize I'm drawn to gastropubs and small plates places.  Full disclosure.  Although I don't think this review is biased in any way.  There was a time when my Michigan Avenue shopping day would be detoured around dining hours because I didn't like a single restaurant in a one block radius of that street.  Everything was overpriced and uninspired.  I love a good steakhouse as much as any Chicagoan-- but a pound of beef is just not conducive to trying on clothes.  Enter Purple Pig.  Finally Michigan Avenue has a restaurant that lives up to the address.  The menu at Purple Pig is inspired, and lengthy.  I've been here a few times and have barely made a dent, which just makes me more inclined to visit again and again.  The wine AND beer list is quality with a ton of variety.  A pound of beef may not be conducive to shopping, but we all know a slight buzz is!  My favorite dishes include the braised artichokes, serrano ham and hazelnut based salad.  The paninis are also really delicious and can make the restaurant approachable on a completely different price point.   I will say the bone marrow misses the mark.  I've been a few times on weekend mid afternoons post-summer, and have not had to wait.  I figure once summer comes the wait will be 2 hours again and my Michigan Avenue lunches will hibernate until winter."
great little place to eat for lunch. Who doesn't love charcuterie and cheese plates? Thumbs Up: Pig ear salad lardon crostinimilk braised pork shoulder
"We were lucky enough to walk in on a Saturday and be seated right away for lunch.  I don't know why, but I wasn't that excited initially about going, despite the facts that pork is obviously the centerpiece of the menu AND that they have a whole section of the menu devoted to fried foods.  But the snow outside and the Purple Pig quickly changed my mind.  Everything was just really tasty:  a nicely roasted bone marrow, a cold arborio salad with shrimp and clams that was light and toothsome, a tartine with serrano and poached duck egg, a slightly spicy and not-at-all-chewy sepia (like cuttlefish), and a light salad with watermelon radish and luxuriously creamy feta.  The communal tables are nice because everyone just ogles each other's food and then says ""I'll have what they're having"" and everyone's happy!Very friendly unpretentious service, too."
"Went here with a bunch of friends while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago.  Found it via yelp, thanks, yelpers!  We were not disappointed.We had a couple of the different corn antipasti dishes not listed in their online menu, but both were good.  The prosciutto balls and croquettes were excellent too.  I can't say I was a huge bone marrow fan, but I tried it.We asked the waiter  (who was from WI, hehe) to recommend a cheese and we got the Podda, which was sweet and tasty.  I ordered the pork shoulder which was delicious!We split the Sicilian Iris and the lemon panna cotta for dessert.  I recommend the panna cotta, very fresh and tasty.Only complaint is that the bar seating outdoors is jam-packed and uncomfortable.  Other than that, would totally go back!"
"My first time in Chicago and decided to go to Purple Pig after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Is all true Purple Pig is the best restaurant  in Chicago. JLT pork jowl& fired duck egg, Pig ear with crispy kale Braises baby, artichoke fingerling are amazingly good with great customer services. I highly recommend this place to anyone."
"Great food, reasonable prices.  Crowded and lively.  Highly recommended."
"A pig by the Tapas.  Just a really fun place.  Like any the wait sucks, and they have not totally figured out the best seating arrangements.  However, once you see the menu the excitement sets in.  You better be in for some different ""parts"" to eat because that is what there is.  Pig ear, tail, marrow, and tar tar are many of the strange but delicious items that are a must order.  I know, ear?  You seriously have to forget what part you are eating and enjoy.  The meat and cheese options are also a must get.Food a 5, Everything else a 4.  But go, and you will not regret.  Another great option is Bristol."
"I've been here 3-4 times already. The food is awesome and the service is great! We always go between 5-6 and we only waited for 10 mins or we got seated right away. The servers there are very nice and the food comes out quick. The prices there are reasonable. The wine is great too!We always get the bone marrow because its simply delicious! We have ordered the fried pig ear, pork fried almonds, fired brussel sprouts,porchetta sandwich, meatball sliders, pork sweetbreads, sirloin tip, and bone in beef tenderloin. The only thing I didn't like was the porchetta sandwich because i've had better. I recommend get 3 dishes for 2 people maybe 4 but it will fill you up trust me! Also for dessert you must get the SICILLIAN IRIS! Its so yummy!"
"The only reason The Purple Pig doesn't get the complete set of stars is because we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours when we arrived so they jotted our name down and we went to get drinks elsewhere (it was beyond crowded), and returned an hour later. When we get there, the hostess tells us they called our name 15 minutes later. What? As if that wasn't annoying enough, they made us wait ANOTHER hour to finally be seated. By that time I was so hungry I could barely stand straight, *but* man, was it worth it.The restaurant is tapas style: all entrees are small and intended to be split between your dining buddies. We ordered Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli, Lardo Crostini, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. All of them more delicious than the next. However, I can honestly say that the clear winner was the pork shoulder (& it seems to be everyone's favorite across the board) with the lardo very close behind. For dessert, we opted for the hazelnut ice cream (a little piece of heaven) and the Sicilian Iris (BEST THING EVER). Aside from the delicious food, the atmosphere was really nice. I can see it being a perfect spot for a date night or for celebrating a special occasion. The wait staff was knowledgeable and personable, and the location is really great. We were sitting outside and it was definitely romantic - paired with our ""fun-sized"" glasses of wine, I'd say we forgot about the annoyance of the wait pretty quickly."
"Awesome place, great service and imaginative cuisine!"
"Had to give this place a try while in Chicago with all I had heard and read about it.Very interesting menu. Small tapas style. Packed house on a Monday night. We tried the pig's tail braised in balsamic, pig's ear with krispy kale, milk braised pork shoulder, chorizo stuffed olives, and salt-roasted beets w/ goat cheese. Overall, the dishes were very unique from anything I've tried before. I have to say, however, that they were on the saltier side.The white wine that was suggested to us by our server paired nicely with the saltiness of the dishes.All of my friends and I agreed that the beets were delicious. I personally enjoyed the pork shoulder. The meat fell off the bone and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.I would definitely recommend this place to someone travelling to Chicago."
"It is tradition to head downtown for my bday.  i choose the restaurant (dad treats for all 10 of us) then we look at the windows.  I wanted something not too far and something different than the usual steakhouses we tend to choose.  i found The Purple Pig on Yelp and decided to give it a try.I read that it was a ""small place"", but I didn't realize just how small.  This is not a criticism, just an observation... It is more of a wine bar.  Communal seating of a high top 10, a high top 12 and low seating half booth, half chair along the wall (about 20 worth?) The bar has seating all around it.  not much room to wait inside.  OUTSIDE, though was fine even in December!  Grab a gladd of wine, stand by the heat lamp and enjoy the city.  I can imagine that it would be filled during the warmer months.We went at 4:30 on a Saturday during Christmas season. They took our name and cell #, said about an hour and told us to walk around for a while.  We had 10 in our party 6 adults 4 kids (12, 9, 5 &2).  They have been to MANY restaurants as my family are foodies.We were sat in about an hour and a half at a communal table with one other couple.  they were very nice and really did not seem bothered by us in the least.  Service (Maya) was EXCELLENT. A party of 10 can sometimes be a disaster.  Drinks were served promptly, wines were suggested.We ordered just about everything you could imagine and there was nothing that I disliked. Kids loved the Turkey legs.  We ordered a pig platter of cured meats - very fun!I wanted a sample of their very large cheese selection, but was overwhelmed.  Our waitress, chose for me and did a great job!Lamb was perfectly seasoned and had a bit of lemon zest with a fresh tzaziki sauce.FRIED DEVILED EGGS!I took a yelpers advice and ordered the bone marrow smear...yep!  It was tasty!Pork shank w/mashed potatoes.Waygu beefrazorneck clamsmusselschorizo stuffed olivesThe only thing I didn't like was the prawns.  they were mushy.Once we were seated we had a wonderful time trying foods we never would have dared!Definitely would recommend.  Just plan on waiting and take a stroll on Michigan ave to look up Marilyn's dress!"
"Pig has come along way since the 'Other White Meat'.The Purple Pig is a testament to these new times.The restaurant is located right on Michigan Avenue, but don't let that deter you. You won't feel like you're at the epicenter of Chicago's tourist hub. The restaurant is always packed with patrons either sipping on wine outside on the patio or savoring on shared plates of the ubiquitous charcuterie that seems to be dominating menus these days. You won't find tourists in here.The 'Pig' is one of many restaurants that have embraced the trend towards communal 'tapas' style dining. The Spotted Pig in NYC - arguably the originator of this - taught savvy diners that food tastes much better with a little pig thrown in. More importantly, that restaurant dismissed the notion that dining couldn't be social and have serious food at the same time.Now, it seems like everyone knows what Iberico Ham is. Hipsters flock to restaurants that serve headcheese, tripe, and chicken livers. The food at the Purple Pig is a cross between Italian - Spanish - Mediterranean. The dishes come in tapas portions and are mostly designed for sharing. I think the portions work well for 2. Once you share among 3 or more, you risk enjoying a respectable mouthful of what the Chef had probably intended.The food here is good. Nothing blew me away. Then again,I am a sucker for egg yolks, grilled crostini, and pork. If you love any of those three things you will leave a happy client. We had:- Braised Baby Artichokes with Fingerling Potatoes,Asiago & Salami Toscana (artichokes were okay, but the potatoes were perfect)- Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes &Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (Have to like radishes and mint to enjoy)- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (Can't have enough Bone Marrow)- Jamon Serrano with Duck Egg, Asparagus& Grilled Bread (Lick Lick Lick your plate good)- Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Charred Green & WhiteAsparagus, Spring Onions & Piquillo Peppers (Hmmmmm!)The bottom line is that this place is a really fun and social place to chat over a glass of vino and some delicious small plates of food. The dining room feels like you're in someone's $100,000 country kitchen. The wine list has a good selection with many appropriately priced bottles. You are better off sharing a bottle of wine than ordering by the glass though. That isn't such a bad thing!I had heard so much about this place. I finally went. As they say on Facebook...I liked it."
"Great place, but be prepared to wait for a table!"
"Ordered the beats, fried devil egg, pork shoulder and mussels. The pork and mussels  were way too salty.  It was ok, but not worth the $$."
The purple pig is amazing and eclectic I love it! It is great European food with a modern chic twist I took my grandparents here on out trip to Chicago and though it was very crowded (unfortunately they don't take reservations hence the 4/5 stars] everything you eat there is going to be top notch and the waiters and waitresses are wonderful as well; over all great place to eat when not crowded.
"This place was recommended to me by one of my vendors who blends an organic version of my companies seasoning blend.  (worldseasonings.com).  Oh how thankful I am for the suggestion.  Now this is my kind of place.  The menu will keep you coming back for more. I was in Chicago for only 3 days and was lucky to be staying across the street at the Intercontinental Hotel off of Michigan Ave.  After I checked in, got my barrings and unpacked a bit, my stomach was grumbling with hunger.  So off I went to find the Purple Pig.  It was a Wednesday night, about 6 pm or so. (I didn't leave until 10 pm)  I'm not sure if the place takes a reservation, but I would call and see if you can get your name on the waiting list or make a reso if you can.  It's packed.  I was rolling solo, which made it rather easy for me to get a seat at the bar.  It's not a large restaurant by any means...so know this before you go.  You might have to wait for 45 minutes or more - but trust me on this, it's well worth every minute.  There is a reason this place was named one of the 10 best restaurants in America by Bon Appetit!  So...what to eat?  Well, let me preface this by stating that I ate at this restaurant for two days in a row, and tonight will be my third.  Here is a list of what i have tried so far.  (I'm a pretty social guy so it was fun to make friends with other diners sitting at the bar - I met 2 great doctors that were in town from Australia and New Guinea that loved food as much as I do, so we ordered and shared a lot)Antipasti:*Charred Cauliflower  - it was amazing!*Burrata Pugliese - best combination of flavors I've tried with Burrata*Shaved Brussels sprouts - this is a raw dish, great for 2 people*Roasted Butternut Squash with brown butter, pumpkin seeds and grated Ricotta Salata.  I will make a version of this for my website.  Check back soon for recipe.  It was possibly the sweetest butternut squash I've ever tried!  Fried Items:*Pigs Ear - just like bacon and eggs!  This place should do breakfast too.Smears:*Pork neck bone gravey - perfect for dipping bread.  I'd eat a bowl now!*Foie Gras & Membrillo - Don't even know words to describe this...it was divine!*Charred Green Onions with Romesco Sauce - only thing better is my recipe for charred green onions (worldseasonings.com for recipe)*Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - seriously?  Pork you can eat with a spoon, it's that tender!*Mussels with Panchetta - just try it!  I said, try it!!! *Razor Clams - so simple, you can taste the ocean!*Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots - like butter.  really, the most tender i've ever tried (to be honest, the only I've ever tried)*""JLT"" Pork Jowl, tomato and Frisee - best variation of a BLT in the world, Guaranteed!*Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde.  Only Staton 4, in Washington DC can compete.  *Balsamic braised Pigs Tail with grated egg and Parsley - have you ever tried to grate an egg?  Me neither - but the balsamic taste so damn good on pig tails!   Dessert:*Lemon Panna Cotta -  Even the Romans need to try this one! *Festa di Santa Lucia Crema - who ever thought Farro was a dessert?  Do it...don't be scared.  IT was my favorite of all deserts.*Bread Pudding - ummmm, yeah, it was Heaven in every bite!    The service is great.  Jamie behind the bar is amazing with knowledge of food and wine.  For sure made my experience that much more enjoyable!  Overall - well, it's not one of the top 10 restaurants in America.  No, it's top 5!  Easily made my list of top 5 places I have ever dined!"
"Came to this place based on the high rating from the Yelpers.  The atmosphere - is off the charts!  Its has a great high energy vibe that makes you feel part of the Chicago night life.  Being from SoCal - I just loved that aspect of it.We sat at the bar because it was SUPER crowded (even for a Thursday winter night) - glad we did because we had fun interacting with our cutie pie Bartender - Quaid.We ordered the beets/goat cheese and pistachio because there were many reviews on Yelp that RAVED about this.... let me save you - HALT don't DO THIS - unless you've never ever had this combination before ... otherwise, its nothing special.  I often make salads that include beets & goat cheese - so I was like scratching my head and expecting it to be an amazing mouth watering experience... I can make this one in 5 minutes at home.  (You're welcome!)I told Quaid that the beets were really ""pedestrian"" and he nodded without hesitation said, let me order you something else you'll like better - he ordered us the roasted cauliflower w/ parsley  appetizer and it was GOOD!We also ordered:- Butternut Squash Arancini/Sage pesto- Coppa Panini- Wild Striped sea bass - blood orange & celery leafThese were all excellent.And then we come to desserts.... Oh Yeah!Quaid, who reminded me of someone out of an episode of Sex N the City - because he has such a easy going, sweet, cute personality w/out being over the top about it...  but I'm a faithfully married woman (but I'm not dead)... anyhow, I digress - sorry... Quaid wasn't the dessert - but he did give us a sampling of the  soft serve ice creams - both the pistachio and the toasted cinnamon... then we ordered the Lemon Panna Cotta which I HIGHLY recommend.Glad I was able to experience the tastings of the Purple Pig!  Some good eats for sure - if you see Quaid - give him a hello for me!  :)"
"I was originally turned off by this place because the restaurants tag line is ""cheese, swine & wine"".  Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE cheese and wine fan, but prefer to not eat pork.  After months of hesitating about going in, a friend and I decided to finally check it.Upon entry the staff was all smiles and very friendly.  I could tell it gets pretty crowded pretty quickly (the entire place probably only holds approximately 50 people) and was pleased I decided to get there at 5pm with my friend arriving shortly after.I initially noticed the wide mouth wine glasses on the table (it's the small things that make me happy) and got very excited.  While waiting on my friend to arrive, I perused the wine list and was happy to see there are no American wines on the list.  I've gotten into the habit of drinking mostly American wine and wanted to expand my palate and here was my chance. Also, I was glad to see this is a small plate restaurant which I absolutely love. After my friend arrived, we settled on a 2007 bottle of Cotes du Rhone blend, Les Abeilles - from France of course ($40) and we were very pleased.  We decided to order the hazelnut salad, whipped feta smear and a medley of cheeses (camembert, truffle tremor and prairie breeze).  Everything was amazingly good.  I was in cheese and wine heaven.  Our entire bill was $74.The waitress was so helpful and pleasant - she made me feel like a valued guest.I plan to visit TPP more frequently and experience more of their extensive wine and food selections."
"My lady and I have been wanting to go into this place for a while, so when my birthday rolled around, she took me in for lunch before we went on my annual birthday bender and cubs game. Showed up around 115, and we're promptly sat outside. Took a few minutes for the waiter to showed up, but it was sort of busy so we weren't too concerned. When he came over, he didn't introduce himself, just asked what we wanted, and when we told him we hadn't been there before he just said okay and walked off. If this guy would've put in ANY effort, he could've pushed our tab up another 30-40 bucks. Any way, this apparently is a hip place to get lunch, so bad service was to be expected.So we stared at this menu for a good 15 minutes before our beers showed up, which was pretty good and considering it was spanish paired pretty well with all the pork this place dishes out. We ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, which tasted like deep fried cocktail olives(which they were, our fault,) the neckbone gravy which was really good, the milk braised pork shoulder which was awesome, and the serrano ham on grilled bread and a duck egg which was the ultimate disappointment. I have never eaten such a salty dish in my life. And it wasn't the ham, it was the seemingly fistful of rocksalt sprinkled over the egg. I couldn't eat it and my girlfriend, who's kind of picky and took forever for me to convince to try a duck egg beforehand, looked at me like I was crazy.When I mentioned it to my server, asking why it was so salty, he told me the ham is supposed to be salty. I asked him if the ham is salty, why all the salt on top, he just looked at me. I told him he could take it away and to please bring the check. Believe it or not, the check came almost instantaneously, fastest I'd seen him move all day. So disappointed."
"Finally got a chance to eat at the Purple Pig and it was definitely a great experience. Our server was extremely friendly and welcoming and also knowledgeable about the menu. The wine list is extensive, but I stuck with the Kolsch that they had on tap was which nice and refreshing. For starters we had the beets and the chorizo stuffed fried olives. The beets were tasty with some great cheese mixed in and there were plenty of them. The olives were salty as hell but damn good. For the main I had the milk braised pork shoulder (on top of mashed potatoes). Again, this was very tasty, the pork was super tender and broke apart easily with a fork (as should be). The menu has some great variety in terms of pig products: pig ears, terrine, marrow, etc. Can't wait to come back for some more..."
"I was really excited to try Purple Pig for a long time, and overall it just didn't meet the hype. I went on a Tuesday evening for dinner with a friend, and we didn't have to wait at all for a little table outside (under the heat lamps, thank goodness!) We chose four dishes: the beet and goat cheese (very yummy but not hard to make), the poached tuna with greek lima beans (very yummy and refreshing), the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (delicious and savory), and the bone marrow spread (absolutely inedible - I just ate the bread - yuck!) The desserts were probably the best part of the meal - I had the bread pudding, which was superb, and my friend had the lemon panna cotta, which was very tasty but was only sweet and I would have liked it a little more tangy.Service sucked, our waitress was sorta rude to us and made absolutely no effort to make us feel welcome. She also pestered us to order every 2 minutes. Overall, it was okay but better food (and a lot of it) certainly exists in Chicago and I wouldn't waste your time waiting hours for a table here."
As good as they say! Fantastic wines & the Roasted Beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette was the best beet & cheese ap Ive had anywhere.Minus one star for unnecessary loud level of music esp for such a small room
"I love to taste tastes of many things.  And the Purple Pig allows you to do just that with their small plate format.  I thought all the plates sounded so interesting that I wanted to try them all, but then that would be just silly so I limited myself.  My dining partner and I shared Tuna and Lima Beans ($4.00).  It sounds so simple, is so simple and yet so good.  Our second was Fried Olives ($6.00) stuffed with chorizo and coated in a batter, served on a white sauce.  Again, simple and good.  Next came Pig's Ear ($9.00), crisp and crunchy.  Not my fav, but my dining partner, and hubby, enjoyed it a lot.  The Roasted Bone Marrow ($9.00) was a decadent treat.  Soft, juicy and spoonable.  So good.  But my favorite for the day came last, Octopus with Acini di Pep ($10.00).  Delicious.  Perfectly tender, perfectly cooked.  One of the many nice things about the Purple Pig's wine list is, any bottle of wine on the list can be purchased as a half bottle.  A very nice idea, especially when you are having many different small plates of flavor.LindySez:  It's a bit of a wait for a table, but worth it!  And the way it's set up, with some communal tables, it's easy to make some new friends over lunch."
"The Purple Pig was a true treat.  We randomly stumbled upon it while looking for a good place to have lunch in Chicago before attending the Dave Matthews Caravan this weekend - and found a culinary delight! The Calamari may have been my favorite. Uniquely served chilled with pistachio and hints of lemon. We also enjoyed Chorizo Stuffed Olives and Prosciutto Bread Balls. The olive lovers that i was with especially raved about these. Salty, fried, with a Chorizo kick. Our party of 4 also shared 2 Paninis: Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade and Porchetta with Salsa Verde. This Salsa Verde really was a fantastic addition to the Porchetta Panini.We also treated ourselves to a Pork Smear. YUMM! All of this paired with a refreshing Vinho Verde."
"Amazingly good...Tapas with a twist...I love to graze and taste different dishes.  We arrived about 10pm on 9/1 0 the place was packed with a 35 minute wait list, we got seated in 10 minutes (we knew a guy !) when we left at 11:30 it was still packed so plan accordingly get ready to wait.Sat at the bar in front of the kitchen, four of us ordered appetizers; Pig Tail, Sardines, Bone Marrow, Pork Shoulder, Olives and Almonds in garlic, Fried Manchego, Raw Corn Sald, the dishes were fresh, creative,   flavorful, executed perfectly and were all unbelievably good I mean really lip smacking delicious and thats coming from a serious foodie and a chef.I will go back as often as I can, the athmosphere was very hip and you could almost touch the energy in the place, not a large restaurant you can eat outside at least for now that will change in the winter of course.Service tended to be a bit patchy, had to wait a little too long for wine refills, that can be corrected which it should be to make the overall experience a Wow !I would highly recommend The Purple Pig to anyone who enjoys great food."
"Been here at least half dozen times, of all those times, twice were absolutely wonderful 5 star worthy and rest were an absolute nightmare, so it averages to a 3.Start with good- late summer night, small group, relatively empty restaurants, attentive wait staff, CHEAP wine, decent beer selection and oh so so many yummy delicious stuff to choose from! I am a huge fan of the beet salads(I always order it to make me feel less guilty), pork shoulder (when I am in the mood),  skirt steak (so worth it). Then there is the bad- as much as I love this place, it is just overhyped. crowded and damn uncomfortable sometimes when it's filled. The communal table is uncomfortable and I always feel like I will knock someone's table over. I get it, the communal concept is ""in"" (not really anymore), but seriously, communal table, tight space AND high table is NOT a good mix. getting in and out of the table is always a struggle (that's my problem, I know, I am short at 5'4'', but still, shouldn't they take short customers into consideration?). There's something off about the acoustic of this place and it's always impossible to hear each other when you are inside. The hostess always seen overwhelmed because they don't take reservation and there is always a 2 hours wait and the hostess stand is positioned in such an awkward corner. I get irritated just thinking about it. All in all, I feel like I'll always having a good experience coming here as long as I eat out at the patio and not actually step inside....The food is definitely above average but they really should consider hiring a new interior design team.  Oh and the bone marrow? fatty, no favor, they never give you enough toasts to go with it....being Asian, I love bone marrow, but why spend money to suck on flavorless fat? I guess I just don't get it."
"The food here is good, but it's SO heavy. Perhaps their menu didn't pair well with the extraordinary weather in March. But if that's their menu year round, I'd only visit at the most once in a year. Definitely go for the pork liver smear and the friend sardines."
"This place is right up my alley.  Small plates to share, so you can have a taste of everything!  Favs: Shaved brussel sprouts, Roasted bone marrow and some cheese dish I cannot remember what is was...oh and great wine!"
"I arrived here with a party of four at 7pm on a Saturday night.  We were finally seated a quarter before 10.  Yes, we waited for almost three hours.  Its really a shame they don't take reservations.  This place is small, packed, and crowded.  Big emphasis on crowded.  Most tables are communal so you are smashed up against other parties.  I can't wait to come here during the summer when they offer outdoor seating.Our server informed us that a couple dishes were sold out for the night.  Big bummer.  I was looking forward to the fried prosciutto bread balls.  Anyway, we still managed to order a whole lot from the menu.  I recommend the fried pig's ears, octopus with green beans, and my absolute favorite dish of the night- milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. yum yum yum.  The pork shoulder just melts in your mouth.  I had a great time at this place, despite the long wait.  I've learned my lesson and will arrive well past the dinner rush hour.  Food was simple and delicious and well priced.  Nine dishes, two desserts, and 2 glasses of wine each, with tax and tip we paid around $50 each.  Not bad, not bad at all for all that food and fun."
"We generally love the food at PP, but did not have a good experience yesterday.  Two members of our party had the razor clams and within an hour they both had stomach upsets and diarrhea.  I went to the net and found that razor clams can accumulate a toxin that causes these symptoms.  I think that these clams caused their symptoms.  We called PP to alert them so that they could look into the problem, so other customers would not get the runs.  So avoid the razor clams at the PP."
"Being from out of state I was eager to find a ""Chicago"" restaurant. When a friend suggested Purple Pig I was intrigued. After following the large purple sign we entered through a misguiding door into the restaurant. We arrived at 7pm and were told a 15-20 minute wait. The two of us were put at a small table by the window and given menus. If our waitstaff hadn't explained the menu we'd have been lost. The menu items didn't have descriptions, which led us to use our phones to look items up. Both us are adventurous eaters and decided to start off with the stuffed olives...amazing!!! We then ordered Pork Liver Paté which came out in a large square bowl served with fruit sauce, sea salt, and toasted bread. This was one of the best things I've ever had. The pate was creamy and flavorful. Lastly we tried the Prairie Breeze which came out wedge style with crackers. Both of us agreed it was not our favorite. After finishing and getting our bill it only came out to $18 for two people. We were both stuffed and went away with a good deal and great food. I can't wait to go back to Chicago!"
"A beautiful summer night, a wonderful new friend and wine... and food... and sitting outside in said beautiful night... can we line these ducks up anymore?After a day of intense longness, a friend and I texted each other about meeting for a drink. Or two. And perhaps a nosh. Or two. Since she was staying on the Mag. Mile, we decided I would meet her down there after we got done with our engagements for the night. I arrived first, the hostess was kind enough to shout a little loud since the place was pumping with a plethora of people pouncing on drinks left and right. Slightly surprising at 9:30pm, but on a beautiful night like this, not really. The space is small, a wee bit too cozy, but after staring at the amazing list of cheeses on the wall, I was left a little excited and hungry. When my guest arrived, we were given a chance to sit at the communal table outside which we took. Definitely quieter, the best thing about the area was since it was later, traffic had died down, the greenery was lush, the air heavy with slight humidity and summer warmth... it nearly transported me to being somewhere other than downtown Chicago. The wine list was interesting and fairly diverse. Countless countries were highlighted, absolutely good prices on many bottles. Seeing as I was the only one drinking wine, I opted for a white from Portugal. And as seeing as I was the only one having something to eat, I opted for a simple crispy salad with radishes and a mint vinaigrette and sampling of Jimmy's Greek sausages with rapini and grapes. As we chatted about life and our passions, (no. seriously. we did.), I was quite happy with the salad. Not only was it refreshing, especially with the mint, it was well balanced with the mint not overpowering the rest of the salad. Refreshing, tasty and balanced. Well done. The sausage was roughly ground with some of the cut up pieces getting a little more browned and crispy, delicious, well seasoned and well prepared. The slightly wilted greens helped to soak up those succulent flavors of the sausage. The place is small plates, the wine list is great, the beer list is good, it's tiny but transformative of downtown Chicago. The service was great, our waitress was always on top of things, but never on top of us. A definite must and if you can snag an outdoor seat while the weather can't be beat... you might just be a little closer to trying to hide that smile at the end of the night."
"Eating here was really the highlight of visiting Chicago. I came here with 2 other people on a Wednesday night w/o reservations and had to wait about 30 minutes. The food here is served tapas style, so its great way for you to sample their menu. We ordered a bunch of things like, Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. However, the one thing that blew us all away, made the long wait worth it, made the trip to Chicago tolerable and change all of our perceptions of how pork can taste is.....wait for it....wait for it....the Pork Blade Steak with Nduja & Honey!! If you go to the Purple Pig you have to try this item on the menu. I guarantee that you will not want to share. Oh and for dessert go for the Affogato {Shot of Espresso over Espresso Soft Serve}!"
Thank you Yelpers! My friends and I tried this place based on reviews. The food was awesome---really good. It's fun to order a variety of dishes and share everything.
"You'll be happy if you go.  Trust me.  FOOD: Modern, reasonably priced, interesting without being weird. (Pig's ear with kale, pork chop with 'nduja).SERVICE:  Excellent, friendly.  They have a cocktail service for the waiting area, which is big and outside but still tucked away - great setup, best I've seen in Chicago.  We only waited about 30-40 minutes around 8pm on a Friday night, and it flew by.AMBIANCE:  Not overly hip, but a cool place.  Dylan-Jimi-Zeppelin-Bowie type music, fairly noisy.  You might get put at the family-style bar-type seating, which some people don't like.  It's tight inside, but not uncomfortable.  It's European-feeling.We stayed in Chicago for a four-day weekend and went to a bunch of restaurants - this was the best all-around dinner spot we found.  Highly recommend."
"I ate at The Purple Pig on Saturday night and thought it was good. We were there at 5, so we were seated right away. My first impression was that the place was very loud, however, it only seemed to get louder while we were there. Maybe it was because the tables were so close to one another. I could barely hear my friend across the table, let alone the people next to us!The waitress recommended my friend and I order about 5-6 dishes to share. We were hungry, but not too hungry, so we decided to start with three and go from there. What we ordered: 1. Salt roasted beets-sweet and delicious. The goat cheese was light and perfect--loved it!Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta-excellent toasted bread, rich layered tomato sauce, delicious cheese.Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes-good, very tender, but a little too salty, sparse mashed potatoes--mostly good!After the three dishes we felt full and decided not to order anything else. The waitress seemed a little annoyed that we only ordered the three dishes, but she was nice enough and the service overall seemed good. When we left around 6, there were throngs of people waiting outside. I would recommend getting there earlier if you don't want to wait!"
"Thanks to Yelp, we were aware of the Purple Pig and its reputation.  On a trip to Chicago for Christmas we really wanted to give it a try, but they don't take reservations.  So we avoided it because we just did not want to spend hours waiting.  Especially when there are plenty of other good restaurants nearby.   So while walking around the north loop on Sunday afternoon, we passed by it and thought, lets give it a try.  Maybe lunch won't be so crowded.I'm so glad we did.  They were busy, but we were seated immediately at a communal bench like table of 6 other people.   This was the surprise part of the visit; the fun we had meeting our tablemates and comparing notes and oohing and ahhing over each others order.Brian, our server, was great and patiently endured our many questions, no doubt answered just minutes before by our fellow diners, about the menu, how to order and recommendations.   The menu changes often he said, and the style is a sort of tapas style small plate.   We started with a cheese plate, selecting 3 cheeses from an assortment of maybe 20.   We had 3 people and we each got maybe 3-4 bites of each type of cheese.   Came with baked bread and some jam.  Wonderful.  My wife loved the blue cheese and she normally doesn't eat it.   We wanted to try something new so got the bone marrow smear.   Came as a big bone cut in half and filled with delicious baked marrow.   So creamy and buttery.  Put it on some toast with a few greens.  Yum!   Enough for 2-3 little half sandwiches for each of us.    Next we tried the butternut squash small dish.  I am not a fan, but my wife loves it.   I'm glad we got it.  Not too sweet and mixed with a variety of herbs and seeds, it was a real good side to the bone marrow.  That was enough for us, but our tablemates all seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.  We still talk about the bone marrow and will definitely go back and try one of the other things on the menu next time in town,   And meet some new friends."
"I attempted to come here the previous two nights and ran into a 45 minute and 1 hour wait, respectively. I gave it another try tonight and man am I glad I did.This my first review on Yelp. Mostly because I have been lazy over the last year with the app. But the Purple Pig is definitely worthly of my first review. I ordered the Pork Neck Bone Rilette & Mostarda and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Njuda & Honey. I have no idea what the ingredients mean but I don't really care. The Rilette came first and had a pate with it and bread. It could be best described as a bruschetta. The flavor combinations were amazing.Next came the blade steak and the honey glaze was excellent.The wine list is also one of the more extensive I have seen, especially for a out of the way restaurant like this.Too bad I won't be near this place next week. Otherwise I would be back. I may just change my hotel back to the Marriott just to be closer. Enjoy."
"The first time I passed by The Purple Pig I was drawn to it, and I knew I had to go.. Cheese, Swine and Wine sounded just about right. I was visiting Chicago for Lollapalooza and the best way to end a great music weekend was by having lunch at The Purple Pig.They know very well how to portray the new and trendy ""tapas and open kitchen gastropub concept"".Our meal:- Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, yummm. The tartness and smoothness of the whipped goat cheese combines perfectly with the sweetness of the beets and the crunchiness of the pistachios.- Calamari Salad with Radishes, Farro & Cucumbers. So refreshing and light, definitely a great way to portray all the ingredients. It's one of those dishes that the more you eat it the more you like it. - From the smears we had the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, and WOW a great decision that was!! This smear is so ridiculously good, I still remember the thoughts that were running through my mind while I was eating it. I wanted less bread, more smear. I swear, they should sell it... I would buy a few jars.- So let's continue the food journey with Pig's Ear, Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg.. This is what I call my ""ok to clog an artery for"" type of dish. The ears are cut so thin and are so crispy, the cherry peppers add the perfect spice and acidity, and of course the fried egg and its runny yolk are THE way to top this off tying all the flavors together.  Our other two plates after this weren't as remarkable as the prior ones but still good.- The Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche & Marjoram and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey. The mussels were well cooked and the sauce was great for ""bread dunking"". The pork blade was somewhat disappointing, but this doesn't mean it wasn't good. It just was too big of a portion, too much meat and not as exciting as all other dishes.Their beer selection is also very good and their ambiance is casual and relaxed. I loved my experience in The Purple Pig and will make it a ""must go"" every time I visit Chicago."
"Pigs ear, bone marrow smear, chorizo stuffed olives? Feeling adventurous, so I tried them all. It was delicious! The pigs ear was my favorite. It was served with greens and an over easy egg. It tasted like a light and crispy thin bacon, like a yummy breakfast dish. Bone marrow smear was interesting, a mild smear served with greens and sea salt.  Chorizo stuffed olives were fried and had a nice crunch to them. I would recommend the restaurant, our server wasn't that great so I rated it a 4. Be prepared to wait! It was a popular place and I was there on a Thursday with a 45 minute wait at 8 p.m.For those visiting Chicago, this restaurant is right next to Nordstroms on the miracle mile."
"So much pork!! The portions are tricky some are filling but can have small portions.  They suggested getting two plates per person so you can share.  My friend and I got the bone marrow, the camambert cheese, and the milk braised pork shoulder.  Even though  we only had  three plates, it was still pretty heavy and filling. Pretty big selection of wine, but a lot of it was foreign so kinda difficult to decide which to get (no explanation of the wines included in the menu either, only that they are red or white).  Also some instructions on how to eat some of their dishes would've been nice too. I would probably skip the bone marrow next time, it was good, but too greasy and rich for me."
"I've been wanting to go in for a year now and wish I had gone in once a week for the last year!First, Lukas our bartender was fantastic! ?He helped me pick exactly the right wine and with minimal instruction created a few cocktails for my wife that she loved. She never gets that buzzed but this night she couldn't help herself!The beets, how good can beets be? No better than this for sure. The butternut squash with toasted pumpkin seeds served warm, couldn't stop till the bowl was clean.Awesome cheese, only wish it was a little less chilled but still great. The truffle tremor was our fav.The Sepia was cooked just right. Not chewy and tons of fresh oceany flavor.The pigs tails, maybe my personal fav. So tender and flavorful. I could have had more!The roasted bone marrow was the other contender for best dish. WOW! make sure you get that one.If you don't get and Iris for dessert you my friend are an idiot!A beignet full of sweet ricotta a chocolate chips like a canolli. If you miss that you're a fool!We had a few other things that were all great but you'll just have to go cheack it out yourself!Now GO!"
"Overall:  Fantastic place specializing in pig-derived portions.   Friendly waitstaff, good selection of food and drinks, and very reasonably priced (considering it's on Michigan Ave)!The Purple Pig.  You've heard all about this place.  Reviewers rave.  All your friends talk about it.  Is it really that good?The answer is yes.  Unless you can't eat pork products.  In which case, I feel sorry for you, and we'll meet at Avec.Everything on the menu is great.  Highlights include their pate and the to-die-for, let-me-lick-the-plate-clean, braised pork shoulder.  Even the bread is good.  The overall meal will run you less than $30 per person including wine, which is a ridiculous bargain for where you are and what you get.  Don't blame me if you get fat though.  Not the place for the health-conscious."
"Excellent Tapas style food and very nice drink selections. Ate Sweet Bread for the first time, didn't realize you can make pig's brain like chicken nuggets. The Marrow was delicious. Pig Ears were interesting, still very tasty. Overall, very nice place."
"Oh how I wish this pig was much much fatter. Preferably tripled in size. The only thing preventing a 5 star review would be the cramped conditions we had to experience this amazing food in. I'm not adverse to communal dining at all, but it seems like 1 or 2 too many people were squeezed into each table. Such a wonderful problem to be had by a new-ish award winning restaurant.I really need to send many thanks to Anthony Bourdain for demystifying all these delicious neglected portions of the pig and old world applications. 5 years ago Pork Neck Bone Rillette would have went WAY over my head instead of into my mouth. It will win you over if you are afraid of spreadable meat.Also: I want a side of smelt with every sandwich I ever eat. Even better than fries (of the land)!"
"Nose to tail menu. Ran across it while visiting the magnificent mile. A sign out front promised ""wine, swine and cheese"". Swine, who says swine? I hoped for odd piggy parts and was not disappointed. It wasn't too busy as it was an odd hour, 3.30 on a Thursday. Skip the meatball sliders, don't waste your appetite on such a mundane offering. Go straight to the crispy fried pork jowl resting on sauteed mushrooms sitting on a crusty sliced bread and topped with a duck egg. It's a rare find to have sweetbreads, tail and ear on a menu. ""I'll eat anything if it's prepared well"" and here, it's prepared very well."
"Went to Chicago this past weekend and a friend took us here as our first place to eat when we arrived. Excellent choice!The food is tapas-style which I absolutely adore; I could dine on pick-food and wine every single day if given the opportunity. There were 4 of us, so the small plates were just enough for each of us to have at least one bite of everything we ordered. ""Beer, Swine & Wine"" is a lovely motto to have! We started out with a bottle of red wine that was delicious. I don't know what it was, since I didn't do a lot of the ordering....I just trusted my company. For food, we sampled some assorted cheeses, the razor clams, chorizo olives, lardo-something on bread (which I assume by the name that it was straight pork fat slathered on a crostini), proscuitto bread balls, Pig's ear with crispy kale, peppers & fried egg, a cold eggplant dish, and finished off with a second bottle of wine and a ricotta and chocolate filled fried pastry-type thing for dessert. (Can't remember what it was called!)As with many restaurants in big cities, the seating is a bit tight in there and we were sharing a large table with a few strangers. I don't really mind this, unless you get stuck next to stains. Our server was an absolute DOLL also, I can't remember her name but she was terrific. Bus staff also promptly cleared empty tapas plates in the cramped quarters to make room for the next plate of deliciousness. Would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago ~ and the bonus is that it was very close to our hotel (Hyatt Regency on Wacker & Michigan) as it was very windy and rainy there this weekend!"
"The Purple Pig does a lot of things well, some things not that well, and almost none of it with originality. Small plates, lots of cheeses, locally-sourced meats and seasonal veg, communal seating, bar towel linens, etc...sound familiar? Yep, it should. That aside, the smattering of dishes we ordered were for the most part, tasty. The roasted and salted beets were excellent, the poached egg crostini with asparagus and parma ham (I'm sure that's not exactly right but you get the idea) was very tasty. The avocado, fennel and carrot salad was one of the aforementioned missteps however - cooked carrots, the bane of my culinary existence - was bland. We ordered a few more items which while I remember enjoying, don't totally remember. Oh but for the powdered, chocolate-filled sort of donut thing we got for dessert...that was very decadent and tasty.The wine list is long and very reasonably priced, and most come in three possible sizes. The outdoor seating along Michigan and Illinois (or is it the river? We couldn't investigate, it was pouring) is really lovely. Tall and short tables, lovely flower boxes and probably some choice people watching. I made a mental note to try them for a post-work drink and bite one of these days.The service was nicely sparse, the food was paced evenly and accurately and the bill was - surprisingly for the location - quite reasonable. The Purple Pig isn't anything you've not seen already. It's a mix of Publican, Quartino, Avec and some of the newer small plates places popping up all over creation, but it has some goods to back it up as long as they can even out the execution."
"Pretentious, shitty service and a high maintenance and lazy wait staff eradicate an otherwise creative and tasty menu. Our waitress screwed up our order by not entering half of it into the system. We waited 50 minutes for the food because when she re-entered the order she placed it at the bottom of the queue instead of at the top.  To make matters worse she didn't apologize and instead was irritated at us for being irritated. Ridiculous."
"Amazing! This is now one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Every thing we ordered was delicious. We had the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios; a meet and cheese platter with blue cheese, chorizo, and jamon; crispy fried pigs ears and kale; pork shoulder with mashed potatoes; and octopus with fingerling potatoes. It was seriously amazing and the service was great. I wish they took reservations as it was almost a two hour wait on a Saturday night but we went across the street to the Eno wine bar and the restaurant called us when our table was ready. I also wish there were more than 2 unisex bathrooms but the line wasn't extraordinarily long so it was ok. Neither the bathrooms or the wait will stop me from going back again and again!"
"After hearing many raves about this place and the fantastic reviews on yelp, I planned a trip here over two weeks for a celebratory dinner. Since PP is located on Michigan Ave, parking was not an easy feat. no valet. My party of three was told that it would be a 45 min wait around 7pm on a Wednesday, which we kinda expected. They took down my friend's number and called her when our table was ready. When we were back at PP, the hostess led us to the end of the communal table with the super high chairs... I'm vertically challenged, climbing on top of my seat was almost comical. Furthermore, there was not a lot of surface area for our menus, drinks and eventually our food. We were constantly trying try rearrange our plates and glassware to fit. I don't quite understand why were seated there when there were other normal size tables open at the time. Our waitress was very attentive during our visit but she went AWOL after we asked for the check. On to the food. We ordered the following:- Roasted Beets with goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette - beets didn't taste like anything, maybe a spoonful of the goat cheese. Dish was alright.- Fried devil egg with caper berries - Should've read the description closely, it's one egg, people! One! For $6, would it kill them be give us another egg or two? Nothing special about it, Anything fried is good. - Fried pig ear with crispy kale - It didn't taste like anything other than SALT. The entire dish was over salted. Coming from someone who had pigs ear ever since I was a kid, the pigs ear tasted nothing like pigs ear. Kale was good though.- Fois gras - this is the second time I've tried fois gras and I was surprised when I didn't taste anything other than it was slightly sweet and the butter on the toast... Not sure what they were trying to do with it but it tasted nothing like the fois gras I had at David Burke's.- Roasted bone marrow - bone itself looked super dried out, the marrow itself was oily and didn't taste like anything. Again tasted only the toast it was on.... I had marrow before and doesn't come close to what we had.- Buttermilk brined quail with pomegranate sauce - mehh, it was alright.- Razor Clams - Salty and rubbery- Milk braised pork shoulder and mash potatoes - pork was nice and tender the mash was really good.- Mussels with pancetta - really good and highly recommend. the sauce is really good, especially with bread.Overall, I was really disappointed with PP, I expected much more than mediocre food, especially for the amount they were charging. I won't be back and pretty sure the other members in my party won't be back either."
"Once again, Love this place.This time, my boyfriend and I asked about the wait time (hour fifteen) but headed straight for an empty chair and place setting (yes, single empty chair) and started our dinner. He was standing behind me as I was passing a plate back. Our server/bartender was awesome! When the ladies chatting over after dinner WATERS moved their bag, our server/bartender asked if he could sit there.Great food, great staff, and great people who come here!We were good customers and enjoyed our time but got out of their once our meal was over. We got hazelnut ice cream to-go and gave up our bar seats to a lovely couple who was apparently waiting for those women STILL chatting away with their after dinner WATERS. So my boyfriend and I walked home (a few blocks) with the beautiful Christmas lights adorning the trees, our ice cream in hand, talking about the wonderful time we had. How romantic :)"
"One standout saved this dinner from spiteful one stardom, salted beets. Fantastic, salted beets with mascarpone cheese (or similar).  One of the first innovative dishes I have had for some time in the context of ""American"" or bistro dining.Otherwise, everything else was really salty, and/or poorly executed. The olive oil cured tuna with gigandes was just ok; the hunks of tuna were oddly hewn.  The cheese plate came with two large pieces of cheese and three wee pieces of bread. Likewise, the octopus was only two small pieces, not exactly matching the waitress's description.Finally, and the real dealbreaker, we sat outside on the patio, which seemed lovely in the first 10 minutes. Seven large mosquito bites later, and one massive spider crawling across boyfriend's button down was enough. The trees and foliage are too close to the tables, resulting in te spider and mosquito incidents. When we asked whether we could move inside due to the insect invasion, we were informed it would be 30 minutes...while we accumulated more mosquito bites.PP started out well and then crashed and burned. I won't be back."
"I am debating whether to give this place a 3 or 4 star. Good food, but very oily & salty. almonds - yum, but oilypig's eat with crispy kale - very goodbone marrow - burnt bread & too oilypork blade steak - very very goodjamon with asparagus - very salty, but it is jamonmilk braised pork shoulder - wowbutterscotch budino - too sweetsicilian iris - goodThis place reminds me strongly of Spain, I have to say I like the dishes, but not the oiliness."
"We came around 5pm on a Thursday and there was only one other table seated inside. For some reason it took about 10 minutes before anyone decided to wait on us, which kind of sucked because we were really, really thirsty after walking over here. Our waiter seemed like he really couldn't care less about us and we joked that we wouldn't get our drinks until some of our food started coming out...which ended up being true and not a joke after all.The beets with goat cheese were good. The fava beans with prosciutto were awesome. The meatball sliders were really good. I enjoyed the cucumber and feta smear. Really disliked that we were never given clean plates over the course of the entire meal. The chicken kabobs were the highlight. They were amazing. Also awesome was the fact that our busser took time to explain to us questions we had about the food since our waiter seemed lost in his own little world. I'd probably have given four stars if service had been better. I really liked the interior of the place and there are still things on the menu I want to try."
"I've been to many wine bars, and the purple pig is one of the best! Where to start???Location: It's on Michigan Ave which is very easy to get to and filled with stores and people walking around. Since is the holiday season all the Christmas decorations were up and the trees were lit. The Purple Pig sign that you walk under is so unique and leads you to the door!Ambiance: Ok- yes it's loud but it's a wine bar! I could hear my boyfriend with out any trouble so no complaints. I like the community seating for some reason. It just feels cozy! The inside is nice, not over done and not bare. Service: There was an hour wait for 2. Not a big deal- we are on Michigan Ave so there was plenty to see and do during the wait! The hostess girls were SO nice and accommodating. They took our number so they could give us a call when the table would be ready. They were so personable and talked to us as well. Our server was so nice and helpful! She even gave us suggestions on where to eat breakfast since we are out of towners :)Wine and food: The wine was amazing. Best moscato I've ever had! My boyfriend had an appetizer and he said it was so good. He ate it pretty quickly so it had to be bomb! The prices were not that steep either. It was our favorite place we went to on our vacation and we will definitely be back!"
"Yes, Yes and Yes!  Several friends recommended I visit on my first trip to Chicago.  Reservations are not offered here so when I arrived to a 4 hour wait, I giggled and said ""oh well"".  I tried again on a Sunday night and welcomed the hour-plus wait, but quickly found 2 spots at the bar which are first-come first serve.  I'm glad we scored this spot, because we throroughly enjoyed the extremely knowledgable bartender and watching the talented chefs work their magic.  Have the bone marrow and the pork sweetbreads.  I would have licked the plate if it would have been acceptable.  Bravo PP, Bravo!"
"I have been here 3 times and I love this place. THe food is great (Roasted bone marrow crostini  mmmmmm), plenty of choices for beer and wine. Servers are knowledgable but not in your face. The only downside is that it is always super crowded and doesn't take reservations."
"Where do I even begin?  I started eating pork for the first time IN MY LIFE a few weeks ago.  Decided that The Purple Pig would be the best place to get adventurous. The reasonable prices and no wait helped too.My bf and I sat at the bar where the very friendly and knowledgeable bartender guided us through our meal.  I'd recommend the croquettes, pork neck bone gravy (my fav), razor clams, and the pork jowl.  The restaurant itself has indoor and outdoor seating.  I'm partial to the  communal tables and the bar where you can watch the chefs do their thing.  Trust me, if this pork newbie loves the Purple Pig, you surely will."
"This is a great place to come for a happy hour on Friday after work, say, 3ish!  I had remarked to my friend, ""There shouldn't be much of a crowd at 3 on Friday"", but I was wrong!  This place was bustling, with the outdoor patio open (it was chilly, but they have multiple outdoor heaters).  We sat outside and had drinks and shared some small plates.  My favorite thing,  hands down, was the spring peas with red onions and feta. Also very tasty, and meaty, was the pork neck bone with ricotta.  Don't be turned off by the whole pork neck bone thing....it is sorta served in this croque with fresh sliced bread to spread. If you are into olives, order the fried ones here.  Reminiscent of fried pickles, the fatty/rich/bitter taste is delicious.  We also tried the milk braised pork shoulder.  It was good, not my favorite, but was very tender and served with mashed potatoes.The only thing I didn't like here was the hostess.  When we came into the restaurant to be seated, she acted like it was quite a chore to help us.  There are a lot of things on the menu, I will be back to try some other items."
"Amazing food. Was our first stop in Chicago to eat, and weren't the least disappointed. I ate the pork shoulder, pork gravy smear and the bone marrow. All were excellent. My least favorite of the three was the bone marrow. It was very greasy and fatting. Different and good, but definitely something I wasn't use to eating.  My wife had the cauliflower with pickles, this was my favorite dish. Extremely tastyHad some Belgium wheat-barley beer, excellent."
"That place was pretty damn good. You can tell that they have some good cooks and chefs with nice talent there.I'm curious as to when they added the bone marrow because when I went there a while ago, I don't think I saw that on the menu (could be wrong though, it's happened once....but only once).Another great thing about this place...great wine menu. Not just for the selection, but for the price. The bottles are definitely priced to sell for most people, not just the people that feel like throwing around $60 bucks for a bottle of Yellow Tail.Try to get a seat on the balcony on a good day, if you can."
"Outstanding. Fine service.  Fine wine. Fine swine. One thing...the wait for a table can be long. It's worth it, however, and they offer cocktail service while you wait outside."
"The octopus is amazing.  They also had great cheese; the servers are knowledgeable, and can match your taste preferences to a particular  cheese type.Almost worth 5 stars but I felt a little cramped in the restaurant.  They could also improve their beer selection."
"Great wine list, atmosphere and food. The variety of meats and cheeses are to die for. There is usually a 45 minute wait but well worth it!"
"This is a great place to grab drinks and apps after work.  The inside is festive. You sit at communal tables which I tend to like b/c you get to meet new people or if they are lame, you can choose to keep to yourself.The wine list is expansive and they have less expensive options ($35 - 40).  The staff is knowledgeable about the wines and offer many suggestions depending on your taste.  Great for groups!"
"The fact that this place is on the Mag Mile and involves the owners (chefs?)  of Heaven on Seven made me a little worried.  I'm happy (and also surprised) to say that the food didn't suck.Like any place that serves small plates, it's an experience more enjoyable if you go in a big group where you can try several items.  I don't recommend attempting this late on a Fri night. Based on the other reviews, maybe don't try this at all, at least until they can iron out some of the issues with their service.  I went with one other friend, and we were lucky to get a couple seats at the bar (which is actually preferrable to the communal style tables.  That trend is a nuisance.)  We ordered just a few items and were stuffed and happy. Here are specifics:Roasted bone marrowMy previous experiences with bone marrow (or as I like to call it, guda boti) have involved picking bones out of my food with my hands and sucking the marrow out.  This more refined version was also wonderful. Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheeseThis dish is all about the cheese.  i wish i could buy this stuff in a jar and eat it by itself with a spoon.  the beets tasted boiled and bland.  they needed to be cooked w/ seasoning directly, then topped with that wonderful cheese and the vinegerette.SepiaMy friend thought this dish was bland. The flavors in this dish were more subtle, but i thought they worked together really well. Chili flakes, mint, a little acidity, a little salt.  Simple but good. I would love to see these same ingredients and flavors with something less chewy than cuttlefish.ScallopsBest dish of the night!  Seriously delicious.Overall: good food, a little overpriced, and no service issues while dining at the bar."
felt chipped on the scallops for the price other than that the food was really good..
"Friendly staff, although not very knowledgeable about the wineBig wine list, although the vast majority of it is only available as the bottle (cannot buy just a glass). Fairly loud seating area, and not a ton of seating or space, meaning servers were always flying by RIGHT next to you and bumping into your chair. I will say there were some outdoor tables that looked nice, although all taken. We all tried different wines, yet the server used the same measuring glass for each one. No wine flights available."
"Shaved summer squash salad and the panini with nutella, marshmallow and bananas were both great!"
"Food: if you're a foodie you won't even know what happened to you once you taste any of their menu items. Wine paired to perfection, food cooked with love. Gosh, I wish I lived in Chicago, I would not leave that place."
"Fresh off the tarmac from O'Hare - this was our first stop. The entrance is set back on Michigan Ave (almost missed it) so look out for the big purple awning.We had lunch on a recent Monday. I was surprised by the crowd. You walk through a heated, enclosed outdoor seating area to enter (it was rowdy with colleagues by 12:30). Since we were tourists, we sat inside at a high-top communal table near the bar. We received excellent service including constantly replenished water glasses. It's the little things.Delicious small plates that we kept ordering repeats of...some of my favorites were: scallops with chickpea aioli, beet salad with goat cheese and the whipped feta with cucumber smear - light and refreshing. If you're going to spend any amount of time in this part of Chicago (it's in the center of it all), you must check out the Pig."
"Cheese. Swine. Wine. That's all I needed to hear.A gated entrance made way to some communal outdoor seating and even though the weather was nice I felt, as a loner, I'd be better suited at the bar. And I truly was. I ate food so good I'd roll around in it like pigs roll in whatever they roll around in (I think you know).  Pig ears with pickled pepper, crispy kale and a fried egg, pork liver terrine with thick slices of bread doused in butter and toasted. Although the mantra pushes wine I opted for two Gulden Draks, an utterly perfect complement to my rich dishes. This was a splurge, calorically and monetarily, but probably the most enjoyed and memorable meal of my mini-vacation."
"Taste: 4Value: 4Service: 4I had passed by the Purple Pig a couple of times and really wanted to try it out. The unique name and hidden nature of the restaurant added intrigue that necessitated investigation.I will say that when the place is busy, it's hectic. Though small, they pack a lot of people in there by using shared tables. This is where confusion happens. I was mis-seated twice before I was finally given a place and served.I had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, and the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde. I was surprised by how much breading there was on the pig ears. I grew up eating pig and cow ears, so I was looking forward to the taste and texture of years past. I was disappointed to loose the texture in batter and only have a faint pork taste. The composition of the dish was great. The different elements complemented each other well. I wish they focused more on making the pig ears the star of the show.The octopus was a sour surprise that was quite pleasing. The sourness is similar to capers, but you could taste how fresh the salsa verde was. The octopus was cooked well. Not too chewy, with a sear on one side. The fingerling potatoes were a disappointment though. It was cut like french fries and lost it's character.The wine was a great recommendation by my waiter, Andrew. He knew his wines and did a great job of pairing my meal.I hear the cheeses are top notch here. I didn't partake because those are things I enjoy with friends in small quantities. I hear the Blu di Bufala is one of the better choices. They also had a bone marrow spread. Gotta try those next time I come by with my friends."
"Pretty good, only down sides were 1 - they don't take reservations and 2 - waiting for a table can take a while, especially if you're starving at 10pm on a Friday night, but then again that goes for just about every fine dinning establishment in the loop. The presentation is more small plate than full entrees, think tapas but with more of a Spanish-Italian-French fusion with other, non-mediterranean, influences mixed in.  There were a few more memorable dishes, one of my favorites was the Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans, excellent dish, kind of has a cerviche feel to it but without the raw fish, highly recommend it.  The Octopus was also pretty good, another winner on my list.  Of course one cannot go to The Purple Pig and not have pork, so my table ordered Prosciutto di Parma, very tasty but it was gone before in an instance. One of the plates I'm a bit torn about is the Fried Chorizo Stuffed Olives, in concept it sounds good, but the fried olives served at warmer than room temperature just didn't do it for me, you'll have to try this one for yourself and decide.Bottom Line: Break open your piggy bank and pig out!"
"No question about it...this is one of the cooler places in Chicago and its absolutely delicious to add a little cherry on top of the coolness!  The place makes you feel like you just discovered a small neighborhood gem...If you can picture the interesting/unique restaurants in downtown Denver, CO or San Fran, The Purple Pig has that same feel.  Although the portions aren't huge, the food is reasonably priced but the wine is on the expensive side I think. All in all this is an awesome place that I would suggest anyone living in or visiting Chicago try and you HAVE TO finish your meal with the cinnamon flavored ice-cream.  Ben & Jerry's...step your game up!"
"I woke this morning with an inexplicable and uncontrollable urge for a (French) sandwich jambon fromage.  You can't get one of those in Chicago.The Purple Pig is located fantastically close to U Chicago's Gleacher center, and thus makes for a luxurious break between Saturday classes.I did not get French jambon, nor did I find any version of Swiss on the cheese menu, but boy, oh boy! did everything turn out right.I was initially daunted by following a group of 45 conference attendees through the door.  No worries.  Seat at the bar, delightful bartender, and the best lunch I've had in as long as I can remember.  I ordered Serrano ham and Bucheron.  Oh yes, and wine, of course.  All paled in comparison to the Bucheron, which was so extraordinary that I was incapable of keeping my eyes open to enjoy it.  My eyes closed of their own accord, and I was swept away into the magical kingdom that is French cheese and fresh bread.I don't know what the other bar patrons thought of that, and I do not care.The wines were too expensive, I'm very sorry to say.  The $7 glasses of wine were stingy.  When I say stingy, I mean disappointingly small.  All things considered, my experience was wonderful.  I sidled out of the Purple Pig shining a satisfied smile, and I will be back."
"yum yum YUM yum YUUMMMM!!!Made a trip to Chicago a while back, and while Purple Pig was no Alinea, it was nonetheless definitely one of the many highlights to my trip.how do I begin? Well a little bit of the place - its really cutely decorated but trust me, if it wasnt for the fact that it is generally way way pack, I probably wouldn't be observing my environment.The wait is ridiculous which makes it a bit irritating but its well worth it and if you can pick up a seat at the bar, I suggest you do that, bc it will go a lot faster than waiting, PLUS the bartenders are SOOO awesome, its quite an entertainment to sit at the bar.Its been a while so I cant remember what we had but the few dishes I would reccommend are:bone marrow - meh - not my favorite - a lot of reviews highlight the bone marrow but maybe im  not just a fan of it, it tasted like lard on bread but when does bone marrow not taste like that? But it would've been nice if they paired it with something acidic to cut the fattiness.the pig ear - IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!!! its cut so thinly, it comes with an sunny side up egg and if you dig that (and im a sucker for sunny side up egg), you pop your yok and eat it with the crispy pig ear and kale - this dish is amaazing!again - try to sit by the bar bc the waiter would reccommend wines to pair with the food and enJOY~!"
"Outstanding food and a really fun take on tapas. Love the big communal tables and, on a cool summer evening, hanging out here was fun. Spot on with the wait time quoted, just enough time to share a great Rioja. Good wine pricing, they have worked hard to have good quality and approachable pricing..."
"A perfect lunch dining on swine and wine!  i am sold!  The 45 min wait was really a 20 min wait and our waiter was attentive, prompt, and had great recommendations.  We picked the perfect courses to ""pig"" out on.  1.  Pig ear with egg and kale---fried ear smothered in an egg yolk, it was delish2.  Eggplant caponata with goat cheese---our favorite dish!  3.  Milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes---pork as soft as the potatoes, tasty4.  Mussels--this is a pig restaurant, it was okay but i'll stick to pig next timeSomething I was eyeing on other people's tables was the MARROW.  Next time, next time, I promised myself.  Our wine (a Riesling) made everything all the more enjoyable.  The atmosphere was busy and bustling!  All the dishes look so tasty so be bold, take chances, and please do NOT make the timid sad mistake of ordering a PANINI (two paninis!) like the table next to us."
"Only came here for a cocktail but I was impressed...Great location, ambiance and decor was classy and the staff was very friendly.  Didn't seem too trendy or touristy.If you are in the downtown area and need a place to stop by for a drink I highly recommend the Purple Pig"
"Let's just start off with I plan my trips based on what restaurants I want to try!  I took a few days off from work to travel to Chicago for some R&R.  I heard about the Purple Pig through a couple of travel sites and decided to give it a try.  By far, it's one of the best restaurants I've ever tried!  It's all walk ins so try to get there during their off peak hours.  My girlfriend and I were immediately seated in front of the prep area.  It was cool to see the chefs at work.  They serve their food tapas style and were able to try several dishes.  I have to say the pig ears was a hit!  They were crunchy and full of flavor.  It's probably one of the best pig ear dishes I've ever had and I've had quite a few.  Also tried the bone marrow.  It was really good...maybe even too good.  It might have been a bit too rich but it's something you have to try.  The egg plant with goat cheese was amazing!  We didn't even order it but was given to us on the house.  My guess is that they made it by mistake and gave it to us since we were in front of them.  Overall, this is a place you have to try when you visit Chicago."
"We went early (5:30 pm)  in hopes of getting a table and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We were told we could not wait inside and it was freezing outside. The staff was very rude. We never experienced the food, because after 3 hours we gave up and went and had an awesome dinner at Smith and Wolensky (with great service). At 10:30 we received a text that our table was ready. I sent a comment about our disappointing visit via their website and no one bothered to respond (i.e. they obviously don't care about their customers)."
"Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed with small plate-style eating? I really love 1) getting to taste lots of things 2) finger foods and 3) meals that just keep coming. Hum, I sense a new list forming. And Purple Pig will be on that list.When the cute italian boy sitting 3 cm away from you leans over and recommends the lardo ... you get the lardo. And while it was tasty, my tummy was NOT happy an hour later. That probably had something to do with my tummy's lack of familiarity with pure fat. Okay, TMI. ANYWAY, other than that, I have no complaints about my experience here. The food was a really quite grand -- especially the beets with whipped goat cheese. In fact, I think my new motto is ""everything would be better with some whipped goat cheese."" The waitress was lovely and the wine list was quite extensive (yes, I will have 1/3 bottle instead of only a glass, thank you). All in all, a gem of a spot."
"Lovely ambiance, amazing wine list and lovingly made food!"
"Having heard fantastic things about the food scene in Chicago, I was disappointed to have so few meals over the weekend I was there.  And being unfamiliar with the city and not wanting to get lost (even with my gps), I was glad to find that this place was right smack in the center of Chicago, right off Michigan Ave.  On a Sunday around 2:30pm, the Purple Pig was closer to empty but it did fill up rapidly after I got there.  I settled myself at the long bar (fits about 10-12).  The bartender was super nice and after checking the menu, asked his opinion on my choices:  The pork terrine, the bone marrow and the milk braised pork shoulder.  His eyes widened at my choices, or more specifically at the number of them..  Yes, I don't play around.  He cautioned me that it might be best to go with the terrine and the pork shoulder and should I still be hungry, then order the bone marrow but he thought my choices were right on.  To accompany my meal, I thought the white burgundy would have enough acidity and body to cut through and stand up to the meal.  Unfortunately, they were out of it but the bartender, who by now, had pegged my taste buds, recommended a Portuguese white done in a Burgundy style (can't remember the name) but he was completely right in his suggestion.  My terrine showed up within minutes of my order and the order was big enough that that would have been sufficient for my meal.  The lard on top of the terrine was creamy white and had been warmed to a spreadable buttery softness.  The bread had been toasted to the perfect consistency, providing enough crunch on the outside while keeping a warm center.  The side of fig  marmalade, sort of like a more substantial membrillo, was delicious as well.  When the pork shoulder arrived, the waitress delivering the dish mentioned in passing that it was her favorite dish on the menu..  Seems like my stomach can pick its way through menus rather well..  The pork shoulder had been braised for a long time and flaked at the touch of my fork.  I persevered ahead despite being full, thinking about the crappy airplane food I'd have to otherwise resort to later on.   Morale of the story:  I did not finish the pork shoulder but I did as well as I could.  And if one has to load up on calories, the Purple Pig is a great way to go.  Prices were reasonable with each of these dishes in the $11-15 range.  For a lunch of this caliber with a great glass of wine, getting out for under $40 is superb in my book.  In addition, the famous ""Midwestern"" hospitality from the bartender to the guy seating 4 seats away from me (and as I found out works in the restaurant industry) and who ended up chatting with me through my meal, making me feel not alone at all was fantastic.  Service was great with plenty of attention when necessary and yet a certain amount of privacy as well if one desires (another single woman had been sitting at the other end of the bar and she'd gone with the ""reading my book"" way and had been left to her own devices).   All in all, I'd definitely come back here and I can see how this would be a great date place in the evenings."
"I came here about a month ago with work peeps for lunch. It was a Friday at about 11:40 am and it was already hopping (they don't take reservations).We had a larger party (8 people) but we got seated fairly quickly. Inside space is really small - they do have an outdoor area with those table heater lamp things, but can't imagine going here if it's any chillier than 60 degrees.Anyway, waitress was alright, and the food was good but not as amazingly awesome as other yelpers have said. We did try the bone marrow dish and it was so gross - either to fancy for my taste or it was made wrong but it was just so, so gross. i get gross shivers just remembering it while typing this up. We also had a winged ""friend"" join us in one of the meat dishes - not a good way to finish a meal. We are guessing it flew in from outside. The hostess was very accommodating and sent us over some free desserts but at that point, we didn't really want to touch any more food!Worth a try once (if you aren't footing the bill), but I'll be taking my taste buds elsewhere."
"Another solo business lunch (I do actually do work as well!) I really loved this place, I mean come on... Cheese, Swine and Wine! The menu reflects a varied and adventurous selection of dishes including fried pigs ear (not for me, sounds like a dog treat), bone marrow, and pork fried, boiled, diced and cooked in more ways than you can imagine. They also have a great cheese and of course (pork) cold meat selection. I had pancetta and two different cheeses with a couple of glasses of chilled Portuguese white wine, all rather excellent. I'm going back next time I'm in Chicago. Oink, oink!"
"Was very full and had to wait for 20-30 mins, I had no problem with this . dinner was just descent not amazing , we had higher hopes They were out of a lot of items , and service was not good . Very chaotic , maybe we dined on an off night . I may try again down the road . I would prefer Gilt or Longman & Eagle for now for my bone marrow fix."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she said I had to come here.  It was a good thing that my friend and I came early.  This place gets packed REALLY fast.  Even though we had an early dinner we still ended up sitting at the big table (it's a huge table, counter height, that you share with other customers).The cauliflower, deviled eggs, roasted bone marrow smear, milk braised pork shoulder, and affagato (their cinnamon soft serve with espresso) were all amazing!  Their butternut squash and sicilian iris were good, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  AND I loved our waiter, Lukasz...very hospitable.Next time I'm back in Chicago, I will definitely return.  Yum-my!"
"Well let's see, had the cheese board, had the server pick the cheeses (he was amazing and very helpful)...they were amazing. The pig ear is delish! Great service, great place to enjoy a late night meal! I am still having dreams about the lardo! Fantastic! Great wine selection!"
"i am a huuuge purple pig fan. this review will be biased. i absolutely love LOVE LOVE everything on the menu. (except the bone marrow and desserts.. i know everyone raves about it.. but its just not my thing.)there were times i went here every week. like it says... wine, dine, swine. please. the wait is always a bit long. put your name on the list and walk around.. do some exercise before the eating.. because you will need it."
"Second visit and compelled to share my great experience - if you truly believe everything's better with bacon get to the purple pig now!We visited in June and again this week while in town from Portland. First visit tried the beets, peppers and three different pork dishes - including the pigs ear and the milk braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was a memorable dish, melt in your mouth comfort food.  We also had the Lardo - my definition is kinda like the foie gras of the pig - rich and a little goes a long way!This trip I was solo and my server steered me to her favorite, the pork neck bone gravy ""smear' - a small dish of wonderfulness that was like the very best marinara with  on thick cut grilled slices of yummy bread. That along with the fresh raw corn with heirloom tomatoes and an 8oz pour of a crisp white wine made my afternoon worthwhile!"
My favorite restaurant in Chicago. A must have is their pig ears!
"Pork shoulder, sweetbreads, butternut squash, turkey leg confit, testa...all amazing. Don't think I had anything I didn't like."
"Purple pig has some great small plates and is accompanied by an upbeat crowd. If you're looking for pig-related food this is your spot. Definitely not a huge spot so take your chance with actually getting a seat, unfortunately not a great bar area to hang while you wait either. Worth the wait though. Try the St. Lucia dessert, absolutely amazing. I had the opportunity to be the first to try a fresh batch they just made too. Had it twice now...amazing!"
"Cool place, small inside. Nice to have one of these rustic feel places right on Michigan Ave. Good music, good wine, good food. We had the Beet Salad, Bone Marrow Shmear, Scallops and Roasted Peppers. All very good!"
"waiter was rude. the bone marrow is the greasiest food I've ever have, and breads too!! almost puke after the 1st bite. other food with yelp fotos is not good either.people love the place because of the environment and wine, but not the food itself. suggest you could have some light dinner before going there, so u can just taste their wine and enjoy talking with friends. but not enjoying the food.1 more thing, don't trust tour guide too much. every tour guide has this restaurant listed. don;t know how much money they gave to those publishers. anyway, we paid all they have."
"Amazing small plate selection. Place is a little small and the wait was 1.5 hours but then again, went back at around 3-4 on a saturday and only waited 20 minutes.The crispy pigs ear and the milk braised pork shoulder were our highlights. Also the charred green onions are probably the most underrated thing on the menu."
"The Purple Pig was perfect for after-work drinks and snacks. We went promptly at 5 and it wasn't too crowded yet. We sat at the long, communal tables but had ours to ourselves. Our server brought us menus immediately and gave us time to peruse.As more of a beer drinker than wine drinker, I was a little disappointed at the drinks menu. Yes, I know their motto is ""Cheese, Swine and Wine,"" which is perfectly okay. But, given that they did have some beer options, I was wondering where the American craft beers were. All of the limited beer options were European. I just think it's unfair to think only European beers can be paired with the fine cheeses and meats that they serve--surely they've heard of at least 3 Floyds and Goose Island who are local and make some very elevated, even ""fancy"" beers that pair great with finer dining. But, I digress. I did order an Italian wheat beer called Genziana that was satisfying and new to me.For food, we ordered the Pigs Ears, Salt Roasted Beets, and a plate of 3 cheeses--a pecorino, manchengo, and a soft-goat cheese that I forgot what it was called. The Pigs Ears were great and a new experience for me. They were nice and crispy, topped with a fried egg, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite toppings! The beets were delicious as well--sort of a ceviche topped with whipped goat cheese and pistachios. Very refreshing. And the cheese were of course great...I've really never met a cheese I didn't like. And they brought out more bread as needed, which was a plus.I would love to come back for dinner or maybe even another group outing where we could try even more of the small plates. I would love to add some cured meats to my next experience."
"Loud, fun place to hang out at and just grub. The bone marrow was good, but there was so little to spread on the bread. The pigs ear was delish however a tad bit TOO salty. The asparagus salad was refreshing."
"My review is a bit mixed, but there is a good reason that the Purple Pig gets 5 stars. Most of the dishes we tried were truly amazing (salt-roasted beets, asparagus salad, deviled egg, feta smear, lemon panna cotta) and they put a big smile on my face. On the other hand, we also tried the olive-oil tuna, the tuna was fresh and perfectly mild, but the fava beans were a bit on the salty side. Speaking of salty, we also ordered the charred green onions, which were so heavily salted that we could not eat them. This would normally knock a star off the rating but when we informed our waitress, she insured the matter was handled very professionally and we even got an apology from the chef. I understand that things happen, and a really fantastic restaurant can not be perfect all the time, but the rating is a combination of service, ambiance, and food. I think the Purple Pig is a great combination of all things good. Go, you won't regret it."
"I have been to Purple Pig five times and I have never been disappointed with the food.  Although the menu  leans heavily on swine, wine and cheese there are always many interesting vegetable and seafood options to pick from.  Some notable dishes I have had include broiled razor clams, eggplant caponata, bone marrow spread, foie gras, pork sweetbreads and a cold calamari salad.  Although I cannot complain about the food, the seating situation at Purple Pig can sometimes be cramped and uncomfortable.  If you come at popular dinning hours, be prepared to wait and dine elbow to elbow with your neighbor."
Best meal I had in Chicago on my vacation so far....not inexpensive but we ate it all.  Waitress was amazing and really helped us choose food and wines.  Great variety of food...anyone could be happy.  Thanks or a great restaurant on the magnificent mile.
"After hearing all the hype, I finally made it to the Purple Pig last Friday night. I arrive with two friends at 6:00PM, and told it was about an hour wait (Purple Pig does not accept reservations). The placed was already packed with tourists and the after-work crowd. So, we grabbed a place to sit on the patio and ordered a bottle of wine. Now, I found the service at this place to be outstanding, and that started even before we had been seated. It had been a LONG week, and I found myself overwhelmed by all the choices for wine. So , we gave the cocktail waitress a price point, and asked for her recommendation on a red. After asking us a few questions, she recommended a bottle that was about 15 dollars UNDER what we said we wanted to spend at most, and it was outstanding.After waiting for about 45 minutes, we were finally seated at one of the outdoor tables. It was a communal table, but there was space between our party and others seated at our table. My only complaint about the Purple Pig would come here, as it was a little chilly outside and the staff did not light the heaters until we were leaving. Otherwise, after chatting up our waitress, we ordered several dishes to share along with the cheese plate. Again, with the cheese plate, we asked the waitress to just select 5 cheeses that she liked best, and that is what we would have. Well, it was delicious (it was explained to us what selections she had chosen & why) as were all the shared entrees we ordered. My favorites were the salt-roasted beets withwhipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette and the fried deviled egg with arugula & caper berries.Purple Pig suggests that you order as you eat, which I HIGHLY SUGGEST and we discovered we became quite full on much less food than we could have guessed. If we had ordered all of our food at the beginning of the meal we would have had plenty to take home.For dessert we had the bread pudding (wonderful) and the salted carmel ice cream (good). Our check came out to about $45 per person. We left very full, happy and a little tipsy. I cannot wait till I get to go back."
"Amazing, honestly I almost moved here just to have this in my city. In such a great food city this needs to be on everyone's list and the service..THE SERVICE is great, in a restaurant that could be snide and short they weren't . Accommodating, friendly, and attentive. Bone marrow. Done."
"If anyone wants to do lunch- call me, we will go here. No really- I can't wait to go back and I just went last night! Thank you to all the suggestions from yelpers- props to come!- everyone i was there with thought I was making all these awesome decisions on my own!They don't take reservations but told us that the line starts at about 6 so we got there at about 530 to hopefully beat the rush. We were a big group- 10- so it was a bit of a tight squeeze but i don't think anyone minded it. Kind of added to the family style atmosphere of the place. I didn't expect it to be so small- for a place with this kind of notariety, i'm not suprised that people have to wait for an hour to get a table, there is not much space. HIgh ceilings, a lot of brown and wood decorate the space. Really laid back vibe. Service was great- our waiter was a very friendly guy. Did not catch his name but he was kind of cute too. Eager to offer suggestions which i always appreciate- especially when he turned out to be right! Even servers who weren't ours were happy to take an order for another bottle of wine. The food- oh the food. What didn't we try. I wish there had been labels on the dishes because we ordered a whole lot to pass and i'm not quite sure what everything was! I can definitely recommend the Chorizo Stuffed Olives,  Braised Baby Artichokes with Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Jimmy's House Made Greek Sausage with Rapini & Grapes, Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki, and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey. They don't bring it all out at once- it comes out as its ready. If you go in and get one thing get the french fries of the sea. so so so good. we had like 4 plates of them. We went through a couple of bottles of wine, not sure of everything but we got a couple bottles of Pinot Noir that were fantastic. I really liked this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service- I can't wait to go back."
this is the hipster please with some very interesting small dishes. I sat at the bar right in front of the kitchen and that was the show into itself. This place seems always be crowded.
"Go expecting a crowd and noise, and you won't be disappointed. The food is worth it!  I enjoyed the Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette so much, I was tempted to get it again for dessert! My companion had never tasted green olives before (!), but the Chorizo Stuffed Olives made her a believer. The Eggplant Parmesan Balls were not too much of either ingredient and were gobbled quite quickly. We also enjoyed the Chicken Mortadella. There was more, but I think I went into a food haze. We wished we had known to order the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; so many of them were being sold, but we didn't know it until too late that it was one of their most popular dishes. The desserts were unnecessary, but necessary, if you know what I mean, but they were way too large after such a big meal. I got the Panino Con Nutella and received two sandwiches on my plate! I asked why they needed 2 for a dessert portion and was told, ""All our paninis are served in pairs."""
"Every time I walked down the magnificent mile, this little nook of a place always caught the corner of my eye, I noted it for future reference, and continued on my merry way.  Today was a different day though, and we decided to see what lay behind the iron gate and enticing signage displaying Cheese, Swine, and Wine.As we walked in this Sunday afternoon, we noted that two seats were available at the bar.  Now, I learned that just because two seats are available doesn't mean that the space is.  Short of rubbing Crisco all over our asses and sliding into two of the barstools, we climbed in and placed our order...10 minutes later.  Uncomfortably invading the people's spaces next to us I ordered a vino tinto and le BF ordered the Surprise Grilled Cheese sandwich.  I'm Latin and culturally-speaking love close, tight quarters that invade people's personal spaces, but even this was a little much for me.The bar is small and the bartender works only as a bartender, so I really had a hard time understanding 1.) why it took so long to ask for our order, and 2.) how they were able forget to serve me my wine even though I was smack, dab, shoe-horned in front of them.Overall assessment, hopefully not influenced by my ""cramped style"":Vino tint=great (is it ever really less than though?)Grilled cheese=excellentService=caca     (For those not familiar with the Spanish word caca, may I refer you to Google Translate:-)"
"The pig shaped bowls and platters made me happy.The ""french fries from the sea"" made really happy.And the nutella, banana and marshmellow cream sandwich put me straight into heaven.Mmmmkay, now that I've gotten that out of the way, Purple Pig has a lot going for it (clearly). Cat L.,  Molly G. and I opted to try this place out as our celebration spot for Cat's birthday. We arrived around 5 p.m., and snagged a great table on the deck, ordered a French white (dry/light - perfect for sipping), then picked out a few small plates to start with. Up first was the aforementioned french fries (wee little fried fish with aioli dipping sauce), the pig's ear (with a fried egg, peppers and kale), braised baby artichokes (not a fan, but my tablemates loved it), prosciutto bread balls (mmmm), peppercorn salami (very peppercorn-y, which I guess was the point),  and my favorite, the whipped feta with cucumbers smear (spread on their toasted mini baguettes). We also added the milk braised pork shoulder to our order (uber tender, and uber delicious), then a slighty heavier white wine (called Suave, as in Rico Suave...or that's how I remembered it, anyway). It was a bit too heavy for me, but not bad. We finished with dessert - in addition to the nutella sammich, we shared the strawberry ice cream with balsamic vinagrette and the butterscotch pudding. Our server was attentive and helpful, and while I wouldn't consider this place heart-stoppingly fabulous, I'm definitely a fan of the cheese, wine and swine."
"Came here for the second time today with my foodie friend. The wait was only 15 minutes however, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. A must try to start with is the whipped feta spread with cucumbers. It's a great appetizer to share for two. They bring extra bread to the table, which is awesome just by itself.We were really excited to try the fried prosciutto balls but they ran out for the day. It was only 3:30! So our waiter suggested we try the fried manchengo. This was so tasty! You can't really go wrong with scallops and Purple Pig satisfied our fix. There are three scallops on a skewer paired with a white aoili sauce. Yummm! We also shared the ""JLT"" with fried egg. We were not the biggest fans as the meat was a little too salty. The service is a little slow. He didn't really check on us and didn't fill our water until asked. We didn't even get his name. He also did not inform us that his shift was ending and a new server would take over our table. She however, was very attentive. All in all, I'll definitely come back. I think it's better to go in a smaller group and expect to wait atleast 40 minutes if you are trying to go for dinner."
"I went here with a few friends on a Friday evening after work.  It's like a tapas place where the food comes in small french-ish dishes.  Personally, I am not a fan of any restaurant that serves a bunch of small dishes... (I'm from Texas, I like everything in big portions), but I came just for the wine and cheese.  Overall, it was a very good time.  The wait staff was professional and provided great service, despite the ruckus of our crowd of folks.  The 7-8 bottles of wine tasted great.... we are not wine connoisseurs, so we just randomly selected wines from their extensive menu.  We ordered a few appetizers that I don't really remember eating, except for the cheese.... mmmm cheese.  Purple Pig's on a good location off Michigan so a good place to go after work.    A good way to end the week.  Definitely worth checking out at least once to drink a bunch of wine.  Four stars for sure."
"1) Burrata Pugliese with Peas, Radish, Celery, Spring Micro Greens & Aceto Balsamico: if you like burrata cheese, you'll enjoy this plate. small but delicious. 2) Rabbit Panzanella with Mixed Herb & Lettuce, Crispy Capers, Pickled Fiddlehead Ferns & Black Truffle Vinaigrette: decent sized salad, loved the mint herb, and truffle dressing. good portions of rabbit as well. Just be careful, i got some rabbit bones!! 3) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: This is a very rich dish, and the pickled peppers help to cut through some of the fried fatty goodness... if it weren't for that tart, crisp flavor, you'd taste a lot of the oil/fat from the pig's ear, kale, and egg yolk. i liked how the ear was sliced thinly. 4) Dessert: Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche}--this is a donut filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate. fresh out of the fryer and topped with powder sugar. it is a regular-sized donut, so the portion is good for sharing.great service!"
"Spent an hour here drinking wine and sampling cheese before we moved on to the small plates.  Wine list was fantastic!  Everything we ate was moan inspiring, so I will simply list my favorites:fried olives, pork shoulder, and JLT"
"I love this place! Regardless of the season or time of day it is comfortable and fun. Everyone that works there is friendly. And most importantly the food and drinks are superb. The burrata, the bone marrow, the other spreads, ok everything I've ever ordered has been delicious."
"This place was great, I stumbled upon it while walking up Michigan Ave with my brother and his wife.  We were in town for the Rock and Roll half marathon and we were in search for a good place to grab a glass of wine  (this was pre yelp and foursquare days for me).We were seated at the end of a large table, its almost cafeteria style seating but yet kinda posh and cool.  We ordered a big spread of cheeses, crackers, bread and the others in my party enjoyed some meat as well... we sipped on some amazing wines and had a great time.  I will definitely go back when I am in town next.  I wouldn't go there for a full meal but its great for a lunch with wine or an afternoon spot."
"I feel like I missed something. I talked this place up for months. MONTHS! Ever since I first heard the name whispered, I told folks that they just HAD to try the Purple Pig. Well, having just tried it, there were some things worth trying and some things worth skipping. I had an okay experience but not a transformative one. For all those I told to come here and did not have an oh.emm.ghee moment, I apologize.To begin, I felt very put off by the service. I arrived shortly before my awesome lunch colleague, so I tried to grab a table. I entered the restaurant from the Michigan Ave entrance and the hostess stand is at the opposite side of the room. I made eye contact with her immediately and walked my way over to her. In the intervening seconds, a table of four walked in her entrance. She sat them. Of course. Fine. By this time, I had made my way to the hostess stand. As I approached, a two-seater cut in front of me. Rather than indicate to them that I was ahead, she ignored me and sat them. Not impressed. At all. With a 'smile' (you have seen them before), she sat me at a two top. Okay. Whatever. I'll peruse the menu as I get some water, put in a drink order and wait for my colleague.No one came. Not one busser/waiter/Indian chief came over to greet me, see if I wanted anything, check if I were alive. Nada. Since I was early and my companion was a little late, I waited over 10 minutes (and after my companion's arrival) for the first person to greet me and offer me some water. Not impressed. At all. This isn't starting well. After we hugged, caught up, talked business, talked shop, and compare pictures of our grandkids, the waiter finally showed up. He started off by telling us all the things that weren't available. Mind you, this is 12:30 pm on Friday and a good number of the menu's attractive items were off the table. Ugh. Really? Unfettered, my intrepid dining companion decided on a nice mix of veggies, cheese and meat to keep us occupied. I had just managed to regain my ability to speak (having been dumbstruck by all the annoyances) when I asked for some tea with my meal. ""We're out of that.""Seriously. Tea. Out.of.tea (and food)....for a Friday lunch. Did Kirstie Alley pull up a table just before we got here? What gives?By the time the food came, it was pleasant enough. I'd just had wonderful squash ravioli at Sapori the night before, so I was a tad underwhelmed by the veggie selection, but the cheeses and meats (we got the pig platter -- complete with the star of 'Lord of the Flies' staring at Andrea R for the entirety of the meal) were fun. The serrano and salamis were my favorite. The spreadable meat was a little *shudder*. After more eating and way awesome conversation (the BEST part of the meal), we were ready for the check. So, we waited. We smiled at the waiter. We waived at the waiter. Andrea did a fan dance with her credit card for the waiter. Finally, another table was seated by us -- and the waiter came to greet them. Seconds before he ran off, we were able to get him to bring the check. I promise. Neither one of us smelled bad and we both looked rather fetching that day. I don't know what the problem was.I like the space and the menu sounds interesting. I'd like to try it with some wine, good service and the full option of choices. Problem is, I don't know if I'll be able to receive all of that...and that's too bad. Come here. Check it out. I hope you have a wholly better experience than I did."
"Was very busy and had to wait , I had no problem with this . Food was just ok , not as good as I expected. They were out of a lot of items , and service was not good . Very chaotic , maybe we dined on an off night . I may try again down the road . I would prefer Gilt or Longman & Eagle for now."
"We were visiting Chicago and yelped this place. They dont take reservations so we tried to have dinner there on Friday night but it was 1 1/2 hour wait, so we decided to come back Sat for lunch. Yelp had good reviews, it was packed, we thought ""must be great!"" boy, were we wrong! First of all, it IS packed so seating was uncomfortable...service was good... Food was horrible! Lunch (no drinks only water...was $70!) and can I say again? Food was horrible! They serve a fried pigs ear salad... On fried kale. The whole thing comes with oil dripping at the bottom. We ordered bone marrow, disgusting. Their calamari? So strange the flavors... It was like the chefs don't know how to put flavors together. Would never go here again. Go to the Publican instead - it's more expensive but the food is like a food orgasm!"
"Great food, great service! I recommend:1.  Panino con nutella.  Two words: Food. Orgasm. A warm panini filled with creamy nutella and bananas... drool drool drool. 2.  Braised Pork Shoulder3. Wagyu Sirloin TipI don't recommend:1. Bone marrow:  I've been to other restaurants that served bone marrow and the serving size at the Purple Pig was considerably smaller.  Also, the bone is usually cut lengthwise, making it easier to scoop out the marrow, but here, the bone was cut to look like cylinders.  I had a hard time scooping out the marrow, and since i don't like it working for my food, I couldn't fully enjoy this dish. Overall, great wine selection and great food!"
"This is my idea of a ""gem""! Though, I have only been here for lunch, every taste is a fantastic explosion of yummy food! I highly recommend my two favorites! eggplant smear with goat cheeseroasted beets with pistachiosAs a vegetarian, don't be afraid of the swine in the name! Enjoy!"
"Wow, what a great meal! Four of us ordered 8 items and it was more than enough food for all of us.We ordered:Pork fried almonds: A little soggy, but salty and very yummy. One of the night's favorites.Braised baby artichokes: Good for a veggie option.Pig's ear with crispy kale and egg: THIS? is good. scary good.French fries of the sea: Also scary good.Pork neck bone smear: We were going to go with the bone marrow, but our waiter suggested this instead. I was skeptical, but don't let the sound of this scare you. It is delicious.Eggplant with goat cheese: I want to fill my bathtub with this and eat my way out of it. My very favorite dish of the meal.Pig's tails: My least favorite. Still good, but it doesn't compare to any other item.Milk braised pork shoulder: Other Yelpers are not liars. This is a very, very good dish. Get it.If you can sit outside, do it. The wine selection is great. The staff are better than great."
"I came here with two friends last night before we saw Cabaret at Gallery 37. We arrived at 5:30 p.m. to get dinner before the 7:30 show.If you had told me that I would enjoy a meal so very much at a place that basically serves every part of the pig, I would've said you're crazy. I even had a backup plan, in the secret hope that this place would have one of the notorious Saturday night crowds I've read about. ""Gosh, guys. As much as I want to eat pig ears, it would sure be a shame if it was too crowded. I GUESS we should keep The Gage in mind as a backup plan.""The stars were aligned last night. I arrived to see my friend Jason already there, with two empty seats beside him for me and the other gal joining us. She's been there before, so she already knew what to steer us clear of (which wasn't much) and we ultimately decided to order 2 things each.My picks? The whipped feta-cucumber smear and the quail. Man, did I make a fantastic decision. I let out an audible groan after my first bite of the smear and only then began to grasp the concept of my friend (and fellow Yelper) Deb E.'s ever-growing list of death-row foods. Deb, you're comin' back here with me as there are many additions to your list here. Back to the feta. It was served with an artisan bread grilled to absolute perfection. My two friends both have dairy allergies, but were willing to suffer to enjoy this  creamy goodness. We also had jamon serrano, but frankly I was more focused on scraping the remnants of the feta-whip out of the bowl with my spoon once we ran out of bread. I was thisclose to giving it a once-over scrape with my finger. I can't remember what came out next, because at this point we had plowed through our first bottle of Malbec. I'll write about what I remember...the lamb blade, the pork blade, and the quail. I've never had meat cooked so consistently to utter perfection. And what juicy cuts of meat! These  animals, who I'm sure were adorable before they met their untimely demise, were delicious. (Off topic, I laughed while remembering another review from a VEGETARIAN who dined here. Lady, did you not know anything about the restaurant? It's a carnivore's wet dream!)I do remember what came last, because it was the dish I had the most apprehension about eating: pig's ear with fried egg and crispy kale. I think I am in love. I went in with a vision of the three of us gnawing on a giant fried ear. However, the ear is near-julienne, light and crispy,  and went perfectly with the yolky-goodness and crispy kale.Now about the staff: I must  give a shout-out to our server. She was laid back and totally non-pushy. She was friendly without being fake. And she showed up at just the right times. Then there were the hot men behind the counter in my direct sight line thanks to my position at the communal table. It was all just so delightful!I can only hope that my next experience here will be just as divine. Even if there's a long wait, I will be willing to brave it."
Very reasonably priced tapas style dishes. Everything is pretty unhealthy... Even the Brussel sprouts were fried.  Small but efficient wine selection.  Good to try once but I wouldn't return... At least not without pre-medicating Lipitor.
I was really excited to try this place because the menu is everything that I love.  Any place that has lardo on the menu is good with me.  Sadly we didn't have a good experience.I knew it woud be busy but my boyfriend and I were okay with this and figured we would just grab a drink at the bar while we waited.  Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long because we couldn't get close enough to the bar to order a drink.When the waitress took us to our table we were a bit surprised that she was putting us at a communal table that was almost full.  Now I don't mind the social atmosphere of these tables but when half the table has to get up and I have to squeeze past shrubs to get to my seat it's just not pleasant.  Once we got settled we tried to make the best of it.  We both ordered a beer with some fried manchego and the whipped feta spread.  When the waitress came with our beer I was surprised by the small glass she handed me.  She explained that it was the end of the keg (yuck) but that she would be back shortly with another glass for me.   15 minutes later I finally had to remind her about my second glass.  She came back and explained that they didn't have anymore so I had to switch beers.  Thankfully they didn't charge me for the first glass of sludge.The food was okay.  The fried manchego was nothing special.  The whipped feta dip was nice and they did offer to bring us more bread when we ran out.  Mind you I did have to remind them as they forgot about us again.I think if I was going out with a group of friends for a social evening this place may have been a good choice.  It wasn't what my boyfriend and I were looking for.
Cool atmosphere. Great service. Wonderful food. Get many dishes and share. We took the waitress's recommendations on the entire meal and it was awesome.
"Really gourmet food, excellent atmosphere. It was busy when I went and I sat at the counter near the food preparation and it was an impressive operation producing a top quality meal."
"I Met up with a friend at The Purple Pig a year ago.  Had cell phones never been invented, I may very well be left my friend sitting alone all night. The gem was nicely hidden. My initial reaction as I walked into the restaurant was the coziness.  It's ""sit side-by-side with strangers"" cozy.  One long bar table across the middle of the place.  Group parties not recommended.   I also notice the number of good looking people.  Not only good looking, but stylish men and women!  So if you're single, look your best and check it out with a friend. As for the food...till this day, I don't know how to describe it.  I liked it, but didn't love it.  There were ingredients in the dish that may not taste so great alone, however paired with something unexpected, the results were amazing.  For example, I tried a dish with butternut squash served with pesto. Anything squash for me is a bust, but this dish was just YUM-MY!My favorite and it did come highly recommended; Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. The meat was tender and it has this odd herbal taste to it, but I can't describe it.  I have to go back to try some more.  Many people have gone to the Girl and the Goat and when asked what I've thought of it, I often say it reminds me very much of The Purple Pig.  However no one I've spoke with has tried The Purple Pig.  So if you've tried Girl and the Goat, give Purple Pig a try and tell me if I'm way out of line."
one of the best places I have had tapas at  . Amazing Quality and extensive menu choices. Great Experience!!
"The wait could be long at times.  It can get loud in here so if you are looking for conversation this place is not it.  Wine selection is great!! Menu items are meant to share like tapas. Menu items we tried were:Bone Marrow -YummyPork BelllyPig Ear with Kale and Fried EggPork ShoulderI would return again if we are able to make and reservations, not sure if I want to wait again without one!"
"It was good. I ate Testa. I also got food poisoning pretty soon after. I'm still not sure if they are completely related. But if it was anything from the Pig, it would have been the Testa. I read up that there are regulations on the temps it should be kept at. It was a particularly balmy evening when I had it."
"solid 4.little pricey on the draught beer side, but the food is quite affordable for the quality and location.feta/cucumber mix., salami panini, beet + goat cheese were all good. i liked the brussel sprouts which were shaved. ive never seen that before."
"Kicking off our restaurant tour of all things swine we decided to finally check out Purple Pig. I knew about this place before their recent media blitz , but reading about all their food in the RedEye was the kick in the butt we needed.We were seated and immediately eyeball everyone's dishes. It's pretty easy to do with communal dining. Everything looked and smelled amazing. If given the chance I would have ordered everything off the menu, but we had to stick to our guns...charcuterie!We order the Purple Pig Platter, which was all the cured meats, choice of five cheeses, and one meat that wasn't on the menu. We told our server to pick five cheeses for us, and after a couple of questions of preferences he was all set. I did chuckle when he asked what kind of water we wanted, he made the tap sound like we were drinking untreated lake water. I drink sparkling all the time, so the up sell for Pellegrino was entertaining.The food arrives and we both start drooling. Sadly I can't remember the cheeses the server picked out, but it was a non stop party in my mouth. All the meats surprisingly paired well with any of the cheeses. We slowly noshed on our pig platter and order the Roasted Bone Marrow.Marrow arrives and at first glance it doesn't look like much. We dig in and a third of the way I'm done. It is such a rich spread I couldn't believe how full I was afterward. My friend did the honors of finishing my marrow.Next time we'll have to try the small plates. The only reason I didn't give  it five stars was price. With so many mouth watering plates, you can drop $50 pre drinks easily...but it is so worth it!"
"Started out @ the Purple Pig for some wine and caved and got a smear after seeing Steve Dolinsky's blog bit.ly/9oOrk8. We went with the eggplant caponata and goat cheese. Stick with me while I dissect. My god was that spectacular. Slightly greasy and delicious. Every bite, creamy, yummy. We couldn't stop raving about it; even my friend who doesn't eat eggplant. Who knew you should mix goat cheese with eggplant? I'm sure you foodies did, but I did not and it was such a spectacular surprise.So spectacular that I went back to the Purple Pig the following day. I couldn't just give five stars after drinking one perfect glass of red wine and splitting an appetizer. So I brought two different individuals to the place the following evening. Wine again, was perfect (Rioja).Then we ordered - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (my boyfriend loved it, i thought it was a bit too fatty for my taste, but still unique, delicious and recommended).- Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki  - Mussels with Treviso, Serrano Chiles, Winter Citrus & Gaeta OlivesI recommend getting a little something from every portion of the menu (a la plancha, salad, smear...etc). I just can't stop raving about the food. I'm literally going to this place again next week with a different friend, and I don't think I'm the only crazy addict out there. When the waiter asked if we'd been there and I said ""yes, yesterday"" he said that's common. :)Oh yes, wonderful wait staff and definitely worth the money (it's all about value, friends!)Go straight to Purple Pig, do not pass go, do not collect $200. You won't regret it."
"We overordered, oh like 6 tapas sized dishes for 2 persons. Who cares? How often will we come back to Chicago? Highlights are the fried pigs ears just like crispy French fries and pork neck rillettes. Not digging the Big Ed cheese. The food was not overly salty at all. Show up at 11:30am ish to get a seat. They dont take reservations and do get packed by noon time even on a weekday. And if you are collecting pig t-shirts, get the $20 Purple Pig t-shirt!"
"Can you say over hyped!  Terrible service we were asked to give our order all at once,  so the waitress can manage the dishes coming out.  Instead she put the order in all at once and we received 2 rounds of small plates before our drinks even came out.  No apology!  The food is not spectacular or ground breaking,the ubiqitous fried egg you see all chic menu, The pig ears more like pork rinds..., they just try to make it appear that way.  Do not order the calamari, not sure what they are trying to do with this dish.  Will not be back."
"It may be crowded, noisy and tough to get in to....but the food is really terrific!"
"Now I remember why I like Chicago so much!  Besides the great selection of restaurants in the city, the biggest thing the Second City has over L.A. (the Snob City) is class.  I stopped by here on a Friday night around 7pm (prime time hours) as I had read some reviews online and was curious to try it.  It's a lot smaller than I expected inside but as I was poking my head inside to see if there was any space at the bar (there wasn't), the hostess saw me and asked me if she could help (first difference: in L.A. the hostess is trained to NEVER notice you unless you're an A-list celebrity).  I told her that I was looking for a space at the bar and as we both looked again she asked me if I wanted a table (second difference: in L.A. the hostess is trained to NEVER ask you if you want a table).  I said yes but told her I didn't want to take up a whole table seeing as how busy it was (thinking there maybe some tables in a hidden back area---there isn't).She pointed me to the communal table near the door where there was a spot available and promptly seated me (third difference: in L.A., even if a table is available, you're always told it will be a 45 minute or longer wait to be seated).  It took a few minutes for the waitress to arrive but that gave me time to peruse the menu of tapas items and the extensive wine list.  As I just wanted to try the place, I ordered the Arancini with peas and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes.  Both were excellent but I was surprised at how large of a portion the Pork was (the waitress said it was 8 oz but I'm not sure if she was joking).  It was very tender and flavorful and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.  This place offers a great selection of cheeses (most people were ordering at least one dish) and is very meat-centric, so if you're a vegan or vegetarian, I wouldn't suggest coming here except to drink wine.  It is all Tapas style so I'm not sure I would come here for a full meal as I'm an old-fashioned guy (appetizer, entree, dessert for me!) but they do a great job with it.  The busboys seemed a little overwhelmed as I never got any bread until I asked the waitress for some (even though I saw the busboy serving others).  No worries as you're here for the meat and cheese and wine.  Great friendly service and good food so what else could you ask for?  Prices average about $8-10 for each tapas and about $5 for beer, $6-19 for a glass of wine.  Oh, and this place seems to cater to a movie/theatre crowd as more tables/spaces became available as I was leaving around 8pm....."
"This place is amazing! Very fun, lively atmosphere. Our server was the best, I forget her name but she was a very down to earth Spanish girl. We got roasted corn with pickled mushrooms to start, it was alright. It's served cold which caught us off guard but we still managed to eat every last kernel. We also got the fried pigs ear and HOLY CRAP!!!! That was super good. You have got to get it if you go. I got the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, don't be fooled..it's a super small portion so make sure if you're interested in that for dinner, get an appetizer just for yourself. Love the purple pig!"
We had excellent food and the service was speedy. I had hoped that the waiter would offer some recommendations instead of leaving us to sit and take in the menu for 15 minutes but all in all we were very happy with what we chose. The tables sit very close to each other so don't plan to discuss anything you wouldn't shout out to the public about!
I loved this place.  I go to Chicago once a month and this is going to be my new place.  I loved eating here and their wine was amazing.
"went there and had a great experience.  Marcus our server was extremely helpful and we enjoyed everything we ordered.  we even ordered an extra dish (chicken on skewers) because the table next to us had them and they looked soooo good.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the music was a little loud, but we dealt with it.  the cheeses are GREAT and from pastoral.  there was some yummy current spread that came with the order  - really great compliment to the cheese and bread.  More later......"
"Crowded, expect a line, very loud.  Good service, many good things to choose from.  It is an experience that should not be missed.  Discovered that I do not like marrow or lardo, but this was my first chance to actually try them.  I found that the best meals are put together from the salads, antipasto, cheese and charcuterie.  I would have skipped the larger dishes had I known.  Ordered good wine, so the bill for 2 was $270."
"Conflicted. Great patio. Wonderful wait service for dinner but prepare for a very long wait, almost 2 hours, and friendly but ridiculous slow service on the patio. The food was really good,reasonably priced but you better love pork and bread...I thought I did but even I had a bit of a pork and bread overload."
"What a ridiculously amazing place! This has to be the best find for me of 2011 so far. We had wanted to come here for a long time, but finally decided to walk over after Lollapalooza 2011. A huge huge bonus is that the kitchen is open til 12 on weekdays and 1 am Friday and Saturday. I know of no other restaurant in Chicago with this quality of food open this late. This will easily be my go-to restaurant for late-night food.Ambiance and service are both amazing. The place could easily be at home in New York or even Paris. No TV's to be found anywhere thank God! We had an assortment of dishes, and I won't bore you with the details, but everything from the charcuterie to the entrees to the cheeses and desserts were all terrific and well-presented. Portions are perfect too. None of this crazy stuff that's as big as your head!Already can't wait for the next visit!"
"I smell BACON!!!  For those that pine for swine, this is it.  If not, you won't be disappointed with their vast Euro selection of liqui-dinners (my unregrettable choice).  To avoid the crowds and ""Oops-I-rubbed-your-butt-but-didn't-mean-it"" experience, go on a night early in the week. We went on a Tuesday night and except for 2 other couples, the place was dead. The interior was cozy--in fact, so cozy, I wanted to nap.  The communal tables made it an ideal spot for groups....given you land there on an empty night since they don't acccept reservations.Ordered a perfect bottle of sancerre...my fave and usually tough to find.  The bartender was adorable and offered me a gratis serving of the soft serve olive oil ice cream.  I'm not a fan of ice-cream, but this was salty, creamy and dreamy...worth a second round.Rated P.P 4 stars because I didn't eat.  The menu seemed too meaty (don't eat it) and heavy.  Not certain what to think about the pig ears....my dog loves em."
"They market themselves as ""Cheese, Swine and Wine."" That's a pretty legit assessment of what these guys do well.The menu is constantly changing so its hard to recommend certain dishes. The Turkey Leg Confit was killer during my first visit, unfortunately, it was already off the menu by my second.Either way, its good to go here as a group of 4-6 people and plan on ordering 3-4 dishes per person.Adventurous eaters are a must! The dishes are basically tapas style. Just keep ordering waves of different items. Experiment! Get our of your comfort zone and try bone marrow, pig ear, blood sausage etc. Is it weird for the sake of being weird? Absolutely not. Its great food that just happens to be weird. Out of the 20 dishes I've tried thus far, I can't think of any ""misses.""I will warn that they do NOT take reservations so use your brain and plan ahead. Come a bit early, come a bit late. Hell, starve yourself for lunch and try to jet from work early. Its worth it."
We had several dishes and all of them were very very good:Pig earsPig tail (on the sweeter side)Roasted Bone Marrow (* beef marrow is tastier)JowlRoasted cheeseThe wait was worth it.
"Let me just start with this - take public trans or a cab; there is virtually no parking close by, although they do validate at the Michigan and Ohio garage & one other (which is not indicated anywhere, let alone their website).  Sooooo, now that I got that off my chest, let's get this party started, right?Crowded.  Very intensely, shoulder-to-shoulder, front-to-ass, sardines-have-more-room, crowded.  The rub: we got there at 8:30PM.  Well past the dinner rush, unless you live in Spain or anywhere in Europe.  And, you can either stand and wait in an approximately 2 ft X 2 ft sq patch of space next to the ""hostess stand"", or, when the weather is nicer, outside.  Don't bother trying to ""wait"" at the bar; far too many patrons who are having their supper there;  getting a drink amongst the masses is an exercise in patience, balance & tightrope walking.  However, contrary to many of the reviews posted here, the waitstaff, the hostess & the GM are very pleasant, quite helpful, & eager to get you seated.  Note: For those of you who prefer a semi-private table, do NOT go to Purple Pig.  This is a communal establishment, ad nauseum.  So communal in fact that the runner wasn't sure to whom the food he was running was supposed to go to at our spot as the couple across from us was no more than 11 inches away AND my dinner company exchanged cell phone information with that same couple.   The interior is, well, the interior.  It's decorated.  I've nothing negative nor positive to say.  They have an interior.  Onto the food.  Definitely ask about any new plates; menus taped to the overhead light fixtures are not updated with the newest offerings.  IF you have a question about a term or an item, next to the overhead menu, taped right next to it in fact, is a glossary.  Look here first before asking your server, as they may be taking your order from across the table due to the cramped quarters; you don't want to look like a food-virgin asking what exactly ""jamon"" means.  We had the following:Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette.  My thoughts - this was a nice starter to share.  Good amount of rough cut beets, tender and beet-y.  For those of you scared of goat cheese, the goat cheese on this is not as goat-y as one would expect.  It's more like a hearty cream cheese.  My dinner company (she was NOT a date) especially liked this.Butternut Squash with Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Ricotta Salata.  My thoughts:  I especially liked this.  The squash was cut in small-ish (about 1/2 inch cubes), was roasted, & presented more like sweet potato fries.  The brown butter, which I recommend you toss the dish in before eating it as it just pooled at the bottom of the bowl, was fantastic.  Buttery.  Lemony.  Roast-y.  Yummy.  The pumpkin seeds added a nice texture.  What the heck is salata (I did NOT check the glossary)?Winter Squash & Goat Cheese Arancini with Sage Pesto.  My thoughts:  Again, my date (okay, I called her a date....sue me) especially liked this.  The sage pesto is unique; sage-y and garlicky.  perfectly fried.  Yes, the goat cheese is not goat-y, but lends a nice creamy texture against the crunchiness. There was winter squash in there?Prosciutto Bread Balls.  My thoughts:  I loved this dish.  I thought there was going to be chunks of prosciutto, but, I was wrong.  There was a meaty taste from the prosciutto throughout each ball.  Could've used a bit more red gravy, but, that may have been overkill.Octopus with acini di pepe & Swiss Chard.  My thoughts:  Probably the most tender octopus dish I have ever eaten.  Two tentacled arms, with the skin removed (which I appreciated, as that can be tough), the octopus was meaty, hearty & almost had the consistency of moist chicken breast.  The ""acini di pepe"" (again, should've checked the glossary.  A fail on my part) was a nice complement -- looked like cous cous, and the Swiss chard lent a nice bitter component to the sweetness of the octo-meat.Prawns a la Plancha.  My thoughts:  My favorite dish of the evening.  Eat these prawns whole people, shell and all.  You will not regret it.  And, have one of the little fried garlic chips while crunching on a piece of the prawn.  Fresh fresh tasting prawns (no, not the kind from District 9), briny not fishy, and the heads held so much shrimp-y flavor.  Lovely, just lovely.  I will definitely order this again.  Desserts -- we had something referred to as a ""something something lily"", which was essentially a fried brioche filled with ricotta cheese and dark chocolate chips.  This was a dessert worth getting again, but ""chips"" should mean more than 2.  Pass on the farro with pudding with chocolate sauce.  Oddly enough, they do not have tea.It's unfortunate that they don't provide bread with any of the dishes, as I would've like to use it to transport some of the sauces & oils from the dishes to my mouth.  There is bread with a few of the dishes, but not separate & not offered."
"Great small plates of awesomeness.The pigs ear is a must have. The grilled vegetables are very refreshing. Wine list is good and not too spendy.The service was attentive, cool and offered good advice.Top notch find."
"Tourist trap, 'nuff said. Doesn't accept reservations and always a huge wait. There's also typically a line. If you consider where it is located, it is what it is.If you truly want to indulge in the new trend of pork fat worship and beer, I strongly recommend the Publican as an alternative that takes reservations, has a more robust menu and knowledgeable staff. That said, you certainly won't be disappointed if you get in and get a seat here; I'm just sayin' it's not worth all the hype."
"The lunch service was stellar.  Even though the restaurant was packed, the service was great and the food was on-point.  The wine selection is interesting, and provides a little something for everyone.  Every dish was cooked to perfection, and the staff took the time to explain preparation.  Thoroughly impressed!"
Went here again last night and I was reminded of why I love this place so much! The food is incredible. Absolute favorites:BroccoliCauliflowerBeets with whipped goat cheeseWhipped fetaPork neck bone gravy w/ ricottaChicken thigh kebabsFried brussel sproutsPork shoulder / mashed potatoesSICILIAN IRIS (my favorite dessert ever ever ever!)
"This place was packet! We went mid-afternoon, knowing we were going to have a late dinner and couldn't believe how busy they were. Worth the wait! The food was great, so many different tastes! And amazing beer and wine selection! We throughly enjoyed everything we had: Salt-Roasted Beets with whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and of course the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - they give you fresh herbs and crostini to spread it on.. so good!"
"Honestly I would give it a 3.5... but I won't be stingy. The Purple Pig was recommended by a foodie friend who claimed this was quite possibly the best meal he has ever had- naturally I had to try it. Knowing the it's on Mag. Mile, my friend and I showed up for an early dinner (5:50pm),  was greeted with pleasant smiles and informed that  there would be a 20- 25 minute wait. By New York wait time standard,  that's equivalent to immediate seating.  We were provided with a drink and a server took our orders while we waited on the outside benches (it would had been almost pleasant if it wasn't so incredibly humid).  I had the Il Saggio gin based with sage syrupy and my friend had the prosseco based specialty cocktail (exact name escapes me). Il Saggio was delicious with very balanced, true sage flavor, which was surprisingly refreshing for the summer.  Like clockwork, we were seated within the 20 minutes of arrival on the outside patio, which was cool by two industrial fan. It made the 80+ degree and 70% humidity somewhat tolerable (hey , don't judge I grew up in Southern California- low humidity tolerance)For dinner we ordered: the salt roasted beets with goat cheese, Caesar salad (not my choice), sirloin tip and the octopus.  For some reason or another we were served the  Caesar salad first and the beets last, an order I found a little strange. Food wise:  Caesar salad of romaine, spinach, quail eggs and house anchovies  was least memorable. I don't remember much spinach in the actual salad and found it to be a slightly over -dressed. The surprise factor was the 'freshness' of the house-cure anchovies, which was not overwhelming & overly salted. Octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes was our second dish of the night. It was stellar! The octopus was so tender and caramelized and was perfectly compliment by the salsa verde. I could eat one order by myself. Sirloin Tip- tender, nicely prepared dressed with a marrow dressing that really heighten the meaty flavor and add a ton of richness. This was balanced out by green olives and red onion.  Overall it was a good  steak dish.Roasted Salted Beets- roasted beets and goat cheese, which is a classic combination. The chopped pistachio was nice touch. So good food, fantastic cocktail and friendly services puts it at 4 star for me. Next time, I will definitely be more adventurous with the order."
"This was unexpectedly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Popped in here late yesterday afternoon and had the calamari, shaved brussels sprouts, cauliflower, prosciutto, skate wing and the feta and cucumber smear, and each thing was more ridiculously delicious than the last.  I've never seen calamari done like this...it wasn't fried (was it raw?) and was mixed with couscous and nuts and something else. Could not stop eating it, is the point I'm trying to make here.  This restaurant could make me rethink my NY superiority complex."
"Oh, yum! Do not pass up the pork shoulder. Tempranillo goes great with this food. Eat here!"
Pros: - lively atmosphere- pretty good food with good prices (a surprise for the location)- fantastic cheese plates and milk braised porkCons:- the waiter hovered over us and made it crystal clear that he wanted us out to clear the table even though we still had food on our table- no reservations- told us that we needed 10-12 plates and it ended up being WAY too much foodBottom line:- A casual place but they will hover and then slam the check on you as soon as they see that you are close to being finished. If you don't mind bad manners its a good place for good priced small plates.
"Last night was my second time dining at this fabulous establishment. The five stars is based completely off the food. It is all seriously delicious. The menu has changed slightly since my first visit - which makes me love it even more. Same place, new fantastic food = big win. Some things that stand out are: whipped feta and cucumber spread, butternut squash with pumpkin seeds and sage, pork shoulder, nuetella and banana panini... i could go on.. bottom line - go there! you may have to wait a few minutes and the seating may be a little crowded, but your tastebuds will be happy!"
"I was really excited to have dinner at The Purple Pig since it's menu is definitely off the beaten path and is highly rated.I have two primary complaints.  First, the food is meant for sharing and are small plates.  All of the orders came out at the same time and was not broken up well.  Secondly, we asked for recommendations and all of the recommended food was fairly bland, which is hard to do with pork.One really good item was the spreadable pork liver.  If you do choose to go.  You should try it."
"Ate here in late March on what started out as a mild evening. Upon arriving we were expecting a wait based on reviews. We checked in and were told we would have a 30 minute wait. They asked us to wait outside and told us a server would be by to take our drink order. We did and he did in about 10 minutes, and then we were pleasantly surprised to be seated just inside an outdoor tented structure with a heater. So we only waited about 15 minutes. Then it got better when we looked at the menu, there are so many interesting things to order I wish I could eat there every day just to try them all. But, we had to pick, so we went with Fried Brussel Sprouts, Fried Pig Ears with Kale, Striped Bass and Skate with Beets & Blood Orange. Our wine was an Italian red from the Abruzzo region and at $8 a glass it was both delicious and a bargain. About midway through our meal the wind picked up and it became obvious rain was on the way so I flagged our waitress over and asked her to move us ASAP,  she found us a place inside at a hightop with some other folks. No sooner were we inside when the heavens opened up so it was just in the nick of time. The food was delicious and so interesting - every bite. Looking around at what everyone else was eating, they were all oohing and ahhing over their food and enjoying and sharing with their friends. I just wished I lived in Chicago so I could eat there often. Oh - and the prices were really reasonable for the caliber of food."
"I got it, I got it: this is stoopid cuisine. You know, like, if a bunch of frat boys, in the drunken splendor of an epiphany, decided to open up a haute-peasant restaurant? Yeah, that.It's all smoke and mirrors here, kids: just dump butter and olive oil on a bunch of fried shit and you're golden, right?Which is to say: this place must be AMAZING when one is intoxicated. Oh, sobriety!  Next time I'm kicked out of Excalibur, I'm so there."
"Maybe the idea of an inebriated swine doesn't totally correspond to your idea of romance.And believe me - I don't judge.But as long as the pig in question is just intoxicated and not toxic, and willing to share the source of its daze - I am game.Even on Valentine's Day.Especially on Valentine's Day if you are like me.The space tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue doesn't breathe date, passion and intrigue. For sure. There are long communal tables, bar seats and a few tables which share a red vinyl bench. It's open, quite loud and vibrant.But boy - does it breathe Europe!!! With its gorgeous painted tiles The Purple Pig is the wonderful and American love child of a Spanish tapas bar, a Danish bodega, an Italian osteria and a French 'bistrot de campagne'. Just. Delightful.Was immediately transported back home thanks to the wine jug/pitcher...such a nice little touch. The 'quartino' (a quarter of a liter, a third of a bottle) is the perfect amount to share. And for the suspicious minds they make you try your selection out of the bottle first.So quiet down, winy(!)  hearts...As for the food....delicious, fresh, classic but still inventive. We had a selection of three cheeses, the special smear of the day (ricotta and shredded pork neck cooked down in a scrumptious tomato sauce), the fried sardines with fennel and lemon vinaigrette.The highlights:- the mortedella/balsamic/pistachio smear served on crostini: described as porky by another food writer but it doesn't make it justice. It's rich, salty, creamy and just perfect. $6 for four pieces of heaven.- the butternut squash served with pumpkin seeds, fried sage, ricotta salata and brown butter: sounds simple and it is, but the flavors once again marry so well that you forget that you can easily do the same at home. $4 bring you a nice cup of it. - the farro/ricotta dessert served with a bitter chocolate sauce: unique and delicious. Just try it.Disappointments:They were out of many items - including the pork ears and their already famous fried deviled egg, as well as half their cheeses. A little tough. And sad.But munching on all these goodies in the heart of Chicago is such a treat that I will be back soon to give them a try.It's just that good."
"Thanks iphone Yelp app!  We did a walk in on a Saturday night and got seated outside with no wait to enjoy the last dregs of sunlight on a hot day.  We ate our way through most of the menu, all of which was good, and some of which was great.  Wine is a bit overpriced but they have a decent variety to choose from.  I'll defintely stop back here if trapped downtown for an extended period of time again."
"Man I was really looking forward to eating here but unfortunately the experience did not live up to the hype. We ordered the bone marrow, the milk braised pork shoulder the cheese sampler and the calamari. the calamari was excellent and we all really liked the braised pork shoulder. We also decided to add on the pigs ears since we were still hungry. They reminded me of onion strings, only with less flavor. Most disappointing was the cheese plate with three cheeses for $19.  Way overpriced considering you can get bigger free samples at a deli or supermarket."
"Gulp, Gulp, Gulp, Gulp - Nom, Nom, Nom, NomWonderful wine paired with amazing sharable plates and trendy atmosphere (can be loud if you haven't had your share of wine). Try everything (no matter your reaction to the menu description)!"
"First, I must admit something.  Over the last two weeks I've realized that I've been doing my Yelp reviews on a somewhat random scale, so I've started using something called the Burrito Calibration.  Meaning, how many Chipotle burritos is this worth to me?  Due to this recalibration, Purple Pig gets 3 stars.  The food was decent for something that sits between two tourist traps, but the horrifying service I received the second time around left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth (figuratively speaking, of course).Visit 1:  With friend J, 9 pm on a FridayCold March day, 20 minute wait, promptly seated inside on one of their big communal tables.  Had a few plates, none of which were particularly awe-inspiring but were definitely inventive (like the pig's ear).  Marrow was not that much better than my mother's (why, I am Chinese, thanks for asking).  Cozy atmosphere and great service more than made up for the slight let-down in food.Visit 2:  With friend M, 5 pm on a SundayCold September day, told that there was a 45 minute wait for indoor seating, so we chose to sit outside.  Food was ho-hum again.  I had the white bait this time which just tasted like a blander version of calamari.  The neck gravy, I'll admit, was better than average.  But that didn't save the whole experience of me freezing slowly from waist down due to the fact that the server took THIRTY MINUTES to bring us a check.  At the end we had to flag down the busboy as he was clearing our plates."
"Dine with Swine.  That or be a pig and gluttonize it up. Either way, win win situation, unless you're on a diet. If then, sucks for you.  This is strictly tapas style so come with friends because sharing is caring.  Definitely get a meat/cheese platter and fill 'em up with your favorite pork.  My favorite cold meat? The sweet yet spicy chorizo.  Everyone keeps raving about the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta smear; they are right. It's amazing. Smear that on bread and it's cloud 9 from there.  Actually, order any smear from the menu and you'll be asking for more bread to load your carbs.   If you're a fan of octopus and pan seared scallops, you found the place- it's grilled and seasoned to perfection.  Also of note were the Berkshire Porkchop, the ham panini,  and the wagyu sirloin tips.  I pity the fools sitting next to us that ordered only 3 dishes for 4 people.  Friends don't let friends do that. Friends let each other be fat pigs and order whatever they want."
"Come early, Come often. That's what their slogan should say. The lady and I showed up at 6 on a Friday and it was already an hour and a half wait. There is literally no standing around room, so you might as well give them your cell and go to the wine bar (Eno) across the street in the Intercontinental Hotel.Hot damn, this place is good. Think mediterranean tapas and small plates. They also have a great selection of cured meats and cheeses. The lady and I had the sopressata, jamon, and one other type of meat. No cheese, we had that at Eno while waiting :). The other appetizer we had was the brussel sprouts, but was more like a dry cole slaw with cheese and a little olive oil. Surprisingly good. After the appetizer we had the braised pork shoulder, and it should be called Braised ""babe the pig"" shoulder because only Babe could produce a shoulder this tender. Wow, I'm lame. Seriously though, it literally falls apart with a slight breeze. To go along with that, we also had the mussels. Very solid, not much more to say.I heard this place had a great beer list, but was a little underwhelmed. They had some rare Belgians, but other than that... ehI can't wait to go back and get all the weird stuff on the menu that the lady didn't want to try on the first trip. Braised piggy tail!... bring it."
"I might consider giving a second chance to them, but my first visit did not leave me that impressed. We did arrive at 11:15 pm and they do close the kitchen at midnight, we were greeted by the friendly host, so we are off to a good start. Then we are greeted by one of the servers who goes over the menu made some good suggestions and brings our drinks.  We do place the order with her and the appetizer is brought out.  The  appetizer is an artichoke and potato combination with goat cheese. I take one bite and thought perhaps it was just me, but when I look at my partner his expression was priceless.  The appetizer did not have a good taste to it, almost as if it had been sitting int he refrigerator uncovered collecting the different tastes of the refrigerator. In the meantime I take a sip of my soda, flat! Ok so stuff happens, we ask the busboy if he can please take it back and get a new one or tell the server.  He comes back and lets us know the server would bring it out because she had to enter it into the computer?  Still no problem. A server other than our initial one approaches us and states that they are looking at changing the soda and will bring one out asap! Thanks for the follow up, although you were not the server who greeted me, took orders, made suggestions.  So our entrees come out.  I had the chicken kabob and my partner had the pork sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious I actually ended up eating more of that than my entree.  The kabob really was not that great of a presentation, it actually looked like a plate of slop because of the watery tzatsiki sauce, what appeared to be three potatoes and perhaps the juice or grease from the chicken combining together.  The chicken was ok, actually my partner liked my dish more and I his so we just swapped. In the meantime we really did not see anymore of our server until the end of the meal and the nice lady who came by earlier stopped by to see how things were. So at this point we tell her about the appetizer she was nice about it and apologized. They did end up taking it off the check. The place is cute, but the exhaust fans must not be working right or they turned them off later in the evening.  The place smelled like grease/smoky I could not wait to get out.  Perhaps they were cleaning the kitchen and had turned off the fans?  Whatever it  was I was grateful to go out for fresh air. Some suggestions for the servers if you are going to trade off a table, it is customary to let your table know that a new server will be taking care of them so we are not looking for you. Like I said I would consider giving them a second chance, but my first impression was not that great."
"I had read nice things about this place, and since it's next door to where I work, I really wanted to go.  Just prior to leaving, two co-workers said ""don't go, that place is disgusting"".  The only thing disgusting is how terrible my co-workers' taste in food is.I would not say ""OMG, you MUST go here"" but seriously everything we had was really good.  Cheese plate, pork shoulder, butternut squash, fried bread balls, pate....everything was really enjoyable.We hit it up at 1pm on a weekday, it was still pretty full, but winding down.  You could tell that it must be tight at noon.  It is small plate dining, but everything was so rich that two people couldn't come close to finishing our five small plates.  Add in a couple of drinks and the bill was onlly $55, so it's truly affordable to eat here.Our server was pretty knowledgable about the spices used and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare meals on hot plates.  I would definitely come back."
"Here for a few days in Chicago, I heard raves of the Purple Pig.  Arrived at 8pm, and they were jammed packed.  Waited for about an hour before getting seated.  Honestly, the food is definitely good, but not heads or shoulders above anyone else (Chicago or elsewhere).  Went two nights ago, ordered 7 dishes (tapas), and frankly, I can only remember about few dishes or so...so lets review...4.5* - Milk braised pork shoulder3.5* - Bone Marrow Spread (This is supposedly their signature dish, but, didn't intrigue me.  The olive oil overwhelmed the spread, and the entire dish did not impress)4* - Wagyu Beef MeatballsYes, I also did have their cheese - again, good, but did not blow my mind by any means.  So at the end of the day...just another above average restaurant to add to the list."
"I've been waiting forever to try this place out. Every time I want to, there's at least an hour wait, so I took the liberty of going at 10:30 PM on a Wednesday night, and sure enough, there was no wait. If you're as impatient as I am and hate waiting to get seated, I'd suggest trying to eat here at obscure hours of the day.The food was absolutely amazing, as well as the cheese and wine. Their motto afterall is cheese, swine and wine :) I asked a foodie friend of mine for some food recs beforehand, and he told me to get the bone marrow spread. Unfortunately, they were no longer serving it because the bone marrow of the pigs from the farm that they usually buy from wasn't fresh enough and so they were waiting to find some quality bone marrow before putting it back on the menu. If the chef cut out one of the most popular dishes because the bone marrow quality ""wasn't cutting it"", I think that has a lot to say about the quality food of this restaurant.My boyfriend and I ordered the pig's ear and a cheese/meat selection to start off the night. I don't know what kind of cheese/meat we got (we just asked the waiter for a recommendation) but it was fantastic! The bread and jam were also a great combo too. The pig's ear was alright - it was a little bit too oily for me, but still rather good. Later on, we ordered the pork shoulder and charred cauliflower. The pork shoulder was AMAZING! It literally just melts in your mouth!!!!!!! I would definitely definitely recommend that as a must-eat dish.The ambiance is really romantic and the outdoor seating is so nice. Definitely try the wine - the one that our waiter recommended for us was very smooth and complimented all of our dishes perfectly. After eating here, you could really tell how much care and effort was put into all the dishes, wine selections, and decor. There is absolutely no wonder that it's one of the most famous and top ranked restaurants in the country."
"One of the stops on my mother's birthday outing of eating. walking and shopping and was this place that I heard sooooo much about! We are huge fans of wine, charcuterie and outdoor seating and Purple Pig did NOT disappoint. It was a crisp day but 3 of us scored a lovely perch on the end of one of the communal outdoor tables that was just a smidge too far from the heater. It's ok b/c after that bottle of wine (that was a delight but the name escapes me) we were pleasantly warmed up! Our server was great, we loved all his suggestions and when our initial wine choice was not available, he suggested a few others and allowed us to sample before committing to a bottle - super cool.The grilled octopus was great, the pork neck bone rillettes were AMAZING, quite possibly b/c they were served with an apricot mostarda accompaniment - perfect match. We also had some manchego and fig spread, camembert, prosciutto & coppa. All went well with the wine.Even grabbed some dessert to go (consumed in the movie theater a bit later) the paninocon nutella - wow, what a rich, delicious  concoction but best if eaten immediately since it is served warm. The menu had some awesome items on it and I can't wait to return and try some more goodies!"
"A near-perfect experience... I've been twice, and enjoyed both thoroughly. Helpful and attentive staff, delicious small plates allow for sampling many dishes, and oh so much wine. More details and photos on my blog :)"
"Under-promise and over-deliver, was the way our night got started.  We were told it was a 45 minute wait and 15-20 mins later, we were seated. Love it!  The cheeses paired with jelly were fantastic.  The pork shoulder and mashed potatoes were unreal.  I think we may need to stop here again before we leave town."
"It was rainy and cold but the weather could not possibly come across food and us.  We stopped by the Purple Pig the day before Thanksgiving, roughly around 7pm.  The place was packed and there was a 45 minutes wait.  This little restaurant was so crowded.  People stood around, waiting for tables, but mostly because if you weren't present when they call your name, they would skip you and you would have to re-enter your name on the waiting list.We decided to take the chance and went to Nordstorm to waste sometime, which turned out well since we got back just in time our name was called.    It was our first time, so we were unfamiliar with what they serve; we ended up taking the waitress's recommendations of Chicken Thigh Kebab, and Pork Saltimbocca with Rainbow Swiss Chard with additional orders of Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, and Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans.Tuna was good but not exactly my favorite in comparison to other dishes we ordered.  The dish was served cold with gigantic lima beans, which was fatteningly scrumptious.    Then, the highlight of the night was served, mortadella, balsamico & pistachio smeared on toasted bread.  It was just flawlessly delicious.  The crushed pistachio completed the dish with flavorful nuttiness. Pork saltimbocca was well seasoned and prepared, however the chicken thigh kebab was superior in my opinion in comparison to pork saltimbocca.  If you are looking for a meat dish to complete your meal, chicken thigh is the way to go.  However, I have also heard good things about their pork shoulder that we didn't get a chance to try.Purple pig is one of a kind restaurant.  The restaurant is well decorated, small, and cozy.  It is located on Michigan Ave, which is hard to get to if you live in the suburb but it is definitely worth the drive/cost of parking/commute time.  The restaurant specializes in wine and pork related dishes.  The portions are small, like tapa style.  We had four courses between two people; we finished everything and were completely stuffed and happy at then end of our dinner. The creativity was the main attraction.  Their menu items are unique and can't be found in any typical restaurants.  I was impressed with their menu, and the choice of ingredients.  The bill was surprisingly affordable.  For such creative food Purple Pig serves, I'd expect to pay more than ~$50 for our meal.  Bottom-line, Purple Pig would be on my visit list during my next trip home."
"While I still don't enjoy tapas, The Purple Pig was one of the better tapas places I've been to. The price is still a bit steep for both the quality and quantity of food. The service, decor, and non-food related attributes of the place are all very good. We went with a group of six, so we ordered a decent bit. We tried at least one dish from every subcategory of the menu from the Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette to the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs to the ever so popular Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. None of the dishes made me go ""wow,"" though the goat cheese and pork shoulder were both very good. Some of the dishes, like the cured meat and the bone marrow, did make me have the opposite reaction. I love, nay, LOVE bone marrow, but it's almost like they managed to suck the natural flavor out of the marrow and replace it with, well, nothing.My feeling is that much of the buzz is coming from the recent pork craze which was getting really old even a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I still love me some pork, I just don't think any pig slapped on a plate should be fawned over.The Purple Pig wasn't as bad as I've made it sound. I don't plan on going back, but I in no way regret stopping in. I just don't think there's anything particularly exceptional about The Purple Pig."
"My office crew and I hit this spot and while I dig the community seating and the great beer list, the small plates concept is overdone. The food was pretty good but at the costs I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  While we managed to get enough to eat, swine and cheese is fairly greasy and didn't leave me feeling so great by mid-afternoon. Thank God for the beer!"
"Wow what a place, gastro wine bar! Had theshaved Brusslesprouts appitizer, a little bit salty for my tastes, but after that Woo Hoo damn good. Great wine selection, great mixture of plates all perfect for sharing and sampling. I had the Razor clams the pigs ears and the quale, not a hint of anything but goodnesss in each dish. Topped off with that wine list, and a nice spanish brandy, I only wish I had more people with me to try other things."
"This place has been getting a lot of hype, and it received the Bib Gourmand designation by the Michelin Red Guide.  I went for a weekday lunch by myself and sat at the bar.  Service was good for a bar seat.  I got a draft beer, the bone marrow, and the braised pork shoulder.  Beer was good but slightly overpriced.  Bone marrow was just okay.  The braised pork shoulder, supposedly their signature dish, was tender but was too salty.  Overall not a bad meal.  I can see this as a great place to go for a night cap or a munchie with a group of friends.  Frankly Chicago needs to have more late night gastro-joints like this near Mag Mile.  But still, IMHO, the food was just ""okay,"" which makes me feel that the place is a bit overpriced and over-hyped."
"Was here on vacation awhile ago and just had the time to write a review now. Great service, great food. We had a good variety of stuff here, but I don't remember exactly what we had. The location was superb since its right where all the big shopping malls are."
"I wouldn't visit this place again, but I'm glad I marked it off the list. It was a fun experience, but it is extremely loud inside. If you're seated at the large tables where the family style seating is, it's also hard to have a conversation with your date.Here's what we had and what I'd recommend:Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli - This was awesome. Definitely would recommend. Pretty small portion but packed with flavor.Cauliflower topped with bread crumbs - probably my second favorite thing. Great flavor and texture. My fiance was not a fan though! Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Very tender. A little bland on flavor but was still good.Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde - Not a fan of this dish at all. Was very bitter.Sicilian Iris for dessert - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche - This was a well done dessert. Beautiful fluffy pastry filled with cheese and chocolate. I wish it would have been a little sweeter.A glass of wine I had was bad. Waitstaff was great about it though and very friendly. I left feeling a little hungry and a little unsatisfied. If you only have a few nights in the city I wouldn't necessarily recommend that as a top choice, but again, glad for the experience."
"Hard to get in, not the best service, and the seating situation is very uncomfortable. But the food makes up for that for the most part. It was delicious! We got a bunch of the small plates, and only one didn't blow us away."
"I've been meaning to try Purple Pig for a while.  Every time I went shopping on Michigan Ave, I would pass by and wonder what a restaurant by that name could possibly be like.  Before I read reviews, I was expecting some sort of hokey BBQ joint -- instead I found that it is a classy sort wine-cellar, hang around the kitchen and enjoy great food type of place.  Their kitchen is the size of a basic home kitchen - it's so impressive that they can get everyone out so quickly for so many tables.  The minus one star is for communal seating, of which I am not a fan (the man across from us had a cold and kept sniffling very loudly, which was really disgusting), and also for not serving martinis.We knew we wanted pork shoulder, but were unsure about anything else.  We asked our waitress - who was really nice btw - for suggestions and ordered everything she recommended.  Great choices!!The gist:- tapas style Mediterranean (Italian/Greek/Spanish) food- delicious pork shoulder with mashed potato - I could have eaten two of these orders easily!  I wanted to lick the bowl.  Okay, that makes me sound like a pig, lol, but really, it's that good.- smears... the descriptions do not sound appetizing - pork neck, really? That sounds depressing.  OMG it was soooo good.- sepia, a type of squid.  I never heard of it before, but I like calamari, so we gave it a try.  It was served in a lemony juice with almonds.  It was delicious!- prosciutto balls were good, but not on the same level as everything else.- dessert: Nutella, banana and marshmallow sandwiches (one order is big enough for two, too big for just one)  So simply and yummy.I'll definitely be back, but probably will wait for an individual table."
"If you look at their menu on their website, the prices there are lower than when you go to the actual restaurant - not cool.  Not a big deal, it's still fairly priced, but update your website to show accurate pricing!  I digress...anyways, we had a wonderful little dinner at the Pig last night. My fave was the milk braised pork shoulder and the mortadella smear w/balsamico and pistachio.  We also had the butternut squash w/pumpkin seeds/brown butter and the prosciutto bread balls.  Loved the squash, wouldn't recommend the balls - too salty, small and just tastes like bread crumbs.  That was the only item I would not order again.Our waitress was good, hostesses even nicer, and even Jimmy Bannos Jr. himself came by to check on how we liked the food (that was nice). I liked all the smiling faces...I live just across the river from here, so the Pig will be a new regular spot.  I'm excited for the summer to come so we can eat on the Pig patio!!One suggestion...improve the dessert menu please. :-)  I really wanted dessert last night after din but there was just nothing enticing on the menu (and for me, that's saying a lot)."
Nice place to hang out after hours.  Food menu is out of the norm.  We had the pork shoulder.
"Make reservations, or you might end up waiting for a seat at a bar for nearly an hour. Whether it is a weekday night or weekend, this place is bustling, and for good reason! It's a tapas-style kind of place, so get several plates to share (maybe 2, 3 each if you're looking for dinner) and you might not want to arrive ravenously hungry unless your wallet can afford it. I particularly like starting with a prosciutto, then maybe something with squid. I usually just order randomly off the menu and I feel like every dish I've had here has always satisfied my taste buds. Even though they are busy, the service has always been friendly. Standouts include calamari with fregola, milk braised pork shoulder, and mussels with pancetta"
"Go there.  The wait was long and they don't offer reservations, but we went across the street for a glass of wine to kill time.  Glad we waited.  Tried some foods we thought were a little weird based on the descriptions, but man they were awesome.  Bone marrow, pigs ear, and the chicken screwers were to die for.  Yum.  We had a cheese plate for dessert that had a great grape spread to enjoy along with it.  We enjoyed a bottle of Pinot Noir recommended by our waiter and it wasn't too bad price wise at the end.  It is a small place, so wouldn't recommend fighting out the wait inside.  This is definitely worth going to check out."
"What a great surprise. Who would think you could get pork-oriented tapas more or less above the Billy Goat Tavern? We enjoyed the pork shoulder, but the show stopper was something that just sounded weird but not so weird that we weren't intrigued. The fried deviled egg (only one) was so yummy, it took us by complete surprise. Shaped like a breaded Easter egg, it looked like an intact egg but in fact had the deviled yolk inside. We sort of wanted bread, and without charge they brought out a freshly toasted crostini made to order!If you're not into sharing your food, walk past this oddly named place. But if you enjoy good wine and fresh takes on pork and cheese tapas, take it from this tourist, Purple Pig was a sure winner. Tha-tha-that's all folks!"
"A really fun dining experience! The atmosphere is bustling - it's a quaint space with tall communal tables that run through the center, smaller tables of two along the wall and additional seating at the bar. The staff really hustles around and seem to be very knowledgeable about the offerings from the menu. We were seated at one of the communal tables near the kitchen. The aromas that poured out of the kitchen were extremely enticing. Each dish that quickly whizzed by our table made it that much more difficult to make our selections from the menu. So many tempting options! Unfortunately, they were out of quite a few things we were hoping to try. I found this a bit odd considering it was a Saturday afternoon around 2PM. Oh well. We relied on the waitress' recommendations and she was practically spot on. I say practically, because she suggested the Prawns a la Plancha. Normally, I would be all about this, but with so many creative and intriguing options on the menu I was a bit disappointed with this dish. However, everything else we tried was pretty freakin' tasty. We sampled various cheeses, sipped a savory wine and let our taste buds ignite!"
"An Ode to the Purple Pig:If you like to dine on swine with wine, then the Purple Pig will do you just fine.They only take reservations for parties over four, so if you're not that size, you have to put your name down at the door.But getting there on Saturday around 7 or 8, will probably result in an hour's wait.If you're like me, and you want to sit right away, there's one solution that might make you stay.If you're a party of two, you don't have to go really far, just grab your partner and sit at the bar!If the bar is full, eating there is still faster, though my own experience almost turned into a disaster.We had one seat and were waiting for the adjacent one to be free, when this old fart tried to cut in front of me!But I sat down first and all should have been good and well, but this guy made a scene and said, ""Go to hell!""He said the person that left said he could have her chair, I told him we were waiting there first, so that wasn't fair.Lucky for him I was dining with a lady that night, so I ignored what he said and avoided a fight.I ordered prosecco and cava, and the lady had a cab, and we both agreed that the drinks were just fab!We started with bread balls that had prosciutto inside, which once again proved that everything's good fried.The chicken thigh kebabs were moist, flavorful, and great, and the accompanying fried smashed potatoes were definitely first rate.I had one minor critique, and maybe it's just me, but I thought it tasted better without the tzatziki.We had another good dish that some people might fear, but tasting it, you'd never guess it's fried pig's ear.It was mixed with an egg and cut into shoe-string size, and the crispy kale was almost as good as french fries!The bartender recommended we get the pork blade steak, but when she asked how it was, our enthusiasm was fake.You should get the tender milk braised pork shoulder instead; for this dish, I can live with a pig being dead.We ended with a donut stuffed with chocolate and ricotta cheese; if you have a sweet tooth, it will definitely please.Service was good, but dessert took a really long time; they made up for it, though, by giving us chocolate liquor shots on their dime.I will definitely be back to eat and drink some more, especially since it didn't leave me too poor.So if you're reading this review, take it from me, you'll leave the Purple Pig happy and yelling, ""Suey!!!"""
"Let me preface this review by saying The Purple Pig was so delicious that we came back for a second visit on our four-day trip in Chicago. If I could have eaten here every day, I would have. Highlights of my meals include:Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki - Seriously, I am still dreaming about how amazing this chicken was. The skin on the outside was really crispy and salty, but the chicken inside was incredibly juicy. A feat of science! Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - I think I was partly expecting hunk of chewy meat, but the pork was crunchy, salty and in thin strands. The kale was a great complement and the dish overall didn't feel too heavy or greasy. Mussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche and Marjoram - With the addition of crème fraiche, I expected the sauce to be a bit creamy, but it was actually more of a broth. Thankfully this dish is served with bread for dipping, which you'll need so you don't let the sauce go to waste! The pancetta is the real hit in this dish because, well, what doesn't taste better with bacon(ish)? Panino con Nutella (dessert) - Nutella, marshmellow fluff and bananas sandwiched between two slices of thick bread and grilled to perfection. Not sure I really need to say more about this masterpiece. Simply amazing. I would steer clear of the affogato (ice cream topped with a shot of either hot or cold espresso) if you're a fan of the traditional vanilla ice-cream kind. The Purple Pig only has chocolate and cinnamon ice cream on hand and it's just not the same. Never figured myself for an affogato snob but... I'm not ashamed. The restaurant was packed both times I visited, around 2 p.m. on different week days. They have quite a few communal tables (inside and on the patio), but it made the dining experience more casual and fun. The dishes are meant for sharing and it's recommended you get 2 - 3 dishes per person but good luck trying to decide. This place is a must-visit while in Chicago, and perhaps more than once!"
"LOVED this place. I do not usually branch out with my restaurant choices and Purple Pig was way out of my comfort zone. We had no ideas on what to order and the menu looked foreign, we mostly went with out waiter's opinions and then a few of our own. The quail, pig's ear, and foi gras smear were my favorites. The bone marrow smear tasted way too ""fatty"" but we knew what we were getting ourselves into. Great service and nice atmosphere. I would definitely go back!"
"Dinner here was a mix of fair, good, and some very good dishes.  Otherwise not particularly memorable."
"We went on a busy Friday afternoon and missed the dinner rush.  They were busy, but we got right in, so there was no long wait at all.  The atmosphere was fun, but a little loud.  I loved the energy of the place.  We ordered the milk braised shoulder, the pig ears, the jowl and the roasted marrow.  The shoulder was the star of the show!  Absolutely incredible.  I've had ears before and they've been chewy and sort of unsatisfying, but these were perfect.  The texture was sort of like fried onion strings - crispy, light, delicious, and they served it with an egg on top, so the yolk gave it a fantastic richness.  Jowl - how can you go wrong?  It was basically a take on the BLT, with jowl replacing the bacon, heirloom tomatoes, frisee and an egg on top.  Really, really good.  The marrow itself was good, but I wish they hadn't oiled the bread so much.  Adding that to the fats in the marrow made it a little too greasy.We had a few cocktails - the price was typical of the area (overpriced) but the quality was good.Excellent atmosphere!  Excellent food!  Excellent service!  I highly recommend this place."
"I love the name of this spot.  Makes me giggle.Ok, first of all, I'm NOT a pork eater -- however, after having a few pork related dishes at Publican and the pork belly tacos at Big Star, I've started to come around -- slowly. I came for lunch and to start had the marinated olives and the eggplant -- both excellent.From the ""smears"" portion of the menu I had the pork liver pate -- never had this before but it was excellent!I also had the mortadella panini -- divine! I truly enjoyed this place and the service was great too.  I'll be back -- I'd like to experience it for dinner!"
"1st time patron and I was delighted! Roasted Bone Marrow was awesome. The foie grois pâté decadent! If ever in downtown Chicago, the purple pig is a must try. Great atmosphere, excellent selection of wines to boot!! I'm a fan!"
"I returned to the Purple Pig for the 3rd time last week. This time I came with 5 friends on a Thursday. Still supercrowded. (sigh)  But this time I was a big flustered by the wait because the waitress said 15 minutes and we ended up waiting 45 minutes. The food makes this place worth the noise and the wait! Really! FOOD:- The CHEESE platter is THE BEST DEAL on this menu, and I've tried tons of things at this place. It's a must-have for groups!!  They served generous amounts on a rectangular platter with your choice of a spread Ask for more bread!!!  They only serve like 5 slices of bread at first. Their cheese selection is great! Our friends randomly picked 5 cheeses including waitress's recommendations and we loved all the selections! - I think this was seasonal but we had an amazing Butternut Squash dish - perfect dish to warm your belly in this cool  fall weather. We were all raving about this dish. - of course we had the usual must-haves such as the beets in goat cheese, milk braised pork shoulder  and Deviled Egg  - I've reviewed these selections in the past already. Honestly, i prefer the outdoor seating with the heating lamps because indoors you can't even talk to the person across from you without yelling  Even with the canopy, sit close to the heating lamps or you will freeze!"
"Cozy atmosphere with the romantic vibe, super awesome bartender and waiter, and sensational European food. It's The Purple Pig.We went there for lunch just to get something light and were overwhelmed by interesting and creative items on the menus. The menu was presented tapas-style with lots of smaller dishes that ranged from $5 to $15. We sat at the bar and ordered scallop spiedini with chickpea aioli, pig's tails braised in balsamic and my favorite.. pig's ear with crispy kale, marinated cherry peppers & fried egg. The food was delicious. It also had great texture and lovely presentation. Huge wine/beverage selection was a plus. I wished we could try them all that day. With that said, I'd definitely come back to try other items. Now add purple to my favorite color!"
"What a meal!  Dined solo at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly and helpful.  I had a great red (can't remember what it was as it was 2 months ago).  Started with the marrow, which was creamy, buttery, goodness.  I then got the milk braised pork shoulder which was so very good.  Please put this in your itinerary for Chicago.  I know there are a load of good choices, but you will not be disappointed with this place."
"Summation: Excellent food, location & ambiance, great for a date or small dinner group. However....expensive, slow service.""The Bad""? Price. If its Friday night and you just got paid, well, then this may be the spot if you're looking to drop some cash. Why so much? Because if you're coming with a serious appetite, you'll have to get a fairly large amount of plates to split amongst your group. (And heck, with the awesome menu you'll be hard pressed to NOT want to get a lot.)Another downer was the PACE of the service. Our server was actually extremely knowledgeable about both wine and food choices, but we were there for lunch with a business group that obviously couldn't lounge around all afternoon. We actually cancelled our dessert order because it was taking too dang long.So...enough Negative Nancy....what about ""The Good""??The creativity and care that goes into each delicate dish is quite obvious. Their entire menu really plays well on combining sweet and savory into one dish, and using slightly unusual ingredients to bump up the otherwise norm (i.e. using duck egg instead of a chicken egg...simple things like that). The breadth of offerings is pretty generous and their wine selection is FAB!Here were my favorites:-Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette (""Beets? Really?"" YES. REALLY.)-Prosciutto Bread Balls-Jamon Serrano with Duck Egg, Asparagus & Grilled Bread-Eggplant Caponata with Goat CheeseOolala! Yum!"
"Came here for dinner over the Christmas break. Very crowded but luckily we didn't have to wait long for a table of 4. This place was highly recommended to me and I was very eager to try it! :: Food :: Salt-Roasted Beets, Shaved Brussel Sprouts, Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Jamon Serrano, Oyster Mushrooms, Fried Egg with Grilled BreadThe food was tasty, simple and rustic. But why did I only give 3 stars?1. The food was simple and tasty +points!2. Service was impeccable - very accommodating and gave great wine recommendations. +points!3. My bf and I got stomach cramps after eating the pigs ear! -- points!!!!! I was hoping it was just this night... but my friends had also suffered the same fate on other occasions.I REALLY wanted to like this place and REALLY wanted to give it more stars because the service is great, the menu is diverse and creative, but getting ill afterwards really killed my excitement.Should I try again? I'll have to think about it, but when the number of great restaurants in Chicago and my limited time there, maybe not!"
"Just about perfect in every way.The space is hidden on the side of the 500 N. Michigan building, but once we made our way in, we were immersed in the soft glow of amber lighting bouncing off of the brown wood and splashes of blue, white and yellow from tiles on the wall. The atmosphere is relaxed, with the servers IPod mixes serving as background music. The greeter enthusiastically did his job. We sidled up to the bar.The bartender greeted us like old friends that he had been expecting, and then he began telling us all about his favorite wines and cheeses. From the moment he started speaking, he was thoughtful to listen to our likes as he made suggestions, and his passion for both the wine and main menu was obvious. The food was obscene. I was like a child in a candy store, heart racing as I went down the menu like a checklist. Cheese? Well, we have to have cheese. And some olives. And of course, a couple of the ""Smears"" - dishes ranging from mortadella whipped with olive oil, to eggplant caponata, all served with crusty bread to smear it on. And for good measure, I should have the bone marrow. Had I paced myself better, I could still be there right now doing that.Between the relaxed atmosphere, the passionate, super-friendly staff, the fantastic food, and the relatively reasonable prices, it was decided before we left that this was our new Monday night ritual. A little bit of goodness to ease into the work week."
"Tapas!!!!! Great location!! We had the roasted bone marrow recommended by a friend. It is delicious! Taste and melts in your mouth like butter. We also had the artichokes and stuffed olives!!! I love the wood decor and wine sayings. It's an intimate place, but ate here with my best friend and we were seated between two couples- not awkward at all! Chicagoans are very friendly!!!"
"one of the best eats for lunch in a long time. Always busy so not the best of place if your in a hurry. Cramped doesn't describe the venue, but it adds to the appeal of the restaurant. Overall great food, decent service. Do get the pork shoulder, pate (Best i've ever had)Skip the pig ears"
"I was recommended this place by a buddy while I was in Chicago visiting the family for the holidays.  Came here around 12:45(pm).. the place was packed for sure; but we were seated within about 5 min. Interesting place for sure.  Almost like a tapas style of Pork and things that go with wine.  I would def. recommend this place if you like wine and if you like pork!I highly recommend the 'Milke Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes' Amazing.Coppa with Provolone Cheese, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Whole Grain Mustard Panini was also excellent!"
"The Purple Pig, you should go.  The staff here was so lovely and knowledgeable; all of them seemed to be foodies.  They have an extensive wine list and do a somewhat odd, porky tapas menu hence the name The Purple Pig, but they do have other options as well. The Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette was to die for; I could have eaten that alone with a glass of wine. However, no we had to gorge ourselves and also tried the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio smear, very rich and a little intense for my tastes, but my husband thoroughly enjoyed it. The fried Melrose Peppers with the little chips of garlic were amazing.  I really enjoyed my time at the Purple Pig and would be more than happy to stop here again when I am in Chicago."
The restauraunt is small but the food make up for the lack of space and the wait! The waitress got our order wrong but we ate it wanyway because everything on the menu is delicious!
Amazing food and great service! The menu was a bit overwhelming but our server was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got lucky and got seated right away. We  got there at 3pm and the place was already full. Great wine selection. We ended up order several small plates and was very very satisfied. And the prices were very reasonable (even with alcohol). Definite must-go in Chicago.
"Big fan of this place!  Love their cheese board, spirits are awesome, and service is amazing.  The roasted bone marrow is amazing!!!!  TRy everything on the menu, but be prepared to wait.  The line is long to get a seat, and it is hot inside during the summer months!!There is outside seating that is nice, and as mentioned above.....service is awesome.Glad to see this place downtown, and will return every time I am in Chicago."
"omg. I made the mistake of coming here after a wonderful, over the top, awesome experience.I can't complain much about the food. The wine was great. The cheese selection was great, I just wish our waitress hadn't recommended the same three that everyone else in the room was having, just because it was easier for her.The wait was.. HORRIBLE. As there was literally NO room to wait inside (unless my date and I were going to wait inside the bathroom) we told the hostess that we would wait just outside under the awning. 15 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass.. no call. I go inside to check how far exactly we were down the list (since she had told me it would be 15 minutes) and instead she tells me ""oh! I thought you left!"" umm... no, that's why i looked you in the face and said.. ""I'LL BE WAITING JUST OUTSIDE THE DOORS"".... the main host came over and quickly tried to resolve the issue.We were seated next, but in the back booth table. A cute, intimate and cozy spot.. only... other people waiting to be seated were hovering around us.. awkward.We looked at the beverage menu before sitting down, and knew what we wanted to get. Why is it that our bottle of wine took longer to get to the table than the food items we didn't know we were going to order? It also made for an awkward wait, as we had a full table of food, a full bottle of wine... but only one plate, one wine glass and one water glass at our table.. were we supposed to fight over who gets what?And surprisingly, our favorite item was not of the cheese, wine or swine variety, but actually the grilled octopus and swiss chard. yum!Either way, this place is much more for the tourists. I'm not sure I'll ever make my way back here again, unless it's on a weekday evening or early Sunday afternoon. I think my chances are better heading to Gene's Sausage Shop & Delicatessen in Lincoln Square, where I know the service will be much better and I can just al fresco in the park at a quarter of the cost."
"I don't know if everyone writing reviews here are friends of the restaurant or not. But, we had a really bad time here. The service was horrible to the point of we actually decided to start timing until someone came to speak with us. The food we actually did get served was not even that good. Maybe they will improve but I'd wait 6 months to a year to tell anyone to go.Skip the mushy fried deviled egg they reccomend. In short any restaurant can have potential but it's your money and Id reccomend you spend it elsewhere first."
"I've been to Purple Pig twice - the first visit was fun and delicious after one initial hiccup with an overly crabby server...She ended up being quite helpful and accomodating after I shot her a dirty look upon her withering reply to my request for silverware.  On that visit, we enjoyed a great bottle of wine that the server recommended, we loved the beets, the fava bean dish, and the octopus.  I returned to Purple Pig on Friday and was completely underwhelmed from the second we walked through the door.  We were able to sit down immediately, but our table was hardly enjoyable as it was crammed into a corner and the home to a colony of fruit flies.  I'm not kidding.  Fruit files.  Inside.  Buzzing around our table.  Totally unappetizing.  I didn't say anything until the end of the meal.  I should have.  By the time dessert (the totally thick, gloppy, and almost flavorless Iris Rose) arrived, I had already talked to one server about the problem and I ended up just walking to the hostess stand and requesting to eat the dessert at the bar.  A woman who I presume to be the manager talked to us about the problem, apologized, comped our dessert, and told us that they ""would try to figure out that problem"" before seating the table again.  Less than 5 minutes later, it was re-sat.   This lack of attention to detail was in close accordance with the bumbling and uninformed server who took care of us that night - she seemed to know very little about wine (or waiting tables, for that matter).  Here is an exchange we had with her:My sister:  ""I don't really like oaky wines.""  Server:  ""Do you like chardonnay?"" Sister:  ""No.""  Server: ""Well, this one is  a chardonnay, but it doesn't really taste like one.""  There are too many really good, inviting wine bars with excellent service in the city of Chicago to bother with Purple Pig ever again.   The only redeeming part of this whole botched visit was that the entire bill, complete with a 20% tip, was $90."
"I'm not a fan of ""Michigan Ave"" touristy restaurants.  This isn't one of them!!  This is a real gem.  Although the hostess didn't have a clue of what she was doing, we were told 90 minutes for a table, and 3 minutes later another person in our group asked and she said 40 minutes.  We were seated in 20 minutes.  The food was incredible.  The turkey leg was huge.  The shoulder steak was cooked perfect.  The milk braissened shoulder was incredible.  Bone marrow......very rich and flavorful.  They have an extensive wine list.  Very nice place."
"This place was amazing - delicious and just wonderful!  I had some time between a meeting and a work event and my friend recommended that we come here for some drinks and a bite to eat.This was amazing from start to finish.  They have this extensive and amazing wine list.  We started off with a quartino of this Italian red wine - I couldn't pronounce the name then and I doubt that I can even spell it now.  Our first dish was the roasted bone marrow smear with herbs which was savory and delicious on the toasted bread.  We also had the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki which was juicy and deliciously flavored, as well.  Since I was a time crunch, we only ordered one more dish - the Fried Manchego with Membrillo Vinaigrette which was delicious, as well.  Everything was perfectly done and nothing was overboard.Overall, delicious food and perfect for sharing.  I definitely look forward to coming back again!"
"To only give 5 stars is a crime!My boyfriend and I have been here twice in the past month and both times it's exceeded our expectations!The Plus':1. Well-balanced wine list2. Amazing food - everything we've had is fantastic3. Very very friendly service - we even scored a free glass of wine last night because another patron ended up not wanting their order!4. Cheese comes from a local shop: Pastoral in Lakeview -- amazing cheeses and worth the priceFood:Pork neck bone, bone marrow, pork shoulder: ALL amazing.  They've been out of the pork liver pate both times we've been so we're still waiting to taste that.  The chicken kabob was recommended by our waiter, and it was fantastic! For a place known for their swine, they cook a mean bird.Even though the restaurant is always busy, they move people in and out quick enough that the wait isn't too long.  We can't wait for the next time we go back: Christmas-ish get together with family!"
"We were just walking by on a Tuesday night to check out the scene, and for fun we asked how long the wait was.  The place was packed inside and out, so we were shocked when the hostess said she could seat us outside right away!  Figuring it was a sign, we decided we might as well stay for dinner.The highlights of our meal were...- Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  This was the last of the dishes to arrive, but it was worth the wait!  - Roasted bone marrow.  Delicious with the accompanying sea salt and vinegar cilantro and onion.  Could've been improved with bread that wasn't smothered in olive oil.  I would have been happy with toasted French bread instead.Nothing was to die for, so not sure if we'll be coming back for another Tuesday night dinner.  But it would be fun to try again in a big group!"
"When a restaurant shows up on more than one list on TOC and is in the heart of downtown and is NOT a fancy steakhouse, it was just a matter of time before I made my way in there! Stars aligned when an old friend agreed to accompany me on a cold weekday night and it was a fun dining experience indeed. We made an attempt to go budget friendly on the alchohol and were not at all disappointed with a 6$ glass of fine red Italian wine. We deserted any attempt to go calorie friendly and were thrilled with our frugal but delicious small plates. I loved the fried brussel sprouts and the squash arancini, but the very buttery butternut squash was a bit too rich even on a half empty stomach.We didn't quite share our food with complete strangers as TOC predicted but did exchange wine recommendations and small talk- maybe it was the cosy ambiance, maybe the energy on a weekday evening, maybe it was the two glasses of wine, but being friendly with a random diner sitting next to you, does come quite easily at Purple Pig.Less easier is the ability to snag a table without a lengthy wait. But if you don't mind sipping your wine in a dead zone between the restrooms and the main lobby, when the mercury doesn't allow for a wait outside on Mich Avenue - there is not much to complain about with the swine, wine and cheese experience in a very non-pretentious and local setting in a neighborhood that you would least expect it in."
"Seriously reasonably priced upscale Mediterranean small plates, with an emphasis on porkaliciousness.So bear in mind, that's reasonable, not cheap, but still -- considering the location and the quality of food and service, the Purple Pig is a serious deal!Starting off, they have a large wine list of all European wines, heavy on cool Italian and Spanish offerings. Even better, there are tons of reasonably priced bottles, with tons of half-bottles on offer as well.The menu is pork-heavy, as you'd expect, but I convinced my vegetarian girlfriend to come here with me and there were a bunch of veggie-friendly offerings as well -- and absolutely no attitude from our server when asking about what dishes were meat-free.Of particular note are the smears -- we got both the pork rillette and eggplant caponata smears, both huge steals at about five bucks each for a generous portion of stuff to smear and bread to smear it on. Antipasto dishes are a treat also -- the the brussels sprouts and salt roasted beet were phenomenal and amply sized.My meaty dish of choice was the fried pig ears with egg and kale, which were nothing short of phenomenal. Little slices of ear with that delicious porky melt-in-your-mouth quality covered in thin breading, all mixed in with crispy kale and bits of over-easy fried egg? Decadent. And bonus: it's served in a super cute dish that looks like a pig. Yeah.The cured meat and cheese looked excellent as well, although we didn't get to try any.The Purple Pig offers a temple to porky deliciousness, first-rate Mediterranean small plates, a large wine list, very friendly service, and very reasonable prices for all of it.  Definitely check it out!As an addendum, our waiter said the place had only been open for two weeks. Truly impressive."
"There is a reason why the pig is not sacred in any religion and that's because they are just too delicious! As for the other religion that outlaw the eating of pigs for other reasons...I just don't want to get involved in that fracas.The Purple Pig is impressive. Pig is served in many ways, shapes and forms. Our bartender knew the menu inside and out. I recommend:- Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey- Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic- Grilled Cheese- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- Brussel Sprouts with Thyme and Lemon- Mussels with Treviso, Serrano Chiles, Winter Citrus & Gaeta OlivesI was disappointed though that they didn't have any artisan bacon which I expected them to have."
"We knew this was going to be an interesting meal, but we wanted to give it a try. We went on July 4th and waited about 2 hours for a seat, but we expected this and killed time having a few drinks and walking around Michigan Ave.  We tried a few things, some definitely better than others. We told the waitress that we wanted to start with three meats and three cheeses and for her to surprise us (we also said that we were adventurous). For the meats, she brought us the testa (delicious), lingua agrodolce (I've never had tongue before, but it was actually pretty good), and prosciutto (amazing). Things got interesting on the cheeses. We had the caveman bleu (standard bleu cheese) and the Maxx 365 (firm, semi-dry cheese) which were good. The Mont St. Francis, however, smelled like, and tasted like wet garbage. I like strong cheeses (or at least I thought I did) but this one was way too much for any of us to handle. The next thing we got was the roasted bone marrow, correctly described to us by the waitress as ""beef butter."" It was excellent. The next thing we got was the fried pig ear, which came as small shredded fried bits mixed in with a few other things. I really enjoyed this and would get it again. We finished with the octopus which was my favorite thing. I'm a huge grilled calimari fan, and this was very similar but a little more meaty. We didn't get dessert as some of us were still feeling the effects of the cheese course. I'm not rushing back to the Purple Pig any time soon, but it is a good spot to have a fun meal with friends."
"We went here on Friday for a friend's birthday. Arrived at about 8PM and the other 10 or so people there for the party were in attendance already gathered by the bar. Upon walking in, the place itself reminded me of a smaller version of Quartino due to the mostly wood decor, large bar with tons of wines displayed, white menus with an array of small plates/cheeses. I always enjoy Quartino and even though the two places have no relationship to one another other than my personal observation I fully expected to enjoy my time here especially based on all of the great reviews and buzz Purple Pig had been getting. Anyway, while our group moved from the bar to the table (no reservations, so it was the matter of jockeying for position at one of the larger communal tables), I waited by the bar to order Amy and I drink - stood there for what was easily 5+ minutes (it wasn't packed) and no one took my order. Decided to sit down and order from the server instead. He was extremely nice but very slow and disorganized- it took over 10 minutes to get a mixed drink and a glass of wine. This continued the entire time and I never quite understood why. A bunch of different items were ordered - the cheeses we had were great and the smear was pretty tasty as well. I didn't sample everything but did order the milk braised pork shoulder for myself figuring a featured pork item in a restaurant focused on pork would be a great representation of the place. It tasted like a bad version of the slow cooker pot roast I make for Jewish holidays which is kind of funny in itself. My pot roast rocks. This was dry and uneventful - the only saving grace were the mashed potatoes on the plate but once those were finished the pork couldn't hang on it's own. I realize that my two star review is in the midst of a slew of 4/5 star reviews so I guess there's always a chance that I was there on an ""off"" night however between the nonexistent service at the bar, the slow table-side service and the very disappointing pork dish I see no reason why I will ever return."
"We came to this restaurant before going to a show at the Chicago Theater. Though it's crowded we got there early enough to snag two seats at the bar right across from the stove.  It was very enjoyable to see the chefs at work...and they worked hard and fast!We tried a lot of different items including the fried deviled egg (so rich and delicious), the beets, the brussel sprout salad, the bone marrow, a cheese plate, and a beautiful Tempranillo.Everything was wonderful, the service was great and I would 100% go back.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!"
"I really liked this place!  My dude and I came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon on a whim, and I have to say it made the rest of that rainy afternoon extremely tolerable.  Or was it the champagne that did that?The food is rich and can be a bit pricey, but the milk braised pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.  To make a point of how well it was cooked, my boyfriend ate it with a spoon (yes, I think the champagne may have gone to our heads by that point.)The seating at the restuarant ranges from private 4-seat tables to sharing large (read: seats 14) high boys with your fellow patrons, which is a great way to meet people.  The couple sitting kitty corner from us ordered the bone marrow, which they insisted we order as well.  While I don't think I'm a huge fan of bone marrow, I was glad we tried it!They also have a lovely selection of cheeses and really good wines (did I mention the champagne?).Chicagoans- if you're looking for a place downtown to take your visiting parents or in-laws, this is the place!  It's not a chain (it's owned by three well-renown Chicagoy chefs), and it's hip and cool without being too young. Visitors- if you're looking for a special treat downtown and don't mind dropping some coin, I highly recommend it.  Again, it's not a chain, so I feel like you can get a great Chicago gastronomic experience."
"It was our first time here and the waitstaff was VERY helpful, a bit too helpful, but not over the top.  The food tasted wonderful.  We ordered the Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey.  The chicken was tender and the skin was crispy, the pork was tender and had the perfect amount of sear on it. My complaints:  It would have been nice to put on the website that this was a place where the food doesn't come out together and the plates are meant to be shared.  Not from Chicago, so I looked for places to eat before going, and no mention of that whatsoever on the website.  We chose to sit out on the patio and we were put right next to the speakers and the busiest foot traffic of the place.  That really knocked the enjoyment down a level.  When it came to order, I ordered, and then the waitress just turned around and thought we were done ordering!  My boyfriend was a bit offended, and he even said he didn't even feel like eating anymore.  Needless to say, I diffused the situation and he got to order what he wanted.  My last complaint is, since my boyfriend's order was taken last, and mine first, my food came last!  We finished eating the pork and waited for another 10 minutes before the chicken came out.The food tasted great.  That's all I can say about this place.  I would eat here again, but only if I was in the area.  I would not make plans to come here again though."
"4.5I knew we'd be stuck downtown after the Wait, Wait taping (yep, I'm turning a smug 57 next week), and too hungry to skate all over the city looking for dinner.  I was reasonably intrigued by Purple Pig, given the price points.  I then noticed a withering takedown of the place on this site by a guy who seems to specialize in oleaginous reviews.  That clinched my decision.We had salted beets; endive and mixed green salads; sobrasada; sardines; pig's ear; and sepia.  Granted, some of the stuff was a bit heavy for ordinary consumption.  (I'll resist a joke at the Second City's expense here).  The beets, for instance, lost all their nutritive value in a dense mousse of goat cheese.  And fried pig's ear with fried egg and fried kale might not be on my cardiologist's short list.But Purple Pig exceeded my expectations.  The ""foodie"" generation seems to venerate esoteric ingredients and outre pairings over taste and enjoyment.  But not until the dessert card came out did I see  evidence of the chef's impulse towards food chemistry.  Olive oil ice cream...And while the meal was heavy and occasionally oversalted, it was delicious.  And the service was friendly and excellent.  Quite a trick at a tapas place.Right now, Purple Pig's biggest deficiency is its dessert list.  Made in Chicago, I suppose, but Nonna wouldn't have made it past 22 if her life were a constant procession of semolina cream, Sfogliatelle, and Italian pastry.  For $25 pp before wine (yeah, yeah) and after dinner drink, I'd be very surprised if one could do better without losing the tablecloth, atmosphere and pretty young things (That apparently means different things here: the guy to my left was enormous and was wearing a novelty watch with embedded rhinestones in the shape of a skull...his dates called him ""Daddy"")."
"PHENOMENAL!!!It's a slightly hipper version of Avec with similar prices. I love how you can pick between different sizes of wine and several varieties are easy on the pocket. We lucked out and were able to grab some seats by the kitchen without a wait. It was fun to watch all the different dishes come out. It's hot and busy in there, but I have to say Jimmy Bannos Jr. has his sh*t together. We started off with fried deviled eggs. Genius!  The octopus was also very good, but I wish there was more octo portion wise. The milk braised pork shoulder? Excellent, comfort-food redefined.Eggplant caponata: Mmmmm.. It tasted like bruschetta and paired nicely with the goat cheese toasted bread.We didn't order the chicken thighs with fried smash potatoes, but it looked really, really good. For dessert, one of the chef's recommended the Sicilian Iris, a fried brioche stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. If you like fried food, you'll love this. I'd probably get it again even though I'm not big on sweets. If you're looking to impress an out-of-towner without going bankrupt, I'd definitely recommend taking them to Purple Pig.Parking is a challenge, but you can either park in the Nordstrom's lot for $12 or find street parking north of Michigan Ave."
"Oink oink!  I dig the cheese, wine, and swine!  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Although the pig themed marketing may drown out everything you hear, Purple Pig is actually more like an Italian wine & cheese bar/restaurant.  It's elegant, it's unique, it's fun.  Oh yeah, it's crowded too (like all the good restaurants).The menu is set up similar to Quartino or Avec, with a variety of smaller plates in addition to larger plates.  The dishes are intended to be shared.  They are on the small side, so plan on ordering a lot.  I love this, because I can try many dishes! :)  We went the adventurous route.  Here's what I remember:- Sardines with Lemon Vinaigrette- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- Pork Liver Paté- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- Octopus with acini di pepe & Swiss Chard- Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette- Special shad roe salad- Sicilian IrisOur favorites were the pate (how can you go wrong with pate, and it's cheaper than even the deli!)  and bone marrow.  Mmm bone....  All the dishes were great actually.  They have good seafood too, so don't think it's all pork.  To top it off, the chef stopped by to ask us about the shad special, since we were the first ones to have ordered it that evening.I really enjoy unique concepts, daring ingredients, and food influenced by other cultures.  Purple Pig has all of these.  I'm definitely going back to oink some more :)"
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! We were treated poorly by the host and the manager. We were quoted a 45 min wait and ended up waiting 90 min for our table. Plus the food was not worth the wait or the rudeness of the staff.I waited over a week to write this because i wanted to cool off a bit and be fair. I have never been so mad about a dinning experience in my life! We put our name, were quoted 30-45 min. After waiting nearly 60 min my boyfriend went up to the host stand to enquire. She was dismissive of him and hardly paid attention to what he was saying, waving him off and saying we would be next. 20 min later i went up and she said they called us up 30 min prior and they skipped us. There is no way that we could be missed as we stayed in the restaurants waiting area. No host came remotely near us in the time we waited. In addition, why didn't the host tell my boyfriend that when he was up there?!? We then had to wait an additional 10-15 min for them to actually seat us.I asked our server (who did a great job and was the only polite employee we came in contact with) if i could please speak to the manager. I saw him stop by the host stand and could clearly tell that they were giving their side of the story before he even came to see what was wrong. When he finally arrived, I explained that we had waited double the quoted time, that the hosts were dismissive and rude, and how once the problem was brought to their attention we waited an addition block of time without apology. The manager was just as rude! He was unapologetic and blamed it on the fact that they were busy. Being busy doesn't give you the right to be rude to your patrons! I have worked in a restaurant for nearly 6 years. I know what it is like and i am normally very lenient and forgiving. But I would never dream of treating anyone the way the manager and hosts treated us.  If we were not starving (seeing as we waited much longer than expected) and if our waitress was not so nice i would have stood up and left.Food in my opinion can smooth over just about anything. The items we ordered didn't do it. Everything was saturated in sodium so it was hard to make out the other flavors. I would give 3.5 stars to the food because the saltiness was balanced by everything being cooked well and presented well. Overall HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! will never ever go again nor will i suggest it to anyone, not even an enemy."
"Purple Pig: This is my home away from home. A hidden gem of Michigan Avenue. Even if it's not listed on the menu, beg for the liver pate. And the deep fried deviled eggs. And the bone marrrow. Beg.Fantastic."
"Lots of fun and very unique.  Fried Pigs ear is definitely worth trying.  It is a small place and gets very crowded.  They pack everyone in, but it's worth the wait.  Ask the wait staff for their recommendations, but you can't go wrong."
"I've got to admit, I was super skeptical of a 1) gimmicky sounding, 2) new place in 3) tourist central Chicago -- but OMFG was I happy to be proven wrong!Seriously good food, with a sizable array of veggie-friendly options for those of us not so hot on the piggies -- which for a place with the tagline ""Cheese, Wine and Swine,"" is a very welcome surprise! Given the trendiness factor, of course there are a couple brussel sprout (a la the new veggie hotness) options on the menu -- I tried the shaved brussel sprouts, which were cheesy, but different from how I've usually eaten these nutty monsters and just good. Eggplant caponata was classic, and came with some fabulous bread. But the salt roasted beets -- so good, I'm basically on a mission to figure out how to recreate the magic.Great, and affordable wine list with most options available by the half-bottle -- yes please! I can see this arrangement making some people very happy sitting out on the patio by the river this summer.And here's the real kicker: for the princess factor of this place, it's SHOCKINGLY reasonably priced -- like, I thought the check had already been split in two when I saw the grand total. STEAL!"
"Delicious food - definitely my new favorite place. Went here with a group of 5 - we waited about an hour on a Saturday evening since they don't take reservations, but we ordered cocktails and time passed rather quickly. I had some fantastic gin cocktail with amaro, lime juice, and egg whites - it was like drinking a lemon meringue pie, yum!We had:Charred cauliflower with breadcrumbs - nice and zestyEggplant parmesan balls - perfect and creamy deviled egg with arugula and capers -oh my gosh, amazing Fried brussels sprouts with thyme lemon and chili flakes - delicious crispy chipsPig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg -similar to the pig face with hashbrowns and egg at Girl & the Goat - just as good!Whipped feta with cucumber - nice and salty with amazing toasted breadRoasted bone marrow with herbs - died and went to heaven with this dish served with that insanely good breadSepia with celery, almonds and rosemary - very interesting, it tasted like calamari but apparently it's a cuttlefish. pretty cool!Quail with trahana and porcini stuffing, salsify and pomegranate - still tasty, but my least favorite dish. Dessert was the Panino con nutella (I could have had ten of these - it had marshmallow and bananas mmmm) and the Sicilian Iris - ricotta and chocolate chip brioche, also incredible. I may have forgotten something, but everything had was basically spot on. Wowzers - I would go back in a heartbeat :)"
"Wow totally lives up to the hype. Well worth the wait. Small plates, wine and every kind of pork imaginable. I mean, every. kind. imaginable. Also... Dessert is well worth it. A nutella marshmallow and banana sandwich? SCORE!!!!"
"Despite having a vegetarian with our foursome, we found plenty to order at this small plate eatery that was plenty to share.  Ordered a few dishes at a time as our palates changed with the passing of each dish.  Started with the calamari w/fregula, bone marrow, broccoli w/roasted garlic & anchovy vinaigrette, and pigs ears w/crispy kale...all delish!  Next came the razor clams & sepia (cuttlefish)...again worth ordering.  We also got lucky getting a free Octopus w/green beans that must have been someone else's mistake.  Finished off with an Affogato (basic soft serve ice cream w/expresso)...just right to finish off the meal.  The only ""fair"" item was the Manhattan cocktail, just OK, but the Estrella Inadit beer was refreshing on a beautiful day.  Loved this place for the ambiance as well and will definitely go back to try out many of their other choices."
"This place is great! It is very bustling and busy and loud inside, but we actually only waited 20 minutes to get seated outside on a beautiful Friday night. The service was excellent despite the fact they were understaffed as the earlier storms of the day portended a bad night for sitting outside.Try lots of stuff! Most of it is really good. We had:Tuna with lima beans - deliciously vinegaryRoasted beets with goat cheese and pistachios - incredibly wonderful despite how random it sounds - beets, and um goat cheese and how bout we throw some pistachios in there - but they were wonderfulSardines with fennel salad - I'm not a sardine fan but my friends loved it, ditto for the Bone Marrow plateScallops with chick pea aoliArancini - lovely rice balls with minty stuff insideFried proscuitto bread balls - just okPork with mashed potatoes -  home cooking at its best"
"Great place- love the ambiance and the decor.  I would describe the food as return to the old classics, but re-defined with more than a touch of sophistication.  Milk brazed shoulder was so yummy and went down really well with a white wine (cannot remember which one now) that I picked from the extensive wine list.  Yum yum- can't wait to find a reason to go there againThe only bad thing? the fact that parking can be expensive."
"I've been there twice once inside when it was quiet and once outside when it was busy. Quiet was better. This place gets raves so when its busy they struggle because they are a small restaurant.Once you're in stretch your compfort zone and order bone marrow, pork liver pate & pork neck-bone rillette as appetizers. For larger plates try the pigs tails, pork shoulder and ham & duck eggs.This new spot from the family that brought you Heaven on Seven's cajun fare now rides the wave of lesser used cuts of meat and proves you can make a silk purse out of a sows ear."
Fun place for sure! Stopped in after a work conference around 4pm and the place already had a fun group of people sitting around. We sat at the high top table and ordered bottles of wine and small dishes. The greek sausage was really good. Look forward to making another visit next time im in Chicago.
"UM YEAH!!In Chicago recently to spend a romantic weekend with my Husband, and we stumbled upon this place and were completely enchanted. Not sure if it was the wine, the pig, the city, or the fact that we had originally been told at least 30 min wait, and then 1 minute later they sat us (YEAH) - that made us feel special, but it was a cool night.The tables inside & out are communal for the most part, so it does encourage communication with people you don't know, but certainly you don't have to.  Me and my husband were able to have great conversation in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. Wine was great, we got a bottle of spanish red, I believe it was a malbec, but it could have been a tempranillo, I can't remember. We ordered a 3 cheese option, and just told her to surprise us. We WISHED we weren't full when we got there, because my husband wanted to try the pig ears with fried egg, it looked AMAZING - and he loves all things pork.Fantastic place, can't find anywhere here in Dallas like that (don't worry we looked once we got back last weekend!), and we will be back here for sure the next time we are in chicago."
"I went to the Purple Pig during their first week.  I was very impressed by the food selection, ambiance and the efficient rhythm of their kitchen.  You would have thought that they had been open for years.Tried several options including the House Cured Baccalà Brandade which was unique, tasty and an item that I will specifically come back for. Bravo!"
"My wife and I just dined here for our anniversary.  It was excellent.  It was our first visit and, despite reading other reviews, we weren't sure exactly what to expect.Our waiter was very friendly, but also very professional, and explained the menu so well.  I've waited tables and memorized menus before myself, but never had as much knowledge and enthusiasm as our waiter did tonight.  I'd love to name him to give him some props but don't think that's allowed.  All the food was excellent.  The atmosphere cozy and lively.  As I said, it was our first visit, but won't be our last!"
"On my trip to chicago, I found out about this restaurant near my hotel. I tried to go there 4 times but every time it's a long wait and they don't take reservation. I advice that you called in advance to know how long you will be waiting before going there. So on my last day, I finally was able to sit myself down on a lunch day. The waitress was really friendly to us and introduced the menu. We ordered the roasted bone marrow with herbs, milk braised pork shoulder, and the pigs tailed braised in balsamic. We basically wanted to try a little of everything as this was just lunch and we don't want to eat too heavy. The food came quick. The tail and the shoulder was very flavorful because of the juicy fat. The bone marrow was something I never tastes before and it was awesome. You pick the fat part inside the marrow and you eat it with the garlic bread. I wish they had more of the bone instead of the bread. Anyway, if you stop by chicago I recommend this place. :)"
"Its just ok.  If I were out shopping and wanted a small bite and wine I'd pop in.  I will not go out of my way to eat here again.  It was perhaps the worst martini I've ever had.  I know this place is a wine bar but c'mon!  We weren't asked gin or vodka or what kind.  Yes the salted beets are yummy.  That was the star.  The cheese is good but no fruit!  The fried deviled egg is better on paper.  We had some cheese rice balls that were good too.  Then some potato fish spread that needed S&P or something.  It was boring.  The staff was just ok.  It did get crowded and there were some really rude people there.  I'm sure it affected my experience.  However there was either the owner or the manager that came to both tables next to us.  We didn't get a hello, thanks for coming in, is everything ok or anything.  I am Ms. Cellophane but still!!  We felt snubbed.  Also its very loud in there.  Not a great date place."
"I would say this is a 4.5 stars.  Went with a friend here yesterday night (10 ish) and I really enjoyed it!  The place was  quite full and we were told it would be a 20 min wait or no wait at the bar.  We opt for the bar as my buddy was starving!  We waited about 10 mins for them to take our drinks order).  We started with the bone marrow and foie gras.  The bone marrow came in 2 large pieces (almost like a small femur bone cut in half) was full of marrow.  A small salad, toast and sea salt came with it.  My only thing is if they don't put the butter in the toast a the bone marrow was already fat and buttery.  I didn't really enjoyed the foie gras as I should since it was more of a foie gras pate hence the $15 price as oppose to double with just foie gras.  Oh did I mentioned it was a bit sweet (too sweet for me).   There was some jam that came with it so PP if you read this don't sweeten the foie gras!   Our next course was the fried pork sweetbread (sweetbread is really the thymus (neck) gland of the animal normally veal.  It was really nice and not overly oily or greasy.  There was about 10 or so bite size pieces and we gobbled it up and washed it down with some nice beer.  Next we had the grilled octopus.  There was about 4 piceces of 4"" strips (breaded and fried) along with 4"" strips fried potato sticks.  It wasn't easy to figure out which was octopus or potato (kindof like guessing what your catch once you cut it).    I really liked PP and the only reason for not getting the full 5 star is that cold gusts of wind that blows at you when the doors open and just freezing everyone including the poor hostess by the door.   They should put a cloth or drape to block that. and would make for an excellent night!  Go ! go! Go!"
"Guess the bar was set way too high from the great experience at Ruxbin Chicago, The Purple Pig didn't impress. The beets salad was good - the pistachio bites brought out the earthy flavors of the beets; but our braised pork shoulder was too salty and inedible (though well aclaimed by others). Chef Bannos need to go light on the salt! We weren't up to challenge the chef since the time constraint of going to catch the Grant Park Music Festival. For the love of cured meat, we got the Purple Pig Platter, which was a treat, yet the Sopressatta did not excel those of Faicco's (Brooklyn, NY) You should definitely get the Lomo, which is the part of the pork tenderloin that will find you a chewy texture but pack with flavors. The roasted bone marrow was fattening and got a garlic kick but not impressive. Rather, their wine list was finely chosen."
"If you're in Chicago, you've got to go to the Purple Pig!  I visited the place for dinner after a friend recommended it, based on the Yelp reviews... and the fact that it was right across the street from my hotel!  Since I was on a business trip, I came here solo and sat at the bar.  I sat beside a guy and the waitress assumed we were there together so we got to chatting anyway.  He had been there a couple times already and made some recommendations as to what to try.  By the end, he split some of his meal with me as well so that I could try some extra items off the menu.  People are SO friendly in Chi!  Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- YUMMY given that you like beets and goat cheese!  Great little appetizer to start with.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Mashed Potato - Tender milky pork that melts in your mouth with the creamy mashed potato.  Well seasoned, well cooked and delicious.Pig's Tail Braised in Balsamic - talk about eating every bit of the pig!  This one was tasty as well.  GREAT menu.  The service here is friendly and helpful, the location is lively and busy, and the food is like none other.  ""Cheese, swine and wine"" - How can you possibly go wrong?!  A MUST-TRY!  I will be back here if ever I'm in CHI again..."
"Rude horrible diners. As a NYer visiting, this place left a bad taste in my mouth. I wish i can choose to give it no stars. The food was over the top; the bone marrow that everyone spoke about was so fatty it almost made me hurl. And I am no stranger to bone marrow. And the diners were so rude and kept stealing seats. If you're going to do that, at least have some taste in food."
"Delicious, unique food. Expect a 1-2 hour wait, but you can buy a bottle of wine and sit outside until you get a table. We had the pig ears, the foie gras, cheese plate and pork secreto, all of which were fantastic. The plates are small, they recommend 2-3 items per person. It's worth the wait!"
"Drinks took forever! The four dishes we ordered arrived before our drinks did! Food was good. Peas with bacon was great. Buratta with peas, celery and radicchio was amazing!!! Whipped feta want my thing, the people I were with liked it but I didn't care for it. Coppa was good!Come early....a long wait time is bound to increase as the night goes on.service sucked."
Back again with a group of seven.  I love their outdoor tables on summer nights!
"The wait can get annoying - on any night of the week, expect to wait close to an hour. I have never been disappointed with the food. Earthy, fresh, rich and delicious!"
"Most go place, loved it!"
"I went here solo which is a great way to get seated without having to wait 45 mins to hours! The food was very good, the service was pleasant and friendly. It is kinda pricey though, very loud ans small."
"I was running a conference at The Fairmont Chicago and wanted to take my staff to a delicious restaurant.  My friends who had recently visited said that The Purple Pig was a must-go, so I tried making reservations for 10 of us.  Unfortunately, they didn't take reservations and told me that if I arrived between 5 and 7 pm, then we would be a-ok, but when we actually arrived at 6 pm, we encountered a HUGE crowd of people waiting outside.  The hostess said it would be about 2 hours before we got a table.  Um, no thanks.So, on Tuesday evening, when most of the staff flew back to NYC, four of us decided to try again.  We waited about an hour and a half, after being told it would be about 45 minutes, drinking some wine outside and watching the slow hostess try to figure out how to seat people.  We'd see some empty tables sit there for 15 minutes sometimes, even though there were clearly parties that could've been seated.  This is probably my one and only gripe about this restaurant.Other than that, the food is well worth the wait.  The savory food we ordered:- fried chorizo stuffed olives  (good but could do without it)- fried Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (basically like fried calamari but much less meat so it's like you're eating fried dough)- some shredded pork in tomato sauce spread that you ate with bread (apparently the chef's grandma's recipe, very tasty!)- Purple Pig Platter of cured meats (MMmmmmm, must get! And it comes with a cute piglet platter.)- pork blade steak with 'nduja and honey (like an awesome pork chop.  The honey lends a subtle sweetness that is very welcome.)- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (2)  (we ordered two because we shared one amongst us three gals, and the lone man ate one by himself.  It is melt-in-your-mouth good.  A fave!)We were stuffed, but we had to order dessert.  They ran out of the butterscotch pudding, so we got two others:- Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche} (this is amazing!  It's like a super soft, warm, gooey dough filled with a lava of warm ricotta and chocolate.  I am still salivating over this.  I WANT MORE!)- Panino con Nutella {A Sweet Sandwich filled with a Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Marshmallow Cream & Bananas} (you kind of can't go wront with any of these ingredients, but the Sicilian Iris really takes the cake.)- Olive Oil soft serve (like a seriously awesome vanilla soft serve. really refreshing and was great to eat with the Sicilian Iris)Sounds like an expensive meal, right?  It was actually less than you'd think.  Including a $45 bottle of white wine, but excluding the tip, the bill came out to $199.  Only $50 per person for all of that!  Go forth, my children, worship The Purple Pig...PS - you might need to be an Asian female + Caucasian male couple, though, to get in faster.  We saw no less than six such couples that night, two of which the females wore a weird, non-fashionable white cloth headband. WEIRD."
"Very, very tasty.We had the pork fried almonds, braised baby artichokes, pig's ear, and the eggplant caponata with goat cheese.  The winner was definitely the pig's ear.  Served with super crispy kale and a fried egg over easy in a pig bowl (yes, a pig shaped bowl), the crispy pig ear is definitely a must when dining here.The atmosphere is super fun, and the waiters very knowledgeable about the extensive wine menu.  Would love to go back!"
"The bone marrow is exactly as I remember from my childhood- completely lacking in flavor. The side dish of salt is provided because it has to be - marrow is boring. The jamon slices were fine but a bit of bread or a few crackers would have made it seem a better value. But it was the $10 draft beer  that made me decide to never return. I kept checking to see if I had been charged for two. Nope.  I was very amused by the two older couples next to me grousing about the long drive from the burbs. One of the men asked the server where the wine was from and was told ""just outside of Rome"". He said ""Rome? That's Italy, right?""  That sums this place up perfectly. I will say the decor is warm and my server was great. It's just not worth the money, and I spend money like a sailor on shore leave."
"Yum YUM YUM.Was visiting Chicago, and my dad and I had nothing to do for a couple hours around dinner, and this was referred to us by a friend. I gotta say, our waiter was super kind, but it could have been because we got there around 5, which was before dinner rush on a Friday. She was super knowledgeable, able to offer great suggestions, and we chatted for a bit. She suggested a few things which were super legit:-fried kale pieces, pig ear, and fried egg-cous cous with grilled fresh octopus-pork liver pate (super silky consistency)-bone marrow (deliciously broiled, nicely supplied w salt and onion & parsley for spreading on bread)-shaved brussel sprouts (wasn't expecting much, but was so surprised)I'm moving to chicago soon and I'll probably be a regular.**EDIT**I AM a regular! love this place. especially milk braised pork shoulder... it's to die for."
The first 5 star rating I give goes to Purple Pig.  Wow! Everything we had was excellent.  But the one that was over the top was the bone marrow. It was like bacon butter served on delicious bread.  But let's be real it could have been served on anything and it would have still tasted great.   Can't go wrong with this place.
"One word - FABULOUS. As they only take a limited number of reservations, my husband and I took our chances on a Saturday night. When we got there around 6:15 it was already packed. Originally they said it would be 20 minutes for a table, so we put our name down and grabbed the last two seats at the bar. Within 2 minutes of meeting the bartender, Lucas, we opted to stay put at the bar for dinner. Lucas is fabulous with great recommendations and made us feel right at home. Food: AmazingWe started with the Roasted Bone Marrow smear. Really rich. This wasn't my favorite of the night but still great. The toast that came with the smear was delicious as was the salad that came with. The marrow smear was good just a bit rich for me.From there came the best single dish I have had in a long time. Pig Ears with a Fried Egg. OH MY GOSH. At first I was hesitant obviously because when I think of pig ears I think of a dog's chew toy, but wow. SO glad I gave this a go. They taste like little salty pieces of bacon, and the egg is the perfect accompaniment. Although the best part of this dish was the crispy kale. I WISH I could have ordered a whole side order of the kale! Then we had the prosciutto bread balls which are almost like delicious prosciutto meat balls. These bread balls were served with a delicious tomato sauce. The sauce was great, I just wished they had given us a bit more!We were pleasantly surprised when the kitchen sent over a complimentary side of marinated eggplant. DELICIOUS!Lastly, we had the Chicken Thighs with fried potatoes and tzatziki sauce. Chicken was cooked perfectly, potatoes were delicious, tzatziki was the best I have ever had. Seems like a lot of food but the portions are perfect little plates, so you don't leave feeling overly full. This place is only a bit over a week old, and obviously has a few kinks to work out (they ran out of a bunch of wines and liquors, but were quick to make alternate suggestions which were equally fantastic). I certainly hope that The Purple Pig stays around for a very long time!! (Start taking reservations so I can be sure to get a table!!)"
"I really thought I would like this place better, honestly. The wait was long even early on a Tuesday night, but I guess with a small dining room that's to be expected. Everything was delicious and I honestly have no complaint with any of the actual food preparations or flavors. If I could make some suggestions they would be:- add 20% to the prices and give just a little more food with some dishes. The chorizo olives and prosciutto bread balls were great, but only 6 of the former and 5 of the latter is kind of a little weird for a table of 4.- make it clearer which items on the menu are suited to feed more people, like the pork shoulder blade stake, which was phenomenal, tender, and huge, well worth $14. The milk-braised pork shoulder was also lick-my-plate good but I could tell the whole table was disappointed that it was basically the size of a juice box. - make items more easily shareable. The jamon serrano with egg and mushrooms on one single toast was really a little inexcusably awkward. Two smaller toasts would have been way easier to eat. Overall I'd say it was a very delicious, but especially not knowing really what would be enough food I feel like this is only a good place if you're coming with one other person or on a date. I think it was fun to try, but I just frankly don't feel compelled to come back."
"Found this place in a chicago brochure, so I was skeptical. Went on yelp and found great reviews...were they ever right.  You walk in and the place is quaint, packed and alive. Patrons at lunch include anyone from businessmen, to college students, tourists and young professionals. Our waitress stealthily worked her way to us and guided us on our journey. We started with some cheeses, meat and the pork liver pate..yum. that pate was by far the best flavored pate that has ever hit my mouth. The consistency was smooth and it was served on buttery yummy toasted french bread (diet, what diet?). We then tried the pork ear, since it was their signature. I was actually surprised by how tasty it was and how the peppers almost tasted like pickles. We followed that with the clam/sausage concoction that had this amazing broth. There were about a million items on the menu that we wanted to try, but we proceeded to dessert which included a perfect light lemon panna cotta and an almost doughnut like large beignet filled with ricotta/chocolate filling. We took home italian wedding cookies too. Fabulous place and if we lived here, we would be there every week. Am trying to convince my husband to go back today for more pate. Purple pig-can you pack up and open up a place in dallas? Please, please, please?"
Food was mediocre and a 4oz glass of wine was $13. Service was hit or miss and the place was not kid-friendly. Dissapointing.
"If you like small plates and snout to tail cooking, this is a great place to go. Almost everything I tried was tasty, service was friendly, and prices were reasonable, especially considering the location. The highlight was the thinly sliced fried Pig's Ear mixed with pickled peppers and a fried egg. The only disappointing dish was the chorizo stuffed olives, which hardly tasted of chorizo at all.The only other issues I had were that my $11 draft beer was served in a glass that was still hot to the touch when I got it, and the waiter's recommendation of a dish that they didn't have. Despite those minor glitches, I enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to anybody who likes to try a number of things they haven't necessarily had before."
"Great spot for lunch. A bit hectic and crowded but the food does not disappoint.For apps, the salt roasted beets were very good. The raw corn and tomato was a pleasant surprise.For the regular dishes, the pig ear with crispy kale was excellent, a must try. The pigs tail and the JLT were both tasty dishes that should be considered too.The JLT could make for a fantastic hangover meal.Overall a tasty place to eat."
"Took the whole fam including an out of towner, ranging in ages from 18-63. Everyone thought it was DELICIOUS. The wait staff was awesome, loved the swine and wine (no cheese for us for some reason). My only criticisms are that if you are with a bunch of starving guys, not really the place to go. We ordered a ton of food, but all the guys still ended up going to eat again a couple hours later."
"I'm mostly writing this review to warn all you deviled-egg fanatics that their deep-fried deviled eggs are not available at lunch!  BUMMER.  But even without them, I had a great meal here.  The Purple Pig is surprisingly vegetarian-friendly for a place with swine in its tagline, and all of the vegetarian items are delicious.  Dessert was great too -- a deep fried ball of ricotta and chocolate deliciousness.  The one thing I could do without is the communal seating.  It was fine at first, but then a woman got seated next to me and the stench of her perfume almost ruined the end of my meal."
"I CANNOT wait to visit this hidden gem again!!!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the wine list.  I'm such a Cali red lover that I didn't want to spread my wings as much.  The white Bordeauxs were wonderful though!!  You have to try the roasted beet with goat cheese and pistachio appetizer!!  The best thing of our meal was the goat cheese with eggplant Smear!  AMAZING!!!!  The Sepia with fried rosemary was delicious as well!  If you love fried small bites, try the fried deviled egg!!  It actually sold out before we left!  Can't wait to return!!:)"
"This was a destination restaurant so that should say something to begin with.  I heard raving reviews and they were all correct. Tucked away from the busy streets of downtown Chicago, the PP provides a private atmosphere in a reasonably calm yet bustling hotspot.  I recommend ordering the Asparagus and Hazelnut salad - a perfect mix of crunch, sweetness and fresh vegetables.  I really enjoyed the Camembert Cheese (think of a brie crossed with a rich goat cheese) and DON""T MISS the Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - without a doubt the best dish I had.  Be warned, the Roasted Bone Marrow is difficult to eat.  I say this as someone who does not get grossed out easily and I had to work to dig the marrow from the bone and could only have one taste - it was too much for me.Go, eat and enjoy!"
"Lots of great food at the Purple Pig. Appetizers: the burrata with vegetables (burrata is a delicious soft-center mozzarella cheese).Smears: the pork liver pate, the pork rillette & mostarda. Dishes: the milk braised pork shoulder, the turkey leg confit. Desserts: I love dessert, but sadly these are a huge disappointment (I've tried almost all of them!). Drinks: terrible beer selection, really; plenty of wine choices though. But above all else, if they have the Porco Bucco, order it! It's delicious and very aromatic, it falls apart in your mouth, and there's quite a lot of it to share. They usually don't have it, so if that's the case, the Turkey Leg Confit is a close second."
"Perhaps it was the night or my date (the bf), but I had a really nice dinner here. I was last at The Pig during the late summer and ate outside. We ate at one of the communal tables and while it seems awkward at first, it was fine for the meal. Main advice: Stick to the food here. Beer is served small and expensive. Wine is served the same. I think I would have rather had more tasty food than the alcohol that took up a quarter of our bill. Loved the pate and the pork shoulder. Would definitely have again. All in all, a SOLID choice and a restaurant I'm looking forward to going back to."
"Consider this; Yelp does not have a rating system for food, atmosphere, and service. It is all combined into one.  This serves the purpose and should; to measure the overall experience, experienced at a particular establishment.This explains the Three Star rating I gave the Purple Pig. The wine, delicious.  The cheese followed suit. However I find it painful to pay triple+ the amount for a piece of cheese I can purcahse from Pastoral (one of my favorite places). I understand that restaurants have to make money, and there is a mark up. I know this.  However to justify a mark up, in return I expect good service and an appropriate atmosphere.Note the three star rating. Here are my issues. Waiter, I understand you work at a wine bar, and therefore you should be/ are very knowledgeable about wine and cheese, it is your business. I work in IT and I know about the products I sell. BUT... Never do I give am arrogant and pretentious impression to my customers. Am I wrong to rely on my server for advice on what wine and cheese to select? I do not expect to feel embarrassed, and uncomfortable for my lack of the wine and cheese selection at the Purple Pig. Please do not feel bothered by my questions. My other issue is the atmosphere. I like the lighting, décor is nice fits well. However noise level was too loud. I could not communicate with my girlfriend across the table without yelling. And I also did not care to listen to the guy next to me boast to his date, about his trip through Europe.I would recommend going here, but with a large group of people. Not an intimate setting (not implying that is how it is advertised)."
"Salt roasted beets and whipped goat and pistacios delicious and actually filling.  Get something light with that dish.  I also ordered the  Mortadella which was surprisingly good.  Was there for a packed lunch crowd during the week, looking forward to back in the evening to enjoy the good selections of wine and drafts.  As for the decor, when you walk in you get this feeling that you've left the US and landed in Europe somewhere."
"Great food, service and price point. Not big on small plates but these guys do it right"
This place is delicious!  Be patient as it will take a bit to get seated-it's worth it though! Yum!
"Good wine and great food with an interesting selection of unique food. I took my wife here for our anniversary and we loved it. The wait for a table was pretty long and they do not take reservations though. We enjoyed turkey shanks like the Romans, bone marrow, monk fish, and broccoli with anchovies that was amazing. The service was good and someone was always nearby to get you anything you may need. I'll be back and I recommend others try it as well."
"Loved it and fabulous wine list!  If you don't know about wine, don't just go for the Chardonnay.  Ask the server, they will be able to help steer you in the right direction of something awesome.With the hot summer Chicago is having, definitely try the calamari appetizer dish.  It is chilled calamari salad with (I think) couscous, radishes, cucumber, nuts.... I might be describing it a bit off, but it was cool, crisp, and so fresh tasting, I ordered a second one :) We also tried the roasted almonds, olives, broccoli, cobia wrapped in prosciutto, and eggplant schemer, all solid choices!  The only downside... people love this place so much that even early on a weeknight (6pm) it is packed and a wait is almost a given.  But hey, you can't hate on success!  Great job PP, can't wait to come back."
"This place is cool.  It's pretty much always crowded, though.  The wine selection is great.  I really like that they have some Greek wines, which is unusual.  We always sit at the bar.  It's silly to wait an hour or more for a table when you can sit much sooner and get the same food.  My only complaint is the preparation of the Monk fish.  I was so excited to see monk fish on the menu.  It's a flaky, buttery fish- some call it the poor man's lobster.  I was so disappointed to see they had fried it.  Who fries a fish like that in a fancy restaurant?  It ended up tasting like any old pan fried white fish, and slightly overcooked.  Such a sad disappointment.  Otherwise, this place is great."
"Loved it...very Euro, excellent wine list and fabulous list of small plates.  Great people watching as well...."
BEST WINE bar in the city! seriously!
"Perhaps I've become spoiled by the Bay Area ubiquity of farm-to-table, gastro-pubby small plates restaurants specializing in great wine and pig parts.  There's a lot to like about Purple Pig - we had the great fortune to snag an outside spot on a lovely warm summer evening, the menu has a number of innovative, interesting offerings, and the wine list is impressive.  But nothing really blew me away - if you've had the pleasure of grazing at the likes of A Cote in Oakland or Casaluella in NYC I think you'll think it's just fine, but nothing to write home about.If I had to sit inside, though, I'd skip it - unless I was with someone I absolutely didn't want to speak to (or hear from) - the noise is unbelivably deafening.  Probably more like 3.5 stars - nothing really wrong, it just didn't live up to the hype."
"Lots of inventive tapas, expertly prepared.  I appreciated that there was a good variety of vegetarian options, ( rather difficult in Illinois).  Wine recommendations were spot on, and I loved the casual, cosmopolitan atmosphere."
"Went here for lunch and it's one of those places where everything is cooked and prepared very creatively.  I had the chorizo stuffed olives, meatball slider, and milk braised pork shoulder.  Service was quick and friendly even though the place was very busy.  Servings are ""tapas style"" - perfect place to get in and out while getting high quality and well thought of food."
"Loved it loved it loved it. We were here for dinner. Even though we had to wait for around 2 hours to get in, it was worth the wait. The pig shoulders were delicious - meat was well cooked and the sauce that came along made it amazing. The pork chops were just heavenly. I had high expectations of the bone marrow after I read the review, but they fell short as the bone marrow turned out to be too oily, but my friends loved it. The service was great, they were prettu understanding of how we wanted to share all the entrees and so they brought the each entree only after we were done with the previous. The lady who served us always gave us tips on the best way to make the entrees taste better. We also had the blue cheese that was recommended and it was amazing. I'm definitely going back despite it being really loud in here."
"I brought in 2010 here, and it was fantastic! It's a Mediterranean family style restaurant. And by that I don't mean a Greek family cooks you dinner. Mediterranean means any country on the Mediterranean, it's actually more Spanish and Italian heavy dishes.   Every item we ordered was fantastic! Not a single complaint.We started off with the Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette, the Sepia with Toasted Almonds and Fried Rosemary & the Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda. I mention these three because they were among the best, and I was most sober while I ate these, so I remember them best...Other offerings worth mentioning are the Pig's Ear with Fried Egg and Calabrian Chilies (my absolute favorite of the night!), the Quail with Salsify and Pomegranate & the Octopus with Fregola and Swiss chard.The service was perfect and the owner was extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back."
Mussels and proscuitto-great.Calamari-great.Milk braised pork shoulder and mashed-unreal.Wylie the wine guy was great.  Try the Croation red.
"Wow - I was completely blown away by The Purple Pig.  We ate outside, with a lovely view of Chicago.  The servers here are fantastic - they actually seem grateful every time you order!  They brought out our orders promptly every time, and it's no big deal to order a few things, eat, then order some more.  You might not have the same server for every dish, but it doesn't really matter.  Of course, the food was what truly shined.The roasted beets (goat cheese! pistachios!) and morcilla were my favorites, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a dish that isn't full of delightful flavor combinations or elegantly presented.  The cheese comes with toasted bread and a tomato-grape jam that paired nicely.  I didn't really care for the fried prosciutto bread balls, but everything else was fantastic.You'll leave satisfied but not stuffed, which is the way eating should be, right?"
"I love this place. The food, the wine, the atmosphere. It's a great place. The wait can be long, but you can go shop at Nordstrom while you wait. The bone marrow and fried brussel sprouts were really good. They have a good beer selection to. I particularly like sitting at the bar because the guys will recommend food and wine pairings."
"Cheese, Swine & Wine - what more do you need to know? I was in town for work staying at the Intercontinental and wanted to find a place nearby to get a light dinner and glass of wine. I walked in as a party of 1 and only had to wait a few minutes as the hostess tried to determine which communal table to place me at. The bar was completely full but since they had several communal tables I only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The tables are a bit tight on space - they are high with as many chairs that will fit as possible. I'll assume she realized that I was not from here and wouldn't be able to handle the cold and sat me inside away from the door. ;p The wine list was fairly long with Italian and Spanish varietals which will pair perfectly with the tapas style dishes. There was a lot to select from and it was so hard to pick just a couple of dishes as there were many I wanted to try, but this would be a great place to come with a few others to share many dishes. I started with the Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette and then got the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and farm fresh egg. I was bummed they didn't have the butterscotch pudding but had their affogato which came with chocolate soft serve - different, almost like having a mocha. Overall my meal was very good, only complaint was that my grilled bread was a little over grilled so it was very hard to cut through the crust. Had great conversations with a few strangers at the communal table - funny that 2 were from California."
Awesome eclectic menu with a great choice of wine. Be prepared to wait for at least am hour.
"You can take my review for what it is worth because I didn't order dinner. I decided to follow up my ahi tuna that I had elsewhere with dessert and wine. The place was busy and had an energetic vibe. I pulled up a seat at the bar, slightly self conscious. The bartender was nice and was particularly good at suggesting food and wine pairings.I had read about the Sicilian Iris, which is a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips. I thought to myself, holy mackerel that must be amazing. However, I wasn't that impressed. It lacked moisture, almost as if there needed to be more filling or some sort of sauce with it. I would like to go back for a real meal though because the dishes that people were eating around me had me thinking- second dinner?"
"Excellent food, great wine list, awesome staff!Went here with a large group and went crazy on the menu for 3+ hours...incredible food (expect no less from anything with Tony Montuano's name on it), great wine list and a top notch server made it such a great night.  SUPER popular right now (Michelin Bib Gourmand winner) and lines out the door on most nights.  No reservations accepted but don't let it deter you, it's crowded for a good reason.(Try the Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes.  We kept ordering this, it was just incredible.)"
"Mark this down as my first experience with pig's ear. Or at least pig's ear that's no longer attached to the animal.While I can't say that I need to experience pig's ear again (it's a little too creepy crunchy), I hope it's not the last time I have a chance to eat at The Purple Pig.This is what many other tapas restaurants try to be: Cozy, lively, communal, with a great variety of well-priced food and drink. While there wasn't anything I didn't like, my favorites were:* Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette* Majorcan Sobrasada* Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki * Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip-filled Fried Brioche}"
"As I was wandering about Michigan waiting for my poor husband to finish up work on a Saturday I happened to see the giant arch proclaiming ""Purple Pig - Cheese, Swine, and Wine"". How could I resist? So later in the evening the two of us headed over there. It was cute, small and cozy. But being that it was pretty late at night (11pm ish?) it was not too crowded. We opted for a small table rather than communal table and immediately began perusing the menu. Just gotta say, we like our pork...We ordered the following:Braised pork  + mashed potatoes : so tender, melted in your mouth. absolutely delicious. All i've got to sayEndive salad : definitely interesting, like a more anchovy cesear salad with roasted endive. Not usually a huge fan of cooked salad greens or even endives in general, but this was pretty good. A bit bitter and acidic for me, but refreshing.Cheese platter: Goat cheese = delicious butteryness (sp?) that went perfectly with the bread. Very mild goat flavor. Blue cheese = nice salty, savory  taste without too much pungent flavor.  Went well with the qunice paste, which my husband had to move away from him to keep from inhaling the whole dish. Manchego = solid, good cheese, but not as impressive.Fried pig ears w/ egg and greens = crunchy chewy delicious. I'm not a stranger to pig ears, but have not had them fried. And now I wonder why I don't have it this way more often (other than the potential health impact). Dessert: I believe it was the Iris(?). It was a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate. soooooooooo yummy. We also had wine, a Syrah & a the sparkling spanish wine..both of which names have totally escaped me...but they were great accompaniments to the food & nice to have as a 1/3 bottle.Overall, definitely will be heading back that way."
"I'm about to serve up a little more ""whine"" than cheese on this review. The name of this place should be The PRICEY Purple Pig! I am a HUGE wine connoisseur and I was incredibly unimpressed with this place. I finally went on a late Sunday afternoon in early March on a date after wanting to go to this place since I moved here. When my date and I walked in, we were seated with a large group of people we didn't know which was a little awkward, but I thought ""Oh well, it's a wine bar...it should be fine."" Anyway, the waiter asked what we'd like to drink. I was in the mood for a red wine, and my date didn't have a preference, so we went for one of the more moderately priced wines. We were perplexed on what type of cheeses to get, so I asked the waiter for some suggestions on what to order that what compliment the wine. He gave us some suggestions, and naturally him being the expert, we took them. He brought us the plate and both my date and I did not like a single one of them!! It was obvious we didn't care for them because we pretty much left the entire cutting board of cheeses untouched. The waiter never asked any questions, or if everything was OK , nada! But he did ask if we wanted anything else? Well of course we do, we're still hungry!!! So, we chose the meats (ourselves this time!) and ordered a meat tray, olives and a few breads, They were OK, nothing to rave about,especially for the price. I'm not exaggerating, but there was hardly enough meat on the cutting board to make a small sandwich. By this time, we were both disgusted and unimpressed with everything, so we asked for the check and then left. I felt so bad for my date, and he felt awful too. Poor guy kept apologizing, when I chose the place! Thankfully, we went to and had a delicious meal, dessert and wine somewhere else for less than $85 dollars. I'm sorry, but I should never walk into a restaurant pay $105.00 tab and still be hungry...or tipsy for that matter. Tragic."
"The Purple Pig is fun. Be prepared to wait, an hour or so - and to shout. Its very loud. Its a nice room with lots of shared tables and an odd amalgam of decor. The outdoor are should be terrific when Spring arrives. Food? This is a ""small plates!"" restaurant, so there is a lot of ordering involved. And little dishes/bowls of bits and bites of this and that. I guess that the serving style kinda jives with the decor - a bit schizo but pleasant. We wound up having a mashup of appetizer sized bites: fried brussels sprouts, beets/goat cheese, milk braised pork, etc... and a turkey leg. The Pig related menu items - ears, tail, feet - just really didn't make a hit. Same for the bone marrow. One in our party noted that the place is almost entirely filled with women. There may be a connection between the small plates! and the desire from guys to want more than say...a tablespoon of fried brussels sprouts flakes from a little bowl passed around the table. Don't get me wrong here, the brussels sprouts flakes were terrific. Actually quite terrific. The beer selections are very good, the wine list extensive... but wine at $10 a glass comes in at the ""barely passable"" level and doesn't get to ""nice"" until $16. You can extrapolate those figures to bottle pricing. Overall, price/value is pretty even here. My party ate a fair amount, drank a fair amount, and paid around $60 per person. We enjoyed some interesting bites and overall had a great time. After drinks elsewhere following the meal, we all did eat again as everyone was still feeling a bit unfulfilled in the hunger department. So, as is the guideline with any place offering small plates! (exclamation included), realize that a large portion of the experience will be social. In this area, the Purple Pig does deliver strongly as an enjoyable spot to be with those you enjoy most... with the bonus of some interesting tastes to graze and make you happy. I will go again, hopefully to enjoy that great looking patio !"
"This place was absolutely delicious and I actually visited it 3 times in the span of 3 months, that's how much I loved it! The service has been great every time I've come and the food has been absolutely delicious!My favorites include: the pork braised milk shoulder, the eggplant caponata with goat cheese, the asparagus and hazelnut salad, and an amazing lamb dish! Oh and try to save room for dessert!! I've tried the sicilian iris (kinf of like french toast filled with ricotta and chocolate chips) and the Festa di Santa Lucia Crema (Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce). Both desserts were really good, though I prefer the farro & ricotta because it was just so unique and like nothing I've encountered anywhere else and it was almost... light?The thing to remember about this place is it's tapas, so order a couple of things and then order more as you go along! Most of the meat items are really rich and heavy (and delicious) but jsut keep that in mind so you don't over do it too much!Also, it's a very good location and thus gets full really fast! Either get there around 5/6pm for dinner so you don't have to wait or come for a late dinner at 9pm."
"I came across this place while strolling down Michigan Ave. with a friend. We were more curious than hungry when we walked into this place. Boy...were we in for a surprise! LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I always small plate portions because you can try a million different dishes at one time, so that's what got me in the door. The food, however, is what made me go back again! It's so fresh. The staff is friendly. You must make room for dessert, particularly the Iris. 2 drawbacks for me: no reservations and small space. The first time I went here was for a late lunch, and they sat us down right away. Dinner...forget about! 1.5 hour wait!!! Went to a movie and came back for late night dinner.Great tasting food, so would go back again again."
"Get: House-made Italian Wedding CookiesBread Pudding with Marsala & CitrusMussels with Pancetta, Crème Fraiche & MarjoramPass: Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade panini Prosciutto Bread BallsI personally like the ambiance of this place. It gets really loud too if its crowded, and its pretty much always crowded at night, so if you want a little bit of a quieter setting, brave the cold and eat outside in the tented area and sit near the heater :)The service here is really great - They didn't have any seats open when I called in, and they said they would call me back when one opened. My friends and I decided to walk around and go to a wine bar across the street and when our seat opened, they called us. I explained we were in the middle of a glass of wine and they told me they would hold our seats for up to 15 minutes, which I thought was great, considering how long the waiting list was. The servers were all very knowledgable about the wine they served and what would pair well with what you ordered, and they didn't try to push anything on us. I got the panini, and it was just okay, nothing special. Same goes for the bread balls. For both of those, they are perfectly okay, but I probably wouldn't get them again. I really liked the mussels and the wedding cookies and the bread pudding however. Great place, great atmosphere, and great service."
"I love this place.  Mostly the cool looking, knowledgable, and very sweet waitstaff!  The energy is great.  Plug in!  We went last Saturday and I'm one of those people who don't care if the process of dinner takes all night and enjoyed the people watching and talking during the hour + wait for our table.  It is bustling and crowded, so if you need ""your space"", you may get agitated.  But, if you love people, how they talk, who they are with, and how they style themselves, its great.  The food was interesting.  Thank goodness the waitstaff helped with cheese selections and wine (The most cherry flavored wine!) and we selected the main courses.  It also appeared (although I was not seated at one) to have community tables which is one thing I miss about some of the restaurants in Boulder, CO.  It's very loud because of all the close quarter talking, so being there with anyone who is soft spoken will be a strain.  So speak up and make sure to go with your more vocally gifted friends.  All in all, the food was great, staff wonderful and while not completely creative it was different and I had a great time!"
"We were visiting Chicago last weekend and came here for drinks. There was a big group of us (7) and we walked right on the patio and sat at a big table. To be fair, I'm not sure whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves but no one told us either way. The serving staff was extremely rude and SLOW, and I should also say that most of our party works in the restaurant business and therefore are very patient and understanding. If the staff was snotty because we sat ourselves then someone could (and should) have politely approached us and told us. We would have been more than happy to get up and wait. However, it seems to me they are just rude and stuck up. Would not recommend, or go to, this place again."
"The hubs and I ate hear last night and first and foremost, we lucked out with the BEST server. Our server, Gerson (or Jerson?) really made our experience here. We were seated right away, and we started discussing the menu with our server. We went off of his reccs and we weren't disappointed. I have to ask you now to stop being Judgy McJudgerson while I tell you what we ordered: We had: Olive oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans 6 The Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio                 Vinaigrette 5 Porchetta with Salsa Verde 9 Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki 9 And ended it with a fried ricotta and chocochip pastry that was delicious. When I look at this list now, it seems like there is a lot of food, but really, we took 1/2 the panini and 1/2 the chicken thigh home too. So there. I love small plates b/c I like to taste a lot of different things...and this is a place where the tastes are different. I was telling my Hubs that I enjoyed eating there b/c I had tastes that I either never had, or hadn't had in a really long time. Now, this is KEY to your enjoyment there. Get seated in Gerson's section. He is the best. Super friendly, really great at describing and recommending dishes, really attentive and just awesome."
"Okay, so the food is fine, but the use of salt and fat to create flavor is very noticeable. I didn't really want to eat much because it was just so overpowering. I had the pig ears, bone marrow, and pork shoulder. I guess it's worth the go. I was disappointed because my friends recommended it so much. I would suggest Avec over this place any day."
"This was a fantastic experience. A small plate restaurant, you can share and try many things without committing to an entire dish. I highly recommend the beets which come with goat cheese and pistachios,  pork shoulder braised in milk, and the house made sausage. Excellent service, and a real unrushed feeling while dinning. I'll be back for sure!"
"Great food!!! Another winner from the creatives behind Mia Francesca's(and other fine eaterys).  So great to come home to Chicago, and all it's great food.  Also went to the Davanti Enoteca this weekend.  Man - Chicago is the home of the food Gods.  New York doesn't have anything on us!note: hazelnut sunchoke salad is a masterpiece! among others."
"From start to finish, our first experience at the Purple Pig was wonderful. Despite its tourist-friendly location, this place was full of locals (ourselves included) who've heard about this new spot and managed to sidestep the throngs of visitors into this cozy space.Our Friday post-work brains were fried, so our server's suggestions were absolutely critical. He hit it out of the park with several recommendations, including a shaved brussels sprouts dish and slow-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The wine list is great and offers half-bottle pours that are perfect for sharing. Most of all, the atmosphere perfectly complements the upscale comfort food. While the place was buzzing, nothing about the experience seemed rushed at all. Great experience that I can't wait to repeat soon."
Great cheese board and house pinot grigio.
"If you live or work in the Loop, River North or Gold Coast, cancel your dinner plans and come here immediately. If you like tender pork loin with creamy mashed potatoes, come here immediately. If you like perfectly fried pork chopped up into delectable slivers, come here immediately. If you like perfectly seasoned grilled octopus, come here immediately. If you like affordable small plate dining to be shared with friends, come here immediately. If you like an extensive wine list with glass, half-bottle and full bottle options, come here immediately.If you like spacious, quiet dining rooms, don't come here. It's loud, cozy and intimate. It was pretty crowded on a Monday night, but I still totally loved it."
"I was in Chicago last week visiting a friend.  She brought me to the Purple Pig and it was so good we came back the very next night.  The menu has tons of interesting items, far too many to try in one night between 2 people.  Even after two nights of indulgence, there were still many items  left to try next time.  The best thing about this place is the design of the menu.  The portions are small and inexpensive (meant to be shared) so you can, and should, order 3 items per person (we got 4 so I could try more, haha) and get a taste of a lot of great food.  The wine list is extensive, over 50 selections available by the glass.  Thankfully the bartender and server we had on our 2 visits were both very helpful in navigating it and making suggestions.  We tried many dishes, but I'll briefly highlight the starsRoasted Beets With Goat Cheese and Pistachios: Awesome dish, light and extremely flavorfulPork Blade Steak: AMAZING, a great combination of flavorsBone Marrow: this was a first for me, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I love bone marrow!Octopus: Another fantastically put together dishHonestly not one bad thing to say about this place; food, service, drinks, and atmosphere were all amazing!  Its in a great location, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  I know I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago."
"We would give this place a 3.5 if we could. The ambience was great. We were there in October so the weather was not quite cold but it was cold enough that they had the outside burners going on. The service was a little slow but they were very busy while we were there. The food selection is very eclectic and honestly some items were not familiar to us. The staff however was friendly and willing to explain and answer any questions. The Butternut Squash Arancini & Sage Pesto was very yummy and even the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg was surprisingly tasty. Their wine selection is extensive but we went with beer as it was early in the afternoon. The server recommended the Panino con Nutella and oh she was right, you can never go wrong with Nutella. We definitely will give this place another try but with so many great places to eat in Chicago, it might be tough."
"Last night, while eating here, I had a revelation.  I like salami more than bacon.  GASP.This was a really delightful dining experience.  I want to give it four and a half stars.  I'm leaving that last star off for two reasons:  the chairs are INSANELY high.  And yes, they are bar tables/chairs, but I had nothing to rest my feet on (my short, short legs couldn't reach the rung).  We were outside and the breeze was nice...but also too much.  I was cold.The food though, all of it was delicious.  My favorite was not even my choice - the salami/goat cheese/olive tapenade panini was to die for.  My choice, the BLT with the fried egg was tasty but annoyingly hard to eat.  The rest of our choices were really solid.  Specific mentions:Prosciutto bread balls - I wanted to eat them all.  These stand out to me as the tastiest super small plate of the night.Deviled egg - it was fried!  And smooth.  Really great.Remember, this is small plates.  We were warned not to choose our own sandwiches, but we ignored and did it anyway and between the four of us we had enough to all share.  The reason he warned us is because we got two BLTs.  I think we made the right choice - if there are four of you and you all want a piece of the BLT, order two.  The paninis though - order one for four.  You get two sandwiches on a plate and they can easily be cut in half.Also, no reservations = long wait.  Bundle up if it's chilly as there is a lot of outdoor seating to actually wait."
"Yum, i am definitely a fan of this newly opened restaurant, the food was good and the service helpful and friendlydishes we had:1. ricotta cheese with pork neck gravy (deep pork flavor)2. pork's ear with fried egg (as good as everyone says)3. fried brussel sprouts with thyme (lemony crunchy goodness)4. baccala brandade (nice grainy texture and not too fishy at all)5. pig's tail in balsamic vinegar (too sweet and not porky enough)6. razor clams in parsley (i love these hard to find clams)7. chicken thighs with tzatziki sauce (juice and sauce is tangy)Desserts:1. butterscotch ""pudding"" (addictive)2. hazelnut icecream with brioche (nothing special, brioche way too dry)that plus 2 beers and a bottle of wine, we were happy and satisfiedwill be back :)"
We went a month ago and we found some nice rare things on the menu that me and my wife wanted to try. The porchetta panino was delicious and so the cheese samples. The salad was a little small for the price you pay.The service though was really good. I don't remember the server name but she was great! She was from arizona
"4.5 starsLe Cochon Violet!! NOM NOM NOM!I loved this place! I wish downtown had more restaurants/wine bars like this. The wine we had was really amazing, very very good! (and I'm often unimpressed by a lot of wines I order at restaurants.) Yes the Yelp community has declared that the milk braised pork shoulder is to die for! We ended up ordering another one after we tried the first one. Haha that's how delish it was. It was like so tender you could separate it with your fork!I also loved the bone marrow smear! Who knew bone marrow is so tasty? It comes in a bone which may be off-putting for some, but you spread it on bread with some salt and parsley(?). Savory buttery goodness my friend.Also we ordered the meat platter and another surprising find was the lengua (yes tongue).Try it!! All the cured meats were great with the wine.Other dishes I liked (but not like over the top love) were the beets with pistachios and goat cheese (and I'm not even much of a beet lover) and fried manchego. I also had the fried pig ears with kale which tasted like little crunchy salty snacks.Overall great selection of wines, innovative menu, and convenient location. They don't take reservations, so if you're going on the weekend... put your name down and go wander around or get a drink somewhere else and come back. Definitely crowded with communal seating."
"If you like cheese, try the board of 3 for $19. The beets and cream cheese antipasti was incredible. We also had the fried pig ears that were deliciously salty, greasy with a touch of jalapeños"
"Went there for lunch on Saturday after black Friday. We got seated right away.Atmosphere: cozy, some private tables as well as communal seatingsButternut squash: tasty. I love it.Grilled octopus: too much of lemon juice Scallop: good but could be better. I like the chick pea that came with.Braised pork shoulder: yummy but salty for my tasteSoft serve ice-cream with espresso: really like it!"
"A little disappointed. Ambitious menu that didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The same vinegar base seemed to run through many of the dishes and while it was tasty it ultimately lacked imagination. We sampled about 11 dishes and none of them sucked but none had any 'wow' presence. The pork liver pate was texturally perfect but a bit heavy handed. The prosciutto bread balls were uneventful and the marinara with it was bland and sweet. The biggest disappointment was the bone marrow. The bread they served it with was delicious but the butter and garlic completely overpowered the marrow which, on it's own never seemed to have absorbed any of the herbs as promised on the menu. And so it went... It really felt like a Publican knock off without Kahan's talent to give it any soul. Service was minimal - brusque and inattentive. We waited a long time trying to order courses and our server offered us nothing in the way of either recommendations or personality. Music was okay but the low fi sound system just made it annoying at the volume they set. I wouldn't refuse to go back - I'd like to try the pork shoulder - but it certainly wouldn't be high on my list."
The spreads are so good. Must try the pork shoulder! Amazing wines too!
"Trendy and always crowded, Purple Pig is worth the wait. This is the place to go if you want to try creative ways of eating pork!  At the Purple Pig they offer delicious dishes from parts you'd never imagine eating! Our favorite is the Roasted Marrow served on thick slices of toast with fresh parsley and capers. The Pigs Ear served with the fried egg which is delicious.  Because of the tourist friendly location, this is the best place to watch people!  Order a glass of wine, sit on the bench and watch the world wait for a table."
"This place is a gem.  Every time we have been here the service has been wonderful.  Ask your server for recommendations; they will not steer you wrong!!!  A little pricy, but absolutely worth it!  Our favorites are the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, and you just have to try the Espresso over Toasted Cinnamon Soft Serve and Limoncello Creme for dessert!!!!"
Great.  Had the prociutto (spelling) balls and a smear.....great on both and also the blade steak.....It was like three different cuts on the same piece of meat......The fat on pork is great because it melts in your mouth......veggies actually have choices here as well and the service and arrangement is great....try it out
"Had to stop by and try it because of all the great Yelp reviews and the menu.  I tried the most popular dish - the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  It was cooked perfectly but a bit too salty. Service was good despite being super packed.  If you like red ale, try the Gavroche beer on tap.  It's my new favorite."
"First try for Purple Pig was a Saturday night before a movie, stupid idea.  Wait was way too long so we came back on a Tuesday night at 6pm, much better.  It was comfortably crowded but we got right in (as soon as our whole group was there).Between the three of us, we split six dishes.  I was definitely the most adventurous eater of the three and would have gone a little crazier than we did if it was all up to me but I wasn't paying so I had to compromise.  I was specifically told, ""I'm not eating pig's ears AND bone marrow!""  This is what we got: - Truffle Tremor Cheese: a small wedge and two pieces of crostini... hard to split between three people, I'd pass on this one - Whipped Feta with Cucumbers: a generous portion served with eight wedges of agressively toasted bread.  This was really delicious but maybe not something you couldn't make at home? - Roasted Butternut Squash with Pumpkin Seeds: Wow was this good.  One of the favorites among the table.  I think it might be a special for fall though. - Pig's Ears with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg: I saw so many good reviews on this and I had to work hard to convince the table to order it and then it was just meh.  The pig's ears were julienned very thin and battered and fried so there was no pork taste to them at all, just like fried sticks.  It wasn't bad tasting but it wasn't mind blowing. - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: My favorite dish of the night, served with mashed potatoes.  You should order one per person so you don't fight over it. - Fried Deviled Eggs: Just how it sounds.  I liked deviled eggs and I like fried things so I liked it.  Pretty inventive and cooked well.For dessert, we got Sicilian Iris: basically a doughnut filled with cannoli filling.  Very good and pretty large size, we split it three ways and it was the perfect sweet bite.Overall, the service was great, our server was really knowledgeable and friendly and had great suggestions (basically everything we got was her suggestion).If I was to go back, I'd skip the cheese and the pig's ears and I'd get the bone marrow and maybe something not heavy and fried, perhaps a vegetable?  Like the baby artichokes?  Either way, I'm glad I tried it and I'd definitely go back to try some other dishes but it wasn't as mindblowing as some other very similar-type restaurants were."
"I went here last week with a few friends, hearing that it was on Bon Appetite's Best New Restaurants list. The sign, ""Cheese, swine and wine"", three of my favorite things, got me quite excited. Initially shocked by the peculiar seating arrangement, I adapted and actually had a few great conversations with new people.A ""girl and the goat"" type, where a group orders several dishes, many of which are not your ""mainstream meats"", I was anxious to eat. We ordered  six dishes between the three of us. The highlight, surprisingly, must have to be fried pig ear. With fried meats like pig ear, I was worried about maybe being overcooked, or possibly too chewy. I couldn't be more wrong, And the combination of pig ear with the peppers and kale was delightful. The second best dish had to be the JLT, with jowl (pork cheek) replacing bacon. The sandwich, although small when divided amongst three people, was delicious (then again, I am a sucker for fried egg).Why not five stars? First, the cheese plate was good, not great. And the other dishes, the corn and tomatoes and prosciutto bread balls were good, but left me thinking that they could have done a little more with those dishes.A great spot for a unique dining experience on the mag mile, especially fun for groups!"
"Unbelievable.  One dish better than the last.  If you can, go."
"Absolutely fantastic is you are a foodie! Community table is great for single diner, small plates, very reasonable priced"
"This place was alright. I went during lunch time by myself and sat at the bar. I kind of got the feeling of being ignored. I waited a while to order and when i finished my drink it was a good 15 minutes until i  was able to get the bartenders attention to order another one. I went to try the bone marrow and they didn't  even have it on their lunch menu. The food I did get was good but really expensive for what it was... glorified fried cheese balls, and a meat and cheese board."
"We checked this place out randomly one evening in Chicago. I'd say I'll be returning for sure. We order 6 different swine dishes, and none were a disappointment. We got brave and attempted the marrow, to say it was interesting is an understatement. It was an adventure for the palette. Huge wine list, and modestly priced. Great cheese list, oh and the swine is amazing as well.Sharing is the motto here at The Purple PIg, so enjoy! What a time you'll have. Will visit again!"
"In the words of one of my dining mates, ""their motto includes swine, we HAVE to order pig!""  There are several reasons why I was impressed with this place; here are a few:-variety and quality of food - the milk braised pork shoulder was akin to the texture of melt in your mouth pot roast atop salty, buttery mashed potatoes, the chicken kabobs in tzaziki were topped off by the BEST fried potato slivers, and the beets with pistachio and goat cheese were rich, flavorful, and fresh tasting.  -location, central to downtown and perfect for a chill dinner spot with clients/colleagues-wine recommendations - the server we had gave great recommendations on wine that did not include the most $$$ bottles available.  ours was from italy, $38/bottle called labrandi - fruity, smooth, and went down easy-the small plate, communal seating style - promoted an incredibly social, casual, fun vibetotally surprised that this restaurant was not in a neighborhood like wicker park; it felt totally homey in the middle of the very corporate loop."
"Absolutely fantastic. Great tapas, wine list, and unusual tastes! Be warned that most seating is shared tables in case you do not like that. We had fun meeting a lot of from all over the City and Country, lots of fun."
"You are guaranteed to make a pig of yourself (pun entirely intended).  All prior warnings of wait are warranted.  It is well worth it.  Even when our names had been put in for a 12:30 p.m. seating on Saturday--a day that is guaranteed to pull in every tourist in town--we did not take our seats at the communal table until 1:15 p.m.  Right when you are ready take your leave, don't pull the trigger.  If it is your first time, it will not be your last; give it a chance.  There were 7 of us, all looking for a mid-afternoon bite of small plates,, but all present foodies had big appetites and were ready to sample the resident delicacies.  We tried the roasted bone marrow; the purple pig platter (assorted charcuterie, grilled bread); four cheeses; salt roasted beets with goat cheese; braised baby artichokes; prosciutto bread balls; pig's ear; pork liver pate; pig's tails; milk braised pork shoulder; chicken thigh kebabs.We were not leaving one of the top 10 restaurants in the country without having a hoof to mouth experience, literally.  We covered nearly every part that makes up a portion of the namesake.  It was hog heaven.  Even the cocktails were sips of the sow: Pig's Nose Scotch.  The aroma was something only the most refined lover of swine could appreciate.  From first sample to the last, our palettes enjoyed every morsel.  So rich and delicious was every selection that you felt ashamed for indulging in them.  I am normally a healthy diner, eating more along the lines of raw produce as opposed to fried pig's ears.  Please forgive me, but Purple Pig is such a decadent treat for all that they may even convert the most strict vegans.  Slip a bit of marrow on a grilled baguette slice, and you may think you are enjoying the sweetest honey.  I was like a bee to it.  Sweet breads, indeed.The food is not the only important talking point here.  The service is spot on.  Right when you swallow your last sip, one of the four individuals floating the floor will be there to refill your water, ask if you want another beverage, or kindly remove the glass if you are finished.  They are there to remove any empties when the plates are licked clean.  I guarantee they will be--either by you OR your neighbor."
"My mom and I went to Chicago for the weekend and I was told by several chefs that I had to go to Purple Pig.  She isn't a huge foodie, but I persuaded her to give it a try.  We started with the Pork Fried Almonds with roasted garlic.  I am never one to order mixed nuts on a menu, but I must say these were phenomenal!  We also finished dinner with the Sicilian Iris.  This wasn't on their normal menu... I had seen it on their website.  This was a brioche dough filled with chocolate and ricotta, deep fried and topped with powdered sugar (enough said!).  These were so delicious that we went back the next day and bought two to take back to Indy.  Even if you are not into crispy pig ears or fried pig tail, this place is sure to please!"
"Ending my last night in Chicago at The Purple Pig was such an awesome idea! It's exactly the kind of gem you'd tell friends and family about when you return from a stay in Chicago... which makes me wonder why I forgot to leave a review for the place (though I found time to leave a 2-star review for Blackbird - ha).I honestly can't remember much about the night except that I loved the whole experience of it. Sitting with friends at a long table with others, laughing over wine, and ""pigging off"" of each piggy dish that arrived (I loved the pig-themed dinnerware) - all translating into a great meal.I will tell you though that the olive oil ice cream and the dining experience itself are not to be missed."
Great location- always tasty!
"The Purple Pig is, in no small measure, one of my favorite places on Earth.The cooking is right in my wheelhouse - approachable, yet by no means pedestrian, and full of flavor.  The atmosphere is boisterous and lively, especially if you sit at the ""chef's bar"" right next to the pass.Can't wait to visit the fair Windy City again.  Be worth the 3-hour flight just to have another go at their 'smears' menu.....!"
"Great place for fantastic food and drinks.My only real complaint is the fact that it's busy, there are no reservations, and there's absolutely no place to wait inside.  We also ended up next to some loud and pretty rude people, but that's not the restaurant's fault. The food was great. We had the arancini which was filled with ricotta and spring peas. Very good. We also had the whipped feta which was yummy, but a little too salty for my taste. The pig's ear stole the show. It was crispy and so delicious. I wanted to order another. We also let our server choose a cheese plate for us, and she did a very nice job leading us from the mildest to the funkiest cheeses. For dessert, we shared the nutella, banana and marshmallow panini (Wowza!) and the butterscotch pudding (underwhelming). Overall, the drinks and the food were good, and the atmosphere is lively and fun. I'll probably stick to weeknights for visits because of the crowds. Very fun place to bring your friends who love meat and cheese and wine."
"BreakdownFood: 3 starsWe had many things. The Rock Shrimp with pea medley, The Prosciutto Bread Balls, The Grilled Cheese, The Porchetta Panini with salsa verde, a cheese plate, the Milk-Braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, the Lamb leg chop with fava bean salad., the Mortadella, Balsamico and Pistachio Smear, for dessert the Gianduja Soft-serve served on a brioche, and the Iris.The GREAT: Prosciutto Bread Balls, Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder, The Smear.The GOOD: Gianduja Soft Serve, Iris, Lamb, Grilled Cheese, Porchetta, cheese.The BAD: Rock Shrimp.Decor: 2 starsService: -1 star."
"Although the weather was not very cooperative during our visit, the food and the service definitely compensated for it. At first, I  was kind of thrown off when we had to wait outside for about an hour because they don't take reservations. It was also kinda lame that they had more outdoor seating than indoor since Chicago doesn't really have the best weather. The food, however, was flawless. We ordered the fried pig ears with the crispy kale and egg, the roasted bone marrow, roasted corn, the roasted pork blade steak with 'Nduja and honey and for dessert we had the fried brioche with ricotta cheese and chocolate inside. For all of that, I thought we were going to rack up maybe a little around 100 bucks, but nope. When the check came, it came up to about 75 bucks and that's with two glasses of beer too. So to sum it up, not only it has great food and service, it's also not that expensive. And as an added bonus, it is a fun place to go people watching as well."
"Had people visiting. We had 40 min wait but the bar was great in meantime. There are many interesting items on menu. It is designed as small plates, so We ordered several items and shared them. Our server was outstanding! She answered questions and offered ideas. We mentioned we loved Brie so, although not on the menu for the cheese plate, she knew the chef had in back so brought it for us on our cheese plate.  Definitely the best server I have encountered in Chicago since moving here almost a year ago. I work at luxury hotel on the northshore and have been spreading the word about my experience and the excellent service. iWould definitely go back."
"Yelpers, thank you thank you for your recommendations.Purple Pig, thank you for being you.I did my research here before taking my family to lunch at The Purple Pig, so I knew just what to order for our table from the rave recommendations. I might be more adventurous to try other things next time, but for my first trip to The Purple Pig, we got:-Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette-Butternut Squash with Pumpkin Seeds, Brown Butter & Ricotta Salata  -Prosciutto Bread Balls-Whipped Feta with Cucumbers smear-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder -Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki(ALL of these were EXCELLENT)Without wanting to be redundant after all the other reviews, please know this list of options are a slam dunk (imo), and the only thing I would ask is that there be more bread along with the smear (they'll give it if you ask) and that the bread is not charred on the edges. The Chicken and the Pork Shoulder were my favorites of these items.We went on a Saturday at noon. There were four of us and there was no wait. After the items I mentioned above, we ordered two desserts:-The Iris (donut with ricotta cheese and chocolate inside)-Olive oil ice cream in a briocheThe ice cream was too much like vanilla on french bread. The Iris on the other hand was To Die For!! We should have just gotten two of those.Please note that it was just us four girls, and that you may want to order more food for four hungry guys. Please also note that I wanted to be accommodating for everyone's tastes, so I did not go for any of the dishes that were more unusual (though I kept threatening my sister that I was going to order bone marrow and pig ears). Maybe next time.Everyone enjoyed the style of plate-sharing (which is what we do anyway). The service was excellent. And with the four of us only drinking water, no wine, our bill was only $57. Awesome. My family was very impressed with every aspect of this lunch. Success!!"
"You almost have to know PP is there to go there, with its Harry Potter station 9 3/4 -esque entrance right off of Michigan. We walked back and forth past it a few times, baffled, before we looked up and saw the sign above proclaiming, ""You are idiots,"" aka ""The Purple Pig."" The actual restaurant is recessed quite a way in from the street, and upon entering, took a seat at the bar with a puzzlingly mute bartender. He nodded, shrugged, thumbed-up, but never once spoke a single word. Not that he needed to exactly, the food really spoke for itself. We started off with the salt roasted beets - I am a beet fanatic and absolutely fell in love with this dish, while my bf could cared less for the taste, which he just described as ""purple."" Crunchy, nutty, creamy, and slightly acidic all at the same time, to me it was heavenly with every bite. The proscuitto bread balls were interesting, more kale (I think) than proscuitto or bread, but good none the less. To top it off, I loooooove me a good marrow, and PP's ""spread"" did not disappoint with its garlic and buttered toast points, sea salt, and parsley. However, the best dish of the lot was definitely the milk-braised pork shoulder. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and I would have licked the plate to get every last touch of the mashed potatoes off if our mute batertender wouldn't have silently judged.We would have given PP 5-stars if it wasn't for the fact that we were STILL hungry after dropping over $60 on the 4 dishes and two glasses of wine, and the fact that getting to this place means that you will inevitably have to battle through the swarms of tourists on Michigan Ave. Location and value aside, however, there's no denial PP knows how to cook up some good eats!"
"Monday evening around 6:30pm.  About 20 minute wait for 2 people, which isn't too bad compared to the other stories I've heard.  Overall a really great dinner.  The restaurant is really unique, easily missed on Michigan Avenue, but a great find when you know what to look for.  It's a great combination of sophistication and unique-tasting dishes.  It reminds me of tapas.  The best dishes: wagyu sirloin and pig platterThe pig platter (a little bit of every cured meat) was absolutely amazing.  I didn't have any idea what most of them were by looking at the menu, so we ordered all of it and were able to try it all.  I couldn't get enough of the flavor of all of them.  It was perfect.The pork shoulder is as amazing as everyone else said.  The presentation wasn't as great as the other dishes, but it was the memories of the holidays.  The mashed potatoes that came with it was quite amazing.The wagyu sirloin was the perfect amount of crispy flavor on the outside and juiciness and red meat on the inside.  The potatoes were also very flavorful.  This was the second time eating wagyu beef, and I'm definitely a fan!The pig ears was good, but not exceptional.  Growing up eating Chinese-style cooked pig ears, I was expecting something very different.  Too much salt, but definitely interesting combination.  The kale and egg in this dish were well cooked.The calamari was really good.  I loved the combination of calamari and vegetables.  It was quite refreshing.The prosciutto bread balls was nothing particularly impressive.  I couldn't really taste the prosciutto, so it kind of ruined the expectation for me."
"I recently came to The Purple Pig with Carlos, who is a big lover of Pork. It was a cold Saturday night, but it was worth it. It was around 6:35pm when we got there (FYI: Call to make reservations), it was extremely packed and it was an hour wait. Luckily for us the waitress gave us  seats because it was only two of us (BTW the seating there is a family style sitting, which means you get to sit next to strangers). So we started off with a smear which was Bone Marrow braised in Rosemary...OMG! It was amazing that was $6. After that we got the famous Pork ear and Fried egg, which was also good and that was $8. We also had Jamon Serrano braised in duck sauce and it was delish that was $8. Finally we had dessert, which was awesome. We had the sillican Irish and it was great, that was $6. Our total bill was $32. 90 and it was worth each penny. I will definitely go there again. I enjoy everything I had and want to try more of there smears. I really recommend this place if you enjoy and love pork. YUMMY, YUMMY!"
"If you love pig and cheese, this place is pretty much as good as it gets. I couldn't believe how many different dishes involving every part of the pig were offered that didn't involve sausage (which I also love, but this is not a sausage type of place). I had the fried pig's ear with crispy kale, truffle tremor cheese, milk-braised pork shoulder, and tripe parmigiana. The ear and cheese were my favorites, but I'd have all four dishes again. There were some pretty good-sounding non-pig dishes, like a tuna appetizer, but, being unsure when I'd have the chance to return, how could I not roll with maximum pig?The only negative was the self-consciously hip atmosphere, created mostly by the patrons, but it's something to be aware of because you'll stick out in a bad way if you don't dress up at least a little bit to come here."
"Returned for another visit to my favorite pig yesterday.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Our server had fabulous recommendations (side note - I forgot her name.  I have a bad habit of asking people's names without any intention of paying attention to what they say.  Alas, this is what happened here) and guided us through a flawless meal.   The pork fried almonds were delicious, the taramousalata spread was much better than I was expecting - in fact it was downright amazing (I'm not a huge fan of it at most Greek restaurants but our server's glowing recommendation won me over), the octopus was smokey and tender, and the chicken thigh kabob - let me just say, I love it when a chicken dish blows me away because so often, there's something wrong with it.  The chicken was juicy and moist, the skin was perfectly crispy and the tzatzki sauce was a perfect match to complement the chicken.  I went for Sicilian Iris part deux and this time got one that was chock full of chocolate.  It was everything I was expecting and wanting it to be the first time around.  If this place didn't have a crazy wait 24/7, I'd be here daily.  It's well worth that wait though."
Place in my mind is not worth the money.  Food was hit or miss- half of what we had was really good half was not.  plus you are paying a lot of money in my mind that means everything should be spot on.  it was not. great service and good location but i will not repeat as the food was not good enough.
"I gave Purple Pig another chance and this time our experience was wonderful and that's all because of the person serving us.  She was friendly and gave us good recommendations.  I was comtemplating on the drinks and she did, what the best servers do, she bought both of them to taste so that I can order the one I like.  Food was delicious.I am meeting up with friends today at PP.  Will post the latest, if food and service are not consistent this time around!"
Our waitress was not great. She recommended all the fried food and the cheese fry we ordered was too greasy and tasted like they were using old oil to deep fry. Pork shoulder was good but nothing special. The menu didn't have much vegetables. We were surprised by our bill. Our waitress recommended $18 and $24 wines for a glass!
"O' Purple Pig how I wanted to Love thee.. but it was not meant to be.While out walking I stumbled across this place and made a mental note to revisit it for Dinner, after all it had 2 of my favorite things in their tag line... cheese, swine and wine (that being cheese and swine, I likes me some burr over wine).  When I looked them up online and saw they had bone marrow it sealed the deal (beef right? oh well).So after a great workout in the hotel gym I headed the few blocks to The Purple Pig around 9-10ish.  I was seated immediately as the place was buzzing but not packed.  I sat at the ""bar"" area.  The set up with the communal style dining is great.  Yes I got to hear some awesome lines to use in the future as the pimp next to me got his mack on but overall it made for a good dining experience.  The service I received was very lack luster.  The waitress was somewhat nice but really did not go out of her way to wait on me.  I had a good view of the kitchen which was fun and talked with the Chef a couple times and he was beyond nice.  When I placed by Burr order, either my non-existent Texan accent through my waitress for a loop or perhaps the subtle gaze into my ridiculously over handsome eyes stunned her as she brought me over a bottle of wine.  I have spent easily a good chunk of my my life in Europe (mostly in Germany)  but perhaps it has been to long.. I ordered the Brau Herren (beer on tap) and she brought me a bottle of Heron wine.. which is kind of funny but kind of ridiculous when she knew that I was looking for beer because I asked her what was on tap and for the beer menu... oh well chalk another one up to the downsides of blue steel.I started with the Roasted Bone Marrow.  Automatic kudos for having it on the menu as this is a hard dish to come by.  It appears that they may pre-butter the bread or something as the bread they serve with it is greasy which kind of guilds the Lilly when you are putting bone marrow on top of it.  Overall it was decent but not the best I have had.  Also they give you these little forks for you to smear it with.  In the past I have had it with little butter knifes.  When I attempted to use the butter knife (full size) that they gave me with my setting the waitress chastised me and said it would be easier with the mini-fork.. umm no.. liquid jelly runs through the tines of forks.. again damn you blue steel for being so remarkably attractive.Next I had the sardines with lemon vinaigrette.  The sardines were lightly fried however I tasted little to no acid in the dish which would have been nice.To finish up I had a selection of cheeses.  These were pretty good and probably the best part of my meal however they were out of manchego so that was a bummer.I may give it a second try as I like the format and so really wanted to like this place but the spark was not there.  but fret not Purple Pig.. it is not you.. it is me."
"Kind of a smaller place, very nice inside-Clean/Modern/Communal Tables. Very diverse menu options as well as Liquor/Wine list.. Literally not one thing from the US on Wine/Beer list. Draft beers consisted of some German and Italian choices- some pretty obscure choices- tried a few and they were very good. As far as the food, Had a really fresh great salad that was dressed with Cabernet Mint Vinaigrette--It was Great! Also really liked the ""Shaved Asparagus App"".. kind of a place where you really have to give it some time because there are lots of options and everything is served ""Tapas"" style.."
"Being a popular place, I am surprised we got seated within 30 minutes on a Friday night. Although a bit cramped, I kind of like the community table atmosphere which allows for some interesting ""single serving friends"" Food is pricy, but amazing. wonderful flavor combinations I would have never thought of!The wine list might be the most extensive I have seen in Chicago, and it is all imported to boot.While I don't think I will be a regular, it is definitely worth a visit now and then."
"Great little spot tucked away off the main drag on Michigan St. We managed to get a table for two outside on a nice Saturday evening. The chairs were especially comfortable (padded), not the cheapo poolside plastic specials you get at some alfresco spots in town. We enjoyed the pig's ears, especially with the kale. We also had the Greek sausages, bone marrow and tuna & beans. Some commenters have said the food is a bit oily and salty, and yeah, you'll have that with fried pig parts. But not all items were that way (not that I minded), just stay away from the fried section."
"I've been oinking about The Pig to anyone who would care to listen. It has become my go-to recommended place to anyone I know. I don't even care if they have any history of heart ailments. I just say go to Purple Pig. At least you die happy. Why wouldn't you be? Anything with this much pork fat just spells T-A-S-T-Y. Their pig's ears with crispy kale is tantamount to gastronomic orgasm. Add the bone marrow pate and I'm in arterial clogging heaven. And screw all the  ""That's so unhealthy!"" remarks said in aghast. That's what red wine is for. If a glass is good for the heart, imagine what a decanter would do!I would have given The Pig five OINKS if it were not for the wait time. I count it by the wine glass and I would average four glasses before getting seated. More so during weekend dinners."
"I wish I could give three and a half stars, but three will have to do.Had dinner with friends at Purple Pig on a Tuesday night.  Purple Pig is essentially a victim of its own success, because most of my ""cons"" have to do with the fact that so many people want to eat there.  Pros:--good food, with decent prices.  I particularly recommend the whipped feta smear, the salt-roasted beets with goat cheese, the milk braised pork shoulder, any of the cheeses, and the silician iris for dessert (ricotta and chocolate chips inside a  fried brioche: heaven!).  Nice to have something different on Michigan Ave.---nice looking space, with a lively atmosphere.  Bonus points for the particularly good, and varied, background music.---unlike other reviewers, we had excellent service.  Our waitress was fun (wish I'd gotten her name), busboys attentive, etc. Cons:---the space is very small, which leads to a very crowded evening.  Our group of 4 sat at a communal table, with parties on either side of us.  I don't mind sitting at a communal table, but there were too many people squeezed in.---the WAIT!  We waited for an hour and a quarter on a Tuesday night (arrived at 7, seated at 8:15).  We might not have even stayed to wait that long except one of the group is moving out of town and really wanted to try it.  They don't take reservations, and won't seat your party until everyone is there.  I understand the policy of not seating until the whole party has arrived, but I don't have to like it.  The space is so small there is essentially no place to wait inside:  I don't know what they are going to do in the winter, when it will be impossible to wait outside.  Overall, if they took (and honored) reservations, this would be a four star review, hands down (maybe even a five).  But the crowded room and the very long wait downgrade it to three and a half starts.  Don't let it stop you from going, but I wouldn't even consider going on a Thursday through Sunday.  A fun experience, with very good food, and perhaps a place to take out of towners.  Just be prepared to wait, and then be squeezed in."
"Have a plan to kill some time, because a two hour wait is not uncommon.  They will call and give you 10 min, if you want a drink somewhere else.  Pigs ears, pig tails both very good.  The neck bone gravy was just okay, tasted like meaty pasta sauce.  Charcuterie plate was very good and deserts were surprisingly tasty.  Worth the wait."
"I'm not quite sure how to describe this place. It's like little pieces of awesome deep fried in delicious with spicy bits of outrageous tastyness (that means it's good).It was described as ""Soul Food"", but only if that soul food went to school at Le Cordon Blue and spent a wicked summer in Italy getting wasted on wine and eating late night cheese sandwiches with it's junky room mate (that means it's eclectic).The servers are fun and laid back like Jack Tripper meets Mr. Belvedere (that means they are cool).You'll like it (that means you'll like it). Actually you'll love it (that means I was wrong last time. It means you'll love it...unless I'm wrong this time).(stop reading parentheticals and go to The Purple Pig. It's delicious)"
My go-to tapas spot. Always crowded but always worth the wait.
The Mexican bartender wore a rainbow colored Coogi hoodie all night. Get a dress code for what we pay to eat and drink here my God.
"Went with 2 friends on a Sunday night - were told 1 hour 15 min wait, which was happily shortened to 35 minutes.  We ordered the butternut squash, artichokes with potatoes, 2 salads, cheese plate, and prossiuto, plus the cauliflower.  We loved all, the flavors were great!  Tiny, tiny dishes though.  The squash, artichokes and cauliflower were probably 1 1/4 cups each.  I know its tapas, but teensy!  I could have eaten more I think!  With 5-6 plates on the little table at a time, plus wine and water, it still gets crowded.  For dessert - the panini with nutella, marshmallow, and bananas!  And the brioche filled with ricotta and choc chips.  Loved both.  I would go back!"
"The portions are fairly size, but the food is so good, my brother and I kept ordering and finally ended the night after:*Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic*Lardo Crostini*Sardines with Lemon Jam*Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg *Purple Pig Platter (all cured meats)*Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda*Pork Liver Paté*Octopus with acini di pepe & Swiss Chard (don't order)*Charred Scallions with Romesco Sauce*Prawns a la Plancha *Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic*Skatewing with Beets & Guanciale *Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate Plus beer, 2 desserts, several other dishes from our neighbors (love the communal tables), and a cute waitress."
"i'm sure lots of people before me have said that this place is totally worth the wait because it doesn't take reservations, and i've got to say i completely echo this sentiment. it never hurts to be a little adventurous in what you eat and i've got to say the bone marrow here was absolutely amazing."
"We must've had 8 courses of food and they were all good.  It's a good thing this place serves tapa portions so that I could enjoy the different courses.  My favorite for the night was the Milk Braised Pork Shoulders.  Thank you fellow Yelpers!  We had one delicious portion and then the kitchen though we didn't get our order so they brought another portion.  The waiter realized the mistake after we told the runner but he still insisted that we keep it and just didn't charge us.  What service!  My husband said he enjoyed everything but LOVED the espresso soft serve ice cream with a shot of espresso.  It apparantly hit the spot and brought him out of his food coma.  The only two things that I was disappointed about was how tight the place was, especially the individual tables, and the fact that they ran out of of an appetizer that I wanted to try.  I guess we'll just have to visit again."
"The Purple Pig is a great Spanish bistro with great energy, good wine lists and good cuisine. The interior is tight, with long communal tables but well worth it to feel informal and get into the accidental conversation with others. The service was attentive and the pace of the courses were done well. Overall, a good restaurant."
"2nd visit to  PP(Note to self - schedule angioplasty).  Restraint was on the menu tonight.  Instead of blowing it out like last times' 10+ entree order,  I settled in for a lighter meal:Salad with Mint, Feta and those cool looking watermellon radishes - pretty good, this was my conciliation to veggies at the PigOctopus with Beans - really good, tasty, and perfectly cooked Greek Sausage - good, but too much salt forces a demeritDessert:  Sicilian Iris - soo good - it could easily serve 2 people.  must orderService:  excellent!  I always eat at the bar,  All of the bar staff are professionals, friendly, engaging but not obtrusive and when I asked for a side dish of chocolate/nutella for the Iris, it was happily included (i also heard someone say ""I'm ordering that next time too!""My rating is upgraded to 4 stars.  I will overlook the excessive Salt demerit for the Greek Sausage, becuase the PP is such GOOD VALUE, GOOD Service and Good Food. When you coming to NYC????  (or Brooklyn!)"
"Located on The Magnificent Mile just north of the Riverwalk, we popped in here for an early mid-week dinner. We beat the rush and got a couple of seats next at their communal table. It seems like it gets busy with the after-work crowd.The tagline is cheese, swine and wine. We didn't have any cheese, but a full thumbs up on the swine and wine! Our friendly server recommended a wine for us to try -- the 2006 Alpha Estate Axia, a mix of syrah and xinomavro, a greek varietal. We enjoyed it and it paired well with all our dishes.The Purple Pig serves small plates making it easy to share and try a few things. We started with the Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries. The deviled egg is made with bechemel sauce, put back together, breaded and deep fried. The arugula salad is bright and vinegary,  a nice complement to heaviness of the egg.We next enjoyed Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. Three huge bones are served with tiny forks so that you can scoop out marrow to spread on bread. The combination of salty pork flavor, fresh herb salad and fresh crunchy bread with drizzles of olive oil... so delicious!We enjoyed two entrees: Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette. Both were fantastic, but I think the Pork Shoulder was my favorite -- fork tender and paired well with creamy buttery potatoes.We finished on a sweet note -- the Butterscotch Pudding. Creamy and sweet with nice hints of salt. As we ate our pudding, a design at the bottom of the bowl was revealed -- a drawing of a pig. Yes, we pigged out at The Purple Pig and enjoyed it. Oink oink!"
"Our group of 3 walked in around 6 on a lovely Sunday evening and were immediately seated (yay, my stomach was eating itself!)  The waitress was really friendly and made sure that we were taken care of, even though the restaurant was about 3/4 full.I ordered the chorizo-stuffed olives, which were olive-y, and the octopus, which was... well...For dessert I ordered the bananan, nutella, and marshmallow panini, which I would have devoured but the crust on the bread was a bit too chewy for my weak jaws.Even though I was not amazed by any of my choices, I had my eye on so many other things on the menu that I will definitely be returning.  For instance, there is a large selection of cheeses and since I have just lately become a cheese fan I have my eye on one that was called Truffle something-or-other.The prices are pretty reasonable if you are savvy,meaning some things on the menu give you a lot more food for about the same price as anything else (the paninis mainly).  But if you just want to try something new they make that really easy too- I got like 8 of the olives for about $4.The ambience is upbeat and classy, but definitely for more intimate groups since the music was so loud I had to raise my voice just for two other people to hear me.And last but not least, the wine list is extensive and impressive."
"Cheese, swine, and wine. The fact that ""swine"" was in the tagline made me nervous. As a vegetarian, I was not thrilled to check this place out, honestly. Reviews and press have stated how ""good"" the restaurant was based on eating bone marrow, ears, tails, and everything else an animal has to offer. Working upstairs, I was also distracted by the smell everyday.With all that said, I have to say I was impressed. I loved the decor as it was a nice change of pace from all the chain restaurants of Michigan Ave. The service was also informative and on point. I'm honestly not a big cheese guy, but I have to say that all their salads were wonderful. They seemed to incorporate asparagus into all their salads. I went with a group from work so we ended up sharing most of our dishes, which worked out well and allowed us to try everything on the menu. After the salads I tried the toast with goat cheese topped with eggplant and garbanzo beans. Tasty! Finally, I closed out with their grilled cheese of the day, which I think was a bleu cheese and cheddar? I'm not sure, but it was good. However, my main concern is that I am a vegetarian leaning vegan and most, if not all dishes, seemed to depend on using cheese as a base for flavor. I don't really know what a vegan would get here on a night out without really customizing the order. Whether it makes sense for a vegan to go to a restaurant called The Purple Pig, is up to you to decide, but I do think that alternative should always be available."
"Purple Pig doesn't need more accolades, but I'll chime in.  This place is great, particularly for dining alone.  It's easiest to get seated this way (at the bar), the bartenders are fabulous at recommending food and wine, and it's a good atmosphere.  The plates are a good size, so even when dining alone you can try a few things.  I recommend asking the bartender or server for recommendations- they've never steered me wrong.  And the Sicilian Iris dessert is amazing."
"This place reminded me a lot of my experience at Girl and the Goat, re: plates to share, various meat specialties, atmosphere, etc. Granted, the restaurants themselves are very different (G&G occupying a huuuuge almost industrial/rustic themed space in the West Loop and PP occupying a rather smaller space on the Mag Mile), but the quality in food is similar.My S.O. and I ordered 4 dishes to start - the bone marrow spread, charred cauliflower, the octopus and green bean/fingerling potato dish, and the milk-braised pork shoulder. We ordered a 5th dish, the pig's tails, because we decided we were still a bit hungry after the first four dishes. The standouts were the bone marrow, octopus, and pork shoulder. The cauliflower was WAY too salty (which is unfortunate), and the pig's tails were on the salty end, too, but were at least interesting to see (I also think the eggs on top were a bit mismatched with the tails themselves). The pork shoulder was absolutely amazing, it came sititng on top of mashed potatoes and the meat just melted in your mouth. Very hearty. The octopus was cooked well, not too tough but not slimy. The green beans and potatoes were delicious with it, and was marinated perfectly. The bone marrow was an experience - the capers/onions really helped bring out the flavor, and a little bit of sea salt made the dish great.All in all, I say service was good and our wait was minimal at 6pm on a Thursday. We chose to sit outside (it was pretty hot) when everyone wanted to sit inside with the A/C. Let's just say it was a smart idea to sit outside, because after we sat down we noticed that a long line started to form for the inside spots. The outside area filled up pretty quickly, too, so if you want to dine here comfortably, I say come early!Service was good, and dishes came out fast. A solid 4 stars, as the food taste levels weren't entirely consistent. Most of the dishes felt heavy, but I guess that's why you would seek this place out!"
"Great wine, great cheese, and a great service!Loved the fried cheese and the beets and meats. Not one thing we ordered wasn't good.I will definitely have to come back here next time I am in Chicago!!"
One of the best lunches i had in Chicago during my visit. went back later that week for dinner. Amazing food and great prices. can get real crowded but its worth the wait.
"Possibly the best restaurant I've ever eaten at, and the best dinner experience of my life. I don't say that lightly. The Purple Pig is an exquisite culinary experience that everyone should try at least once in their life. They took brussel sprouts and made them not just edible but a flavor explosion in my mouth. They took octopus (normally ridiculously chewy) and turned it into something I'm now sitting here craving. The pork was phenomenal. Bravo to the chorizo stuffed olives. The wine was well suggested by our server. The sharing experience as opposed to one dish per person was unique and invited discussion of all the dishes. The price for Chicago left me speechless and happily shocked. If and when I return to Chicago I shall return to the Purple Pig and I shall relish that moment. In the meantime I will wallow in self pity that Phoenix doesn't have a Purple Pig to call our own. I will not say goodbye to the Purple Pig and instead shall say, until we meet again."
"Great little place downtown to grab some food and some drinks. This is a place for foodies and wine lovers though, so if you're not in one of those categories you might not enjoy it as much. We enjoyed all of our dishes a great deal, from the salted beets with goat cheese and pistachios to the artichoke and fingerlings and the braised pork shoulder. Desert was also excellent: mmm nutella pannini and the ricotta chocolate chip iris. Service was a little slow, but still friendly. Not sure if I'd go here again for dinner per say, as I think its better for just some snacks and drinks as the dishes are kind of tapas style. Also, if you're not a pork fan, you might not appreciate the menu as much (as their name implies)."
"great, fresh food. all small plates which are great for sharing, and a wonderful wine list. i've been here twice at lunch time, and it hits the spot every time. I had a corn and tomato salad and it was amazing! i recommend ordering a few things to start, and then order as you go if your still hungry--everything comes out quickly. not a place to go to if your looking to bring home leftovers."
"Very very good. Great wine selection!Pork shoulder was delightful as was the pork liver pate. The pig ear was interesting, but still very good.Service was great, I love the communal tables. Definitely is a bit loud, but when the food is this good, who cares?Definitely will be going back!"
"What a cool little place off the beaten path on Michigan Avenue.   pretty much a wine and cheese place that offers pork in a bunch of different ways.  I have only been once, but expierenced great service, interesting food (that was delicious) and a really cool seating arrangment. You sit real close, if not arm-and arm-with the couple dining next to you, while talking, sharing, and enjoying....pig parts, red wine, and that feeling of downtown chicago....Magnificent!I really liked this place. Clean, and really modern and hip!   Pig Ears, Fried Deviled Eggs, Shaved Aparagus...all delicious, and way cheap for tapas style in downtown Chicago!"
"Sit at the end of the bar in front of the sous chefs if you can.  Not only is the food amazing but you get to see iot prepared and chat with the folks making it and all the waiters zooming in to retrieve the food.  It can be pretty crazy busy but when you're sitting here, it doesn't matter.  Just know you might decide to order even more food as you start to watch it being prepared and get to hear all about it from all the staff."
"The place was packed at 10 pm.  We were seated outside, a little chilly but with the gas lamp, it was nice.Food: Pork neck bone rillette, too rich. Portion was big. I wish they would serve this with crostini instead of toast. The shaved brussel sprouts were good, the feta cheese with cucumber was ok. Overall, their food went well with wine pairings. If you are not going to have wine with your dinner here, you might be disappointed with the food.Service: the server needs a little more training with customer service. She was so hurried and did not even show us the wine bottle that we ordered. She just poured it in our glass and off she went.  How do I know I got the right one?  So, they only get 3 stars."
"The Purple Pig -a great name for a great restaurant in Chicago.  Like the title says, expect a good selection of wine and fine foods.  I love pork and do they have a wonderful selection.  I have only been once to the restaurant (and arrived 5 minutes before the placed exploded. The menu is simple and full of creative options.  Everything we sampled was crisp, fresh and well-prepared.  The only complaint would be with the aggressive use of asiago in the artichoke dish.  I like my asiago cheese, don't get me wrong, but over use can spoil a dish.  My favorite dish of the night was the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and fried egg over an amazing grilled bread.  Note, not all menu items were available that night, so this was our favorite given our options.Overall, the experience was fun, lasting and I would gladly go back."
This place is a must dine here! We had such great food and amazing service!
"So good.  Never thought I'd say that to describe a turkey leg dish, literally.  Turkey Leg Confit presents itself on the menu, and my many years of Chicago living have trained me to instantly think when I see turkey leg ""everything wrong with the Taste of Chicago"". (quickly following eating funnel cake with a bland lifeless corn in the cob).Anyway, the Turkey Leg Confit at the Purple Pig is decadent, and when I've had it (twice now) it was always to share, I need to stop doing that, it's too good.  Tooo gooooood.Along with fried brussel sprout leaves, fried devil eggs, Panino Nutella, Bread Pudding, Cured meats...it's just soooo good.  The food is smart rustic European.  It has modern whims like it's use of aged vinegar with turkey confit in a braised preparation, but served literally as a leg with no fancy advances in presentation.  Service has always been friendly.  They've thus far always been attentive as well, which I find impressive only because they are always busy.  Attentive is hard to do when you're talking about a small location, crammed with locals and tourists, and there doesn't seem to be such a thing as ""down time"" for the location.Located in the funky ""around the corner"" spot on Michigan Avenue, you pass through an outdoor area to get inside, to generally find it at 90% capacity, (even on a monday).They currently do not accept reservations, which is annoying, but the times I've been here I've always gotten seating.  THE TOP FIVE REASONS NOT TO GO TO THE PURPLE PIG: 1) No reservations 2) You have issues with the idea of eating ""pigs ears"" (hell my old dog did it) 3) It can be loud 4) No parking 5) You're a vegetarianTHE TOP FIVE REASONS TO GO TO THE PURPLE PIG: 1) The food is modern rustic and delicious 2) The bar area is just the right level of exhausting and charming - and great wine list! 3)  Service is positive 4) The location is safe 5) The desserts are just as modern rustic and delicious as the main dishes."
"Like a place with 900+ reviews needs my 2 cents. Well, I really enjoyed it, highlights: winelist, pig's ear, braised pork shoulder, and anything starting with ""neck bone"" Outstanding value considering location and quality."
"I've only been here once, but it's a place that I plan to return many more times. I'll say this though, I went on an early lunch in order to get fast seating and service. I have not experienced the evenings there and I'm not sure if I want to.Now for the dishes. For starters, my friend and I had marinated, fried olives stuffed with sausage. AMAZING! I like olives a lot, and the quality of these were great, especially with the sausage in there. We also had the chicken kebabs with fried mashed potatoes. The chicken was good, not the best, but did help with the sauce on it. The potatoes were really good.The best part about what we had though was the pork blade steak with honey sauce. The pork was vvvvvvery tasty, but then to make it better was the tenderness of it. So tender I could barely tell there where the fat was. Only place I've been where the pork is more tender is Longman and Eagle. Oh, I should say that the honey sauce did top it off, making it one of the best lunches I have had in a while.Service was pretty good there, didn't take too long for the food. I didn't check out the wine or beer selections at all because it was lunch, but I've heard from others they're good. Even without the drinks, I'd say check it out. Good veggie food from what I hear too!"
"Purple Pig is one of the best places I've ever eaten. Seriously.I love the semi-casual atmosphere. I love that they offer tall ""communal"" tables. They have a great beer and wine list. And the food! Um. I couldn't get enough. LOVE.I went work friends and we shared a bunch of things off the menu (which is the only way to eat here). When you eat here, experiment! Try lots of things and make sure to order desert to complete the meal.I will definitely be back. And maybe when I'm back I will run into you. Why? Because you have to eat here. That's why."
"I really truly and honestly want to give Purple Pig 5 stars.  However,  the last two times I have been there the service has been beyond poor.  Now granted the place was busy,  very busy in fact and sitting at the bar,  menu in hand looking left and right at couples also sitting drink less and food less with menu in hand ,  who had been sitting there much longer than I had didn't help... I wanted some delicious food dagnabbit!   I wanted a glass of French Rose and some creamy decadent bone marrow,  I wanted those fabulous deviled eggs,  I needed, I desired,  I have been there many times before,  I know the  charms of roasted cauliflower, I yearned for beets! Sadly,  after 25 minutes with not even a nod from a bartender,  I walked out.  Oh I will go back,  not at happy hour,  not on a Friday,  maybe on a nice unassuming Tuesday.  Because the place deep inside me that craves a really good cheese plate will demand it."
"Simply nothing bad to say about this place. Lovely atmosphere and superb food. I'd fly back up from Houston just to eat here again. Really does deserve 5 stars for its warm feel, food selection and for doing something a little different from everybody else."
"I have to say it, I had HEARD great things.  I had READ great things.  But my experience here exceeded even what I had heard and read.  The food is impeccably beautiful & so tasty.  Perfect small-bite & antipasti accompaniments to the wine & beers they serve.  Great after-work wine place.  The beet salad w/ whipped goat cheese is to-die-for, the fried pig's ear (YES, I SAID PIG'S EAR!) is sooo tasty w/ a beer or crisp white wine.  The deviled egg is also interesting and inventive.  Everything left me wanting MORE.  GREAT wine-by-the-glass menu too.  Or you can get a little carafe which is more like a glass and a half.  I appreciate that!  Don't miss the nutella, banana, marshmallow panini for dessert too!"
"Well I set a new personal record for dinners in one evening by eating back to back with two different parties in one evening.  The advantage was I was able to sample about 50% of the menu.  There was nothing that I disliked and a few key stand outs as far a my personal favorites.  The chicken kabobs are delicious, I never order chicken and after party #1 ordered them party #2 also had to so that understood the fabulousness of that dish.  Another stand out was the squid, the flavor was delicious and the seafood was not too chewy at all.  Everything else was tasty and I have to say I really loved the pork shoulder and the pig tails as well. As far as cocktail I enjoyed some bubbly and wine, I wish that they had some Argentinian varieties....maybe next time??We had  a rice pudding dessert with chocolate topping that was truly a treat without being so overly sweet.  My dinner guests were trying to decipher the recipe to pillage for their own enjoyment.Go early and go often, this place is a little place of character and heaven in the concrete loop."
"Awesome food and great atmosphere!!!  Happy to be a Purple Pig for the night.If you only try one thing:  Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed PotatoesOne would think that The Purple Pig would be a tourist trap given it's location but it truly is a little piece of Europe tucked away down a high-profile alley right off Michigan Ave. The unpretentious vibe, down-to-earth staff, contemporary but yet warm environment was packed with hip, young and creative Chicagoans on a warm Wed night.Everything we ate was full of flavor and the small plates let us try a variety of dishes.  Round 1: To Whet The Appetite...- A Half Bottle of Wine: La Cartuja from the Priorat Region of Spain- Marinated Olives- 3 Cheese Plate: Manchego, Podda, Truffle Tremor- Salt-Roasted Beets w/ Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio VinaigretteRound 2: To Fill The Belly...- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes- Scallop Spiedini w/ Chickpea AioliRound 3: To Indulge- Sfogliatelle NapoletaneBon Appetite my friends!"
very great place to eat! but I personally did not like the bone marrow due to the texture! but to each his/her own!
"My boyfriend and I went here last Friday after work. It was definitely packed, but they somehow managed to seat us without a wait.We were seated on a large table in the middle, along with 8 other people - mostly couples. We got tune & lima beans, artichokes & potatoes, chorizo stuffed olives, and the fried pig ear and kale. Let me tell you, the pig ear was our favourite. We are not necessarily the most adventurous of eaters and had both not eaten pig ear, but we were so happy with our decision to try something new. We also got a wine pairing recommended to us, which I thought was great if you want to try something new, but I wasn't a huge fan of the wine we tried.  Not extremely pricey for such a place on Michigan Ave."
"I was excited to try this place. Heard a lot of great things. Bon Appetit wrote this place up as one of the ten best new restaurants in 2010. But alas, it was just OK. We shared the roasted bone marrow spread, the pork tail, the milk braised pork shoulder, raw corn, and mussels. It was all very tasty but I didn't think anything was particularly outstanding. I see what they are trying to do with the nose to tail dining tapas style which is daring in itself. In the end, this place pares in comparison to all the great restaurants that also serve charcuteries and tapas in the bay area. Service was subpar. At times, our waitress was nowhere to be found."
"I went here over the weekend with my roommate and had a fun experience. Since they do not take reservations, we left our name and waited about an hour to get seated. Luckily, we got a nice table outside right by the light pole(sp)? The decor was super cute and the atmosphere was very chill which I liked. Our server was very attentive and informed us of all the specials and what's popular in the restaurant. We started out with wine and ordered couple things off the menu. We ordered the roasted bone marrow smears, fried manchego, and the octopus dish. I loved the octopus dish and the roasted bone marrow smears! Very delicious! Then for our dessert, we ordered sicilian iris which was amazing!! I will def. visit again since this restaurant is open late night :)"
"I loved everything about this place. The drinks, the food, but the bartender seemed to be a bit of a shun:( Anyway, we sat at the bar, four of us Dallas boys and enjoyed an array of bites. My favorite was the Fried sardines and the chorizo stuffed olives. DO NOT skip the olives! Next time -and there will be a next time I hope to try some other menu items and not feel like I'm being ignored. -Literally, I had to get one of my buddies to order for me because the bartender would have nothing to do with me until he realized I had the tab..."
"I went to the Purple Pig with a group of 9 other people so let me say that there probably isn't something on the menu that I did not try. Everything was very good, with some highlights being the pork shoulder, the Villa 2006 Reserve Chianti, and the eggplant spread. Though the service was slow to start, it was a good experience. I would wait longer to sit outside; the inside was too bright and chaotic for my preference."
"We wanted to have a fun, good dinner and not have to walk too far from our hotel and the Purple Pig turned out to be an excellent choice. A little skeptical at first as it is right off Michigan Avenue and I didn't want touristy (Being from NYC I was afraid I was going to get the equivalent of a overdone place) and it was anything but. And with no reservations we could walk in and get a table. Yes, we had to wait, a little less than an hour (we arrived Friday night at 7:30, so to be expected) but there was plenty of space outside to have a drink and catch up with the rest of our party. Can't complain on that front! Once seated the service was great, our server was friendly, helpful and we never felt rushed. He helped us determine how to order and we got a good mix of everything. This is a place to share and taste a lot of different things, we order two dishes per person and the pig platter which was perfect. Some standouts: Artichokes with fingerling potatoesFried Manchengo CheesePork Neck Bone RillettePork SaltimbuccaAs you can see a lot of Pork! A little disappointing was the fried deviled egg and could have served another few chorizo stuffed olives to make that plate more worth while. Good, comprehensive wine list with some excellent choices for under $50 a bottle. I would definitely go back to this place, great atmosphere and excellent food. But you have to like meat!"
"Had some delish pigs tails (I know!!) and a yummy brussels sprout salad. Fellow diners were very friendly, perhaps cuz I was dining solo at the bar, they too enjoyed their meals.  Server at the bar was a tad slow but it gave me more time to chill and people watch"
"Fabulous casual dining on Michigan.  Visited while on vacation last week.  Great food, incredible wine list, laid back atmosphere, and awesome service!  Loved it so much, went back the next day!"
We had an amazing lunch here with brother/sister in law who are from Chicago. Ordered a lot of the menu. Everything was well conceived and executed. Service was flawless. Some standouts were the neck bone gravy (which was almost as good as my grandmas) pigs ears and the octupus. The cheese selection was also brilliant. One of my favorite restos in the US.
Just try whatever the server tells you to. It's all kind of weird. And it's all really good!
"First meal in Chicago - LOVED IT. Had: pig ears, bone marrow, meatball sliders, brussel sprouts, chicken thighs kebobs, and  the pork shoulder. I could go on and on about how good this place is but it seems redundant if you read the other Yelp reviews. I will say, pig ears are my new favroite food. Everything else was delicious as well. Stop reading Yelp and just go try it!"
"Super good!  I have been here twice in the 5 months I've lived in Chicago.  I'm a sucker for a place with small plates and good wine.  I highly recommend the Greek Cabernet.  Who knew?  And the non-fried calamari (I can't recall the name) is so interesting and so tasty. Great place for 2.  Be prepared for a wait, even early on a Sunday evening.  Worth the wait.  This place is a must try!"
"Better than The Gage. Won't say my night here was really all that great, but I'm still glad it's an option to the lovely, but limited, Michigan Avenue.Did not enjoy: Prosciutto Bread Balls, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, and some broccoli type antipastiDid enjoy: Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes, Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, and half bottles of wine.3-3?"
"I fell in around the holidays and was typically blown away. The pan seared quail was unbelievable and so was every thing we ate. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner/chef Jimmy Banos and not a nicer guy exists. Good food, no BS no attitude just a good time with friends and the like."
"I have been many many times to the Purple Pig. It is one of my favorite restaurants and the food is incredible. However, I had a really bad experience with my waitress last time I went. I have to follow a pretty strict diet because of some intolerance. It is not fun, trust me. No eggs, no dairy, no gluten. It makes going out pretty harsh, but usually waiters are extremely nice and always find ways to accommodate it. I have been to PP in the past, and they were great about it. So when I came back, I remembered some things sounded fine but were not. As I asked the waitress to indicate what I could eat, she told me I could not eat smears because they were served with bread - well you don't have to eat the bread - and that for the rest it was pretty obvious. Which I knew was not the case. I asked if I could eat something that did seem. Her reply, was Yes, I'm pretty sure it's fine, it should not have any dairy in it. But I can go in the kitchen and ask. And I'm like, yesss please go ask, (we are talking about my health, I'm sorry about the extra work) and of course there was cheese inside. Every time I had to ask if this or that was fine. Made the experience pretty unpleasant. Went out a couple more times during the weekend and each time the waitress was extremely helpful."
"As a party of two from out of town my friend and I arrived with nothing other then other yelpers reviews and a vague impression that we were about to get our swine on.  We were seated immediately (at about 5pm on a Wednesday) but within the half hour the place was packed. To the gills.  I was pretty impressed at how quickly the evening went from mellow and quite to roaring.  I was not a huge fan of the space itself, something just did not mesh for me with the decor and the type of food I was expecting.  the music was great.  Our server was also attentive and informative about the best order practice.  Portions are intended to be shared and 3 probably would have been enough for the two of us.  Neither of us are drinkers so I can not attest to the wine list or cocktail options, although every single other table in the restaurant was imbibing wine.We started off with Shaved Brussel Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano, delicious and fresh with a nice kick to the cheese.  Next we had the Purple Pig Platter, a sample of all the cured meats on the menu.  It was simply fantastic, as usual the sopressata was my favorite but all were remarkable.  When the platter was brought to our table the food runner did tell us what meat was what, however he was a little difficult to understand.  Next we had the Cesear salad that had a pleasantly strong anchovy flavor.  This was followed by the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs.  By far my favorite item of the meal, rich and creamy marrow spread onto crusty bread with herbs and a dash of sea salt. I could have ended the meal here, especially since this was the largest portion of bone marrow I have ever been served.  We finished off the meal with the milk braised pork shoulder in mashed potatoes. this was soft and rich and a close second to the bone marrow.  Our server offered dessert but after looking at the menu we decided we couldn't possibly and waddled out of The Purple Pig full and sleepy and content."
"I stopped by over the weekend after a nice long bike ride on the lake path so I was pretty hungry by the time we ordered.  I tried out the Chicken Thigh Kebabs.They were not good....  Chewy, no real flavor to speak of.  Normally even a bad kebab can be made edible by dousing it in tzatziki but even their sauce was weak and not very tasty.  The only stars earned were based upon the following;  I did like the decor and layout of the place and the staff was very friendly.  Seems like yelp loves the place so who knows, I may give it a second chance at some point but I am not in a big rush to do so."
"This was the very, very last place I ate on my trip to Chicago and it was a solid finish to an amazing food-filled weekend. I am a big fan of the tapas trend because it allows me to try lots of different flavors without being too full to roll myself onto an airplane. The Purple Pig does tapas well and has some very interesting dishes on the menu. My absolute favorite was the fried manchego. I love manchego and have never seen it served this way before. The little bites were incredibly rich and flavorful and complemented very nicely by what I think was quince jam. They would be a great bar snack! I also tried two of the ""smears"" - the roasted bone marrow and the feta with cucumber. I have never had bone marrow and was not sure what to expect. The portion was generous and the marrow gave a rich flavor to the generous portion of bread. I enjoyed the feta with cucumber more - it was light and bright and very seasonal. I asked my server to recommend one additional plate as I wasn't sure what to order and didn't want to end my trip on a sour note. He suggested the chicken thigh kebabs as a popular option. I don't usually like dark meat, but I'm glad I went with this - the chicken was juicy and flavorful and served with an incredible tzatziki sauce. The smashed potatoes were not boring at all. All in all, I feel like I got a nice variety of flavors for a reasonable price. They lose one star for service. Our waiter was inattentive and obnoxiously pretentious when he deigned to stop by our table. He was also unhelpful - not able to answer specific questions about the menu or provide more general guidance. I noted above that he told me the kebabs were a ""popular"" option, but I asked him specifically to recommend either something that was very good or something that he himself personally would choose. I don't want to know what ""everyone"" orders, sometimes ""everybody"" is stupid. I ask what my servers order because they usually are familiar with the food and can speak to things that they've particularly enjoyed. You work in a restaurant and you can't pick one thing off the menu that you like?! Hie thee to corporate America, kiddo, there's tons of unemployed food-loving hipsters out there who will happily take your job and wax rhapsodic about the finer points of charcuterie."
"Great place, and I recommend it... but...I hesitate...I guess I'm feeling a tad under-sophisticated here...I feel suburban... reading all the 4 & 5 star reviews of ""The Pig"".But jeez, The Purple Pig is just cheese and sausage, for crikey's sake. Hey, it was great cheese and sausage... some fun weird stuff too, but it was just that. Cheese and sausage.It was a fun experiment and the company of my ebullient tulip was outstanding, but... cheese and sausage. 3 stars.moo... yow, bill"
Great food and ambience.Prices were reasonable too.
"My trip to the purple pig was originally to use the bathroom but once I stepped in I was tempted for some wine and cheese.  OMG I was a happy girl when I left.  Fava Beans, Leeks with Hard Boiled Eggs & Crispy Prosciutto super yummy!!!  They lose a star because of the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio spread, it sounded better on paper but was just meh.  I will return for another snack if I'm back in Chicago"
"After reading many good reviews for The Purple Pig, my girlfriend and I decided to head here for dinner on a week night after work. It was a good, but there were a couple of things that didn't rub us the right way. First, our waitress, although timely, seemed a little snooty and practically turned up her nose hearing that it was our first time there. Not a great way to start the night. Her tone remained fake throughout our meal. Second, the menu, albeit varied, wasn't very descriptive. Being a semi-foodie, I was able to surmise what most of the small plates were going to consist of. However, it would've helped to have a brief description considering that you are ordering multiple items. Finally, although the food and wine were all good, I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't worth the money. Our bill with tip was over $90, but we didn't feel like we had a $$$ experience. We each ordered 3 plates and shared a dessert. My favorite dish was the roasted bone marrow while my girlfriend preferred the prosciutto di parma. Portions were fair but sometimes made you wish there was more. The wines were great, but were a little pricey considering they give you a strict 5oz pour. Overall, this is a good restaurant with a good atmosphere. Seems adequate for groups and is definitely appropriate for a date. However, the service and the prices will probably keep you from coming back again."
"Who doesn't wake up with the shakes, craving some good ole pig ear? Finally, the Purple Pig is here to fulfill this rampant addiction. It cunningly manages to stay off the beaten path, while being smack dab on the magnificent mile. Like many of its peers, it too hails the pork-brussel sprout-marrow bandwagon. But it does so flawlessly. And cheaply. So I'm sold.Their brussels are shaved and manscaped, a fun twist. The beets and goat cheese is a treat, the richest $5 you'll spend. The cheeses are a must. The pork neck bone rillete smear was divine. Even though there's a good chance it was dog meat, so be it. The octopus sealed the deal.  Overall the perfect place for wine and indulging in the nuances of the pig anatomy, among many other things. For two, the wait ain't bad, even on a weekend. At least for now."
"I'm visiting from Seattle and this was the only place that I could find that wasn't a giant ""pub"" atmosphere. Small plates for sharing are excellent and made with fresh produce. Wines and cheeses are to die for- I'll be here more than once this trip!"
"A very busy and noisy place. Has to talk loud to be heard. I don't quite like that. Also, they don't take reservations- so I waited 2 hours in total! Food is pretty good. We ordered a turkey leg since we saw people around us were eating it. It's so tender and yummy, which we will definitely recommend it."
"Wow.. I cannot get over how great this meal was. First off, this place is a LOT smaller than I imagined it would be. Expect a wait. A long one. We stopped by around 630 on a Saturday night to check out what the wait situation was like. We were told 2 hours for the two of us, which was a bit much given that I was already hungry (and hungry Jen quickly leads to cranky Jen). We moved over to the side to check out open table but within a few minutes, a group left from the bar and we were able to snag those seats. I think that this was actually better than waiting for a table for the two of us, as the majority of the tables here are communal seating and I'm not the biggest fan of that concept. The bartender was very attentive even though he was serving a lot of people. He always made sure we had a fresh drink ready and was able to provide us with several suggestions on food. The food came out extremely quickly (I think the longest thing took maybe 10 minutes). Everything is small plates style so try several things. Here's a quick run down of what we had:*Pork Fried Almonds: I loved these! They were seasoned really well and provided us with something great to munch on throughout all of our other plates. I thought they gave us a surprisingly large portion as well*Braised Baby Artichokes: I'm not the biggest fan of artichokes but these were done really well. It was a chilled dish, which was a nice complement to everything else we had that night. The potatoes and salami that it was paired with did great things to break up what could have been a boring dish*Pigs Ear: Many yelpers had raved about this before and it was the first dish the bartender recommended so we went with it. Both of us were very ""ehh"" about it. The crispy kale, egg & peppers provided a great flavor explosion -- your taste buds will be all over the place -- but neither of us could actually taste the pigs ear. It was just like eating fried rectangles so I don't know if I'd get this again*Mussels: I do not usually like them, but I was trying to be agreeable that night tried a few. The broth they were served in is delicious! The boy said the mussels themselves were really good, although I have nothing to compare them too. I just wanted more bread to dip in the sauce*Pork Shoulder: GET THIS. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I will go back for this alone. The pork was so tender.. it fell apart just touching it with a fork. The mashed potatoes must have been 1/2 butter, 1/2 potato and were heavenly. Everything about it was delicious. I think I may drool on the keyboard if I continue..*Peanut Butter ice cream: I was more than full, but the boy wanted ice cream, and like I said, I was being agreeable. YUM. It had the creamy consistency good ice cream should have, the pb sauce was to die for and the crushed peanuts made for an excellent topping. I was a little upset I was so full by this point, but still managed to get a few bites down.All in all, I'll definitely be back, many times, but will probably go earlier than I'd normally prefer for a weekend night just to snag a table."
"This was a fun restaurant to go to on Michigan Ave, right next to the Nordstrom Mall. We showed up a little before 8pm, and ended up waiting an hour or so for a table. We didn't mind because we weren't in a rush, and were able to pass some of the time easily shopping at Nordstrom and also hanging out for a drink at their outside waiting area, which overlooks Illinois St. We got a table outside and had a very friendly waiter named Patrick who made the experience even more enjoyable with a knowledgable take on both the menu and wines. Had the Lingua Agrodolce (husband enjoyed it - it was a little ""rich"" for me), and a selection of 3 cheeses - podda (standout), delice de bourgogne, quadrello di bufala to star tout. The other small plates we enjoyed were: fried pig's ear,pig's tails with balsamic, broccoli, sweetbreads, and the sicilian iris as the dessert. Also enjoyed a quartino of Plavac Mali Tomic anda Bertagnolli Moscato. Reasonable, casual/romantic dinner for 2 for about $100."
"Cheese, Swine, and Wine, oh my! What's not to love about a place that incorporates the 3 things that are proof that God loves us? 'Cheese, Swine and Wine' actually is their tag line for real, so they won me over before we even walked in. A magnificent little spot right on the mile of magnificence, with an impressive wine list and a very creative and curious menu. We were looking for somewhere to grab a drink on a recent visit and because I can be simple- all I needed was to see purple and pig in the same sentence. We decided to come here around 5 in the afternoon to meet up with a friend- but apparently we weren't the only ones with that brilliant idea. It's not terribly big inside so there was a bit of a wait for a table, but the hostess was very nice and had us to go in and order a bottle (ok, two bottles) of wine which we then were able to sit outside and drink while we waited. Either there were holes in the bottles or we drank fast, but we were finally seated under the purple awning on the little patio type situation outside.  Just a heads up, seating is family style (and more than likely this won't be your family, but go with it).   And then came more wine...and food. Delicious cheeses and the smears were delish (I forget which ones we tried, see aforementioned wine-while-we-waited).  Overall a fun experience.....obviously not so much for the not so swine-inclined, but we thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Absolutely adore this place.  If I could give 4 1/2 stars, I would, but I'm rounding up for the surprise factor.  Wow this place delivers, despite its location.  Totally recommend the salt roasted beets.  My dinner companion dislikes two out of the three ingredients (beets and pistachios) and it was still a hit.  That's how good it is.  The cheese course comes with this little quince bite that's just divine.  And the chicken thighs?  So tender and such great flavor.  Not to mention the value!  They give you two huge pieces to fight over.On the other hand, I really don't get the big following for the milk braised pork shoulder.  I've had better, and with meat you go with either the medium rare or totally fall off the bone quality, and this one was just neither.  Also, what is up with the bread that comes with the smears?  It's almost like they were swimming in oil.  I wonder if they would bring me plain bread if I asked?  It would make those smears so much more appetizing.Despite all of this, the good truly outweighs the mediocre, and I am so looking forward to the next visit."
"Love this place... everytime I am in Chicago... it is a must go!  The atmosphere is infectious, great vibe.  Love watching the kitchen do their thing.  Wine list is good... food is the highlight.  Must have the crispy pig's ear appetizer, as well as the shrimp, goat cheese and pea tendrils appetizer.  Really a quaint find just off Michigan Ave.  If you get a chance, sit outside if the weather is nice!!!"
Holy porcine amazingness!!! The only regret I have is that I didn't have a glass of wine. I enjoyed the food so much that my companion asked if I needed a moment alone. ....um...I kinda needed several.
"5 STARS FOR SURE!!! My friend came to visit from out of town and we both had seen The Purple Pigs Cicilian Iris on The FoodNetwork. We HAD to go try it out. OMG! ORGASMIC!! The deviled eggs are nothing like you'd expect but sooo delicious. The feta and cucumber smear was amazing on the toasted bread that comes with it. The stuffed, fried olives were borderline addicting. We shared the salami and goat cheese pennini which was so mouth watering and satisfying. Of course we finished it off by also sharing that amazing Iris. The ONLY thing I DON'T recommend is sharing anything!!! Next time I want my own Iris! The decor is quaint and modern/rustic. The cheese list and wine list on the huge barrel tops on the wall is a nice custom touch. Everyone was really pleasant and the service was fast. I've recommended this place to so many people it's insane. They should start expanding their facility soon or find a larger location because t he people come in droves to this place. Keep up the great work Chef!! Your food paring skills keep ME coming back."
"The Purple Pig is really good overall, and any restaurant with an entire section of a menu devoted to fried things gets my approval. Everything on the menu is shared, so order tons of stuff and dig in with your friends. The octopus, jamon serrano, and truffle cheese--all terrific, all keepers for sure--were the highlights when I went. Pork-fried almonds are OK, not as good as I had hoped. Just felt/tasted like oily almonds, really. The cured meats we ordered weren't anything special--somewhat flavorless/characterless, not interesting flavors at all. The milk-braised pork shoulder is really tender, but nothing to write home about in the way of flavor or character or spice. (It's possible that I was spoiled by a recent visit to Salumi, in Seattle, which has the best cured meats I've ever had.)One of the servers accidentally brought us a plate of tasty fried olives, and instead of correcting him, our waitress let us have them on the house. A nice gesture!I will definitely be back when I'm downtown again, as the menu is large and changing, and very interesting."
"I really enjoyed my meal here. Perhaps some of it was due to the company I was with and part was due to the delicious food.Pretty much everything we tried was at least pretty good. Unfortunately they were out of the deviled eggs so we didn't get a chance to try it out. Among three people, we shared a half bottle of wine (slightly more than 1 glass each) and had:Fried Brussel Sprouts: Tasty and somewhat crunchy sprout leaves. Pretty good but it definitely didn't blow me away. I don't think this is a very good place to go if you want to fill up on veges.Roasted Bone Marrow: Man I love me some bone marrow. This did not disappoint. Spread it on the toast, add a little bit of herbs and salt and enjoy the mouth-watering party in your mouth.Octopus with green beans, potatoes, and salsa: This was actually really really delicious. The octopus pieces were fried up and the whole combination was very tasty.Pig's Ear: This was alright. It was crispy but slightly too oily for me. Kind of like eating pork rinds.Pork Liver Pate: This was some really good pate! Creamy and rich... Same as the marrow, spread it on the toast, and let your taste buds enjoy the ride.There was one other dish and I think it was some sort of pasta/vege type of dish. I recall it being just ""ok"". Probably why I can't remember what it was!All of that food and drink cost us about $100 and we all left feeling pleasantly full.So how was the service and atmosphere? We walked in and ended up having to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. This place is a lot smaller than I expected. They really need a larger space for this place! It's so crowded that they have a covered outside seating area with heat lamps. We were placed at the end of a communal table in the outside tent. Luckily the table was large enough that the party next to us wasn't really a distraction at all. The waiter was somewhat attentive throughout the night."
"Had been waiting for guests to come to town so I had an excuse to check it out, so came with a guest and the BF. We had a pretty late dinner (9pm) which worked out well because the space is relatively small, mostly communal seating which makes it loud and energetic.  Opposed to previous concerns about how difficult it was to find, they now have a huge sign right off michigan so it's hard to miss. It's all small plates to share so perfect to come with a smallish group (3-4) or not one plate will be too small.  Everything came out randomly but paced well. Best of all, everything was delicious!  Esp great for those willing to try new things and esp for pork lovers! He does use every part of the porker!! Must tries: - Beets with goat cheese.  Fresh and creamy cheese yum.- Octopus with isreali couscous and spinach: very small order but the octopus was perfectly tender! the couscous/spinach was uninspired- Pork tail:  I thought it was going to be fried pieces of curly tail but in fact it was similar to oxtail meat -- braised to perfection!  so delicious- Pork blade: one of the best cuts of pork ever! nice crisp but the meat was tender, coated with a subtle sweet honey.  SO DELICIOUS! Pretty okay- fried brussel sprouts:  oversalted but good- bone marrow:  no jam to go with and the bread was too oily so putting oil (marrow) on oil bread put me off a bit;  serving is generous with 3 bonesOverall a great meal at a great price point.  The wines are all international and seems like they are willing to open them and sell as quartinos if desired.  Will return again!"
"This place was great!  We were looking for a spot to stop off in and have a drink and a snack and this place delivered.  Our well informed waiter was able to steer us to the perfect drink and food items based on what we wanted.  I highly recommend the feta and cucumber spread, just plan amazing.  I would 100% come back on a future visit to Chicago !"
"By far an amazing addition to  the Chicago restaurant scene. Darhma is the best serving there. Friendly, unpretentious and full of wonderful suggestions. You can't go wrong with the sweetbreads and the menu definitely encompasses a large enough varieties to satisfy any foodie."
"Talk about OVER RATED!  The food was good, the staff, for the most part is so stuck up and they want to turn those tables FAST.  It is very expensive for what you get.  The hostess was so unkind!  AManda out waitress was a total sweet heart!I like the communal table setting, fun and met some fun people, it is so loud you can't really have a good conversation with your friends on the other side of the table.As they bring your ""small plates"" they just slam it down on the table and in front of one of the people in your party and quickly mumble what it is.  The pace is so frenetic it is not a place to go and and enjoy yourself and spend any quality time.  I am sure this atmosphere is created that way so you get in, eat and get out so they can flip the tables.  It is way over priced for the food and the amount that you get.If I ever go again, it will be too soon.  $400.00 for dinner??  There are a ton of amazing places in Chicago to spend that kind of money."
Very unique menu. Pork panini was delicious!  Good atmosphere as well.
"Again, like my review of The Girl & The Goat, I feel like everything in Chicago is salty.  That being said, Purple Pig is a good place to eat.  It's fun, lively, and the menu is broad.  The only disappointment is the bone marrow spread.  I thought it'll be some kind of spread instead of the cooked version of straight bone marrow inside the bone."
"I'll give this place a 5 star mainly cause the food experience they provide you with is unmatchable elsewhere.  They have all the items on the menu that your normal restaurants do not have and they are all delicious as well.  The seating is a bit too cozy but the wonderful food, wine and beer make up for it.  The bone marrow and the pork shoulders are the MUST TRY items on the menu.  I hope I get a chance to re-visit this place again."
"the buzz!  had to go.  pulled up to the bar and started talking to people right away.  40 minutes in we are still nursing drinks just so we can wait until at least we were hungry...  neighbors were wanting to share their beet salad (very good btw) and cheese.  We finally ordered a three cheese combo-all fantiastic and all gone.  then the bone marrow.  nice goody lardy saltiness.  then finally some beef tips for dinner.  that was really really good.  all in all, a great experience, good wine list, and friendly staff.  one, gosh we got home to and checked the receipt...  our one beer at the end called Saison Dupont was really good, but worth the $13 per glass kind of beer.  I would have had another glass of wine!"
"You had me at roasted bone marrow.  Where others are afraid, my taste buds boldly tread ahead. Pork galore...stuffed, fried olives, pork shoulder braised and presented with a toasted bread that got me eating carbs again with gusto.  Small plates that are served with duck eggs, truffle oil, goat cheese and other savory delights.Yes, the wait is long, the eating communal and the noise level high but your mouth will thank you."
"Salt-roasted beets with goat cheese (Amazing), Tuna Prosciutto (salty but awesome), Sopressata (I don't usually like cured meats but it was good), Pig's Tail (really good but don't get it if you're not down with sucking pork off of bones), Pork Shoulder (AMAZING, don't miss it), Sepia with cherry tomatoes (9.5/10).It's all pork; don't go if you're Kosher or Muslim.Communal tables; sort of loud but not too bad.Great desert.Amazing service.  You put your order in and the food comes when it is done."
"3.5 starswhat we had: - Beets: if all we ordered were the beets, this would have been a 5 star rating. highly recommended - Pig tail: tasty dish, 3.5-4 stars, good to try at least once, but probably wouldn't order again. - Bone Marrow: 3.5 stars, based on all the yelp reviews of the bone marrow here, we had to get it, but i was somewhat disappointed. - Pork Shoulder: 4 stars, this was a solid dish. very hearty and the meat was very tender. what we should've ordered: - after putting in our order, we see the table next to us being served a tasty looking turkey leg. the portion was pretty big and from what i remember of the price, it was a really good deal for the amount of food you get."
"For me, this restaurant is so over rated.. I ordered bone marrow (as people recommended), but it was not delicious at all.. I don't understand why people said that it was good.. It was totally tasteless and oily. Sorry to say this, but i wont go back there anymore just for the none marrow.. The pig ear was good though.. And also, we waited 2 hours to be seated..  and it was not worth at all"
"This is a Chicago must if you want a true culinary delight!!  Amazing food, service, and ambiance at a 1/4 of the cost- amazing value......hate to say it, but they could easily price their food much higher since in comparison it's by far 5 star!"
"We went at kind of an off time, and still, the service sucked. Our server left in the middle of our meal, and the new one had no idea what was going on. We ended up waiting a long time for everything, even as other tables got their food.About the food -- it was good, some very much so (milk-braised pork, e.g.) but not anything to really write home about."
"I'm a fan but I know my girlfriend isn't. Here's our different viewpoints. I really enjoyed the little tapas sized dishes, especially the smears. We got chicken thigh kebabs, pork neck bone smear (I think that was the name), and a couple of other dishes I forget the names of. Even though the tapas sizes are small, they are heavy in salt, grease (or lard for the smears) and meat. This is why I enjoyed the meal. My girlfriend though loves lighter, more veggie focused meals. So needless to say she got a little sick afterword. I'd go back again, but I'd have to drag my girlfriend kicking and screaming."
"Why update my five star review with another five star? Seriously it was just that good, one of the best meals I've had in recent memory....This place blows away its competition and in my mind the anti-Girl and the Goat. It's tucked away on Michigan ave, doesn't have a 3 month wait (the one downside to PP is it doesn't take reservations) and doesn't have the overhyped media exposure of a celebu-chef despite its Michelin status (Bib Gourmand award winner) which results in them blowing away my expectations every time (vs. being underwhelmed at G&G). We started with the pig ears, which were very good. Although it was a touch salty, it was very unique, thought out and well executed - like everything else I've had on this menu. We also tried the calamari, which was nothing like we expected. It was a light summer salad (think a seafood/couscous type salad, although there was no couscous), with the right combination of herbs, calamari, nuts and a few other things which we weren't sure what they were, but did not care. It was delicious, the right combination of textures and different fragrant herbs that really made this dish pop. Next we tried the bone marrow, which has been recommended by basically everyone. We both loved it, but wasn't sure if it was the marrow itself, or the rustic, artisinal fresh bread it came with which in itself was amazing. The bread turned out to be the perfect accompaniment to the best mussels I've ever had. The creme based sauce with panchetta and marjoram was so good, we were tempted to ask for a few shot glasses to make sure we were getting every last drop. Luckily the bread was a pretty damn good substitute. Finally, we got the pigs tails, which was the only repeat from my last review (and still as good as the first time around). We walked out of here for less than $30 a person (without booze) for one of the best meals I've had. It blew away my last trip to Publican and Girl & the Goat or any other restaurant in Chicago for that price point. It's going to be hard to not order the exact meal when I go back next time, but if PP has done anything its given me faith from straying from my personal favorites to try something new, without the fear of buyer's remorse once its all said and done."
"Went here for the first time tonight and had a lot of fun!A few things to note:-- The restaurant is small and mostly communal seating. It can be REALLY snug in that seating too and people can be big space hogs but the seats are easy to move in/out of once you squeeze in so that's a plus-- Plates are very small (which is a little shocking considering the price) so definitely get 2-4 to share. My group of three got 6 plates plus dessert and we were satisfied without feeling full-- The wine is really good but bottles are also pricey. We got the cheapest one...at $42. Yes, it was good but priceyDespite these notes, I was very happy with my food. The bone marrow was very good (be sure to add the sea salt and greens) and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes was the best dish we had all night. The pig ear was also delish and the mussels were a really nice too.The only food item we had that was a little disappointing was the prosciutto balls. They were tasty but very salty and just not as memorable as the other items. Dessert: you HAVE to get the Sicilian Iris brioche. It is warm and delicious. We all raved about it. We also got the Sfogliatelle Napoletane but it was tough and kind of cakey, which my friend was very disappointed in.Really, overall I was very happy with my meal and would definitely go back. But beware, I doubt they can accommodate big groups."
"Just tucked away off the ever tourist-popular Michigan Avenue is The Purple Pig, a true diamond in the rough.  All I'll say is that I wish I knew about this place a lot sooner.  It's a great place to grab a nice glass of wine and nosh on some pork liver patte and marinated roasted eggplant (two dishes that I would highly recommend).  The menu is relatively easy to navigate, but if you're not sure what to get feel free to ask the staff.  They are some of the most helpful and friendly restaurant workers around.  Whatever brings you to the Miracle Mile, this is the perfect place to go and relax...and on an affordable budget."
"a little pricey, but everything was good, not your typical menu"
"i came to the purple pig because saveur magazine told me the mortadella spread is one of the top dishes to eat right now in america.  it MOST DEFINITELY IS.  in my imagination, mortadella is the proletariat meat of choice in a dingy, italian deli -- a ground-up combination of fatty pork fat and other unspeakable pig by-products.  i don't really want to know what it is, but spread on top of french bread, topped with baby argula and pistachios, and drizzled with the sweetest balsamic reduction, it reeks of class and meets all of my unreasonably high expectations.it tastes almost like baloney -- a really fancy, savory yet delicate version of the pedestrian ""lunchmeat.""  it is a bit grainy, mostly smooth, and salty and ... it seemed so obvious!  sweet and savory, fresh and earthy -- why didn't i think of the combination?!  during this time of contemplation, my fingers developed a mind of their own and cleaned up all remnants of mortadella and balsamic on my plate.  i remember looking longingly at my empty placemat after i finished off the last piece and briefly contemplated asking for another order.  ""you CAN'T, amy,"" i thought to myself.  ""it's made of pig fat and more fat and forgodssake, it's freaking balsamic reduction!  it's not difficult to make, and you're probably just really hungry and hence exaggerating how delicious it is.""  and so i convinced myself not to order any more.  mistake.  how do i know?  it's 11:43 PM on a saturday night, i'm alone in my bed, and i can't get the thought of ground italian sausage smear out of my head.in my mind, i'm already back at the purple pig, this time with 3 orders of the mortadella spread in front of me.  i'm sipping on a glass of wine and sitting in a corner.  the crowd is effervescent -- but i'm by myself and i can't hear them because the mortadella is speaking to me and overcoming my senses.  ""listen to me,"" the sirens whisper.  ""order us and gaze at us and chew and throw your head back in flavor induced ecstasy.  we demand it.  and don't think about what we are made of.""i'll be back.  my sanity demands it."
"LOVE. EVERYTHING. This place is perfection, with the exception of the dorky tourist crowd that must be heading over from the Intercontinental and Marriott. But that's not PP's fault."
"AMAZING!  Seriously, AMAZING AMAZING food.  I was completely blown away.  With a name like ""Purple Pig"" (I'm from out of town), I actually thought it was some sort of BBQ joint (sorry).  So I wasn't sure what to expect when some colleagues of mine decided to dine here for lunch. The service was fantastic.  Our server helped us make some really great decisions for lunch.  A few items that really stood out for me: the smear!  Specifically, the crushed tomato smear on top of the toasted garlicky bread.  It was out of this world good - so of course, we had to get another order.  Also, the octopus.  I was a little uncertain at first, thinking it was going to be chewy, but it had a meaty texture and delicious flavor.  Again, amazing!  Also had an assortment of veggie dishes, razor clams, the breaded pork - fresh and succulent flavors.  Everything tasted so good...I wasn't disappointed with one bite.I can't wait to get back to Chicago and try some more dishes!Be forewarned - the dishes are all meant to be shared.  So, make sure and go with at least 2 but ideally 3 people."
"Yum, yum, yum! I didn't know what to expect when I heard the name, but a friend recommended this place to me -- and I'm so glad I went! Everything we ordered was de-lish and the perfect serving size! The only real complaint I have is the wait and the lack of arm-space. We waited at least an hour on a weekday only to get two seats at the bar, and we had to bump our way through the crowd to get to them. Our bartenders/servers made it up to us though with their outstanding service and friendliness! Also, the fact that it's crowded shows just how good this place really is, right? It is pricey for food and drinks, but I can't wait to go back!"
"One of my fave places in Chicago! The bone marrow is the best! Also, the pork lion, brussell sprouts (no really, its good), and the chicken thigh. They also have a great, fresh variety of cheeses and meats. The desserts are okay. There is a great alcohol menu. The service is as attentive as it can be. They are always busy and its a small seating area. The bus boys are always helpful and clear everything quickly so you can usually get someone's attention. The restuarant is small. So there is often a wait."
"after hearing nothing but good things, we decided to give it a try late sunday night. the rumors are true; this place is terrific! our server Collin walked us through the menu and helped ease me into the idea of some foods i would have never thought to try! the ""JLT"" and the milk braised pork shoulder changed my life. the cocktails were delightful and we left wishing we lived in the city and could frequent more often. we will definitely be back!!"
"2 words....""SICILIAN IRIS"".....Those of you who of had it know exactly what im talking about....those who havent.....TRY IT!!!"
Yummmmm!!! I could eat the brioche every single day of my life. Friend loved the milk braised pork shoulder. A definite Chicago fav!
"food was delicate though each portion was small. girls were happy about that but guys got to be careful, haha."
"Ready or not? Decidedly not! I ate at The Purple Pig for the first time yesterday, with some out-of-town family ready for a pork frenzy. While The Purple Pig offers some good food, the service and servers ranged from indifferent to rude. As we were standing in line to leave--yes, a line leaving--one server physically pushed us in to each other (think linebacker). No apologies, he actually got in our faces when we asked him not to push.  His confrontational behavior was sadly underscored by a manager in-charge who was not available and a floor manager who excused the server's behavior based on the (admittedly) crowded working conditions. Clearly the folks at this eatery aren't ready for their Michelin Bib Gourmand rating and think it's our privilege to dine with them. There are always marvelous choices in Chicago and you can easily do better than The Purple Pig. Blech."
"We had some friends in town from England who were staying downtown and wanted to meet up for lunch.  We very rarely head to the Mag Mile area so it's always hard to think of where to meet up.  After reading good Yelp reviews, we suggested the Purple Pig.  Overall the food was very good.  I enjoyed everything I ate.  One of our diners did not eat meat (she did eat seafood) and had no problem finding things to eat.  The prices are a bit high ($19 for three cheeses!?) but I guess that's to be expected in this neighborhood.  We had our 4 month old baby with us, and we were able to snag an outdoor table for 4, which worked out well.  We did have to fold the stroller and stash in a different place because the patio is tight.  Inside is very loud and all communal tables so not very baby-friendly.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive and had good recommendations.  I would definitely return if I were in the area."
"worth the wait.  the food was great, well most... the sepia was a bit bland and chewy but the pork shoulder amazing we ordered another, the octopus delicious, the kale salad we ordered another and the veggie sides... you must get the brussel sprouts flash fried to perfection, the beets with goat cheese, i mean all just ridiculous including the desserts.  took some business colleagues and yes they told us over an hour wait and they sent us to grab drinks at the palomar nearby but they called us to come back within 40 minutes.   go go go !"
"I frequent Chicago often , at least once a month if not more often. I was daring myself to go to the Purple Pig, despite the small seating area and feeling somewhat intimidated about being in a ""trendy"" Chicago restaurant. Well, I dove right in and I so did not regret it. The waitstaff could not have been friendlier and because it is such close quarters with your fellow diners, they  were just as friendly. On to the food, I had the calimari appetizer (not your usual batter dipped ) it was fantastic. I ordered a lovely red wine with the assistance of the waitress, then the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.... OMG, awesome... I felt like a grown woman. The prices aren't prohibitive as well. Will be going back this weekend!"
"This is a great spot, I only wish I wasn't traveling by myself when I came here. Luckily there's a bar area so it's pretty easy to eat on your own, but the menu is a lot of small plates so coming in a group would be a lot better. There is pretty good seating for groups too - high-top tables for 6-8 people.Everything sounded good, but I just went with the prosciutto balls to start (which were good, but not amazing) and the turkey leg, which was really good. I love lentils and that was the side for the turkey leg, but it wasn't really what I was expecting -- just a few lentils and they seemed until cooked - they were sort of scattered along the leg, not an actual side of lentils.There was a good selection of wines, but I felt like the prices of many were steep, $14+. I had one for $9 and it was pretty good. The service was fast in the beginning, and the food came really fast, but the waitress sort of disappeared at the end and had to track her down.Overall, a good spot, and super crowded, even on a Monday night."
"after wanting to try the Purple Pig for some time, I finally made it on a saturday afternoon (~4pm) when there was no wait time.  and that was a good thing because seriously, I cannot understand why people wait 2 hours to eat at this restaurant.there's nothing really wrong with the food, it was just underwhelming given the price range and reputation of the Purple Pig.  we shared the roast beets with goat cheese, bone marrow smear, meatball slider, mussels, and affogato for dessert.  The affogato was by far the best thing we ate (although I do LOVE affogato and it is very difficult to screw up).  the meatball slider was really good as well, especially considering how different it was from the rest of the menu.that being said, I thought the beets were kind of meh (not worth paying that much for something I can cook equally well at home), the portion size of the mussels was very small even for ""small plates"" and the bone marrow was TERRIBLE.  even though I'm somewhat of an adventurous eater bone marrow is not something I would normally order, but decided to try it after so many Yelp reviews said how good it was.  the few people who have pointed out how incredibly oily and gross the marrow is are dead on; it would have been barely palatable if the bread it is served with is not ALREADY smothered in butter/oil (same goes for the bread served with the mussels -- plain bread would be nice).  overall, the food was SO heavy and saturated with fat that I spent the rest of the day feeling really sick.  not sick as in like ""omg, I ate too many breadsticks at olive garden"" sick, but sick as in like ""did I get food poisoning? I might vomit"" sick.  not a pleasant experience overall."
"Great menu, very different food..... awesome salted beets with pistacios and the price is right. The wine is great. The atmosphere is good but not perfect. Lighting is dim but there is a little attitude in the place so thats why the 4 stars but that is expected it is off michigan ave."
"First time visit for a late lunch on NYE, surprisingly it was still busy so we sat at the bar...got lucky and sat right in front of the chefs cooking and expediting orders.Loved everything we ate, each dish was better than the last.  One of the head chefs, Jaime, was nice enough to provide recommendations and walk us thru the dishes. Especially liked the pork shoulder, pigs ear, neck bone gravy, and fried Brussels sprouts. Loved the whole experience and will definitely be back."
"Come to the Purple Pig if you want yummy food served with a side of smug.I came here on Saturday around 2pm for lunch and was very surprised by how busy it was on a rainy afternoon at a late hour (for lunch). There were 2 of us, so we only had to wait a couple of minutes to be seated. Unfortunately, there was another party of 4 that they sat right next to us. Because these are communal tables, my lunch companion was seated across the table from me and we were sandwiched tightly in between 2 other parties of strangers. Not ideal. Fortunately, the party of 4 decided this wasn't the ideal arrangement and left, so we could move to more normal seats at the end of the table. Throughout all this musical chairs business, the hostess was kind of rude. It's like she couldn't possibly understand why we were all uncomfortable when there were 12 adults sitting at a table clearly meant for 10. When we all got situated, she slammed the menus on the table with a loud thud and walked away. Okaaaayyyy.We ordered the meatball sliders, porchetta panini, and prosciutto bread balls. We tried to order the potato croquettes, but they were having problems with the griddle or something. The meatball sliders were good. The panini was great. I could've done without the prosciutto bread balls. We also ordered a half-bottle of an Italian chardonnay, and it was so good that I asked the waiter if he could write down the name for me. He responded by telling me that the winery is the second most popular winemaker in Italy. Whoa, dude! Try not to hurt yourself! I think I just heard your eyes roll! Sorry I'm not an expert on the leading makers of Italian chardonnay. Actually, I didn't even know Italians made chardonnay until I ordered that half-bottle of wine. After a lesson on Italy's wine economy, I got the name, which is great because I can go buy the wine at Binny's instead of coming back to the Purple Pig.I might come back because the food was good, but if I do, I'll make reservations and I'll pray the service is better. And I'll study up on my wine trivia."
Best roasted bone marrow since Paris; our other favorites were the eggplant w/goat cheese and the home-made sausage.  Excellent wine list and service was great.  Crowded; get your name on the list and ask for a wine recommendation; plan on an hour wait.
"I'm with Meena. I was ready to be underwhelmed by this place based on location and name and specialty (I don't dine on swine). But the Dames who Dine had selected this as our next gathering place, so I was ready to give it a shot. Oh, Dear Dame Ronnie - thank you for picking The Purple Pig. Why am I grateful? Let me tell ye yelpers: 1. Antonio. While we were disappointed to have a 90 minute wait at 6:30 on a Wed night (after being told they don't take reservations and we should be fine), we were lucky to be waited on during our wait and during dinner (by special request!) by Antonio. A very nice, very attentive, knowledgeable lad. He was super. 2. The space. It's small but very cozy. The bathrooms are nicely-sized and impeccably clean. The tables are warm and seats comfortable. The ""Waiting Space"" they told us about was pretty disappointing because it's basically the hallway by the bathrooms and a door that exits to the building it's in so there was a lot of passersby and exiters -- but overall, a very nice space. 3. The wine. I didn't peruse the wine list for more than a minute, but I know this much: there's a range of wines from an affordability and grape standpoint. And whatever we got (can't remember but I do remember, thanks to my lingering headache, that I had too much) was delicious and fairly-priced. 4. But let's get to what this is all about: the food, bitches. As someone who doesn't touch pork, I figured my options would be limited - but they weren't. We ordered a few sides that make me aching for more: whipped feta with cucumber -- yes, I would roll in a bathtub full of you and then give myself a cat bath -- soooooo good. Also, the eggplant with goat cheese? Yes, please. Superb. Thanks to the chica waiting in line for the lady-can who recommended it. And probs my fave - the shaved Brussels sprouts with Parmesan. My god. The other dames noshed on the cured meat sampler. Not a trace was left so if you're into that, you'd probably be interested in trying this place. The night made for a slight dent in my piggy bank but that probably had more to do with devouring wine while we waited than anything else. I'm eager to go back soon with my husband so I can pig out properly. Very happy to have a quality dining place that's within my budget in the tourist village of Chicago ....I'll definitely be back."
"Went here on a Friday night after work to see what all the buzz was about.Overall, this is a good attempt at the cured meats/small plate/cheese concept, and has the makings of being really good.We arrived at around 6pm, and it was already getting crowded.  The space is quite small, and I can see that there are probably seating issues later in the evenings, but we did manage to score a nice, two person table in a corner. The decor is warm, and I particularily liked the tilework on the booth wall.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server was well informed on the different cured meat, cheese, and wine choices, and helped us select a delicious spread to chow on prior to sampling some of the small plates.The pig's ear was decent, and the Wagyu steak was tasty.  Not spectacular, but definitely decent.Dessert was also a big plus.  We had a fried doughnutty thing with cheese and chocolate filling, as well as the butterscotch pudding.   Both were delicious!Overall, I think the minor issues should be panned out soon.  We had no trouble finding the restaurant, as there is signage right off of Michigan Ave.  Perhaps this is a new addition.  This is a cool joint in an area that I almost never frequent, so 4 stars it is!"
"I was in Chicago visiting with some friends the weekend of the Cardinals/Cubs series and one evening we decided to stop into The Purple Pig for a bottle of wine. We were seated at the bar and had a view of the kitchen, we really were not sure of what we wanted and asked our bartender Dominic for a suggestion, I really wish I could recall the wine that he had suggested because it was great. We only stayed long enough to split a bottle however we enjoyed some idle conversation with our bartender who made several suggestions of other places to go. Overall we had a good time that evening. The Monday before leaving town we also found ourselves on Michigan Avenue with about an hour to kill so we decided to return to The Purple Pig around 3pm for drinks, again the service was great however both times we had stopped by this small restaurant was packed, seems to be very popular. While we didn't get a chance to sample any of the food I would like to try it on our next trip to town."
"My husband, children, and I stumbled upon The Purple Pig by accident on Memorial Day around lunch time, so we had no expectations.  We were able to sit outside and enjoy the wonderful weahter.  Service was prompt and attentive, and our waitress didn't seem to mind the fact we had our children along, although the place clearly caters to an adult crowd.  The foos was fantastic: fresh flavors offered in original preparations.  The chicken leg kebob was a sizable serving, and the panini were tasty and filling despite the small size.  Try the farro and ricotta custard with chocolate sauce: a nice twist on a traditional peasant dessert."
"Unlike the bay area, this restaurant closes at 4, which is great because our plane got in late. We ordered cheese and meat plates, along with other tapas and drank lots of wine, just like their logo, cheese swine and wine. The atmosphere was hip and up beat."
"Been here a couple of times, and it's a reliable place for good food on the Magnificent Mile.  Perhaps not the best small plates restaurant I've ever been to, but the vibe is great, and some of the dishes are awesome.  The crispy pig ears are AWESOME.  When you try it, you would never know or think it was even pig ears.  All the other dishes I've tried there have been hit or miss, but even the ones that were a miss weren't all that bad...just nothing that ever stood out.  Since I (part-time) live in the area, I'd definitely go back there if I were in the mood for that type of food and just don't feel like driving, making a far walk, or taking the train anywhere, but it's not somewhere I'm rushing to go back to.  Try to go there on an off-day or off-hour as waits tend to be quite long if you're there at peak hours."
Absolutely delicious yet relatively inexpensive.
"Phenomenal!    There is not much that has not been said!   Their wine list is European, extensive and moderately priced.   They tout over 50 bottles under 40 bucks.    We had the roasted beets with goat cheese which seemed to be incredibly popular and was very good, but not the star of the show.   We also had the lardo crostini (fatty, smoky, salty, deliciousness), the crispy pig's ear, which definitely was the star of the show, the mussels with pancetta was fantastic and the second runner up is the balsamic braised pigs tails.   I certainly did not know what to expect when ordering them but to my surprise it was a sweet, ham-y delight.   We also had cheeses which were fantastic served with their mustard flavored chutney and bread.   I don't often comment on the bread but the bread that accompanies their dishes is charred out the outside and in the center it is slightly soft flavored with olive oil, perfect for dipping up anything!    Just a fantastic meal and I have a hard time believing anything on the menu is not great.   I will return to test that theory, however."
Where do I begin? I am in love with this place. Lets start with the deviled eggs...amazing! Get the early because they run out. The panini with salami and goat cheese is amazing. The pig tail is something to try. I did on a dare and I loved it. Did I mention those eggs?? Order two orders. Also if you are not a brussel sprouts lover ou will love the way they make theirs. Be adventurous. I guess a lot of things change on their menu. There is a guy that works at the front whose name is Joe. He is one of the best hosts or managers (not sure) that I have dealt with at a restaurant. Super friendly and knowledgeable. Also this place gets very crowded almost every night and especially in the summer. The fact is this was my second attempt to get in. The last time was in the summer and the wait was about 45 minutes. We couldn't wait.  Ask about the wine classes they offer. The couple next to our group emerged from the basement of this place after having a class and they raved about it. That being said there is an EXCELLENT wine selection. Joe the guy I mentioned was great at helping us choose.Zero parking here. Also you will be sitting pretty close to people. Elbow to elbow at big tables so be prepared for that unless you get lucky and snag a small table or you want to sit at the bar. Either way this should be on your to eat list while the food and the service is still top notch. Wish they would open one further north with easier parking.I would eat there 3 times a week!
"What a great slightly-hidden venue... we made a short-notice decision for a late lunch there while we were in the area.After getting on the 60-minute waiting list, we were seated quicker than expected. There were 4 of us in our group. None of us had ever been there before. Keep in mind when making your order that this is, basically, a tapas restaurant. We ordered 3 cheeses (Fontina, Blue Cave man and the Manchego); 3 from the cured meat menu (there was a jamon serrano, tartufo and the fennel-infused one that I can't remember the name of...); the fried pigs ear; the 'Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta' (YUM!!); Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans (which was salty, this is the only one that I'd intentionally skip next time,,, and we finished with the ""Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic""(what a great treat, the balsamic gave it a nice sweet finish, kind of dessert-ish). Everything else on the menu looked great, very creative and we look forward to another opportunity to return...Do not go if you are in a rush or are looking for privacy. Most of the seating is on long tables. Reservations are not accepted... be aware!The hostess and server were great. We were very impressed with the menu knowledge and the honesty from the server."
"I give The Purple Pig 5 stars on each of the 3 occasions I have been there, for a grand total of 15 stars in 2010.  Sure you could order something that wouldn't normally satisfy your ordinary taste bud preferences, but the joy of The Purple Pig is that you discover a new taste that you didn't know existed, or that you didn't fathom you would like.  I have gotten the Braised Pork Shoulder (which melts in your mouth) every time as an anchor in case the more adventurous options are a little too adventurous.  Thankfully, I haven't had to rely on the Pork Shoulder to bear the load."
"In town for work, I searched out restaurants near my hotel and found The Purple Pig. It's always a bit awkward to eat in public by oneself, but I had a nice time sitting at the bar - the bartenders were super nice, as were the folks sitting around me.I had a delicious rock shrimp appetizer -- very simple and refreshing -- and waygu sirloin tips with asparagus for an entree. Both were reasonably priced, decent-sized portions. I also had a delicious glass of wine (""Fidelis""). Overall a very positive experience! Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."
"After hearing so much hype and wanting to go here forever, finally visited on a Monday evening.  I was surpirsed at how packed it was for a Monday.It took a while for our waiter to come to us and as soon as she arrived, she apologized for being late and complained that one of her tables was being ridiculous and didn't know what they were doing.  Here's a tip, never talk bad about your other customers, especially at a place as esteemed as Purple Pig. We ordered roasted bone marrow smear, fried chorizo stuffed olives, milk braised pork shoulder, octopus with salsa verde and potatoes.  Everything was pretty good.  It was my first time trying bone marrow so I can't compare to other places, but the smear was pretty good.  It wasn't offputting in any way, just tasted like extra oily butter.  The bread that came with the smear was really good and they bring you more if you ask!The fried olives were good, the batter covered the olives consistently and had a nice crunch.  The octopus was refreshing and didn't have that briny taste that you get if the seafood isn't cooked properly.  There wasn't anything bad about the pork shoulder but there wasn't anything memorable.  You can pass on this dish and it's difficult to share anyways because it is just one chunk of meat.  Not sure how this fits in the menu as their philosophy seems to be more sharing style.Overall the food was pretty good, the service not so much.  I don't know if we were biased because our waiter talked bad about one of her other tables but she just didn't check in on us, we had to wave down a different waiter for water and for our check.  When she was present, she just wasn't very nice.  Yeah, I get that you're super busy but so are most other restaurants in Chicago and they still manage to have good service."
"One of the best meals I have ever had in my life. I'm going to be back in Chicago in January, and I'm DEFINITELY going back to this place. AWESOME!"
"The Pig is a little piece of North-side paradise hidden on the Miracle Mile. Only 70 seats or so in the place had us waiting over an hour. We sipped a carafe of wine in the odd little hallway. Once seated we were side-by-side at one of the massive communal tables. The food was so so good. Our standout by far was the bone marrow. We also had the shaved brussel sprouts (awsum) and some other odds and ends. We weren't wild about the dessert which was almost like rice pudding. When we got the bill, we couldn't believe how cheap it was!Fun fact, I'm pretty sure there was a ""professional"" working the room. She had on this dramatic fur coat and kept coming/leaving with different gentlemen. I definitely plan to make it back here for a work-week lunch or post-work dinner!"
"We were treated so disrespectful by making us wait for over 40 minutes. The issue was not the wait but seeing other people arriving and getting tables right away and when I asked what was happening the dumb hostess said that we needed to wait another 20 minutes cuz there was no table available ""course not she sat somebody else"". She then tried to find one cuz she was embarrassed she left us there like idiots. We left to find a different place where  they appreciate our business. This happened Sunday May fifth around 7 pm incase any personal on duty didn't notice."
We had the fried pigs ear! Delish!!!! Sounds gross but was supppppper yummy!
"The concept of this place drove me in. Swine, wine and cheese = what's not to love there? But, this place gets 2 stars because the food is not good. I tried: Fried Pig's Ear (leaves terrible after-taste; smells foul after fried egg sets in); Roasted Bone Marrow (bland and ultra-oily); Braised Pork Shoulder (this wasn't bad, but flavor components were a bit odd); Wagyu Sirloin w/Marrow (again, odd taste). While I really appreciate the eclectic menu and wine list, I left feeling this place tries too hard to reinvent the wheel on flavors. The dishes either tasted funky, didn't mesh well, or missed on technique. Especially with the Roasted Bone Marrow. This is a delicacy and not easy to find (even at high-end restaurants in Chicago), but the marrow just wasn't executed well. Too oily, and far too bland. I wish this place would have kept the menu more simple and focused on the true flavor of pork, but I suppose I understand the creative intention and ambition here... The service is rushed, and not very friendly. I'll go back only because I enjoy the wine selection. You won't find any California's on the list (when I was there last there were none), but the French, Italian, and Chilean wines are really worth trying."
"Very popular place!  I like the small portions, gave us chance t try a variety of dishes.  Fun food."
"The noise level here is quite high and the seats and tables are a bit close together - quite cozy indeed - but well worth it! We went here on a Tuesday night - still very busy - sorry, no reservations!This restaurant offers a unique culinary experience.The menu is full of unusual offerings, and everything we tried was wonderful! Our server was very attentive and suggested a few dishes that were their best sellers.We ordered two glasses of wine - again, suggested by our server. The taste of the wine was exactly what we were looking for- less dry with a hint of cherries!We ordered and shared - 1) The Tuscan kale and romaine Caesar salad with hard boiled quail egg - was as expected, tasty with a good portion to share. The kale was crisp and the Caesar dressing was perfect, no overkill with the salad dressing!2) Jamon Serrano - is a type of dry cured spanish ham- served raw in thin slices- melt in your mouth!3) Roasted bone marrow with herbs - Very, very rich, this is not something you would want to eat everyday or weekly for that matter. Along with the bone marrow there was an added side salad of coriander/onions. Delish! Marrow is an acquired taste though- it has a subtle buttery, roasted flavor to it...not for everyone, but my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The point is to slather this stuff on to bread - yup, kinda like butter!4) ""JLT"" with fried hen egg and lemon aioli - this was my favorite of the night. Again, VERY rich - it came on half a bun with a piece of crispy fried pork with lemon aioli- there was also just enough greens on top of the crispy pork to balance it off and the real kicker - the fried egg! I don't know how to exactly describe it...but it was a heavenly combination! My friend and I couldn't get over how good it was. The flavors just meld together like perfection!  I don't know if I would order that dish for myself - I would definitely want to share that one! It probably has as many calories as two big macs! Quite the experience! Awesome! I would definitely order this dish again. Explosion of flavors on your tastebuds!!!5) Lastly, we ordered dessert - Lemon Panna cotta - DELICIOUS, it had the texture of pudding with a light lemon burst in between bites.I heard through the grapevine that  the braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes is a superb dish as well, but we were too stuffed to order anything else - perhaps I will try this dish the next time I come here- which will be very soon!I've passed by this restaurant numerous times and never thought about having a meal here. After this experience, I will have to let all my friends know about it! I'm so glad we went here and would recommend this restaurant to anyone! I'll be back soon Purple Pig!"
"Was in Chicago for business and saw this place from the hotel window.  I was very impressed.  The wine list all ""old world"" no US wines.  Good selection of value priced Bordeaux and Burgandy.  THe ""grazing"" style menu was very nice.  The Beet and Goat cheese salad could have been turned into a sucessful entre, the milk fed pork shoulder was fantastic, tried the roasted bone marrow but I was really a fan - others raved about it.  Best part was the service, knowledgable, friendly, quick with a recommendation, readily available.  Kudo's to Alexa who was our server as she was one of the best I've ever dealt with.Overall Great Resturant, worth the detour."
"We went when it was very busy. Bartender was awesome and so nice to our teen daughter.We tried lots of different foods and everything was awesomeThis place is small crowded and loud, but oh so fun,Our daughter's favorite was the fluff/nutella/banana panini!"
"The food was ok, however the atmosphere was noisy and hard to get a table.  More of a bar-type of atmosphere than a restaurant.  The drinks were good, but it's not a place for a hardy dinner.  The service was good and friendly with suggestions that let us try a large variety of things.Antipasti: - Broccoli w roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette = inconsistent in taste, some were very good and some tasted more sour.- Salt roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette = sweet, very good.Cured meats: - Prosciutto di san daniele = tasted ok, but nothing special.- Tartufo = a salami, tasted ok but nothing special.Cheese:- podda = a hard cheese, tasted ok but not what i really liked.- delice de bourgogne = smooth, mild taste.  Tasted ok.- blu di bufala = blue cheese from buffalo milk, more mild tasting than most other blue cheese.  Tasted ok.A la Plancha:- Octopus w green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde = didn't like it.  Too acidic and sour.- Porko bucco w soft polenta and gremolata = very tender, good if you like tomato-based sauce.- Milk braised pork shoulder w mashed potatoes = very tender, good if you like more gravy-like sauce.Fried items:- Pigs ear w crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg = inconsistent in taste, some too salty and some not.  A lot of it just tasted like crispy bits.Wine: - tintero ""sori gramella"" moscato d'asti from italy = very good sparkling white wine, fruity and light.Dessert:sicilian iris = not sure in how it is supposed to taste, but too me it was too doughy for dessert.  The chocolate inside was good though.caramel ice cream = not any different from any other ice cream, just had caramel pieces on it."
"I am really surprised at the good reviews this has received. I arrived at the restaurant with my girlfriend on a Sunday afternoon. We casually strolled in as we happened to be in the area. Our waitress came by shortly after we sat down, and asked us if we wanted some wine. We did not. After this point I think we waited about 20 minutes for our waitress to show up again. No luck, so we asked another waiter who was attending the tables on either side of us (but not us for some reason) to please get the attention of our waitress if he sees her. He scoffed and said ""I will just take you order"". We gave him our order, and again another 30 minutes for our food to come out while the tables on either side of us were being served and attended. I honestly don't remember the food that I had except the MIlk Braised Pork Shoulder. It was ridiculously salty and looked like something I would be served in an airplane (the mashed potatoes under the pork shoulder in a small square pan). After a disappointing wait, for a disappointing meal, our table never got cleared. Again we saw tables directly next to us getting cleared, but we had to get someone's attention again just to have our table cleared.My family is from the caribbean and grew up eating pork. For a place that pays homage to pork, it does a truly miserable job. There are plenty of better restaurants worth your time and money. However, if you like to be treated like garbage, and eat sub-par pork dishes this is the place for you. Although if thats the case, I would probably still recommend Dick's Last resort over Purple Pig."
"Wow! So good!! The brussels sprouts were fantastic, and I had bone marrow for the first time. Who knew it would be so delicious? The service was excellent, and my only complaint would be the shared tables. I had hoped that getting there at 11:45 on a Tuesday would make for a less crowded table, but no such luck."
"We had heard good things, but we were nervous about a long wait. Great surprise. We were seated immediately. Great server, plenty of attention. It is noisy, but if you sit next to your friends instead of across it is OK.On to the food. The Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda was excellent. I would order it again and again, The chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes & tzatziki was the best chicken we have EVER had. I am not a big chicken fan, but my wife is. DO NOT miss this. The octopus with acini di pepe & swiss chard was one of the best I have had, but the portion was so small, I was irritated and this one item cost them their 4th star. I don't think it was a mistake, in fact the server made a point of saying that the items in the ""a la plancha"" section were larger portions. Our serving was two small bites. Still, I would order again, We also had the endive and arugula with Covadonga bleu cheese & orange. Complete failure. Everything soft and wilted. No crunch and not very tasty. Deserts were strangely uninteresting so we didn't try anything.Prices for food reasonable, but wine a little pricy.We will definitely return."
"Given the prevalence of dining opportunities in Chicago, I found it offensive that they don't accept table reservations. I have dined here before and it is not worth waiting an hour and a half for a table. In short, you are better off taking your dining cash to another place that values your time and allows one to make a table reservation like the rest of civilized society.The hype is just that, hype."
"The Purple Pig reminds me of a tapas place...in a good way.  The portions are enough for a group to share and try various dishes.  My group tried the octopus, prosciutto bread balls, beets w/goat cheese, pig ears, jamon serrano, chorizo stuffed olives, bone marrow, and pork shoulder.  All dishes were good.  The most favorite was the jamon serrano - it comes with a duck egg atop and the blend of flavors was really good.  The least favorite was the beets w/goat cheese - there were too many beets and it overpowered the dish (though, if you are a beet lover you may favor this dish).On top of the food being good, the service was as well.  Upon arriving, my friend and I had to wait for our party so we had a some wine at the bar.  The bartender was very knowledgeable on the various wines offered and allowed us to taste prior to ordering a glass.  The food came out in a timely fashion and the waitress was attentive.The tables are communal so if you do not like the idea of possibly sitting next to a stranger it's something to think about."
"The crispy brussels sprouts blew my mind. I would come back just for that. They were sprinkled with a touch lemon juice which took those brussels sprouts to a whole new level of awesomeness. Besides the amazing brussels sprouts; I would recommend coming early (especially on a weekend) but not during a normal meal hour either. The restaurant is small and cramped. I had my reasonably sized purse hanging on my chair and the servers kept running into in. It was annoying for me (and for the servers too, I'm sure) but there was nowhere else to put it because we were sitting at one of those community tables - which annoy me as well. I didn't find one of those purse hooks under the table. Not sure if they have them or not, but would be a good idea. There is really nowhere to hang out as you wait for your table, but, if the weather is decent, there is plenty of room outside the restaurant that is out of the way of the mob of tourists with their huge shopping bags.It's pretty refreshing, actually, to have a place like this to go to on Michigan Ave. It's kind of slim pickins' over there.We tried a bunch of things, but the stand-outs were the milk braised pork, the crispy brussels sprouts, the roasted bone marrow and the fried pig ear. I did not enjoy the caponata. It tasted like it was made with ketchup. So skip that if you know what a good caponata tastes like.Bottom line: come early, get the crispy brussels sprouts and don't bring a huge purse."
"The name makes me smile as does the eats! This is the perfect place for a cozy get together, sipping one of the many wines, nibbling on cheese and chatting away."
"I couldn't pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the server was very helpful and took the time to patiently answer my (stupid) questions.  The food was good, especially the winter squash arancini and the butternut squash antipasto dish.  The salami panini was just okay - I should have gone for the Grilled Cheese of the Week.   And a big yes to the brioche dessert with chocolate hazelnut ice cream.My one caveat is that this place isn't ideal for lunch.  The portion sizes, the way the menu is organized, are more conducive for dinner when you are having wine.  The food is really just morsels to nibble on while you're drinking.  But if you can't booze at lunch, then it's not all that fulfilling.  I'll go back for dinner, if I can get a table."
"Absolutely delicious... if you get a table.The purple pig is one of a kind in Chicago. Its food is a delicious fusion of basque and southern France cuisine with meat on almost every dish.I have eaten here about 4 times and ordered different dishes every time. The food comes in small appetizer sizes no matter what you order. My wife and I usually order 4 to 5 items and share them with a bottle of wine and it is plenty of food for both of us.You mustn't miss the bone marrow. Such a simple dish but executed perfectly. I've tried holding myself from ordering every time and I have failed.If you are a health nut this might not be the place for you. You might need some Lipitor after you are done but it will be well worth it.The only problem with this place is the wait. Fridays and Saturdays for dinner are impossible unless you go late night. They take no reservations and the seating is first come first server unless you get lucky and snatch some bar seats. One time we were told the wait would be 2 hours, we said ""0K we'll wait"". Then we headed to a nearby movie theater and had our table waiting for us when we got back."
"As a foodie and picky about service, I'm a tough win. This was one of the best overall dining experiences I've had. Last wed, 6pm-yes it was packed but two seats were open at the bar down by the cooks. Not the seats for everyone, but I like watching the open kitchen. The owner was running the show and was great to chat with throughout dinner. He obviously loves his work. Every employee was completely service oriented from the hostesses to our server Kelly (who thankfully knew the menu like the back of her hand) to the food runners and bus men. Menu is well balanced with richness and light/bright dishes so mix them up. The only 'criticism' I can offer is that when so many dishes are superb, the ones that are merely very good seem like a let down. Go now."
"I love this place.  I love small plate concepts, I love wine, I love cozy!  We stopped in Sat at 5 and was surprised how crowded it was already.  But get a table pretty fast.  Ordered a fun bottle of rose.  When it came to the food, I wanted to order it all but we settled on the pig's ears, octopus, bone marrow and beets.  The pig ear was crunchy but needed a little more heat in the peppers.  Bone marrow...how can you go wrong?  The two together were a bit too heavy/fatty, better to order them on separate trips.  The octopus and beets were tasty.  All the food that came out around us looked good too.The prices were just right,  we spent a total of $65 for two of us for 4 dishes and the bottle of wine.  If this place was in my hood, I would be there once a week.  Being downtown, I can only hope that I will have reasons to be there more often."
Not much to add to the nearly 800 4-star reviews here.My stand out fave was surprisingly the octopus. And I'm not usually an octopus fan. It was cooked to tender perfection. Probably the best I've ever had.
"the purple pig wrapped up in a pretty little bundle?  small plates, communal seating, long hours, and located on the mag mile!highlights: roasted bone marrow with herbs (creamy and luscious, paired perfectly with herbs/capers), pig's ear with kale, peppers, and egg (adore the crispy texture mixed with the gooey egg yoke and acidic 1-2 punches of pickled peppers), and chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes (incredibly juicy and worked well with the crisp potatoes dipped in tzatziki).disappointments: braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (the meat was very tender but was extremely salty to the point it was inedible and was returned to the kitchen and replaced with another dish) and meatball sliders (lacked flavor and was a little off-putting being served on brioche buns).i'd actually rate this a 3.5 based on those lackluster dishes, but rounded up given their overall charm and kind staff.  looking forward to another visit to try their other dishes. i'm now craving their fried pig's ear dish... nom nom nom..."
"Fantastic. Personally, I thought this was much better than both the Bristol and the Publican in terms of food.  Everything was really, really excellent. Nice ambiance, too. I would recommend the pork blade steak with 'nduja & honey - it's absolutely mind blowing. Crispy and charred on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside, and a pretty decent sized serving, too. The pig's ear, arancini and brussel sprouts were also very good.  The cured meat platter and eggplant schmear were good, but not remarkable or noticably different from what you'd be served at other restaurants.My only beef is that the wine is not exactly cheap. The least expensive glass they had came in at $6 (the bulk is at $8 and up), and they actually ran out of it pretty early into the night - presumably because everyone else was drinking it, too."
"Probably my favorite Chicago food. A liitle more direct than girl/goat, tastier than avec, both of which i really enjoy. Too loud and perhaps acrobatic for older friends/family (tall tables) & too pricey for some. But for me the turkey leg and bean salad put me in 7th heaven w/ great wine assortment. Now I want to go back tonight."
"turkey leg confit = AMAZING!  quite possibly the best turkey i've ever had in my entire life.  the beet starter w/goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette was delicious as well!  i wish i could have eaten more... but, was so full!!  i'm really sad i didnt come here sooner on my visit!"
"I'm making this my first Yelp review, as by far, The Purple Pig is one of my favorite restaurants in all of the US. I'm from the NYC area and I travel quite frequently to Chicago for work - hands down, this is the best restaurant in Chicago and is worth the wait for a table or seat at the bar (however long that might be!). I've been to the pig twice, once with a friend and dined outside in the heated tent and once by myself, and dined at the bar. Both times, service was phenomenal, recommendations were on point, and food superb. The wine list is spectacular, and if you are unfamiliar with wines, ask the bartender or your server... I've heard them recommending wines and explaining them in details to other guests, something most bartenders cannot do with such an extensive list. A few of my favorite dishes:-Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (someone tell me what makes this dish SO damn good?!)-Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries (If you are dining with someone else make sure you order two orders, comes with just one egg, and you will definitely want your own!)-Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Smear (Best bone marrow I've had anywhere)-Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Smear (Eggplant and goat cheese... you can't go wrong)-Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear (Just as good as my mom's neck bone gravy, which is pretty hard to beat)-""JLT"" with Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli (throw a hen egg on anything and it's gotta be good!)-And I've saved the best for last... DESSERT! I refuse to ever order anything other than the Sicilian Iris here. It's like a giant zeppole with cannoli cream inside... and remarkably, just as fantastic as the first time I tried it at Siciliainbocca in Rome. No one else has come close to their recipe, and the Purple Pig has mastered it!Again, worth the wait. One of the very few places that I can say I will wait without a reservation!"
"It can be tough to get a seat at times but the food is worth it. Small plates and meat heavy, rich dishes."
"I had a good time here, but I think it is overpriced and overhyped, just like most of Chicago's new restaurants.  I was embarrassed, because I was ""that guy"" that didn't want to sit where we were sat.  Listen, I will say it til I'm blue in the face - I HATE COMMUNAL TABLES.  I will gladly sit on the end of a communal table, but do not EVER try to seat me in the MIDDLE of one, especially when we are THREE people, and one of us will inevitably end up sitting between two STRANGERS.  What is appealing about that, seriously?  So, just from five minutes after walking in the door, I was already riddled with anxiety because I did not want to sit where the hostess was trying to seat us, but I HATE when people don't want to sit where I seat them, so I was about to hyperventilate.  It also didn't help that the hostess did all but roll her friggin' eyes at me - listen, I am not that g.d. difficult, just don't try to make me sit with a bunch of strangers!  I'm not at a party, I'm with my mother and my boyfriend spending LOTS of money at your restaurant.  That's what I really don't understand about communal dining:  since it's become such a fad, all of these expensive restaurants are doing it.  Seriously?  You want me to spend $30 or whatever on a g.d. cheese plate but you want me to eat it while I'm sandwiched between two strangers?  I may as well just be sharing with THEM!!Whatever - I digress.  After the hostess gave an exasperated sigh (and whatever, btw, cuz it was like 5pm on a Sunday and the place wasn't even half full yet, so get over yourself), she led us to an empty communal table in the outdoor area so we could sit on the end.  Mind you, it was still pretty chilly outside, but their patio is fully covered and yeah, I would rather sit in the cold than sit between two strangers.  That's just how much I hate it.  Yeah, the food's good, the wine's good, but it's not worth all the hype for communal tables and overpriced food.  And the location SUCKS - right on Michigan Avenue?  We spent almost as much on parking as we did on dinner, for god's sake."
"Let me be the first to say it; I'm a little tired of our country's swine obsession. First, The Publican. Then, the Flu. Now, with wine?Well, friends. This restaurant did not make me sick. Indeed, The Purple Pig delivered.I went here with the boytoy, and, dare I say, we pigged out. No, seriously. We ate a shit ton of food. I ate so much food that I got sick, and that never happens!We ordered:Pork Fried AlmondsMarinated OlivesSalt-Roasted BeetsDeviled EggPig's Ear with Crispy KaleBrussel Sprouts w/ Thyme and LemonJamon SerranoPork Liver PatéRoasted Bone MarrowQuail with Salsify & PomegranateThe only dish that didn't delight was the quail. It was embarrassingly small. The bone marrow was pretty good, although it didn't have much flavor. Everything else was awesome. I liked the beets and brussel sprouts in particular.As for the wine, we had a half bottle of something that I can't recall. I'm not much of a wine snob, so I can't review their libations in good faith. However, they had a very large selection, and, for many of then, you can opt for half bottles, quarter bottles or by the glass. And... the ambiance and service was also good."
"Totally does not get the hype that others get.  It does deserve high ranking for having excellent food, and great waitstaff that know food and their trade.  I also love the fact that it caters to the fundamentals meaning I can have a great food experience without being limited to stuff I am not willing to try."
"You have to try the Bone Marrow, does sound appealing but is damn good!!"
"very flavorful! The food is here is very different and I have never tried the food here anywhere else. I had their milk braised pork shoulder, ceasar salad, bone marrow, clams, and fried Brussels sprouts.Hmm...I have to say that the food is a little on the salty side...I found myself drinking a lot of water during my meal. Also, this place was a little too crowded. Maybe it was holiday season, but it would have been nice if we had a more room. It was a very fun experience eating bone marrow, clams, and fried brussels sprouts. And I recommend yall trying this place!"
"The Purple Pig is a tapas style restaurant with heavy emphasis on pig products.  A popular place with long wait even during off-hour.  We ordered the coppa cured meat, roasted bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, pig's tail, and prosciutto bread ball.  The pig's tail was truly outstanding (4 stars).  The balsamic really bring it to the next level. The roasted bone marrow was nicely seasoned (3 stars).   The prosciutto bread balls didn't quite do it for me (2 stars).  The pork shoulder was nice and tender (3 stars).  My only complain is the restaurant layout.  One of the communal tables was placed right up against the window.  I literally had to climb over people to get to the other side."
"Nice place, really good food. We tried bone marrow spread, really delicious. Calamari was awesome."
"The Purple Pig makes me a happy camper.  The food was TO DIE FOR.  I was there for a birthday dinner and our group was ordering on and off.  Service was quick once we were seated.  It is quite a popular place and we felt very lucky to have been seated after an hour of waiting.  My favorite dish was the milk braised pork shoulder.  Try it, you'll love it!"
"I was walking north on Michigan Ave. and feeling pretty peckish after a meeting last Sunday so I decided to settle for dinner at Bennigan's.  Nothing against Bennigan's but it's generally not the first (or second or 30th) place that comes to mind when I think of fun and interesting places to eat.  In other words, I was hungry and I was willing to settle for ""just okay"" food.  I knew there was a Bennigan's nearby but I couldn't remember exactly where so out came the Google map app. on my phone.  I searched ""Bennigan's"" and saw that I'd actually have to backtrack four blocks to get there.  Forget THAT.  I passed Subway.  Not in the mood.I passed some Chinese place.  Meh.I passed Starbuck's.  Bleah.And then I saw The Purple Pig.  Here's the internal dialogue that took place in my mind:Me:  Hm.  Purple Pig?Me2:  Meh.  I *could* go there but it's probably ridiculously pretentious.  Keep moving.Me:  I'm really hungry.  Oh!  And other yelpers say it's a great place.  I really should try it.Me2:  *shrug*  I guess.  meh.So I walked in, saw that it was very busy and got a sinking feeling.  I did NOT want to sit and wait an hour before I was served.  I was immediately greeted by a host who informed me that they could find me a seat right away if I was comfortable trying out one of the ""communal"" tables.  Now, I realise this won't be everyone's cup of tea but, after getting over the initial awkwardness of sitting next to people who aren't there to spend time with you, communal tables can actually be kind of cool.  So I said ""sure!"" and was seated immediately.When I looked at the menu, my first reaction was, ""What was I thinking?  Why did I come here?  I'm in no mood for wine right now and I don't even like pork.  This was a REALLY stupid idea.""  I waffled for a while and seriously considered leaving.  Everything on the menu has pork and/or (mostly ""and"") some sort of cheese.  Their tag line is ""Cheese, Swine and Wine,"" so shame on me for not taking it literally.Here's the thing, though.  I DIDN'T leave and, once my server, Katie The Rock Star showed up, everything got all better.  Her name isn't Katie The Rock Star.  At least, I don't think it is.  But she was amazing so I've dubbed her accordingly.  Anyway, after Katie The Rock Star explained the menu basics to me, I settled on the fried chorizo stuffed olives and the whipped feta with cucumbers.   I expected to wait a while for my food - the place was PACKED - but within moments, I had my stuffed olives.   At the risk of sounding like a walking foodie cliche, I have two words to describe my first dish:  Flavour Explosion.  Every bite was a ""wow"" moment.  No kidding.  It's not a huge dish but there's so much flavour, you don't *need* it to be huge.  Just as I was finishing my olives, the whipped feta and cucumbers arrived with a plate of toasted bread.  Holy shit, that feta was good.  I'm kind of glad I was dining alone because, frankly, talking would have ruined the moment.  I just wanted to close my eyes and enjoy the flavours.  So I did.  Amazing.After I'd finished savouring my foodgasm (yes, I said it.  foodgasm), I started the people watching.  It's a little tricky to do this without looking like some sort of freak when you're actually sharing a table with the strangers you're observing.  However, the opportunity for a little conversation presented itself in a way that can really only happen when dining at a communal table.  The party of three to my right were discussing European chocolate versus American chocolate.  The female in the group gave me a subtle look when one of the men mentioned how much he loved a specific east coast chocolatier.  It was subtle but it was enough of an invitation so, giving a sidelong glance of my own, I murmured just loudly enough, ""I really only enjoy European chocolate.  Especially Belgian,"" and suddenly, I was a part of the conversation.  Then, the couple to my left shyly asked me if I would please be willing to take their picture on their monstrously large freak-of-digital-nature camera.  I happily obliged, though it took me three tries to get it right.  See what I mean?  Really, only communal dining can give you experiences like that.  I get it.  It's not for everyone. But I happen to love those little moments so it was a perfect dining experience for me.After the conversations wound down, Katie TRS returned to see how I felt about dessert.  Oftentimes I'll take a pass on the dolci but I was in the mood so I chose a strawberry soft-serve ice cream in a brioche drizzled with balsamic.  mmmmm.... delicious.  And not so heavy that I thought I'd go into a food coma.  It was the perfect ending to a lovely meal.Here's my rating breakdown:Service:       5 StarsFood:           5 StarsAmbiance:  5 StarsI can see why Bon Appetit calls The Purple Pig one of the 10 best new restaurants in America!"
"After a long day of doing the tourist scene along the magnificent mile hunger decided to come a knockin and we decided to open our flood gates to the purple pig.. At first impression we noticed the alfresco dining option and was already half way sold to this place.. tucked on the side of a building right on Michigan ave the location is great for an outdoor dining experience.A quick hello to our hostess and off we went to to our table or so we thought it was our table.. Instead of individual tables we were squeezed into a community table, that's right a community table.. Where Larry ,Joe moe,Susie and crap load of other people I don't know was also sitting..now coming from LA where we avoid all outside human contact this was not usual to me and actually made me a little nervous that I might have to interact with people I am bumping shoulders with.. But After an actual smile or two from my table neighbour I started to ease into the experience and realize I wasn't in LA anymore and people were semi friendly..After my initial shock the ordering began and the choices available on this menu got my full attention for  I was seeing items on the this menu I have never experienced.. Time for an adventure.. Our choices were bone marrow,, eggplant cabonato and deep fried deviled egg.Now this place is like a tapas bar so really small plates , small plates and larger plates which all seem to go with the pricing ,,the more you pay the more you get.. Ordering was a little tricky since I got to shout over my new table buddies head to my waitres while they are trying to have a conversation with the other strangers at the table.. Out came the deviled egg note the key word ""egg"" ya you only get one..after my initial thought of what the hell they are ripping us off here I took a bite and all my worries disappeared... The egg was a devil of a good time in my mouth and Made me wish I had more than one .. The watercress salad that came with it was salty and so would be many of  the other dishes I experienced here, they are a little heavy handed on the salt.. Next was th egg plant that seemed to be sauté in some sort of tomatoe base that just went really well with the cheese coated burnt bread ..  Finally our experience that I have been avoiding for awhile but knew I had to try, arrived, bone marrow al a bone..now this was my first experience at this and didn't know what to expect.. Well what I got was a total Zimmerman experience of that was one bizzare food.. Bizarre in texture taste and why would I want this .. It tasted like bone marrrow..people actually like this or are they just putting a show.. Well as for me it was not agreeing with my taste buds  but after two great plates I couldn't complain and quickly brushed of my disappointment with bone marrow.Overall this place is great to experience some interesting dishes, good location and nice alfresco dining .. My negatives would be communtinty tables which make the ordering experience less personal and hard to find out more about what I am ordering, makes you feel like you want to just order something so you don't bother you neighbor who has to curb her conversion so the waitress can take my order in between her space..try to grab one of the few individual seats an it think this place will be a great experience.."
"What about some Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes or Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic.. Or maybe more in the mood for Pork Saltimbocca with Rainbow Swiss Chard? Seriously, by the time you've finished yourself off with Roasted Bone Marrow and Herbs you might as well die. Unbelievable! Make sure to fit in a Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche}. This is some serious eating matter for a very reasonable price."
"This is my new ""Go-To"" spot!I have been here 2 times now and have not been disappointed with a single thing ordered.  Both times we ordered Spanish red wine and love that when they bring it to your table you get a little background/info on the wine.  The pork neck/ricotta ""smear"" is our FAVORITE thing on the menu and keeps bringing us back.  The clams rosemarina is also VERY fresh and a flavor explosion in your mouth.  It didn't go at all with our wine but we wanted to try it and weren't let down a bit. On our last trip we had the Butternut Squash with Pumpkin seeds and my husband and I fought over who got the last bite (he won).  We have been here on a Friday and a Saturday and both times it has been crowded but never more then a 5 min wait for two people.  I'm sure we'll be back soon and hope to be ""regulars"" by the end of the winter!"
"I can only give this little place 3 stars for a couple of reasons.  First off, it is pretty small, and crowded.  The service was pretty good, a little stiff at first but our server finally warmed up.  The food was excellant however, when they say small plate (think tapas) they mean small and expensive.  I was surprised at how small the portions were for the price point.  The wine menu is extensive, but again very expensive.  It's located right off Michigan Av. so I'm thinking they are trying to get the tourist dollar.  It's sad because if they lowered the prices just a bit or put a little more food on the plates, I think they would get a higher review, at least from me."
"Kind of thinking about going back, like today.  After reading a few other reviews that mentioned poor service, I am going to have to disagree.  We were there on a gorgeous Saturday night and had absolutely no problems.  We were a little worried about how long the wait would be however, we were seated promptly at one of the communal tables (not usually a fan, but it was fine) as soon as we arrived.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the wine and food and I speak for everyone I was with when I say we were all pleased with her suggestions.  Here's what we had:Fried green olives, stuffed with chorizo. uhhh, yum!Raw corn and tomatoes with arugula pestoShrimp and clams with Rosamarina (my least fave, but still good)Deviled egg with arugula and caper berriesPork liver patéTruffle tremor (goat milk and truffle cheese) :-) omgMilk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes-def faveThere wasn't a dish that we tried that we didn't like.  You should know that they do small plates, some very small, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Too many places serve you too much.I cannot wait to go back!  My goal is to try everything on the menu.  Who's with me? :-)"
"I loved everything about this restaurant: food, location, atmosphere, staff.  Will definitely be back here."
"dirty and expensive place,  service is lame, and the food is not as good as some of the reviews. honestly, below average. no second time to there."
"This place was awesome! We came here on a Monday night and were able to just walk right in to a table for two of us. They were out of the Malbec wine, but we settled for a bottle of Merlot. For starters we had the Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana and also the Eggplant Parmesan Balls and the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio Smear (Which was AMAZING). For our meals we had the Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula, the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and also the Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (which where my favorite). The server told us that the sizes were small to medium and to share. We definitely got too much for two people. I think 3 items would have been sufficient. Everything had a lot of flavor and was great! The only thing that wasn't amazing about my experience was the service. Our waitress never checked up on us except for after we paid and she was ready to hurry us out."
Amazing food.  Small plates so you can try lots of things.  The JLT is fantastic.  Good prices and wine offered in half bottles if you're there for a quick lunch.  I'd go back again and again.
"First time in Chicago and only here for a short while on business.  Always love to check out the local dining sceen.  I heard about the PP and decided to check it out.  I came in on a Tuesday evening and it felt like Saturday night after the Club -- PACKED.  To me, a good sign.  There was a 45-60 minute wait unless I could find a place at the bar...SCORE, found one!  My friendly bar neighbor just received what he'd ordered and I decided to order it to, it looked so good.  Pork jowls with frisee, a fresh tomato slice and a quali egg, all on thick luscious butter toasted sourdough.  Mamma Mia...with a glass of St. Emilion Bordeaux.  It was all I needed.  My only regret was that I was unable to conscientiously order more food without looking like a greedy bastard.  I finished it off with the lemon panna cotta with candied pistachios and a perfect latte.  In the background, my favorite R&B was playing...LOUD and I just had a fantastic time there...all by myself.  Can't wait to go back and try other stuff.  Best part?  An amazing experience for $44 with my 20% tip.  Icing on the cake!"
"I am baffled! I do not understand the raves about this place. 1st time in, the hostess was so inpolite and unwelcoming i wanted to run out of there. so we did. the place seemed packed but that was becasue the entry was cramed. next visit the place was empty. we tried 2 plates and they were both horrible. the shrimp and crab was bland and ... well ... just plain horrible. Prosciutto Bread Balls were also pretty bad. So i guess go for the wine? but then what's the big deal? I mean this is Chicago I can find 10 great wine spots in 10 seconds AND have a great experience instead of walking into an attitude parlor."
"I really liked my experience at Purple Pig and all it's trendy downtown wanna be European style tapas joint glory. The weather was decent when I went so we sat out on the enclosed patio (next to a heating lamp) and had great service. Wine list was very nice, I had a couple velvety south American reds, went down real nice with the grilled seafood, warm cheeses and grilled scallions. I had a quick one hour lunch, definitely would have been happy to stay for a couple more."
"This was recommended as a tremendous place.  We were able to cruise right in on a Friday afternoon around 1600, though we had to sit outside.  No problem, there was a tent and a heater.  The style is small plates to share: we tried roasted almonds with garlics, Italian sausage with broccoli and grapes, lardo iberico, hamon, and something else that escapes me, along with a bottle of cava.  It was good, but for around eighty bucks it would have to be marvelous to get four stars, and it was just good."
"No negatives from this tourist. It was all good on the small outside patio with 8 people in our party. All the small plates were shared, and I would try anything when I return. Fun place. Good service also."
"Unbelievably creative Mediterranean menu serves tapas style.  Every presentation was a surprise.  Super friendly service, but long waits.  Noisey.  Trendy crowd.  A real keeper!"
"Again Chicago food scene, you disappoint. I love small dishes and went here late night a couple weeks ago. Love that the kitchen stays open late in a town where you can't seem to have dinner past 10p.m. So was super excited to try this place. The restaurant was tiny but cute and seemed young and had great energy. They also have a great wine list, we had a reasonably priced Rose. That's where the positives end. This is what me and a friend ordered-- the octopus, the fried prosciutto balls, the shaved brussel sprouts and the porchetta sandwich. To be fair, we both thought 1/4 of the meal was outstanding (the octopus and the brussel sprouts). Here's my issue-- how can a place screw up pork?? It's delicious and hard to go wrong. I can't say what happened with the prosciutto balls but the porchetta had Rosemary in it, giving it an odd flavor. So they kind of fail in my book if they can't make pork taste good--it's like making a gross cupcake, you think, how can this be possible. I mean, really, it may have been the first time I've had a bad porchetta sandwich. Sorry for the tangent but that's unacceptable to me.So I'm giving the place two stars because we did like two dishes and because I would recommend it-- for drinks only."
"I am not sure why this place has such good reviews because it was nothing exciting and quite pricey for what you get. My date and I could easily come up with ways to make every dish we tried better and more than anything the food was bland and boring. The restaurant is tiny and they pack you in so I didn't find it that cozy or comfortable. They do open up a patio in the summer, so that could be nice? The butternut squash was boring and lackluster, the brussel sprouts were minuscule (why would they break they up instead of frying them whole?), trader joes has better whipped feta/cucumber dips, the bread tasted like freezer burn,  and the bean dish we got was also bland. All in all, not worth the $$."
"Great food, fun atmosphere, and amazing waiter.  We let the waiter choose our entire meal and each dish was awesome.  The tripe and Lucia Crema desert were our favorites."
"Simply put, the PP has outstanding food and service. Everything my friends and I ate and drank (we got through a large portion of the menu) was a treat. A solid tag line as well: cheese, swine and wine. Enjoy!"
"Always very crowded and a huge hotspot, near/on michigan ave. the food is eclectic with many options and variations of 'pig'. the taste for some of the dishes are excellent. i had the slow roast pork with mashed potatoes, was excellent. all the dishes are small, but it's tapas style. the dessert was very good as well. a very decent selection of wine."
"We froze our A$$es off. Even though there were heaters and the patio appeared to be walled in somewhat, our table was freezing cold. The red wine was so cold it was undrinkable and the food was immediately chilly. You could have made ice cream on our granite table and every time someone got up at the enormous table behind us, my husband had to get up from his chair.  This happened at least 8 times. There is absolutely no excuse for this 2 top table to be where it is.  When we complained, both the server and the manager said "" I will tell someone who can do something about this but I can't do anything for you"". I can't comment on the food as it was all cold. Avoid this place right now!   If you must go there take a stand!. Mention this review to avoid that table!!!!  Do not let our horrible experience with absolutely no accommodation be in vain!!  There is no excuse for a restaurant to be so desperate for additional diners that they would give someone a dining experience such as this. Diners Unite!!!  Tell them Hell No!!!!"
"By far one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Stayed here for a couple of hours just eating and sharing dishes. Waitress was very attentive and helpful with recommendations. The spreads were delicious, especially the eggplant one. The housemade greek sausage was also a hit. For dessert, you must try the sicilian iris-deep fried ricotta that left me speechless. It was refreshing to see Jimmy Bannos Jr. working hard in the kitchen and seeing how hands-on he is at this restaurant. Will definitely be back again!"
"the pig's ear was ridiculously good.  mix it with fried kale, pickled peppers and fried egg, and you've got yourself a killer dish.  and it comes in a tiny piggy bowl.  and it's only $6!it's one of the best new restaurants in america this year, and as result, the waits are longer (there's always been a wait though).  the wait staff and bartenders are friendly, and they really take their time explaining the menu items, since some of them are not familiar to the regular palate.  don't be afraid to ask for their recommendations.my other favorite thing about this place is the wine list.  really extensive, very well thought out, and lots of affordable choices.  their piedmont wines, in particular, are really good."
"Slightly uneven but very high marks overall.NOT TO BE MISSED DISHES:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago &Salami ToscanaDeviled Egg with Arugula & Caper BerriesLingua AgrodulcePork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta (the bread that comes with this is fabulous)Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed PotatoesSicilian Iris (possibly the best doughnut in the world!)Festa di Santa Lucia Crema (if you love chocolate sauce)DISHES TO SKIP:Chorizo Stuffed OlivesPig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg All surprisingly blandThe cheese course was nothing special. Maybe we ordered 3 average ones. They were out of Manchego too which was weird for a Friday night.Bread Pudding with Marsala & Citrus - we had at least 3 other desserts that were better than this one. They forgot one dish which messed up the pacing of the meal... things were coming at a fast pace until they realized we were short a dish. It took 20 minutes or more to recover it and they never did find their footing after that. Service was friendly and fun however."
"Very cute place. Little tough to figure out some of the food. Found glossary after we ordered. Ask. It will help. Almonds, brussels sprouts were excellent. Want to return for wine and cheese. Looks awesome"
"this little piggy kitchen wang bang chopchopchop where did my ear go? What a great stop! Twice actually. An easy late lunch of an ice cold Peroni with 2 small plates. Salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese -sweet, salty and earthy. Awesome. (and don't be alarmed later, remember -you ate BEETS) Artichokes with prosciutto, fingerling potatoes and vinaigrette, light on the artichokes, heavy on the potatoes, but good none the less. Exemplary service at the bar. I came back a few days later for an early dinner. I had a most unusual deviled egg. It was breaded, deep fried and freakin wonderful and served with bitter greens. Charcuterie for 2 or more had a nice selection of imported Serrano and prosciutto, plus a trio of house made force-meats. Excellent.  The ""white meat"" of breaded and fried mystery fish tasted exactly like tapas I had in Spain a million years ago, sour and salty.  Perfect!  My only gripe is with the bone marrow. If you serve bone marrow, for christ sake get marrow spoons, not cocktail forks. Its like getting a demitasse spoon for your large latte. -that's another pet peeve, but I digress.... Purple Pig is some fine wine and swine!Carry on."
I enjoyed the  milk braised pork shoulder and the roasted bone marrow smear. I guess what I loved most was that it was so conveniently located off Mag Mile and really offered a great alternative to the middle end not so good touristy places and the high end fine dining. Unfortunately service was a slight negative.
"I went there with a group of 7 girls for a celebratory dinner. The wait was about 1.5 hours since this place does not take reservations.  It was our first time so the waiter recommended that he order for us about 3-4 plates per person which was TOO MUCH FOOD.  The food was avg-good. Not spectacular by no means. The girl and the goat is much better.  We paid about $50pp including tax/tip w/ drinks.  Would I come back? Yea, I'll give it another try. Would I wait 1.5 hours. Definitely NOT!"
"I would definitely recommend this place. Great wine selection, ambiance, delicious and flavorful fare. The wait staff was helpful and provided suggestions based on our preferences. Purple Pig is also reasonably priced for the quality of food. We waited about twenty-five minutes for a table but sat outside on the benches and ordered a glass of wine.We were seated at a communal table and meet some awesome people from Southern California and Ohio. It's a great weekend or week night option if you are looking for great wine, delicious and flavorful food, and a chill environment that's not too loud. I loved the whipped Feta with cucumbers, and the Panini."
"At some point, when my jedi skills are sensing an unusually low number of tourists on the Mag Mile, I will go back for the extensive and affordable wine list.  I think it said 40 bottles under $40--many of these are available by the glass and in 2 different sized carafes as well.  It kind of reminds me of Quartino in that sense (""where the wine is cheaper than water,"" as they say).  It gives you the opportunity to try a few different things, which is nice, because that way you can get into experimenting with pairing things to all of the small plates that you will order.I give the server points for letting us sample a wine (that is available by the glass) before we placed our final order for a full bottle.  That was nice, and she didn't have to do that -- but I didn't find the service to be amazing all-around.  I found myself hunting for her on a few occasions, but I didn't resort to standing up or raising my hand in the air for 5 minutes, which, for better or for worse, I have had to resort to elsewhere.  The lack of attention could possibly be, in part, a function of the communal table action.  Being sandwiched in between others can mean that the deficiencies are less visible to the server.  All in all, I think the service was still satisfactory... but we definitely over-tipped.The restaurant itself had a more peasant feel than I expected, having overheard things about the type of food that is served.  It's not to say it isn't pLeasant, but it's more ""country"" ... you know, proletariat. It's more casual in that sense, yet it has that Michigan Ave neon-type glow and vibe to me, that makes it feel like perhaps you shouldn't go in a ratty t-shirt.  The overall image of the place starts with the discovery that there is no valet parking, which is mostly odd and inconvenient, given it's strange location right off Michigan Ave (at Illinois), but it's not really on the street at all.  I suppose that suits those staying at the nearby hotels quite well.  The banner-like sign above the pedway to the restaurant is the only indication that the place is there, at least by night, but it isn't that polished; Not sure if it's the font or the way it is lit or what.  I will go refresh my memory, but come to think of it, the web page isn't that impressive from a design perspective either.There appears to be covered outdoor seating out front; not sure what it overlooks, as we were seated indoors.Food was good -- we ordered the marinated olives b/c we were starving, and those were just fine and included a few meaty monsters.  I also requested the heirloom salad with cucumbers and feta (basically a greek), but the whipped feta smear came instead.  I was trying to go the healthier/fresher route, but as the crostini that accompanied the smear looked nicely brushed with olive oil and charred, we accepted that instead.  Aside from the bread aspect, I am not sure if I am really that into the smears, and I'd probably prefer more solid food, personally.  The greek sausage was tasty (and Chicagoans love their encased meats), but the pork shoulder really was delicious and tender.  My only slightly negative comment about the latter is that it felt very wintery to me, having been accompanied by more or less mashed potatoes and gravy.  We ordered it, and we definitely finished it.Perhaps someday I will wander back for the wine and to satisfy my curiosity as to how you deep fry a deviled egg."
"Love this place.  We went with foodies and we ended up ordering almost everything on the menu (a great advantage with small plates/tapas).   Each dish was either good, great, or awesome.  The best word to describe everything is ""flavorful.""  Some especially notable dishes:  Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs,  and Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde.  Go early or go late--this place is super crowded all the time!  (1 hour+ wait)."
"First I just need to WOW!! Went to this place for one main reason and that was to try the swine. Started of the purple pig platter which is their signature dish, and this is where the magic began. Generous portions of cured meat and also the everything on the platter was house cured except the Jamon and Prosciutto. After the platter tried the fried pigs ear salad with the fried egg and pickled peppers, for me this dish was close to perfect the only complaint I have about it is I would of liked to have more of the peppers to cut through to richness of the fried egg. Then finished with the sardines which were perfect they came with a shaved fennel salad and lemon vinaigrette. Another one of my favorite things that came unexpected was the beer list which included some of my international favorites at good prices.ecspecially considering being on Michigan Ave.Will definitely be returning to The Purple Pig, as a matter of fact I was planning my next visit before I ever left."
"If I was rating just the food, I would give purple pig four stars. Unfortunately though we must discuss the wait. I would actually never choose this establishment because of the insane wait, however a friend wanted to go and having had one previous experience with their food at the bar I was in. Here is how the evening unfolded. At 545 we arrive and are told 2  hours and 15 minutes. Fine, we knew this would likely be the case, so we sent ourselves off for some shopping and wine at the wine bar across the street. We come back at our designated time exactly, 8pm. We are told that there are two tables of 2 ahead of us. Then we wait...and wait some more...we do not get seated until 9pm, a full hour after our quoted time and a full 3 hours after putting our name in. Crazy pants! Now I get that the space is small, that you know going in of the wait, however, here is my biggest complaint: they do not know how to manage these tables to manage the rush of people. We were told three times by the hosting team that ""we have a bunch of tables just drinking water."" these were the tables we waited on to leave for 45 minutes. I have hosted before....move them on out!! People, if you yourselves waited three hours for a table, don't be a table B and linger over freshly poured tap water while people wait to eat. Overall this experience was so frustrating and irritating I will not be back for the delicious food. Too many other good places in the city without the ridiculous wait! No food is worth a three hour wait."
"So after walking/driving by the Purple Pig numerous times and never getting around to going there, I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it out - and I was very impressed. The food is delicious and creative while still being accessible enough for those (like me) who still aren't overly adventurous when it comes to food. I do have to give two caveats about the place though: (1) this is not the place for those on a diet or counting calories, and (2) it's great for small groups but I wouldn't advise bringing a date here - though this place is definitely lively and bright, I quickly found out that it's also very loud, making it next to impossible to hold a conversation without almost yelling over the noise.All the food here is in small plates that are meant to be shared, which is great because you can try a little bit of everything. The menu doesn't seem to focus on any particular region...I guess that's why it's categorized as ""modern European"". I'd say it's sort of Italian-Spanish fusion with some Mediterranean-ish influences. We tried the fried manchego cheese (just the fact that that was even on the menu had me sold immediately), the finocchiona salami, and the summer vegetables with farro and tomato vinaigrette.  It was all delicious and served very promptly.  For dessert we had the Sicilian Iris, a ricotta and chocolate chip-filled fried brioche.  It. Was. Amazing. Flaky, light and sweet without seeming too rich or heavy, it was unlike any other dessert I've had recently - I highly recommend saving room to try this. The wine list here is frankly quite impressive - I tried a German Pinot gris which I enjoyed very much, though I left wishing I would have tried one of the Greek or Portuguese wines on the list.I should also note that the service was excellent - despite the place being very crowded, we were seated quickly and our server (I think her name was Alexa?) was terrific.  She was very patient with two indecisive newcomers and made very good suggestions. All in all, the Purple Pig gets two very enthusiastic thumbs up from me - I can't wait to return and try some of the other yummy treats I missed."
"OK. If you know anything about me, you will know:1- I love me some Pig2-I love me some Vino3- I love me some cheese4- Go to number one.So when my friends said they were going to take me to a place with the name of Pig in it I was a bit excited.  When I saw the sign out front that said, Cheese, Swine, Wine I was absolutely Ecstatic!  All my favorite food groups in one place.  And I was not disappointed.  This place is now on my favorite on Earth list.  If you have a bucket list that involves anything around Chicago, go here!Now it is small, and is crowded, and a tad noisy.  But it's a great place in a great city, Duh! I don't want to eat pig's ear in an empty place sitting quietly.  Hell NOWell it was a sunny nice day, and there is a patio, but it was packed. As was the inside.  Luckily one of my companions eyed four stools in front of the small hot line/kitchen.  We would be able to watch the magic unfold.  I would highly recommend these seats.  It was great to see the food ballet in this tiny space, with limited cooking area unfold in front of us.  We started talking to the chef running the line, Brian, who made us some of my now favorite dishes.  I could of ordered everything there.  It all looks that good.  Now to our foodHe started us with Fried Pig's Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and topped with a fried egg.  OUTSTANDING!  The flavors were absolutely phenomenal.  Next for a 'healthy' option did an asparagus and hazelnut salad with arugula and Treviso, which is similar to radicchio.  Again, just simple, yet stellar. Had to try the Prosciutto Bread Balls which were fried and had a little bed of red sauce.  And they went fast. The perfect finger food.We also tried the Eggplant Caponata with goat cheese on grilled crostini. Again a home run.  The flavors were amazing.  And the hits just kept coming.....In addition to the fantastic Italian Wines we had.  The wine list is European and Epic.  Guaranteed to find something you like, and something you love.  Then had the razor clams with Oregano, Lemon and olive oil.  They were good as well.  I'm not the hugest clam fan, but they were more than acceptable with all the other deliciousness we were having.Also had the Jamon Serrano with oyster mushrooms and fried duck egg over grilled bread.  Kind of like an open faced sandwich of awesomeness.  And we got to try a traditional Saltimbocca.  Done absolutely perfect.  I mean a perfect dish.  Did I saw how great it was?Well I'm rambling now.  Just go here.  And go again. And eat. And drink."
"Amazzzzzing.  I used Yelp to search for a good lunch spot on a random summer weekday and came across this place.  We opted to sit inside because it was quite hot outside and the place is obviously a wine bar.  I'm not a big tapas fan but everything we tasted was awesome.  My bf and I were interviewing all day so we needed to keep it light but we didn't want to scimp on flavor.  The octopus, Jimmy's Greek Sausage, and Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder were all AMAZING.  The portion sizes are bigger than what I'm used to from an upscale tapas place.  The pork shoulder was so tender and juicy and the mashed potatoes it came with were excellent.  The sausage was extremely flavorful and the octopus was so tender and delicious.  They really have their dishes down, it seems.  I'll definitely be back to try the other dishes.  I saw lots of diners order the steak and beets.  We didn't try the wine but I hope they have good pairings for us to try!"
"Cheese, swine, and wine doesnt even begin to cover this place. It was wonderful. Complain all you want about it being packed, its packed for a reason. Delightful wine selection but the food is FABULOUS. We had the muscles, bone marrow, fried manchego cheese, and chicken skewers. Everything was divine. The servings are actually quite large. (I figured it would be tapas style were you get a little food for a lot of money and still go home hungry). I will be back, probably tomorrow actually.  I doubt theres a bad thing on the menu. PS James is amazing."
creative and tasty menu. Expensive
"Hands down my favorite place in Chicago. I even ate there twice in one week recently. The wine list has a good variety and reasonable pricing. My picks for food - neck bone gravy, pig ears, turkey leg, grilled octopus and of course the bone marrow! I've had the marrow undercooked on one occasion but they replaced it.  I've never had to wait more than 10 min for a seat."
"Small portions on the appetizers, but the chicken kebab was delicious."
This place was fun especially with a group of people.  It is super crowded and always busy but for good reason.  The little plates were yummy and very unique. I actually enjoyed their veggies dishes. There was so much wine to choose from I was slightly overwhelmed until I started drinking.  I would definitely go back.
"You can def. tell The Purple Pig is a hot spot of the moment. Tiny little space, packed the gills. They added outdoor seating under a big purple tent, but the place is still packed and crammed. I felt out meal was hit and miss 1) Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary and Garlic: Loved the favor of the rosemary and garlic, wish the almonds had been a tiny bit more crispy, they were a little on the soggy side, which I don't like in my almonds, but the flavor was spot on. 2) Prosciutto Bread Balls: well doest this sound amazing and life changing? well it was ok, but i expected more. They were really salty and I almost felt like how they were fried took away from the prosciutto and just left you with a taste of fried saltiness. 3) Chorizo Stuff Olives: well I hate olives, but gave it a try anyways. I felt the olive taste was way too powerful and you couldn't taste the chorizo. Again, very salty. 4) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. This was the big hit! Would def. order this again. No complaints at all about this dish. Loved the crispiness of the pig's ear. 5) Roasted Bone Marrow Smear. I liked it. First few bites I loved! Thought it had a nice rich flavor, however the boyfriend couldn't get over the texture, therefore I ended up eating the whole dish. The more I ate of it, the more I wasn't into it, just to rich not to split with someone. Left the restaurant under impressed from all the hype and feeling like i ate a ton of salt! I would not make it a point to return."
"I wanted to try this place because of the glowing reviews and recommendation from some of my Chicago foodie friends.  I was apprehensive, though, due to it's Michigan Ave address and because of the hype.  We went early on a chilly May evening (arrived around 6:30pm) and expected to wait... to our surprise we were offered a table right away!  Unfortunately, the table was outside, under the tent.  We debated, but decided we were hungry enough to sit outside.  I did get a seat by the large heater, which was great at first, but as we proceeded through our dinner, it felt as if my head and neck were melting!  Hot!  Exterior temperatures aside, our dining experience was fantastic!  We had a very knowledgable and friendly server, outstanding food, and I would definitely go back!Just FYI...they recommend 2-3 small plates per person (it is tapas-style).  My friend and I have very healthy appetites and struggled to finish the five plates that we ordered."
"I love this place and left feeling giddy, it was so good. The most delicious food, awesome service, and super-chill atmosphere. My friend and I ate milk-braised pork, brussel sprouts with Peccorino, fried Risotto balls with goat cheese, fried sardines with lemon and fennel, a cheese plate, and, the best food I've ever tasted, roasted bone marrow with herbs.Not only does everything taste amazing, but the service is spectacular.Eat here if you love food and you appreciate a fun, easy dining experience. Also, it was SUPER affordable, considering the level of gourmet we ate and the attention we got."
Everything we tried was on point. They have communal tables and a few individual tables. Great service.
"I love this place.  Small plates, able to taste lots of different items, great wine list.  Went Wednesday late afternoon and got right in.  We had the wagyu meatball sliders, beet salad with goat cheese, almonds and rosemary cooked in pork fat (YUM!), shredded brussell sprouts with pecorino romano, chorizo olives and the pork rillette.  The sprouts and rillette were wonderful.  A great evening with friends and fabulous food."
Yummy! Great food and beautiful interior. Such a wonderful little place to stumble upon. You need to like eating pig though.  ;-)
"food was delicious (had the bone marrow, meatball slider, chicken kebabs, and milk-braised pork), atmosphere was warm and welcoming (sat outside - recommend it), and service was amazing.  i must specifically mention the service - i accidentally left my backpack under the table and didn't notice until we got to the airport for our flight home to los angeles. we called immediately and they told us they had found it and put it somewhere safe. the manager (wylie) was even willing to work with us to research how to ship it back to us in LA. we ended up finding a friend in the area to pick it up and ship it to us, and everything (including some valuable items) was in the backpack safe and sound. thank you, purple pig!"
"Delicious! Great atmosphere! Extremely knowledgeable staff! To memorize their extensive wine list and cheeses, plus the pairings with their very unique menu, is a very daunting task but our waitress was most helpful. Every review we read seemed to praise the bone marrow spread and it lived up to its hype. It was like the most decatent parts of the pork were condensed into this salty gelatin and smeared over toast. And if you are a lover of cheese, then there is no doubt you need to stop by this weekend!"
"This is definitely my kind of place. My wife found it and stopped by on a Friday night for dinner. The atmosphere is very casual, with group seating at large tables, a bar and small booths. Overall the floor plan is cozy, it was a bit smaller than I was expecting. Our waiter was very polite and attentive. The wine list is reasonably priced and loooooooong and you can order a bottle, a glass, a 1/2 or 1/3 bottle. It's a great place to try something new. Our waiter was very helpful in his recommendations without being pretentious at all. The menu has a multitude of cheese and cured meat selections, again a great chance to try something new. We ordered a cheese platter and told the waiter to surprise us and had some cured meats with it. The rest of the menu is divided into appetizers, dips (or smears, as they called it), fried items, salads and entrees. We stuck to the apps, dips and fried items. Everything was a ""small plate"" perfect for sharing. We stayed for almost 3 hours sampling wine and grazing. Everything we had was delicious. I can't even remember it all. Deep fried prosciutto balls....how can you go wrong with that?? The lardo crustini was delicious and so was the pigs ear with crispy kale. We didn't try them on this visit but even the salads looked awesome. All in all this is a great casual place, has great service, an expansive wine selection and a fabulous menu for tasting all kinds of new things. I will definitely be returning."
"Love the food! Amazing dishes.  I have been there 3 times in the past year and every single time the food has been outstanding.  The ONLY bad is that waiting for a table takes for ever.  I went on a Friday afternoon - 1 30 pm - with a gf to have a late lunch and we had to wait for 50 minutes for a table.  Once seated, we had to wait for 15 minutes for the waitress to come to our table.  Waitress was sweet and VERY helpful BUT Gosh in order to place our order we waited for a total of 65 minutes.  Food was amazing.  Nonetheless, the restaurant may want to hire more servers OR start accepting reservations.  50 minutes for a table its too much ... this is not an isolated Friday issue, I have gone on a Wed and on a Sunday ... each time I had to wait over 45 min."
"I've been here a couple of times for drinks and snacks, and more recently for dinner.  The staff has always been helpful with recommendations and tastes of the less common wines, and the food is very good.  I particularly enjoyed the octopus, fried brussels sprouts, and the sausage.  The only disappointment was the housemate copa, which was almost sweet in the absence of black pepper."
"This is the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. Believe the hype.Nice wine list. There is a crianza that is super delicious ($50) and another rioja ""muga"" that is also a hit ($40). The turkey leg confit with black lentils is off the hook. Melrose peppers in sea salt and garlic chips, also a hit.Very busy. Sitting at the bar if you're two is a great way to beat the line."
Fun atmosphere but a bit cramped.  Foodie menu - I had the wild bass.  Nice dish but the bass was overcooked.  Poor service.  Good beer and wine.
"one of two awesome restaurants while in chicago.  this place has the BEST beet salad!  i know what you're thinking: BEETS?!  lemme just say, my friend who doesn't like beets actually loooooved this salad.  personally, best beets i've ever had.  other faves: pork sweetbreads (don't  EVER look up what they actually are) and the milk braised pork shoulder.  and go for the razor clams if it's on the menu; i've never seen, heard, or had them before and it was great!"
"Never again. Okay, I should preface this review with, I don't really eat pork...So, why would I go to a restaurant with pig in the title,  you ask?? Because I felt like it dammit! And, the other non-porcine dishes on the menu should be just as good. Well, from my companion's response to her pig dish, which she called greasy and not flavorful, the pig isn't all that impressive either!  I think it's a very cute idea and I adore tapas style eating, but the only dish that really stood out and might bring me back was the chicken thighs...out of the 5 dishes ordered. That's just not enough, Purple Pig, it's not enough!"
"Have wanted to go here for quite a while and will go back to try one more time but this visit was NOT  great.  Would like to be able to give 2 1/2 stars.Good:  The butternut squash appetizer is perfection itself.Not as good:  The french fries of the sea had a great aioli sauce but the fries themselves weren't anything special, just a vaguely fishy flavor.  The pork shoulder had way too high a fat to meat ratio and the 'mashed' potatoes were more like a soupy puree.  We saw  a wonderful dessert go by, so we asked about and ordered it.  It's the fried iris dessert that was featured in Bon Appetit magazine.   First, there was a REALLY long wait before it arrived and then it was way overcooked, dark brown and a bit greasy.  Looked like it had gotten forgotten in the fryer.  The waitress asked how it was and I told her.  Boy, her  'smiley isn't everything great' attitude disappeared.  No apology, no explanation, needless to say no replacement.  Just the check.  Rather disappointing experience for someplace I've really been looking forward to trying.From the other reviews, perhaps our experience was unusual but unfortunately it's memorable to us!  And, I ALWAYS spread the word to friends about restaurant experiences."
"Ohhh, Purple Pig. I still feel like a pig the morning after. Stuffed, rolling around from place to place and very, very happy.So the food I have no complaints about. They even brought us more toast for our feta-cucumber smear when they noticed we were low on toast, high on smear ;-). Lovely service and delicious, unique food. I just didn't know it was a 200 sq. ft. place that ignores every fire code or that you sit at high tables with 10 other people, so that was really disappointing. It's a busy place. Be forewarned: That popularity you've heard rumors about is true. We waited 15 minutes or so at 8pm on a Sunday evening, standing in the wind by the crammed bar and enjoying about half a drink before we were seated. Our servers were very sweet and very glad we went whole hog (ha!), ordering 10 dishes plus three desserts and a decent amount of alcohol. My uncle was in town from San Fran and admits he was overambitious, but damn everything was so good.I couldn't name half the things I ate, but I don't think it matters. You don't need a recommendation, nor do you need to remember what you ate last time. You only need to remember one thing: Come hungry.Bon appetit!"
"What can I say, The Purple Pig is pretty awesome. Good food and great wine selection. I took my family here when they were in town and they loved it. Its a good place if you want to share dishes because they are very reasonably priced and you could almost treat things as if they are tapas because of the portion sizes on some of some dishes. The only thing that I didn't like was that they have some shared tables meaning that you could potentially sit next to someone not from your party. The chairs are too close together and it probably would be better if they removed a seat or two from a table to give people more elbow room. Other than that I would say if your into trying new things you should definitely go because they always have a few interesting items on the menu."
"The Purple Pig is all the buzz in Chicago lately. I've been wanting to go since they opened, and finally stopped by yesterday afternoon for a late afternoon ""snack"". The place itself is small, but cozy. Very much as if you're sitting in someone's country-style kitchen. They have a great wine list, as well as an interesting (and pork heaven) menu. We each ordered a glass or two of wine (Moscato for two of us, Cava for the third). The Moscato.... can I get a bottle? Next time I think we will get a bottle. We didn't look at the menu when we ordered it, but would've asked for at least a half bottle if we saw those options. Next time. :) We got the Eggplant Caponnata, Pork-fried Almonds, Rock Shrimp and Fried Mussels. Eggplant Caponnata - Yum! Warm toast with goat cheese, to be topped with the eggplant (cold). A delicious combination of flavors and temperature. We really, really enjoyed these and I think it'll be a staple part of our order each time. Pork-fried Almonds - Yhey were ok. I guess I was expected some saltiness, and only a few almonds were in fact salty.Rock Shrimp - This was a cold small salad, with shrimp, snap peas and sweet peas; in a really tart, fresh dressing. I'm not a huge fan of cold shrimp, but this was surprisingly refreshing. I love peas though, and those gave a nice sweetness to the dish. Fried Mussels - Besides the Eggplant dish, this was my fave! Smoked mussels, lightly breaded and fried, served atop a small salad. The salad was good too, but wow, they need to serve these as a bowl of only mussels. So good!Overall, loved the cozy vibe and cozy food here. It's a great spot to stop by for small bites and delicious wine to match. We got to meet the chef/owner as well, and he was friendly and welcoming. Great customer service! We'll definitely be back, and I'm bringing others with me too. The Moscato and Mussels are calling my name. :) P.S. This should realistically be a 4.5 star review... I'm taking a 1/2 point off because I didn't see the Lardo Crostini on the menu (the thing I specifically wanted here), and the Chef said they did serve it. But, more reason for me to go back!"
"I am a whore for roasted bone marrow. Their marrow with balsamic drizzle, cilantro and toast points was the best I've tasted. Better than Publican, better than Rosebud Prime. It is a meat-lovers Mecca. I can't wait to go back."
"Great selection of Italian and German beers on tap, a huge selection of wines by the glass, and 1/3 bottle, and tasty small plate selections.  We started with the salt roasted beets with goat cheese, moved on to the tangy and spicy fried mussels, and finished off with the perfectly grilled octopus and a nice selection of Jamon and cheese. Lively casual atmosphere with friendly and helpful service."
"It is an amazing place to try and come back. it is great to be surprised by a menu that is so original. The food is great, the service very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is vibrant."
"AH-MAZING. Went here last night with 4 of my friends and we got seated around 10pm. We got there at about 9:15pm. The wait was what we were expecting and it's nice because there are heaters outside and cocktail waiters coming around to take orders. We got a bottle of beaujolais to start. Fantastic. When we were seated we got some delicious cocktails. I can't recall what mine was but it had mint in it and was super fresh and light. We started with the Chorizo stuffed olives and the Prosciutto escarole bread balls. Both were great, I preferred the bread balls. Got an order of the crispy pigs ear. This is no joke. We had to get another order because it went so fast and was so great. Mussles were amazing so was the JLT, and Chicken Thigh Kabobs- very good tzatziki.My hands down favorites were the milk braised pork shoulder and the scallops. We also got the Panino con nutella which was the perfect end to the meal. Needless to say you need to go. Totally worth the wait and the price."
"Stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker and after we checked in , decided to find some lunch.  As always, I pulled up Yelp on my phone and buzzed through nearby restaurants.  First page, nothing grabbed me, second page, scroll, scroll, The Purple Pig .4 mi. away!   Lets try it....being around 2pm I figured the lunch rush might be over, it wasn't, place was pretty busy , but only had to wait 5 minutes. Ordered a bottle of wine for the three of us, and a fine Belgian beer of which I can't remember the name, Saison I believe, for myself seeing as we were on a mini vacation!   Waitress recommended ordering a few different things and sharing, which we did and thoroughly enjoyed. Including a 3 cheese sampler from a list of about 20, beet type salad served in a bowl with a whipped goat cheese, and toast topped with serrano cured meat and a fried egg.  The most interesting was the bone marrow, which I had to try simply for the sake of trying.  Did I love it? No. Did I hate it? Nooo....somewhere in between!  Without a sprinkle of sea salt that accompanied the dish, somewhat bland.  Overall, we all the loved this place, really cool vibe, service was helpful  and pleasant.  Had a couple of other samplers that I can't recall due to the long weekend of eating and drinking, but we liked it enough to go back for dessert on Sunday evening, which was also awesome!!  Will go back  on my next visit!!"
"If you're in the mag mile area and you want a kickass meal that will not break the bank but will be pretty effin memorable, consider the Purple Pig. Considering the word of mouth, trendiness of the joint and the legitimately quality dining experience, the wait and the tab were quite reasonable. The wait was half an hour - they wouldn't take reservations, and will seat your party only when everyone is there...communal seating FYI. Come to think of it, the communal part was a bit annoying, because anytime someone in the middle of the tables wants to head out, everyone else needs to shuffle out of their seats - but perhaps this was only for the large outdoor tables we were seated at. Still, sitting outside by the river, perfect evening weather, delicious food....won't complain.The tab was reasonable at about $40 a person after a bottle of wine, and tax/tip and we 3 little piggies were stuffed. We ordered 5 plates and 2 desserts:Antipasti - Beets & Goat Cheese - delish but easily replicable if you have a TJs near you.Smears - Pork Neck Bone Rillette on toast. Zomg. Straight out of a french grocery. So bloody good, and lots of it. The toast was pretty fab too. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - the meat was certainly tender but here, i must confess, I don't know what everyone is raving about. It's a fairly bland and simple dish and there were a lot more Wow elements on the menu.Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli - The scallops had an incredible flavor and sear. Definitely recommend. Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde - I have officially never had octopus cooked as perfectly and tenderly as this. High five.The desserts were actually better together - we spooned the hazelnut ice cream with espresso over the Sicilian Iris. To die. So many other things on the many that we were too full to try but that look amazing. Check this place out, it's worth it."
"I really wanted to love this place. It sounded like a place I would frequent. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience and a terrible meal - top ten of all time.I ate here during the summer around 630pm on a Monday, hot and humid w/a slight breeze. My friend and I got to the entrance of the restaurant, walk in, and the restaurant was full. Good sign, right? After looking around, we finally found the host stand which was home to a very rude hostess - not a good start. We sat outside. Our server finally came a little while later (we were considering leaving) and we ordered quite a bit of food. Our water glasses failed to be refilled for quite some time - usually not a problem, but with the long wait for everything in addition to the hot weather...it was the least that could happen. The people next to us left b/c they had waited so long for a server to attend to them.As for the food, it looked read well on the menu but was poorly executed. A lot of the dishes we got were pork - good right? Unfortunately, there was too much vinegar in the dishes...which kind of ruined them. That in addition to a  lack of seasoning really made this meal lackluster. I plan on trying this place one more time and hopefully I can re-review this place a higher rating."
"This place was amazing! love the atmosphere and menu style, great wine and amazin intresting comunal style cusine, try a lil bit of everthing! Hands down a must stop! Ivanne was my bartender was full of e energy and great advice this place has it down! I will never go to chi-town without hitting this spot! Cheers to swine and wine!!"
"Ehh.  From all the excellent reviews I've heard/read about the Purple Pig, I expected it to be much better.  Honestly, it was kind of, well, yucky.  With French family, I am all about experiencing new cuisine and am a fan of organ meats.  I was neither wowed or full after visiting for a weekday lunch excursion.  I was totally unimpressed and will not be making another visit.  I tried the eggplant shmear and it was ""okay""...nothing to write home about.  I also had the signature milk braised pork shoulder dish and I was left wanting.  It was okay, but it seemed overcooked and much more done than its goal at being ""tender""...it was just slop.  I'm not a chef, nor do I know everything about food, but I know what I like (and that's just about anything and everything).  Purple Pig is a no-no in my book.  Sorry, PP."
"This place lived up to the expectations. The food is as good as advertised. There are many unique and tasty dishes I loved. The food is worth every penny. It is not a great place for an intimate dinner though, since it is smaller and gets crowded. It is a fun atmosphere though. Downside is no reservations. If you go during peak times, it is quite a wait."
"There are only a few meals in your life that make an impression so deep that you remember it for a lifetime.  Our meal at Purple Pig falls in this camp.We ate:- Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley ($6) - I'm a huge fan of roasted cauliflower, but have never thought to pair it with something sour like cornichons.  Worked great!- Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg ($6) - Yum!!!  The fried pig's ear was very good, a very unique combo of flavors.- Charred Green Onions & Ramps with Romesco Sauce ($7) - We got this b/c I've never had ramps before.  Surprisingly, I liked the more ubiquitous green onion... it was sweeter.  Romesco sauce was so amazing.  We actually ate the green onions and ramps separately from the sauce because the former flavors were so delicate and the latter was so robust.  The sauce was so good and hearty (it is tomato-based and made with ground nuts)... we ate it like a stew on its own!  - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs ($9) - This was majorly funky, and not in a good way.  The visual of this dish is amazing with three two-inch bone pieces filled with rich marrow, accompanied by crostini.  However, it was way too greasy from the added olive oil and just felt like a mouthful of lard.  - Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes ($9) - Solid though not overly special.- Festa di Santa Lucia Crema {Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce} ($6) - WOW, WOW, WOW.  This capped the meal off with a most delightful finish.  Absolutely the best dish of the evening even though it had no pig in it.  It was like a high-end twist on rice pudding (I don't normally like rice pudding, btw).  The farro had a great al dente bite to it.  The warm chocolate sauce was served on the side in a little jug - it was dark, bittersweet, and a wonderful contrast in terms of both texture and temperature to the farro and ricotta. We tried a ton of stuff and left full and happy for just a little over $50 for the two of us.  The combination of flavors were unique not merely to provide a ""gimmick""... they honestly worked surprisingly well."
"The Purple Pig is simply exquisite! It was a challenge to get a table, but we were able to sit at the bar for lunch where they serve a full menu. The bar tender/server (Natalia) was amazing! great service with a smile. Our favorite two dishes were the scallops and chickpeas as well as the sepia. Great combination of flavors and perfect size/amount. The restaurant also has an outstanding wine list. We had the Rebeiro (hard to find in the US) and a glass of Rioja red (Seis) from a small vineyard near Elciego in Alava, Spain, which was quite delicious. When in Chicago, the Purple Pig is a must!"
"Loved it!! Espesh the milk braised pork shoulder.  Wasn't expecting to eat this well in such a touristed area, but to my surprise it was the best lunch I've had in ages."
"Delicious Food, Excellent service, Great ambiance."
"Never had lunch or dinner here but definitely an excellent place to grab a drink after work and into the late night. They have a tented/heated outdoor seating and also nicely decorated inside. I've only sat at the bar, but the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the wines on their menu, down to knowing how it was made. I've had the squid appetizer before and it's beyond delicious! Definitely a place worth checking out and meeting some great people."
Nice trendy place with a lot of yuppies there. space is definitely an issue but the food is great. I recommend going there though. Tapas style restaurant are really trendy in Chicago right now and if you really feel eating that and can go up to lincoln park try cafe ba-ba-reeba for sure.
"just got back from the pig a couple of hours ago. overall, my reaction is:good food,way too expensive,crowded and cramped.i'm not yet crotchety and ornery, but getting shoved around in a cramped space and ignored by bartenders gets a bit old while doling out $100 to still be hungry.in the time it took to try and get service at the bar while we waited for our table, we were seated (still drink-less). according to the hostess, that was 30-40 minutes.we waited for a good 12 minutes before our waiter made his presence be known. once we ordered, the food came quickly, and it was very nice food. we ordered the purple pig platter, $39 for seven different types of cured meat. two scant pieces of grilled toast, and a cheese we'd selected. we had also ordered the shredded brussel sprouts, which came in a ramekin-sized container. still hungry, we ordered the grilled octopus with smashed potatoes and summer beans. very tasty, but i believe we dropped $15 for three scant pieces of octopus? my friend and i had one tentacle each, then split the third.my advice? if you absolutely must have the gastropub experience, take your butt to bucktown and go to bluebird. the pig is nice, but the experience really takes away from the food."
"Went here for a late lunch on a summer Friday (read: boozy lunch). Ordered the roasted corn and beet and goat cheese salad - so good. Actually, we have stumbled upon a great combo of flavors - the corn with mushrooms salty and savoury, the beet and goat cheese salad with pistachios light and sweet. Mmm-mm. We followed these up with dishes my husband ordered - both unsuprisingly from the ""fried"" section of the menu - fried green olives stuffed with chorizo and proscuitto bread balls. Tasty. While we were nomming on these tapas-sized treats, a giant beignet passed by - apparently a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips and topped with powdered sugar. OMG. (I don't even use that type of internet term. LOL and whatnot.) Will definitely be back to try the smears and plates, but hopefully we'll have slightly better service."
Amazing! I've been twice for dinner (group of 2 and group of 22) and had a great experience both times.  This is my new favorite for 2010.
"My friend and I went to dinner here in April 2012 on a Wednesday night.  It was still a little chilly outside, but they have a great outdoor set up.  The outdoor area is tented and has plenty of heaters.  We were willing to sit outside due to the heaters, and I think this significantly decreased our wait.  In general, I'm pretty frustrated by places that don't take reservations.  I usually try to get around the crazy crowds by going during the week or at a later time.  This approach didn't help too much with the Purple Pig.  At 8 pm on a Wednesday, we still waited a good 45 minutes.  This is definitely better than the other time I waited almost 2 hours (we ended up leaving because the wait was just ridiculous).  All reservation complaints aside, the meal was fantastic.  We had an artichoke salad to start, which was incredible.  Then we had roasted bone marrow with herbs.  I was initially a little freaked out by the look of the bone marrow, but it was so flavorful and perfectly prepared.  Then we had Porko Bucco, a pork osso bucco.  It was also delicious.  The waiter kept emphasizing that we could take our time, and we ordered each dish one at a time.  While it was nice to not feel like we're being rushed out the door, I'm more of a fan of ordering everything and getting out of there.  The waiter also encouraged us to stay, have some coffee, sit, etc.  I'm guessing that this relaxed attitude contributes to the crazy wait times and no reservation policy.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal.  However, my style doesn't totally jive with Purple Pig, and I would be more inclined to go somewhere with reservations and a timeline."
"I originally loved this place and would be there with great frequency, mostly food versus service.  In the last year I've experienced a great difference and many of us feel as though as women we are discriminated against (which I've never experienced anywhere).  Further, I have a letter from my charge card where I was double charged and their manager (named in letter) said they would take care of it and they never did.  Recently I anticipated their new manager, Brian, would make things right and I'm left hanging."
"Johnny--This one's for you buddy, I haven't written a review in a while...Gorgeous food, gorgeous atmosphere, gorgeous chef. What more can a girl possibly ask for?I took my Mother here after she ranted and raved that it was supposed to be marvelous. We had the following:Proscieutto bread balls--not bad, just not as good as we thought they might be.""French fries of the sea""--Absolutely delicious. Lightly fried but not typical fried flavor. Delicious lemon aioli complimment. Slivers of lemon fried along side. Awesome awesomeOpen faced BLT--Good, love fried eggs but difficult to eat because of the thickness of the bread.Capicolla panini--enjoyed by Mom, she loved it.The hostess was not a delight this day although they were understandably busy during the lunch rush  but these little things make all the difference....I went back a second time for late lunch with  my hairstylist and we enjoyed the french fries of the sea, milk braised shoulder or whatever, she loved that, and I had the chicken kabobs....I love Greek food, but it was just okay. I would definitely return if not to enjoy the ""french fries of the sea"", then that gorgeous aforementioned ""scenery""."
"i wanna give this place a 5 just to help tip it over to the 4.5 star category - i would absolutely come back here again and again.  the food is terrific, the bone marrow smear was so delicous!  i don't knwo if it was the bread or the smear or the entire dish.  i just savored it so much.came here for a pre-dinner meal one afternoon - i know, i'm sad, but when i'm in chicago, i want to pack in as many meals in as many places as possible and there is so much to choose from, but purple pig has been on my bookmark list for a while now.i also had the fried manchego and milk braised pork shoulder - loved both.  we had one more dish with rice, it was a cold dish, tangy, but can't find which one it is on the menu anymore.loved everything i tried.  the atmosphere in warm weather while you can still dine alfresco is terrific - large umbrellas, long tables shared with strangers or private ones.  it's a small homey but stylish restaurant with a balcony nestled in an alleyway off michigan avenue - great for a date or to meet a friend for some good wine and cheese and tapas.  very tasty.  if anything is wrong with it, perhaps food is a little on the salty side if you're health conscious - but this place is called purple pig and it's a gastropub, expect to get a little pork grease in your food!"
"For an overpriced yuppy tapas place, I liked it!  The food was amazing.  If you don't mind spending $75/person on wine and food, this is a good experience.  I'd go again."
"The wine list is extensive and the servers are knowledgable. I thought the food was generally very average, and at times not good at all (the truffled hot cheese was WAY too heavy on the truffle). But the service was quite poor even though we were there at a low-traffic time. The server who was waiting a different set of tables had to come over to help us three or four times because our own server was nowhere to be found. In addition, the toast that came with the truffled cheese was burned, and then when we sent it back, the new toast came out burned too."
"This is another place where, when I'm asked what I ate, I have a hard time remembering exactly what each item was.  Aside from that, if you like pork products, you'll love the Purple Pig.  I think my favorite savory dishes were the butternut squash and the pork blade steak.  The dessert dishes were superb, especially the Sicilian Iris.  One thing that bugged me at this place was the markups on the wine.  I knew the retail value of some of these bottles, and it was hard for me to select a bottle because of that.  Otherwise, this is a great eating experience.  I look forward to trying other items on the menu next time I go."
"great for small plates, but not on the same level as girl and the goat or avec."
"What a great concept. Restaurants like Purple Pig should be everywhere in Chicago. Everything tasted great and was prepared with care. Presentation of small plates was wonderful and the staff very friendly with expeditious service. Wine selection is top notch, go for the Greek Moschofilero wine. The meat and ham selections can have you drinking and chatting with your friends or romancing that special someone for hours."
"Bacon? Prosciutto? Bone Marrow? Deep Fried Everything? What a pleasure this place turned out to be. It's got an Avec vibe but in a bigger, wooden box and set to the soundtrack of some face-melting jams. There's so much going right about this place that this text box really can't contain it. My advice, try everything. If you don't have the budget? Try the chicken thighs, the mint dressing salad, and the deep-fried deviled egg. Oh and dessert, can't forget that. Try the olive oil soft serve paired with the brioche. Nicely diverse wine list, cheerful wait staff and (if you can handle it) communal seating. All hail the Pig."
"The idea of the restaurant is great, European style rich food and booze.  The part that kind of left me hanging was the Michigan Ave prices.  The food quality was a 4, the service a 5, and the prices a 2.  I'm good with properly cooking up the often thrown out parts of animals, but I don't think they should cost filet mignon prices."
"I can't believe I haven't written this review yet. I'm totally delinquent it seems. Anyway, maybe it's just me, but I don't like small plates. I feel like it's incredibly expensive to get enough food to feel full. But the Pig does have a pretty extensive wine list and a nice interior, so I don't discourage you from sampling their small plate fare."
"The food was delicious! Unfortunately, they do not take reservation and even though we were there on a Monday night we had to wait over an hour to get seated (for just 3 people). It was good food but I not good enough to wait that long again!"
"So I could have eaten that asparagus salad by the bucket and like everyone else here, loved the Braised Pork Shoulder.What I didn't like was having a wine suggested for me off the menu that cost $16/glass and that crispy black burnt bread just ""came like that."" (I'd been here before and the bread was not just 'like that.') Anyway, when we asked for something else to put our schmear on, they brought us a plate of sweet bread.  I'm sorry, but cucumber feta on sweet bread -- eww.  Later, the waitress admitted it was a bad batch of bread and there was nothing to be done about it. Some staff training might be helpful?Still, there's nothing else like this place around North Michigan.  And what's good about this place is great. I'm a fan."
"First time there last night. And a big thumbs up!  Wonderful service with great energy and knowledge about food and wine.  Tried new parts of the pig (ears and, yes, even tail) but it was  the pork shoulder braised in milk that really won us over!  Nice cheese selection with some interesting local choices.  Crowded but not overwhelmingly so and noise level was a trifle bit loud... If you're visiting Chicago this is a nice new addition to Michigan Ave..."
This was a great place to try something different.    We ordered several dishes and our favorites were roasted bone marrow smear and foie gras smear.  Mussels were good but not great.   Octopus with green beans and potatoes were delicious.   It was rather pricey for what you get but it was very fresh and tasty. The only dish we did not care for was broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette.   It was too salty.  The service was great and we will definitely be back to try different dishes.
"Two words:Bone Marrow.two more:Pig's earawesome.  fantastic.  tasty.  Agree with a reviewer who said ""tapas style"".  disagree strongly with ""hip"" as a designation.  or it would be sad if it were.  the pig is, ""a noble animal"" as Anthony B says.  May it always be so.Crowded and no N/A bier, but c'est la vie.  enjoy"
"The Purple Pig's dinner menu of small plates to share is a perfect solution for a light meal when you don't want to break the bank.  The menu was pretty extensive, with unique items, so we asked the waitress for recommendations.  Every item we shared was delicious, flavorful, and just enough bites to share.  On a warm summer weekend night, the wait for 2 to sit outside was about 1/2 hour, but we were able to get a glass of wine and sit on the nearby benches while waiting for a table - definitely a plus.  I will definitely go back in the summer and try a few other tasty dishes."
"Such a fun, bizarre restaurant. By bizarre, I mean the menu.   So many unique & delicious dishes. We sat at the bar & had a quick lunch before catching a tour. Sitting at the bar was totally entertaining as you can watch them preparing all of the unique dishes. My husband and i shared the pork jowl & the gigantic turkey leg. Both were amazing. Our neighbors ordered the meat platter & it looked amazing as well. Purple pig is an awesome place to have a fun, yet delicious lunch!"
"I was at the Purple Pig last week and I can't stop thinking about it.  It is the best restaurant I have been to in Chicago in a LONG TIME.  Better than Girl and the Goat.  I loved every single thing I tried so much it was almost a competition of dishes.  The chorizo stuffed olives...the peas with bacon...the turkey leg OMG...the tenderloin...the asparagus salad  and that orgasmic ricotta and chocolate filled donut!  Freakin' awesome!  Amazing outdoor seating too which is rare since it is on Michigan Ave.  Plus, it wasn't overrun with a bunch of tourists in their gym shoes and tight shorts.   Our server was also a part time doula, yoga instructor, and she wore cool earrings which added to the relaxed vibe.  If there is a heaven it might be the Purple Pig."
"Featured in Bon Appetite, small plates restaurant that features cheese, wine and swine. I had a yummy shaved Brussel Sprout, pecorino dish, along with machengo cheese on the side with pickled cherries. I paired it with a bright Jumilla wine. Great convivial dining concept."
Surprisingly veggie friendly! The cauliflower was amazing. So salty- in a good way! Also had the white bean smear. Tons of flavor. The server was awesome and knowledgeable about wine and the menu. He suggested a great bottle of wine. I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out!
"The first stop on the great Chicago pig out. We journeyed to Purple Pig on Sunday, the day after Xmas for some drinks and tastes.  The place was hopping and it is crowded even at 5:15pm.  We waited about 15 minutes for space for four and were seated at one of the communal tables. There are a couple of communal tables and then several smaller tables. It's a small place and feels chaotic and busy with people pushing by and waiters and busers quickly running around to clear and deposit plates. I guess that's one of the disadvantages of small plates; they all have to be picked up and deposited.  Most of the time I don't notice this so maybe it was either the feeling we were being rushed that made me pay more attention or the crowdedness of our communal table that made it feel like there was constantly a disruptive hand pulling away or putting down a plate.  We were handed menus, a drink menu with beer and wine, and a short food menu and the rather abrupt and pretentious waiter explained that they did primarily mediterranean wines.  We asked about cocktails and were told ""a few could be done"".  When we asked which few, he said, ""we have like three vodkas, two gins, one whiskey, etc"". I asked about a cocktail with cherry brandy and they couldn't do it. So, we settled on a bottle of Colombo Cotes de Rhones. For food, we ordered butternut squash, pork shoulder over mashed potatoes, and fried green olives stuffed with chorizo.  The food came quickly and our wine glasses were topped off with alacrity. The feeling was one of get people fed and out of here.And, the food showed a rushed hand.  The butternut squash was lukewarm and seemed to have been sitting for a while. It tasted fine, but we expected more.  The pork shoulder was also lukewarm and tough. This was a surprising disappointment. The mashed potatoes didn't even resemble mashed potatoes but more like a thick potato water slurry. Again, the taste was fine but the textures detracted from a good experience.  The olives were crisply fried and without any excess grease.  But, you couldn't taste the chorizo.  I almost would have preferred an olive without the chorizo.Overall, I would sum up the experienced as rushed, rough and chaotic. I'd go back again because reviews suggest we just must have gotten an off night."
"First of all, THANK YOU yelpers for the stellar reviews of the Purple Pig which led us there when we were home in Chi-town for the holidays. My husband & I had a phenomenal experience overall - the food is amazing, great beers & wines, fun atmosphere and awesome staff. We sat at the bar, which I'd totally recommend for a two-some. We could watch all the action happening with the cooks behind the bar & the attention from the bartender and other staff led to some great recommendations for items I usually wouldn't have chosen, but were SO glad we tried! Favorites: pig's ear (a MUST) and the pork neck rillette. The staff also had some great cheese and cured meat suggestions not on the menu, they have great recommendations for beer/wine as well. HIGHLY recommend this spot, can't wait to go back!"
"We were packed in there like a can of sardines, but it was so worth it! My friend's pork and mashed potatoes was my favorite dish, but everything we ordered was good. They ran out of the olives, though. Must go back and try them :)  Also, excellent muscat wine"
"I have to say I was a hesitant to say the least about going to The Purple Pig. When a place advertises itself as a cheese, wine and swine place it is not too enticing for a vegetarian to go to.Chefs Scott Harris of Mia Francesca, Jimmy Bannos Jr. and Jimmy Bannos Sr. of Heaven on Seven got together and created The Purple Pig. Jimmy Sr. was given the option to open up a restaurant in this centrally located high rise building with one set back. This is an all electric restaurant, no gas is allowed because it is a high rise. Setting that aside, all partners invested in top of the line kitchen appliances where flavour for sure would not be compromised. Jimmy Sr. basically explained to me that all of them have creative ideas with their dishes. The food presented here is anything goes for that day and what they can get their hands on. I love that. I found their menu very creative.The dishes are a collection of seasonal items current at the time. Most of the dishes are quite small in general (like tapas style) but I like that. This is a place where you could go for a quick bite to eat after work or have a short get together with your friends. Don't expect a quiet dinner for two here, it's not going to happen, it's actually quite loud and the setting reminds me of Avec a little bit.Their menu is diverse and there is something for everyone here, I loved it all. I loved the shaved Brussel Sprouts with Pecorino Noce and Parmigiano Reggiano. I'm from the land of Brussel Sprouts and who knew you could make a slaw out of them? Yummy! The Butternut Squash is to die for, this is a dessert dinner. Sweet yet seasoned just right to tap into your savoury senses also. They have wonderful tasty libations and the wait staff are quite knowledgeable in that dept. Their wine selection is awesome and I do suggest buying the 1/2 bottle selections etc. so you can sample quite a few.I had the opportunity to sample all their desserts and I in general am not in particular an ice cream fan. But...their soft serve Olive Oil Ice Cream was to die for. The Festa Di Santa Lucia Crema was awesome also. Wow I was stuffed afterwards!The downside of this place is it can get quite noisy sometimes and it gets very crowded near the door. There really isn't a waiting area and the toilets are also located right by the door, so it gets a little bit hectic over there. I'm sure at some point they will learn how to deal with the influx of people in that area. The heat/air sometimes blows on you also, making it a little bit uncomfortable when you are eating.Overall I love this place. the food is top quality and the staff are very friendly. It's something different on Michigan Ave for sure!"
"Tentative three stars. Would like to go back and try a few other things on the menu, however it's pretty pricey for what did look really good. Corn mushroom - not worth itBeets with goat cheese - favoriteFried deviled egg -egg was great salad was sour Octopus was good solid, may get again. Cheeses- truffle cheese was great but $6 for one cheese that's not that big of a serving seems like a ripoffProsciutto on bread with egg - deliciousWine- half bottle of axia for $28???. HALF bottle. Also pricey but perhaps the location is what you're partially paying for."
"This place has a different vibe than what you get at most place in Chicago.  It's casual chic and the crowd is generally really laid-back and happy (for lack of a better word).  Mostly young professionals and groups of friends.Food:  much like tapas, they come in small portions so you can order several different kinds and share.  I love pork belly and smears.  Those were really good!!  I must say, I didn't like the pork ears... there was little substance and I felt gross chewing on ear-shaped crispy ears.  Presentation tends to be rustic and simple.  The space is really cramped so you're likely to share a table with strangers and get bumped into now and then.  In general, I like to get out as soon as I'm done eating so that I can relax somewhere afterwards.  Service is generally hectic but quick.  I wouldn't say the waitresses are particularly friendly or eager to give you recos (they always look like they're in a rush) but it's not terrible.Overall, a decent and convenient place to grab a bite with friends."
"Great place to check out in Chicago, especially if you are open to trying new foods.  I would give it a five, but haven't loved a few of the dishes ...Prepare for a tight space and long wait - not the best place for groups and you won't have any privacy.The servers are enthusiastic and well informed.  The menu can vary bit I recommend the bone marrow  - don't forget the salt!"
"We stopped here for desert after eating at a (yikes!) great chain restaurant nearby. It is a little awkward to be sitting with a group of strangers at a table.  I am fine with ""communal style"" seating - but my husband -- not so much.  Therefore, I give the atmosphere an ok, not great, as my husband was a bit uncomfortable.  We only had coffee and dessert. Overall, service was ok, not good, not great - they were super busy (a Saturday Night at 10 pm!).  However, the dessert was very very good, which pushs my review to a 4 star. Try the Sicilian Iris!! It is like a Donut (they call it Brioche) filled with chocolate chip and ricotta cheese. Ummmmmm, I am drooling just thinking about it now."
"Perfect oasis from hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave for fellow wine and swine lovers. Atmosphere, Service and Food were all fantastic!"
"Rarely does a meal inspire me to log in to yelp, but this one did.  Start w Tara, our server and Joe, the God of The Purple Pig.  Without their assistance, our meal would not have been the same.  To start, whipped feta cucumber schmear, with perfectly yummy, warm bread.....along with an order of Salt-Roasted Beets withWhipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette.  Started with cava and these appetizers and it kept getting better.  Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley were unique and fabulous.    Next up were the ""a la planchas"", scallops, with toasted chickpeas and a chickpea Aioli (just a little on the side), AMAZING.....the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - comfort food even when over 100 degrees outside.  A fabulous white wine accompanied the ""main course"", artfully selected by Joe, who had a story of the wine to add to our enjoyment.  Even though we were stuffed, who could miss dessert?   Panino con Nutella(A Sweet Sandwich filled with a Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Marshmallow Cream & Bananas).  Need I say more?   Could be its own food group.  The mixed berry pastry was warm and luscious.  A perfect meal.  Will be back."
"Beet salad with whipped goat cheese and pistachios?  Feta and cucumbers smeared on bread? Octopus grilled to perfection? You can have all these wonderful things and more if you squeeze yourself into Purple Pig and pay too much for super small servings of wine. If those two things did not exist, this place would be four stars, hands down. I have to say a super positive thing about the service: super friendly - not what you would expect from an always jam-packed place."
"Oh so scrumptious. I am a sucker for a creative name, so that was the jump-off.. Also anything having to do with pig should surely nourish my cuban soul, and did it ever! We started with white wine to accompany our appetizers, which consisted of feta and cucumbers, and pig ear crisps under a fried egg. Thank u sweet baby pig geezus. Crack that yolk dowg, get it crackin. Then came the strange famous bone marrow, 1st step marrow spread on toast, then some salt on the marrow, last some of the green (salad) they supply to top it off. Crack. We ended with white wine and the sirloin tip entree... At this point we were quite inebriated (stopped prior to at English, awesome bar close by) and were jamming to the tunes they play in the restaurant, Biggie, Tupac, MGMT, etc. Bustling atmosphere, great food and music. Awesome place."
"The food was amazing. I love how knowledgeable my server was. her name was Natalia. She knew so much about the wine list and what foods would complement the wine etc and so forth. She was very helpful and when the appetizer we ordered was sold out, she brought us another option on the house! It was incredible. We loved Natalia and we will definitely ask for her to be our server next time.Thanks girl!"
"2nd time here, simply awesome!"
"The menu here is so inventive. A real culinary adventure. I would recommend the Shaved Brussel Sprouts with Pecorino & Parmigiano as a nice refreshing and light dish to go with all the yummy pork-laden dishes that you'll want gorge on. I'll admit that i didn't pig-out but fortunately, if you're not a huge bacon-eater, you can still find lots of swine-free dishes that won't leave you disappointed.  I can recommend the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio smear, which was heavenly, and the fried Prosciutto Bread Balls. Yummy and not greasy.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how delicious the Farro with Roasted Rutebega & Feta was.  Who knew?"
one btl Vernacchia seven plates no wait even when packed. Under a $100. Razor clams and Baccala not to be missed. Fried Brussles sprouts... rediculous. service quick but not rushed. Just Go Already. Seriously. GO!
"LOVE this place, and I'm no pork lover--I'm a vegetarian.  The vegetable dishes are fabulous and certainly no afterthought as they are at many restaurants that focus on meat.  Wonderful selection to choose from, especially loved the salted beets and whipped feta smear.  Bread is great, waiter kindly brought more when we ran out. My husband loved the tuna, I ate the spinach that came on the side which was very very good.For dessert we had the nutella sandwich, perfect ending to great dinner.  We will definitely be back sooner rather then later."
I will never miss this place if I am in the area.
"great bar/small plates atmosphere.  definately bringin' the animal fat.  tried bone marrow for the first time.  felt awful afterwards...it's just like terrible butter.  i've never had marrow before so i can't compare.BUTTERNUT SQUASH WAS AMAZING THOUGH. pigs ears were bleh.  the steak was a little tough.  the pork braised in milk was very tender, but everything here is (obvi) heavy.  another pork chop we had was pretty good.slowish service for large groups, and i got rained on by the server.  it's really loud so you have to enunciate, so forgivable, but very unpleasant."
"I love this place.my hubbie and I have gone every weekend for the last two months - always in the aftenoon for ""linner"" --- to avoid the crazy wait times for dinner.  We try to be seated with Lucas.  I love Lucas-he rocks!!! He decants our wine and gives us great suggestions on food/wine/dessert!!  He is higher energy and remembers what we like.  High quality food and service. I feel really happy being there.  The wine is awesome.  We tend to stick to our favorites: Bordeoux wine, salted beets, roasted butternut squash, cabbot cheddar, prosciutto, scallops, chicken kabobs, and bread pudding for dessert.   Yum, yum and yum!!"
I am sucker for fava beans in the summer. I avoid waiting in line for dinner and prefer to lunch here.
"With 300+ reviews already, Purple Pig really doesn't need my vote, but I'm posting anyway just so my friend see that we have eaten there. We met an out-of-town cousin there for dinner, and the three of us all agreed that it was an excellent dining option downtown. The wine list had a lot of interesting (and some reasonable priced) options, and the 8-9 dishes we tasted were consistently fantastic. I also agree that the noise levels and no reservations policy are cons, but the food warrants all five stars. You're going to pay higher prices downtown in general (unless you eat at the Marquette Inn), so you might as well go somewhere that takes its food seriously."
"Purple Pig has a surprisingly varied menu given its name, which is great for vegetarians. I've tried nearly all the non-meat options (including fish/shellfish) and while they are universally tasty, they are also very heavy. You can't really find anything healthy on the menu - even the salads have copious amounts of salt poured on them. The cheese plates are great (love a good cheese plate!), and the eggplant and goat cheese smear is incredible. I also loved the sepia, which is cuttlefish - I'd never tried it before, but it was delightful.The wine selection is great, and the service is also fantastic. I just wish they'd have a little lighter fare, for when one is not in the mood to eat an entire stick of butter in one sitting."
"Very good food, delightful menu, nice decor, good location, bizarre music and blah beer menu.  The food was very good.  Nice, inventive menu.  First time I have ever seen raw summer squash on a menu!  It was delicious.Overall the food gets an A.  Also, props for location (its a standout in the neighborhood), and outdoor seating.  Good waitstaff too. VERY loud and a complete mis-match between the music and the food/general ambiance.  The food/decor/overall theme seems to suggest a very classy, charming Spanish/European vibe.  Now, normally I don't notice the music much, but when you are eating tiny morsels of white bean and tuna off of a small plate and sipping a fancy beer, you generally do not expect to get Tupac blaring in your ears. I seriously heard that song from night at the roxberry - you know the one- sideways head jerk- at full volume.  WHY?  WHY?Luckily I was with my girlfriend and we thought it was mildly amusing, but man oh man, if I blew my weekly going out to eat $ on a date here and had to put up with deafening late 90's hits I would be pretty disappointed.Also, cramped space, but you can't fault them - its just a small place."
"It's all good. But $4 for the almonds fried in pig fat, with rosemary and garlic? Divine."
"Great wines, fun appetizers/starters, love the decor.  Will come back to try the entrees.  Very popular, so beware."
"While visiting Chicago the boyfriend and I ended up here with a friend.  I have to say it was definitely a NEW culinary experience for both of us.  If you are not adventurous with food or you are a health nut there are limited options.  Other than that it is a foodie's playground.  We tried all sorts of stuff...fried eggplant balls, some sort of cauliflower dish, mussels with pancetta (just to name a few).   It's like a tapas restaurant but with italian/mediterranean dishes.We were there on a Sat night and the place was PACKED!!!  The service was good, I can't say great, but solidly good considering how busy they were.  Three different times a server tried to bring us something we didn't order.  There was a joke between our group and the group next to us that a phantom table existed between us.  Be prepared to sit at a table with strangers.  Most of the restaurant is community seating, great if you like to chat with people and see what everyone else is having, not so great if you are not friendly.Best part, they are reasonably priced.  We ordered 7 or 8 items, two desserts, 3 beers, 1 glass of wine and tea and our bill was $130.  For 3 people, given how stuffed we were when we left, I'd say that's not bad at all.  I would definitely go back again to try more new stuff, but I'm keeping my boyfriend away from the lardo."
"If you are looking for a fun ambience and don't mind a wait, I recommend Purple Pig! However, the food didn't quite live up to my expectation - maybe because of how much hype the place has gotten. We had a cheese plate (delicious, I admit), then the pig's ear (moderate... not my favorite), the milk-braised pork shoulder (good texture but I wasn't crazy about the milk taste), and the s'mores sandwich for dessert (a big portion but definitely a fun way to wrap up the meal). I had a great glass of tempernillo that one of the awesome bartenders selected for me. Overall I would definitely go again, but more for the fun experience than for the actual food."
"It was an interesting experience, but would never go back. Tried the bone marrow spread that everybody was talking about...and it just tasted like grease to me. Had the pork shoulder-soft but nothing amazing. and the crispy pig ears-just tastes like crispy chips or something."
Great experience with wonderful food. The fried pig ear was one of our faves. 45 minute wait but worth it.  The staff was also great and very helpful. Super friendly across the board.
The food is phenomenal.  I especially enjoyed the artichoke anti pasta dish.  It's very much like a tapas bar.  Be prepared to pay accordingly.
"Purple Pig did not disappoint, as good as when I went last April.  The menu had a few carry-over items like the whipped feta and beets, but had a lot of new options as well.The wine selection is great, though the wine list needs a makeover as it is just too cluttered to read.  Our waiter did a great job of selecting our wines though.The whipped feta was again delicious, the roasted cauliflower was good though a bit ""pickley"", beets were delicious as ever, the mortadella smear was rich.  Another table had ordered desserts that looked delicious, will have to try those next time.Great service for a big lunch crowd!"
"This rustic, tapas-style Mediterranean hot spot is perfect for lunch, but expect a seriously long wait after 6 PM. I'm a big fan of the razor clams, olive oil-poached tuna, milk-braised pork shoulder, prosciutto bread balls, and bone marrow. You really can't go wrong."
"All I have to say is...considering this place is on the Mag Mile, it's a pretty decent bargain.Table of 3...8pm on a Friday night. No wait! I will say though...I believe this place is a cross of Avec and Mado.Communal tables. It was ok...a little cramped...and I didn't really bond with any other people sitting at my table...nor did my companions. Communal dining? I'd say I'm not really a fan. If I were at a cheapies place like Wagamama in London, I'd be fine...but seeing how I spent more that $10 on dinner...no.As for the menu...--A bottle of wine? Yes, please. And bc we were all indecisive about what we wanted, the waitress (friendly service!) allowed us to taste a couple types before we ordered.--Started off with the carrot, avocado, fennel salad. Honestly, I ordered this for all of us so we wouldn't feel so bad about eating meat...more like, ""Let's get our serving of veggies in now!"" Good salad though...I'd like to learn how to make it on my own,--Bone Marrow Spread...I have NO idea what it's truly called. The presentation...definitely was not expecting a couple pieces of bone with marrow still intact to which we had to dig it out with a little fork. I was expecting a little square side of pate. Was it tasty? Yes, delicious. My companion decided to suck all the marrow out...I would understand chicken bones but these were huge! And messy!--Pig tail. So disappointing! This could have had so much potential. Main downside. So much vinegar. That's all I could taste in the meat. Vinegar.--Pork Shoulder. Served on a bed of mashed potatoes. Tender. Melted in my mouth. Comfort food. I don't care how fatty it is or how big my hips will get after I eat a couple orders of these! Give me more!!--Pork pate. Typical pate. Yum. Pate. Mmm. Pate. I'm not really a good judge. I love all types of pate...so don't really take my word for it if it's good or not. Mmm. Pate.No dessert. Though I did picture something delicious like the chocolate bark at Mado. Well, after shelling out $ on retail therapy, I only spent $40 on dinner...just my portion. And we split it evenly...so three ppl, tip included, $120. Score! I'll be back again when I'm in the loop again."
"Amazing - went on a Saturday for lunch - lucky to sit at the bar.. Festive and friendly. The dishes didn't look like much, but woah! Knocked us out. Most dishes started with something familiar and added an unexpected, interesting and delicious something extra. Very good crisp white wine helped."
"Have been here many times and each meal has been excellent. I would give it 6 stars if I could. It's small (intimate) and often busy, so I'm always prepared to wait with a glass of wine. The braised milk pork shoulder, beets with goat cheese, cheese list, and smears are all excellent. Great wine and beer list. Communal tables and super-friendly staff who really take the time to explain the menu or suggest a wine make for a memorable meal every time!"
"Since this kind of food is everywhere right now, the service is what needs to push it over the top. Didn't really do that for me. My friend and I ordered a quartino of wine to see if we liked it before ordering more, and the waitress repeated ""A half bottle?"" No, a quartino. After that, she became decidedly less attentive to me and my friend, and much friendlier to the three ladies next to us with a full bottle. We ended up spending more than a half bottle would have been, but the impression was already set. I know how it is servers, you live and die by the booze. But put on your game face if I don't spring for a full bottle. I might just be sober enough to do the math and give you a really nice tip when I'm done."
"Only been here for wine on multiple occations; but the service has been exceptional. Busy, loud and needingly brave scene; it's easy to blend or be noticed here. Very nerdy cool. Wine list is ever changing and fun. The staff is educated and ready to make your night easy breasy. Be strong, be ready for a long wait during peak hours."
Horrible!  Way overpriced for Chicago.  Order never showed up while the kept pushing the overpriced drinks.  Never again.  Go to Eno across the street.
"We visited the Purple Pig in April on a VERY rainy night. The outdoor tented area was getting pounded with rain and high winds. This place came HIGHLY recommended by other Industry people at other bars and restaurants. We had to try it. Wine Selection was EXCELLENT and the Food - while seemingly focused on it's name sake - Pig, was tremendous. We are fans of Spanish style Tapas and figured that a Greek/Mediterrean take on the concept wouldnt be to far fetched. It's been a few months since our visit, but there's one dish that still makes my mouth water... The Pig Jawls, served with a fried egg on top... The pork just melted in your mouth and was a blast of flavor. There was also a Foie Gras and Quince Smear that was reminiscent of a high-end PBJ! A great dinner, atmosphere and price point. Only negative... I wasn't crazy about the service. Our waitress seemed to have disappeared. I'm sure that's not the norm. This place is a DEFINITE stop on my next visit to Chicago!"
"i loved this place, i went with a friend and ordered as much as we could eat and every thing was amazing, Hats off to the chefs they do a great job."
"Nice early lunch at the Purple Pig on Monday - it was empty when we arrived at 11:30, but by the time we left, it was packed!  It's awesome that they offer various sizes of wine pours, but we ended up ordering a bottle of prosecco.  Veggie dishes turned out to be the stars - salt roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette were really solid, and the butternut squash with parmesan and pumpkin seeds was deliciously seasonal.  The open-face fried egg BLT got rave reviews, as did the scallop spiedini.  Neck bone gravy with ricotta was absolutely as rich and tasty as it sounds.  My personal fave were the chicken thigh kebabs with fried potatoes and tzatziki - SO tender, with crispy skin.  Service was fine, despite our waitress having very little personality.  I would definitely go back - very cute place with yummy food!"
"This restaurant was a dream come true!  This was my first time in Chicago with some girlfriends and I was expecting nothing but pizza and more pizza.... but when I read about this place I knew I had to go.  The restaurant is inside of another building @ 500 Michigan Ave way in the back.  This place was hopping so right away you know you are in for a treat.  The tables are long and close together and they sit you with strangers but it goes with the whole mood of the restaurant so it works quite nicely.   The inside was pretty packed so they sat us in the outside tent area which was covered and nicely heated so we did not mind.  The menu is a little intimidating at first but our waiter was a great help.  The food is all small portions and it is meant to be shared.  There were four of us and we ordered 8 dishes.  Everything is reasonably priced as well and no dish is over about 10 bucks.  There was a ton of meat options but I am a pesco vegetarian and even I found food to eat...seafood and cheeses and olives and oooohhhhhhh so delicious.  The deviled eggs were unlike any egg I have ever had and I will forever dream of them.   They place is a MUST for a group of friends.  It is fun, unique, and an overall amazing dining experience.  Order a bottle of wine, a few different dishes, and enjoy."
"Very very good, particularly for the price. I highly recommend the pork shoulder. Im really only writing this review so i have an excuse to play with my new droid x... which is awesome!"
"Went here during Chicago heat wave and enjoyed the cool covered patio with fans circulating nice ventilation. Affordable tapas with knowledgable friendly staff. Delicious food- Not a bad thing on the menu. We had the beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios, smears and meatball slider- all fabulous. Can't wait to go back."
"My boyfriend and I were recently in Chicago and spotted the Purple Pig. It was not on our agenda but we decided to stop in for a bottle of wine. Once we were there it was impossible not to get more. We had lots of wine, lattes, and an amazing dessert that consisted of marshmallow cream, nutella, bananas, and powdered sugar all in one! The service was outstanding. We had to come back for more so we came in for a second try. We ended up ordering way too much food but it was so worth it. The pork dish with mashed potatoes was outstanding as were all of the other entrees we had. We were not disappointed with anything. We had the same server, Elvis, and he was great! Very friendly and remembered us from the beginning of the week! This place was a little tucked back so I am so glad we found it! If you are in Chicago you have to try it!!"
"Mmmm Purple Pig! My boyfriend is absolutely obsessed...I think he's been here about 5 times since moving to Chicago in August, and I've been here twice while visiting him.Favorite dishes include the pork rillette, which some friends have fondly dubbed ""meat nutella"" due to its spreadable deliciousness (not because it tastes like chocolate), the milk-braised pork shoulder, the OCTOPUS (totally delicious and meaty-tasting since it's cooked over a wood grill), the beets with whipped goat cheese, the chicken skewers w/ tzatziki sauce, and the fried chorizo-stuffed olives.Really, there isn't a bad thing on the menu that I've tried. Just order 2 plates per person, and go to town!"
"Just came back from a trip to Chicago two days ago and already miss the amazing food at The Purple Pig. Was definitely one of the highlights to my Chicago trip with my family. Every dish we shared was absolutely incredible. The milk-braised pork shoulder is a MUST-HAVE. It was seriously, to DIE for good! Another standout dish from all the amazing dishes we had was the roasted corn. Sounded so simply, yet amazing flavour packed into such a small dish and could not stop eating it! Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive, making our Purple Pig experience even better. If you still have room for dessert, the Sicilian Iris is seriously GOOD! It takes a bit of a wait for them to make, but definitely worth it! Also, the whole concept of sharing all the foods is a great way to try a ton of different dishes and flavours for still an amazing price! The three of us had 10 different dishes and wine for about $100. It doesn't get better then that! Can't wait to go back to Chicago just to eat at The Purple Pig again :)"
"I tried to go here with my fiance and a friend on a Thursday night, but it was so loud and crowded that we had to bail. As it was right down the street from our hotel, though, we decided to give it another try for a late-afternoon lunch on Friday.Despite being almost off-putting in its trendiness, the food was tasty and sitting outside at the communal tables on the patio on a beautiful spring afternoon made for a very pleasant experience. I didn't try any of the wine, but their list was interesting and my fiance enjoyed his glass.We shared:- pork friend almonds with rosemary -- so good and so rich, I almost made myself sick eating them- peas, bacon, spearmint, pecorino salad -- one of my favorites because of its relative lightness-- house-cured meat: this was the only one that was sort of a let-down. just kind of boring.-- milk-braised pork shoulder -- this was really the star of the meal, absolutely delicious, aromatic and wonderful-- mussells with pancetta -- surprisingly good mussels (who knew you could get these in Chicago?)"
I was here for happy hour and it's a nice place to come if you work nearby.  The small plates are tasty and they have a good selection of wine.
"This place was unbelievably good. Randomly came across it and it looked busy so I went in. I got sat next to a very nice woman at the bar who was alone and  since everything was small plates we decoded to share. OK enough back story. Beet salad awesome. Fried manchengo one of the best things I've ever eaten fried and I'm a sucker for fried pickles (not they have them but I thought you should know). Moved onto bone marrow, great. Ended with pork shoulder which was not the show standout but was the perfect final course. I need to randomly meet someone next time I come here because so much other good food came out  I didn't get to try. Oh and good luck to the lady I met her baby is due in January."
"Love the concept, love the hours, love the food, love the staff, kinda hate the location."
"I can honestly say this is one of the best places I have ever eaten at. Their cheese plates are to die for, theiir beets are amazing and of course their meat is incredible. Can get pricey but well worth the money. Service was also great. You should make a reservation if you are going, they are usually packed."
"Purple Pig was very good! The ambience is cool, but its always packed! I went on a Thursday around 530pm and it was just beginning to get really packed. They say its European food served in tapas style. That was cool cause what i like about that is that we try so many different dishes. Everything was pretty good. The things I can say you should try are the pork shoulder its so tender and its covered in a tasty gravy sauce.  They also serve a bruschetta type of plate i think it starts off with something called mordetta which i believe is some kind of cheese. Everything we had was pretty good. Sometimes I go to these new restaurants and don't really  know how i feel about them, but what I can tell is whether their ingredients are fresh and prepared to order. These were all very fresh ingredients and nothing chewy or anything that I had to take out of my mouth and put at the side of my plate!! hahah.  I'll definitely go b ack to try different things here. ALSO its not really even that expensive for a place on Michigan Ave. I spent $70 for 4 beers and like 6 dishes! plus tip of course."
"Went here for dinner with friends on a cold cold Saturday night in Chicago 1/16/10.   The staff was really friendly and we had about a 1/2 hour wait (even though we were told about 45 min).They had a nice wine selection and great menu options for cheese, meats, and entrées.  We ordered 3 cheeses for $14 and 3 different types of meats to start our dinner (obviously we ordered wine).  When the cheese platter came, it only had 3 small slices of cheese and a VERY small amount of meat.  At first, I thought that the meat on the cheese plate was part of the cheese plate and not the meat that we ordered.  When our waiter came by to check if everything was okay, I asked if this was the meats we ordered, to which he replied ""yes"".  I was shocked at how little (and I mean little) meat they give you, esp for the price.  It was very tasty, but not much to taste.  Obviously, you can order more, but it adds up quickly.  The pork entre was my favorite, a big winner!  If I could order all over, I would have stuck to the cheese platter and entre and skipped the deli meat section.  Also, regarding the wine, the sommelier was very accurate in his descriptions of the wines on the menu, so if you are craving a certain type of wine, describe it to him and you will get exactly what you're craving!  All in all, I recommend this place and I will be back, if I'm ever in Chicago again!"
"Awesome!!!  Everything was great. Bone marrow, lardo and brussel spouts all great. The nutella, marshmallow and banana panini was the perfect ending to a great meal."
"Great food, great atmosphere sitting outdoor in a summer night! Love the bone marrow and pig ear and the pork chop!"
"Finally a good restaurant on Michigan Avenue! The Purple Pig is foodie heaven in tourist central. The food is tasty - we really liked the pate, but unfortunately they were out of pig ears when we went, which was a bummer. The only two things that make me hesitant to go here more often are its size - it's really tiny and feels so cramped - and the high communal table we sat at, which was difficult to climb up and not comfortable at all. Go here expecting a wait, and if you can, try to grab one of the normal people tables; the high table is great for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but not petite ladies like me!"
"I wish I could give three and a half stars, but three will have to do. Had dinner with friends at Purple Pig on a Tuesday night. Purple Pig is essentially a victim of its own success, because most of my ""cons"" have to do with the fact that so many people want to eat there.Pros: good food, with decent prices. I particularly recommend the whipped feta smear, the milk braised pork shoulder, any of the cheeses, and the silician iris for dessert (ricotta and chocolate chips inside a fried brioche: heaven!). Nice to have something different on Michigan Ave. nice looking space, with a lively atmosphere. Bonus points for the particularly good, and varied, background music. we had excellent service. Our waitress was fun (wish I'd gotten her name), busboys attentive, etc.Cons: the space is very small, which leads to a very crowded evening. Our group of 4 sat at a communal table, with parties on either side of us. I don't mind sitting at a communal table, but there were too many people squeezed in. the WAIT! We waited for an hour and a quarter on a Tuesday night (arrived at 7, seated at 8:15). We might not have even stayed to wait that long except one of the group is moving out of town and really wanted to try it. They don't take reservations, and won't seat your party until everyone is there. I understand the policy of not seating until the whole party has arrived, but I don't have to like it. The space is so small there is essentially no place to wait inside: I don't know what they are going to do in the winter, when it will be impossible to wait outside. Overall, if they took (and honored) reservations, this would be a four star review, hands down (maybe even a five). But the crowded room and the very long wait downgrade it to three and a half starts. Don't let it stop you from going, but I wouldn't even consider going on a Thursday through Sunday. A fun experience, with very good food, and perhaps a place to take out of towners. Just be prepared to wait, and then be squeezed in."
"Here is another spot I never reviewed before I moved and OMG I loved it. I would sprint there after work to try and snag a table for wine and food. I have never once been disapointed with food or service, my only disapointment has been that I can't get a table!"
"Absolutely fantastic experience.  Went there for lunch and sat at the communal table (party of 3) comfortably.  Service was wonderful: attentive but not too much; GREAT suggestions; everything our server suggested was exceptional.  Variety of cheeses and in-house cured meats (let the server choose); delicious brioche served with it (asking for more bread was not an issue).  No idea calamari could be so delicious, tender, and refreshing!  Very innovative dish.  A lovely variety of foods for all palettes.  Highly suggested."
I love Purple Pig!  The charred cauliflower and the turkey leg are amazing!
"So good!  It is how dinner should be everywhere!  Just off Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River.  Extensive wine list, amazing dishes like raw corn & tomatoes with arugula pesto, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes that will melt in your mouth, and octopus with summer beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde.  Sounds simple however masterfully put together."
"I'm only giving this 3 stars because I think I didn't order the best items on the menu and am willing to give it one more try.  My friend and I ordered several items, but our unanimous favorite was the butternut squash appetizer, believe it or not.  We also tried the sepia, pork fried almonds, Insalata Bianca, prosciutto bread balls, and deviled eggs.   All of those were fine, maybe even pretty good, but we were not blown away.  The prosciutto bread balls were even kind of too salty.  Like I said, one more try and that's it."
"YUM....delicious Barcelona-style tapas, and an awesome wine list. Very crowded and you'll wait forever for a table but lots of great people watching and the food is SO delicious and interesting."
"Awesome tapas and wine list. I would recommend sitting at the bar for the best service (we liked it so much we came twice during our trip to Chicago). The first time at the bar was better, but the food easily outweighed the spotty service."
"I dined here last night with a couple friends and had a blast!  We all had a difficult time locating it since its hidden inside an unassuming office building....go through the revolving doors up the stairs past the security guard on your left down the hallway and through the door. Voila! Super small space with limited amount of tables, open kitchen for all to see, so we opted for the bar with the best view.  Great wine list and super helpful bartender who eagerly let us sip and taste multiple wines before committing, multiple times.  The food menu has many different choices with nothing over $17, and that's just one item.  The majority of the tapas is $7-$9! Score.  What was even better is that the size of the tapas was bigger than a pea!! Yeah!!  Standouts: whipped feta with cucumber, shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino, milk fed braised pork shoulder, charred green onions.  Not that amazing but still good: rapini with whipped ricotta, pork fried almonds, fried pigs tail with fried kale....I was hoping for a little more flavor to be going on in that dish.  It just tasted, well, fried.Easy on the wallet, good food, great wine list, friendly service, cute atmosphere= makes you think you're somewhere else other than downtown...and that, I like!"
"The food here is unbelievably delicious!! If you get here late on weeknights or weekends this place is packed beyond imagination...so be prepared to wait at least an hour o be seated. But trust me it'll be worth the wait. Also, be ready to make new friends because 80% of tables are shared seating"
"Wine, Meat, and Cheese. I mean could it really get any better than that?! Came a couple weeks ago with some girlfriends after work. Has communal tables it was a bit tight for us, but I didn't mind.  Had some great malbec, which I got 4 glasses of, whoops...as did my friend, we should have just gotten a bottle. oh well. Cheese plate was good as any cheese plate to me really is, Brussel sprouts were my favorite, actually we got a ton of small plates between 5 of us, and every single one was good. I can't wait to come back!  oh and olive oil ice cream, is a MUST"
"Love this place.  Love the crispy fried ears, the cheese plate, the beets with goat cheese, etc. etc. etc.  Only bad thing is that it gets really crowded and can be hard to find a seat."
"As those that have read my other reviews would know, pork products are one of my great loves. Well, you would imagine then that I would love the Purple Pig. Well, I thoroughly liked it. My wife, some friends of mine, went on a Friday night for drinks and eats. Despite the crowd, our service was impeccable, thanks Brooke. Our orders were taken quickly and it was only moments before our food and drinks were brought to our table. The food was very tasty, I had the fried olives stuffed with chorizo as an appetizer and the porcetta with salsa verde panini. I was in Hog Heaven! As for beer, the selection is very limited but it is very good with a focus on European imports. I had the Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock which is a spring bock. It was a very crisp beer, very flavorful but not very heavy. I would recoomed all three of these items. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, though when we got there it was storming and only the committed stayed on the patio. Inside the restaurant has a strong high end pub feel, lots of wood, big bar, and tall tables. It was very comfortable and I would imagine on other days it would seem cozy. But on a Friday night with a thunderstorm, the number of people inside it was very crowded and loud. It was very hard to hear people sitting across the table from me and so the experience was slightly lacking. One other suggestion, as any Chicagoan should know, don't drive. Of course, I was being dumb and we drove because we were running late after work. Access to it is only off the Mag Mile and so parking is non-existent unless you park in garages that charge an arm and a leg. The Purple Pig does validate but when we were there they did not have any validated cards available for the garage we were in. Other than those small things this was a very good experience and I will return."
"I think I was expecting a lot more from this place. Service was fine but I was not too impressed with the food. Although I did like the beets with goat cheese, the pig ears were nothing to rave about. They were pretty much very thin slices with an egg on top. I must not have read that in the description otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it, I really was expecting to see larger pieces. We had a few other plates but nothing that stood out."
"A pork lovers paradise!!  I went with my best friend and her family for dinner. We were promptly greeted by a waiter who was delightful and attentive. We were told that everything on the menu is set up to be shared, kind of like Tapas. The prices range from 6.99 to 24.00. We tried the Lardo Crostini, Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago and Salami Toscana, and Sopressata. The Lardo Crostini melted in your mouth. We then decided to order Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg, Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and Fried Smelt with Lemon Aioli Sardines with Lemon Vinaigrette. The Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg was to die for. After the first bite, my best friend had a look in his eye that I have never seen before.  The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes was fork tender and so good I am pretty sure you would ask for it as your last meal if you were on death row. The mashed potatoes were average, ask your waiter for no mashed potatoes, substitute it for more pork shoulder.  Definitely give The Purple Pig a try."
"I loved this place. First, the crowded, noisy vibe, and long waits coordinated by  patient and friendly personnel fosters a euphoric dining experience. Go figure. It's just plain fun. Eclectic wine list with great choices. Had a smooth Burgundy recommended by the server who knew her stuff. Shared many small plates among a group of seven. Loved the pork shoulder, squash, beets, prosciutto balls, artichokes, cheese offerings. One suggestion:serve some good bread. The owners are friendly and gracious. Kudos to Jim and Jim Banos Jr. Great food, great fun, great evening."
"Mixed review. The cuke with feta, delish--the salad with hazelnuts wonderful. The server came after we'd had our first round and asked, ""Dessert?"" We had to say, no, first we wanted our meal. Given the person who takes the order, doesn't deliver--she had NO idea. When the pork appeared in a small plate before us, I thought I'd died. My stomach did a 180 and I passed on this rather slimy appearing selection."
Didn't try the food but I ordered a GREAT Italian Stout - forgot the name. The couple next to me ordered lunch and it looked great. The Bartender was great in suggesting the beer. Killed about an hour waiting on my wife and kid at American Girl. Next time I'll go with an appitite
"Beautiful sunny afternoon outside at a large, friendly,  family table enjoying a glass of Sicilian white wine recommend by a knowledgeable waiter.  Small plates were well prepared, different and filled my pallet  with new flavors.  Try the almonds, beets and even the roasted marrow.   Great vibes, friendly,  making you feel like you are in a European bistro.  An enjoyable afternoon or evening.  Would go back.  Very much fun, even more so on a warm sunny day."
"Amazing food, fun atmosphere, great wine list that doesn't break the bank. Some snout to tail eating (pigs ears yum! Think slightly crunchy potatoe chips) The beets were oustanding and I enjoyed the fresh flavors on the Mint and Pea Arancini. We also got the roasted marrow which you spread like butter on bread and then top with vinegary herbs to cut the fat. Everything was fantastic!Wines come by glass, by .25 liter, .5 or whole bottles, so you can try different wines and everything was quite reasonable. Add great service and a groovy casual vibe and this is our most memorable meal in Chicago and one of the top meals I have ever had, I believe!"
"My new favorite restaurant!  Everything here was perfect.  Amazing outdoor seating in the heart of the Gold Coast.  Wonderful wine list and very helpful staff who actually suggested a more reasonable bottle of wine than the one we were considering.  The food was just perfect and presentation was right on.  I honestly adored everything that we ate, and we ate a lot!  I have to say it was very reasonable as well.  I will definitely be back a lot this summer...what a great place!!"
"3.5 but i am easily swayed by peer pressure so i'll give it a 4, to keep in step with the crowd... the fried mussels are tasty, but the fried pig ears are so thin that they could basically be anything and b/c they're so thin, i feel like the fried part is not substantial enough and too tough...i wasnt a huge fan of the the bone marrow smear as i could barely taste the stuff... i might try it again by ordering a plate just for myself...the best deal by far was the pork blade steak, which was a nice size and very juicy and tasty and 13 bucks...pig's tails braised in balsamic was pretty meager in size but tasty, although some people might just say it was ox tail in vinegar...all in all, i would def go again as its also a cool people watching atmosphere for the time being at least..."
"Ate here last week with a friend.  Really great food, outstanding bone marrow and must-try beet and goat cheese app.  Pricey and crowded.  Wait too long for the hype.  What earns it four stars is the extensive wine list and the excellent waiter, who talked us through the menu, was patient, kind and helpful.  Would come back again with a large group- would be less pricey to split between more people.  But probably more of a wait..."
"I came to this place because it has the word PURPLE in it's name, and I love me all things purple. That and because it was the only place I could  find along Michigan Avenue besides all the retail stores and chain food spots. I was not disappointed! I opted for cocktails, though their wine list is extensive. I managed to sample several dishes (courtesy of the nice ladies sitting next to me at the bar), including: the olive oil pouched tuna and greek lima beans, the housemade greek sausage with rapini and grapes, and the eggplant capanota with goat cheese. All very delicious! Also had some pretty yummy cheeses, but I can't tell you which ones they were. All in all, I'd recommend this spot. It could get pricey though, depending on much wine and how many dishes you order. But very tasty/ worth it."
"This place is amazing! I went based on a recommendation and I am so glad I went. Me and my fiance sat at the bar, which was perfect because the bartender was so knowledgeable helpful and friendly. Everything we tried on the menu was delicious and the wine selection is great. If you are into wine bars this is definitely a place worth checking out."
"Thanks to The Purple Pig, I am on the hunt for exceptionally prepared pork.  My friends and I enjoyed the pig's ear - crunch, well-flavored and very rich!  We also tried the pork shoulder - it was like butter.  The seating allows you to socialize with other patrons and check out the selections they ordered.  I can't wait to return with my husband.  When the establishment is full, it is a bit loud, so be prepared.  We didn't really know what to order, but the server was very helpful.  She recommended a number of wonderful dishes and suggested wine for pairing.  It is a small plates type of place, but you can share or not."
"I was SOO excited to try this place, but it was really mediocre at best unfortunately. I recently went to Girl & The Goat, and Maude's Liquor Bar and had incredibly amazing food, ambiance, and service for the same price point...this seemed, really average. Nothing stood out flavor wise, it kind of felt like I would have been impressed had I never had a high quality dining experience aka spent my nights out at Applebees. And the restaurant atmosphere was too chaotic, and our waiter, while nice, was kind of a mess. He forgot a few things which is fine, everyone has a bad night. But my boyfriend brought me there for my birthday and thought of a really clever way to tell the waiter so he could bring a piece of cake or some kind of dessert, he wrote ""it's her birthday"" on his phone, showed it to the waiter pretending to have a question about a dish he saw online but not on the menu. The waiter was like, Oh oh oh ok! Walked off, and never brought us anything, nor did he even ask if we wanted dessert, he just brought the check, LOL."
the food was unique and excellent.
"A fun and delicious place to eat!  Right off of Michigan Avenue, The Purple Pig has great sharable sized portions.  My absolute favorite is the pork shoulder and mashed potatoes...it melts in your mouth, and I am always tempted to place another order!  They have an extensive wine list, and knowledgeable staff that is happy to make recommendations since the list can be a little overwhelming.  They have adventurous dishes like bone marrow and pig ear, and more generic dishes like chicken kebabs and sausage.  But, each dish was very good and well prepared and presented.  I am not a big dessert fan, but the nutella panini with bananas and marshmallow was great!  They do not take reservations - however, it is well worth the wait!"

"Had a really nice date here.  Great for lunch (haven't tried dinner yet).  We sat outside on the little patio, which was pretty good for people watching.  Good for small plates and sharing.  Great wine list.  Loved the bone marrow, also loved the crispy pigs ear with kale.  The fried deviled egg was just so wrong it was right, if you know what I mean.  So bad for me, but I wanted more. And they have lardo.  Something you don't find just anywhere, and so freakin' good.  There are some great vegetarian options (but vegans should steer clear)- fava bean/ricotta spread, paninis, etc.  Service was also good, but the popularity of this place can mean a longer wait."
"With over 150 reviews for this place and most either four or five stars I don't think I need to add any more fuel to this fire. It's excellent small plate food that's meat, egg, and cheese heavy. There is absolutely no waiting space so be prepared to wait outside or put your name in and stroll Michigan Ave for some time. The beer list is a little small, but for what they carry it's some good stuff. I look forward to coming back here more often."
It's a boisterous atmosphere offering small plates that were well constructed.  Great variety of European wines to select from but don't expect to see any on the menu from California. I reccomend the pork main plate.
"I had such high hopes for The Purple Pig and wanted SO badly to like it that I think I got a little carried away with my expectations.  My posse and I chose The Purple Pig to have dinner at before going to Avenue Q a few Saturdays ago.  We got there around 5:45 pm hoping that we could beat some of the dinner crowd.  We were mildly successful, as we were squished, er...seated at one of the tall communal tables in the center of the small-ish restaurant after about 20 mins. I'm still trying to decide if it was just part of the experience, the night, or something else, but the service was below average at best.  After we sat down and were given our menus, it was probably about 15 mins before our waitress came over to ask for our order.  Since it's obviously awkward to order at a communal table, and it was loud in there, she came to my side of the table and said ""Hey guys"" and just stood there.  Uh....after a few moments of awkward silence I asked her about the menu...what she recommended for our cheese plate, if we ordered everything at once, etc.  She was a little TOO casual about the ordering process and didn't really give many helpful suggestions, like how much food would probably be enough for our party of four.  I ordered our cheese plate, Prosciutto di Parma the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic and Prosciutto Bread Balls to start. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks...so I had to flag her down again, then two more times to ask her for the water that was only delivered to two of us when we first sat down.Our food came decently fast.  The cheese plate was delicious, even though we had to ask for more bread because they have only given us three small slices (for four people?!?).  The Pork Fried Almonds were sinfully salty, greasy and good.  The bread balls were smaller than I thought they would be, but crispy and satisfying nonetheless.  Our second round was the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey, Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes.  The braised pork shoulder was by far my favorite...tender and flavorful and the mash potatoes made a perfect dipping sauce.  The Pork Blade was a little dry for me,  and the pigs tails were okay--but I felt there wasn't much meat to them to make them a plate on their own.I would have thought all that would have been enough for four people- but I should put a big emphasis on the fact that they were small plates.  I was actually still a little hungry, and for each of us to have paid around $35 bucks I would have hoped that we would have at least been full, if not stuffed.  Duh, we could have ordered more...but it was time to get to the play.  I think our entire experience might have been a bit better if the service had been a bit better.  At least I can say I've been!"
"Shh! Don't tell anyone about this incredible place! When a restaurant gets it right, I have to rave, and The Purple Pig gets it right! Being an Iowa Girl, I love pork. They obviously love it too. From the name throughout the menu they have honored swine.       I started with ""Pork-Fried Almonds with Rosemary"" served warm in a bowl, accompanied by a chocolatey-nutty dark beer while I waited for my friend to arrive. She was hungry and we both wanted to try so many things that we opted not to have a traditional dinner, but instead sample a number of smaller items. This was easy to do. Three-quarters of the menu is geared toward the casual diner with excellent selections of antipasti, schmears, and a whole section of  ""fried items"". We ordered ""Beets with Goat Cheese & Pastachios"" and ""Baby Artichokes & Fingerling Potatoes"", but the coup-de-gras was the ""Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs""!!! Okay. Beets and Bone Marrow? You either love them or hate them. I love them and I will go back again and again just to have them the way The Purple Pig makes them. It will be hard because I want to try everything on the whole menu--that's how much I trust them in the kitchen. If they can win me over a couple of really distinctive dishes, I know they've figured out the best way to serve the rest!     Now for the rest of the good news. Their location is a god-send for me. I work on Mag Mile and, although there are some great restaurants in the hood, they all seem to have that touristy bend to them. You'll find tourists at the Pig, too, I'm sure, but this place has a different feeling. The focus seems to be on the food and drink not on packing in the tourists or on money, money, money. The prices and portions are reasonable for the location. They've hired good people. Everyone was professional. They're a bit small in size (perfect to my taste-never liked big cavernous places) so it gets filled quickly and they don't take resos. Outdoor seating is much quieter than the inside, even with the sirens and street noise. Thanks for a great Mag Mile option!!!"
"I will start out the review by saying the food was great.  I know a lot of people (myself included) scan the first sentence of Yelp reviews for restaurant recommendations so no real problems with the food. The night started out pretty rough. The hostess stand is right inside the door but you have to get to that by walking through the outdoor patio and it's not really a hostess stand, it's just one of those tables where servers usually enter orders.  We were shuffled inside by someone that when I started to ask where to put in our name, directed me to the bathroom.Once I had toured the restaurant, and realized my/her mistake I made my way to the hostess stand.  We put our name in and she started to show us to our table but realized the third member of our party had not yet arrived and about as rudely as possible, told us they did not seat incomplete parties.  A little stunned (since our table was ready, and would remain so until we sat) we went to sit outside and wait for our friend.  I get the policy if you have a party of 25 and 2 of them have not yet arrived, but 3?  When it started pouring (there is no sheltered waiting area, we thought surely she would reconsider seating us.  ""What if we promise to order an extra cocktail and start ordering food.""  Alas, she upheld the rules and three seats sat vacant for another 15 minutes.  Like I said before, the food was great.  My only real complaint is that everything was super greasy.  They should incorporate some celery or carrots to cut the grease between plates.  Stupidly bad service, too cramped, but the food was good enough that I'll go back."
"OK. If you dig the pig then this is a spot for you. Reasonably priced, good sized tapas with knowledgable and friendly staff. Everything we had we delish, but be sure to get the milk braised pork shoulder. Yummo!  (Get the paninis if you are hungry. They are quite large. )"
"My friends and I happened to stumble across The Purple Pig when we were looking for after dinner drinks and desert on a Thursday evening.  The service was great (our waiter was energetic, but not over the top, and provided suggestions on what food items went well with our wine choice.)  They were out of several items on the menu, but there were still many delicious choices.  We ordered the grilled cheese sandwich/panini of the day and bone marrow w/ crostini to snack on; both were excellent!  For dessert we shared the panini con nutella (nutella, marshmallow fluff, & bananas)... YUM!  Will definitely be going back to the Purple Pig soon!"
"Hello loud restaurant.  Yes, it was a Thursday and there were a ton of people.  But, it wasnt the people that were so loud, it was the music.  Turn it down please!  I was with two people sitting at the end of one of the high top communal tables and we were having to yell at each other.  Thank goodness the people watching was good, because we certainly did a lot of that.  Now on to the food- not too shabby.  We were obsessed with the pork shoulder.  Ordered it twice because it was so tender and perfectly cooked.  I even ordered another to bring home to the boy.  Also had the fried manchego which was alright.  Just didnt live up to the hype from other reviews.  We did enjoy a few of the smears, which are not what one would expect.  They were more bruschetta like- bread or similar carrier loaded with toppings.  We ordered a few of those and enjoyed them very much.  Overall, the food was good and I might be back, but it will probably be on a Monday night when there are less people and we might be able to convince someone to turn the music down."
"My boyfriend and I heard from ALL of our foodie friends that The Purple Pig is THE place to go and WOW they were right! They don't take reservations so we arrived pretty early, around 6pm on a Wednesday night and they were already filling up. Our server was AWESOME, I think his name was Dan but the ticket said Elvis so I'm not officially sure but he was fantastic! VERY knowledgeable, warm, attentive, and efficient for how loud and busy this place was. (We like the loud crowd, and were definitely impressed that our server was able to convey his great knowledge and personality considering how bustling it was!) His wine reccomendation was spot on and I definitely enjoyed every drop, of all three glasses! (Yes, I had a DD, and when a place's slogan is Cheese, Wine & Swine, I'm going to indulge in every gluttonous bite possible!) Ok so the service was perfect, the ambiance and vibe was great, and the wine rocked, let's get down to business: THE FOOD was FAB! We ordered so much I can hardly keep track! The pork shoulder was the best thing on the menu, and the bone marrow was great! The beets and goat cheese are a must, and the pig ear was good too, though a touch on the salty side. The cauliflower was wonderful, and the turkey leg was great (in mid-evil proportions!) I loved the deviled egg and the strawberry fro-yo dessert. We ate at the Goat last night and I still cannot decide which one I like better, so I think I want to go back to the Purple Pig for a tie breaker! Don't hesitate, go to the Purple Pig and enjoy the friendly family style vibe, great wine and incredible culinary delights!!!"
"great wine selection.. great food and very friendly staff. we order 5 items and a bottle of wine, 3 girl 40$ each .. we'll be back next time we visit chicago"
Amazing food and wonderful service
"Been here lots of times the last few months. Still love it! Get the steak. Get the proscuitto bread balls. Get wine by the bottle. I wish they took reservations! I usually have to wait to get a table, very crowded. At least they were kind enough to send a server around the place to see if anyone who was waiting needed a drink!"
"This place was as good as the reviews rave! Everything was phenom; the chorizo stuffed fried olives, prosciutto balls, braised pork shoulder, and chicken thigh kabobs were out of this world! The servers were very knowledgeable and fun, the hosts' were super accommodating... the bartenders were rude and ignored everyone waiting for tables....other than that...wait for drinks til you sit at your seat, your server deserves the tips!"
"I had a wonderful experience here and can't wait to go back! It has a very intimate, yet casual atmosphere. The service was wonderful (waiter very cute and friendly) and the food far exceeded my expectations. The butternut squash was the most amazing and the wine list was great. LOVE this place."
"Nice location off Michigan Avenue, has small portions and great cheese and wine list, this place was fun and the food was great!"
Went here for a late dinner and had the best time!  The food was creative and delicious!!!!  Try the bone marrow......
"So happy this place opened near my apartment.  I have been a few times and never disappointed.  They have a TON of wine/beer choices and all food is great for sharing.  Beet salad is a fave, so was some fish dish with coleslaw.  Their gelato is great too.  It is also pretty reasonably priced. Outdoor patio is great!"
"Pretty tough to only give the Purple Pig 3 stars.  I suppose the grade is a value decision.  I spent a lot of money.  I had a great time, but there are other things I could have done with the loot.Tips:- It was really crowded.  I suppose that is a good sign usually.  But not for a date.  Pretty difficult to be romantic when you are surrounded by tourists.- They offer half bottles of wine.  That was cool.- The bone marrow spread was awesome.  Not something that you have everyday, but it was well worth it.- All the portions were pretty tiny."
"Really good food and a good time.  I was surprised.  The place was packed on St. Patrick's but we were lucky enough to be seated pretty quickly.  Ordered 2-3 dishes per person, each costing $5-12, and everything was honestly amazing.  Liver pate was my personal favorite, along with the beets + goat cheese.  They've got some good beers on tap, and I don't know anything about wine but judging from the book they give you they've got a lot of them.  Service was great, and we ended up staying until closing time.  Can't wait to go back."
"The Purple Pig serves amazingly good small plates with a pig-centric theme.  It's possibly my favorite place to eat in Chicago.  All the dishes are delicious.  My favorites were the bone marrow, the neckbone rillette schmear, and the pork shoulder.  The wine list is excellent as well, and the beer selection is pretty diverse and tasty too.  I haven't really explored the cheeses, but the ones that I have tried are what you expect (it's a cheese plate, what else do you think you're getting?).  Anyway, I can't wait to eat here again!"
"Tourist Trap!  I have been here twice, and both times were extreme disappointments.1st visit was a business lunch with 3 people.  We all ordered, but the Server forgot to place my order.  So, it never came.  I told him.  He said it would be right out.  It never came, it never came, it never came.  Finally, when we were leaving, it showed up.  I told them I didin't want it.  They took it off my bill, but WTH?A few months later, I returned.  There were 2 of us.  We waited & waited & waited for a Server.  Finally, we asked another Employee who was supposed to be waiting on us.  She said she'd find out for us.  Soon thereafter, we found that our Server had been standing in a corner, watching us since we arrived.  She said, ""I had no idea this was my section.""  And, it went downhill from there.There are several other places on & around Michigan Ave you can visit which are better & less expensive with far better service."
"Best offal deal around the loop.  We returned for an early dinner - 1/2 bottle of excellently recommended wine, 4 amazing small plates and 2 scrumptious desserts for under $90.  If you like bone marrow, pigs tail, cured meats and rich eggs you will love The Purple Pig.  If not, I really have nothing to say.  Simple as that."
"Outstanding again! This was our 3rd time and it was as good as the last. We had the bone marrow, beets, crispy brussel sprouts (best ever!), mussels, pork shoulder and a tasty espresso based dessert......can't recall the name. Perfect Greek wine pairing  suggested by our server. I will be back again soon!"
"I've been wanting to go to this place for a long time, but since they don't take reservations, the wait was usually an hour or so.  When you go in, if there is a wait, they take down your cell number and say they'll call.  We were told it was a 45 to 60 minute wait, so we went down Michigan Avenue, and came back after 30 minutes, just to be on the safe side.  I checked in with the hostess to see where we were on the list, and she said they had tried to call us.  Well, I was holding my phone in my hand the entire time to be sure I didn't miss the call, AND my phone did not show any missed calls.  But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that somehow my phone didn't work.  We made it in, and all I can say is that I don't understand what all of the hype is about.  The atmosphere is awful. It's cramped and loud on the inside.  I'm not opposed to the idea of communal tables.  In fact, I wish we had gotten one of the communal tables!  Instead, we got stuck at a small two-person table in the outside tent.  We were fine with being outside, but we were literally by the opening of the tent, which made us cold, and right by the door to the inside, so people were constantly swinging the door and hitting my chair. Worst of all, it was windy, so the side of the tent kept blowing and hitting my husband.  When I asked a server to do something about the side of the tent, he at first said there was nothing to be done!  Then, I said there had to be something that could be done if they are actually sitting people in that spot, at which point he then moved another table to sort of hold back the side of the tent. Why bother putting a table in a spot where the dining experience is going to be so unpleasant? I could have let the bad table slide if the food and service had been extraordinary.  But quite frankly, the service was mediocre (we had to wait at least 15 minutes for our last plate to come out, even after we asked the waiter what was taking so long), and the food was nothing special.  I was not at all impressed with the fried deviled egg that everyone is raving about.  We didn't even finish the porchette panini because the pork was bland.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but my suspicion is that some of these reviewers on here are letting the hype cloud their judgment.  Thumbs down for the Purple Pig.  We will not be coming back."
"One word: Phenomenal. We dined at The Purple Pig on Friday night, outside, waited only a short amount of time and had about the best damn meal we could have asked for. We indulged a bottle of wine first, which was great, then off to the cheese. Our server knew just which soft cheese I would love and got us a type of goat cheese that was soo soft and delish. Next we tried the Peas and Bacon with Spearmint which was to die for. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the fried pig's ears but i sure was! I loved the combo of the peppers with the crispy ears and the fried egg on top. The Roasted Bone Marrow we'd heard over and over we HAD to try, so as the proper foodies we are, we obliged and were delighted!! I loved the salad and salt we were to top it off with. Who knew bone marrow was SOO good??  We also got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes which was soo tender and tasty! After a second bottle of wine and 2 incredible desserts (the iris, and then the nutella/banana panini) we had to call it a night and left happy campers, only to rave to everyone through the weekend how amazing our dinner at The Purple Pig was!!"
"My friend and I both loved the food here. We had one of the hams, artichoke salad, pig tail, pig liver pate, and octopus. All were really tasty. Would highly recommend this restaurant."
"Some may not like the communal seating arrangements, but I found it to add a bit of intimacy as I was seated much closer to my date than I normally do at most restaurants.  I'm a big fan of small shared plates and greatly enjoyed the fact I could easily share 4 dishes with one other person and still have plenty of room for dessert.  They had a handy little glossary of for the ingredients hanging on the light fixtures above us that I found to be very useful.  The Sicilian Iris (dessert) was the perfect way to end a wonderful meal.  I'd come back just for that!"
"Absolutely amazing! Need I really say more! One of the most innovative menus I have seen in a long time, and they truly know how to season each and every unique item to perfection! A definite must try for any Chicago foodie."
"I know that I am going to met with people thinking I am some kind of crazy, I hate when I see places that have all great reviews and then one bad one.  BUT, my experience at Purple Pig was not great and bordering on awful.  First of all, we were greeted by a crabby hostess who did not even smile.  I watched her throughout the night and watched her go from frowning to outwardly rolling her eyes at customers, as if they were bothering her by asking to be seated.  Our server wasn't exactly rude, but was so overwhelmed with tables that she ignored us for 20 minutes at a time.  Not a great thing when the whole menu is small plates and your order throughout the night.  it was bad from the start.  I ordered a gin and soda and the drink she brought me was a gin, with lukewarm water, it was so bad I actually sent it back, which I never do.  We then ordered three cheeses and the prosciutto di parma.  The cheese was good, and I appreciate that it is housemade, but it was nothing over the top.  The prosciutto tasted like it had freezer burn, it was not salty and really had no flavor.  Next we ordered the potato croquettes and they were downright awful, the filling was so watery and had no flavor whatsoever.  The breading was good and perfectly friend but the inside tasted like watery instant potatoes.  We also had the chorizo stuffed olives, which were ok, but again nothing special.  We ordered the waygu sirloin, which I thought was amazing, this was really good.  We also had the cauliflower which was very oily, but had okay flavor.   Finally we ordered the green onions and were served on some weird clay, gutter type thing.  These were not good, they were gummy and so very greasy.  The other thing that I thought was totally ridiculous was that we arrived for dinner at 6pm, the two things I was dying to try were the fried deviled eggs and the pate and the server was almost sarcastic when she was like, ummmm we only serve those at dinner and they are sold out.  Like we should have known this?  It was 6pm!!! Dinner service started at 5pm!!! How are you out of something an hour after dinner service starts?! All in all it was very busy, the two things I really liked, would almost make me want to come back here and give it another try because so many people say such good things, but after the horrible service I wont be back.  Oh they also dropped like 35 glasses in the hour we were there and there was broken glass everywhere.  So disappointed because I think Jimmy Banos is such a cutie pie."
"Hog heaven! Fried pig ears, beets with goat cheese, rosemary & garlic almonds, and bone marrow spread were all outstanding! Wine selection was wonderful as were the kind staff that mixed up Shirley Temples for our boys. Other items that were worth mentioning were the scrumptious sardines and cheese plates!"
"I love this place. Tucked away off the mile, which I usually abhor going to. Best late at night, when the crowd is gone, and you can sit at the bar stools with your date and chat with the sommelier and the staff, and they'll tell you their favorite cheeses, and make recommendations, and because it's that time of the night, and they keep this kinship towards you, will pour you more than your allotted portion of wine, and let you taste other wines, and finish off other opened bottles. They're super friendly, and having come straight here from salute wine bar, this was a great way to end the night."
"So let me start by stating that I am a ""lover of the pig."" With that being said I had the opportunity to dine at this fine establishment with a couple of friends last night and waked away feeling pleasantly surprised and utterley dissappointed.  The following applies to what made my stomach smile:1) Yummy....pig platter! (They have the best pickled tongue...give me a pound of that between to slices of thick bread and I'm a happy camper)2) Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic....ohhhhh so good!3) Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes....the meat was tender and melted in your mouth.4) Fried Halibut Cheeks....anything fried is good!In terms of what I considered utterley dissappointing....... I would recommend not going there on a Saturday night becasue our party ended up waiting for 2 hours! I will have to say the hostess staff was extremely apologetic and served us some appetizers while we waiting. Also,  when dining at any establishment I bellieve it is proper etiquette for the  the server to introduce each entree to the table.  We had the pig platter and  a 3 cheese plate selection and had no clue what was being served to us.......I don't like playing the guessing game when dining. Overall, I would recommend to defintiely dine there but try to stay clear of of the weekend rush"
"This place is great.  I've been a couple times and food, vibe, drink, service etc all great.  I don't think I'd really give any of it individually 5 stars but together I can't think of many other places in Chicago I like more, so 5 stars.  Very relaxing, interesting food and good atmosphere.  Winner."
"Purple Pig was good....I wavered between 3 and 4 stars but settled at 3 b/c while it was good, nothing blew my mind.  This is what I had:- Salt Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinagrette: yum.  Good contrast of textures and flavors, and the goat cheese was not too goat cheesy, which I liked.- Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: full discretion, this was my first time eating bone marrow, so don't have anything to compare it to.  I was surprised by how bland it was, but I guess it's supposed to be b/c it was served with a little dish of sea salt on the side.  The bread was yummy.  Overall, pretty good.- Pork Saltimbocca: really good porky flavor.  It was a little salty, but since I'm a salt fiend I didn't mind too much.I also noticed they have Fried Manchego (!) on the menu but I was eating alone (traveling for work) and was a little embarrassed to order a fourth dish.  Plus I was stuffed already....but I've made a mental note to try that next time!"
"This place is perfect.  We went early on a Saturday night (6ish) and were seated pretty quickly at a family style table outside.  I love that you can eat outside even in the cold fall.  Everything we ate was fabulous, which is amazing because it is small plates so we ordered a lot. The wine was perfect. The waiter was efficient and friendly and knew the menu well. Coming from Boston, I found the people in Chicago incredibly nice.  Here, we had a great conversation with the people we were next to, when they left we had a pleasant conversation with the next people who sat down. This would never happen in Boston. What a fabulous experience. I highly recommend this place.  Also there were a fair number of kids there who were enjoying themselves, so I think it would be quite friendly for kids."
"This food was much better than we expected. The atmosphere- not so much. It was very crowded and the music was way too loud. I think we were under a speaker. Most of the other patrons looked to be from the suburbs- 45+ age wise. The food was very good. It was in a similar vein to avec, but more down played for a broader mass appeal. The menu is very large. We look forward to going back to try more dishes. I recall that the fried sardines were terrific! Never had them before and would definitely try them again. The service was slow at first, but very attentive after ordering. It's good to have another place in that area to go to after shopping at Nordstroms."
"I was impressed with the service and the food.  The price is extremely reasonable given the menu offering.  We had the pork fried almonds (which were passed out to hungry people waiting for a seat - very nice touch), the shrimp and clams, the deviled egg, the french fries of the sea, the marrow, the pork blade, and fried brioche.  All excellent courses, my favorite pig items being a toss between ""french fries"" and the pork blade.The dining atmosphere/area is a wonderful concept - diners share long tables and this creates an environment where diners interact with other parties and talk about what their favorite dishes are, what are you ordering...etc.  Wait staff is knowledgeable and well versed in both the drink/wine and food menus.My only complaint (and the reason why I did not give it five stars) is because of the front of the house staff.  We waited an hour and a half and our drink taker noticed that we were waiting longer than usual.  She contacted the front staff and we were promptly seated and comped a drink - we were clearly forgotten about.  As we made our way through the restaurant, we noticed that there were several openings available at the tables, even though there were still a number of groups waiting."
"Food was outstanding on a warm Thursday lunch sitting outside.  Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. As a vegetarian, found the selection plentiful and varied. Can't wait to return."
"Absolutely delicious. Walked right in for Sunday lunch. Dined on roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios, fresh corn and tomatoes with a basil style pesto, chorizo-stuffed fried olives, fig and prosciutto smear, and fried peppers. An all around wonderful experience. Simple but delightful food!"
"We stopped in for a snack and we were happy we did!  They have a great location, excellent food, and friendly staff. Some of the descriptions in the menu didn't do justice to the quality of the food.  When in Chicago, this is definitely a place to check out."
"I spent New years Eve at The Purple Pig. How appropriate I thought since the new year signifies new beginnings and hopefully fresh new experiences. The Purple Pig IS a new food experience- a vacation of sorts- kinda of like eating your way through Italy Spain and Greece but cheaper and no need to for the depressing Euro exchange, Capisce? The decor is of course Mediterranean inspired and reminded me of some cool places I have been in Florence. The food is delicious, interesting, and comforting. What I tried and really enjoyed- Marinated Olives, Salt Roasted Beets,Whipped Feta with Cucumbers (simple and so damn tasty), another simple dish I enjoyed that had lots of flavor were the Charred Scallions with Romesco Sauce. TRY the Sardines and Lemon Jam and the Pigs Ears with Fried egg and Calabrian Chillies I was really impressed since I have never eaten Fried Pigs Ears! I would eat the Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette on my next visit did not get enough of that plate! The Cheeses I enjoyed were the Blu di Bufala and the Manchego and the really friendly guy who set up our wine pairings was on the money the wines paired were really enjoyable and I even ventured out of the Italian/Napa Valley Red comfort zone and tried some Spanish Reds that were fantastic! From start to finish the service was good and the plates were artfully prepared and really had great depth of flavors. Yup- 2010 the year of the Fried Pig Ear:)"
"potato croqueettes----can i just say the best ball of fried goodness ive ever had? it was light, just enough crunch, and came with this great dipping sauce. also ordered the mussels because im in love with seafood. it was great because they had bacon bits in it and it was cooked in this awesome broth---it was sweet & strong and soo good to dip bread into. We also ordered chicken kebabs---but by this point I was so full I couldnt eat that much. the kebabs were allright,& the white dipping sauce wasnt your traditional white sauce. It tasted more like sour cream & it wasnt too heavy, another point of awesomeness. the cheese & meats were pretty stellar, the meat was so fresh and not greasy. this place is a win win win."
"We went here for brunch - so was the place was kinda quiet and we had the total attention of the host. The food is good but I wouldn't call it amazing. The marrow dish was soupy and the ears weren't amazing. They had a good wine selection. Overall, it was decent but verrry pricey."
"Amazing service and fantastic food. I shared 3 dishes with a friend and all were excellent. Getting a drink at the bar before our table was a bit of an issue, due to lack of standing room. However, the food was so great I will definitely be returning soon."
"The service was absolutely great. Our waiter, was so informative and such a delight when it came to asking for recommendations. The sommelier was truly passionate about the wine and the food and made such a perfect pairing for the foods we had chosen. The location is a tad on the smaller side, and a wait may be in store, but believe me, it's worth it. Totally recommend the deviled egg, and the clam and shrimp dish, and the salami panini i had was absolutely a splittable size, especially after eating a couple of small plates ."
This is my must go to restaurant when in Chicago.  I love the atmosphere as soon as you step in the place.  I usually choose to sit at the bar next to the pass so you can see all the dishes going out.  I have yet to have a dish I have not liked.  My all time favorite is the Crispy Pig Ears with the fried egg on top.  Sounds weird but I can't get enough of that dish.  The Bone Marrow is a must try.  Also the Beets with Goat Cheese is a great way to start.  This place is out of control good.  I have been there 3 times during my last two trips to Chicago.  Perfect for the late night bite too.  Not sure I want too many people to find out about this place it is already really busy so my selfish side is saying I shouldn't post this.
"Went in and was seated at the worst seat in the place with my back to the terminal for servers to rign in orders and the host stand.  There were always at least 3 employees behind me bumping me or tipping on my chair with no apologies, I took it upon myself to move seats.  We ordered beverages and food at the same time and 1 plate arrived before our drinks.  I ordered a quartino of wine and was only brought a glass.  My mother was told her beer would be another minute that they were changing the keg.  Another plate was dropped and she was then told to pick another beer that that one was out and thhey were not changing the keg.  the food was very goo.  Later a manager came by and asked if I would like another glass of wine, I did and asked him if she rang in a glass or quartino for me-she did ring in the wrong thing.  He asked if I would want a quartino - i did, but I was surprised that with the wrong order before that no apology was made and no change to our bill.  They really need to work on their customer service, especially since their staff was using f-bombs a foot and a half away from me and my mom."
"A touristy location, but don't let that fool you.  Purple Pig has a great menu with some unique items (pig's ear, etc).  Be prepared to wait (as they don't take reservations), but it's well worth it! The pork shoulder and fried devil's egg were to die for!"
"I HIGHLY recommend this place.  With that said, this is not a place to go for a quiet or intimate dinner.  Its communal seating at a couple of LONG high tables.  If you're looking for inventive cuisine, a very extensive wine list and a place that is very vibrant, this is a great spot.  It's a great place to go for a mini-meal in between, say...mid to late afternoon after doing some shopping on Michigan Avenue.  The service was top-notch, our waitress knew the menu off the top of her head and she made the experience memorable.  The wine my friend and I ordered was out and she recommended another wine which was similar, however much more expensive, but she honored the price of the wine we originally had chosen.  Now that's how good customer service is supposed to work!  This is not like all the other ""small-plate"" restaurants that have proliferated throughout the city, the food here is definitely a cut above the others that I've experienced."
"My wife and I are giving up meat for Lent -- so naturally, we went to The Purple Pig to celebrate Fat Tuesday.  What a great meal, and inexpensive as well!  Our first course was an antipasti -- clams with short-grain rice and basil.  This was followed by fried pig's ear, pork liver paté, and cured tongue.  We finished the night with grilled cheese of the day (bleu and goat) and the most tender/tasty pork shoulder we've ever dreamt about.  From the excellent service and recommendations from the waiters/waitresses, beautiful bottle of wine and comfortable ambiance -- I could not have been more happy.  You need to go now.  What are you waiting for?  Oh yeah, tab wise, as they would say on Check Please, dinner without drinks was ~$25-30 per person (six courses!)."
"Loved this place!  The atmosphere, the food, the wine, the service - all wonderful.  First of all, they graciously accommodated our group as we grew and grew on a Friday night after work.  Never complained.  For food, we had the almonds, the cheese plate, lots of the prosciutto bread balls, and olives.  Everything was delicious.  And how cute are those bottles of water on the table?  I always appreciate when I can serve myself and not wait for someone to notice my water glass is empty.  The wine list is extensive and they offer some wines by the glass, 1/3 bottle, half bottle and full bottle.  Our server was also able to suggest wines based on our descriptions of what we generally like and don't like.  Can't wait to go back."
"This is the kind of place you'd want to go with people you really like.   I went with two friends on a Saturday night.  As we walked into the restaurant, Benny and the Jets was playing and everyone seemed to be having a great time. It really felt like we walked in to someone's house party, and all the guests had gathered into the kitchen!  The food is served tapas style, where you order several plates and share with everyone in your party.  I loved their Mortadella, Balsamico, & Pistachio Smear, Whipped Feta with Cucumbers, Prosciutto Bread Balls, and their Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  We also ordered the Clams with Rosamarina, which I would not recommend.  It was unimpressive in taste or size (but still not cheap either).  I really enjoyed my meal at The Purple Pig, but it's hard not to love a place whose motto is ""Cheese, Swine, & Wine."""
"My boyfriend and I absolutely love the Purple Pig!!Although I was terrified of half of the things on the menu....my boyfriend and our very knowledgeable waitress convinced me to try a bunch of plates and wine. I loved the decor and European style seating. It is definitely nice to have a vibrant atmosphere along Michigan Ave where most of the choices tend to be over priced and stuffy. My boyfriend's favorite plate is the Pig Ears and I love the prosciutto balls. The nice thing about The Pig is that the menu changes with every season and the food is always super fresh. There was some dessert on the menu that was AMAZING! It was a puff pastry filled with some sort of custard and chocolate. I would def recommend asking your server for wine suggestions OR I know they usually have a Wine expert on staff. You won't be disappointed with this restaurant! And, did I mention it is a great date spot??! We will be back soon!!"
"We had just gotten off one of those boat architecture tours & stumbled upon this place by accident. It was definitely our best meal in Chicago. Wow! All of the flavors were perfect--balanced, well-thought-out, well-executed. We had the butternut squash (best I've ever tasted), the beets, the octopus (not normally a fan of octopus due to the chewiness, but this was unbelievably tender), 3 cheeses which our server picked for us, & the wine complemented everything. Dessert was fabulous too--best butterscotch pudding ever!"
"I wanted to love you but your server was inattentive and sucked  - dark hair, glasses, worked the enclosed patio the night of the 6th. Possibly on coke? We wanted to order more food and our plates were cleared and we were asked if we wanted dessert. The server was missing consistently and we had horrible service - I am a foodie and a loud one. I am NOT rushing back to go there and I would have loved to."
"Ok second time here and honestly again, the service was spotty at best. Our server, Natalia was quite possibly the most apathetic waitress I've encountered.  My friend and I ordered various appetizers that never arrived only to be told later that they sold out. That followed with an entree that never came and then we ordered dessert  - affogato (scoop of ice cream with espresso poured over it, pretty flippin' basic, right?) 15 minutes later Natalia waltzes back to tell us that they now have a broken ice cream maker.  So she returns with another dessert to compensate on her. The gesture would have been very nice if either one of us actually were asked what we would like instead - we weren't. She never once checked in on us. NOT ONCE to ask if the food was good, did we need anything, go to hell, etc. Her attitude was like someone who did not want to be at work.   Her co-worker on the other hand,  spent time with each of her tables, talking to them about their food, wines, etc. Basically giving good customer service. Natalia should take some pointers from the others or find a job she's actually interested in doing.   And just the like the last time I was there, the other servers were just bringing out small plates and plopping them down, looking for us to make room and accommodate them.   Sorry at The Purple Pig's prices, you need to train your staff and remind them that they are in the hospitality industry.  They are not the ones expecting good service, they are the ones expected to give good service to paying patrons.  The food is good but with shit service people will go elsewhere."
"Stopped by The Purple Pig for dinner while in town for a concert.  Since my stomach eats on Eastern time zone, I arrived before the big dinner rush and was able to get seated quickly.  We ordered 5 items from the menu per the server's friendly suggestion.  My first complaint was that the menu descriptions do not adequately prepare you for what they are serving.  I was frequently surprised by what I received versus the description and even more surprised to see what the other people at the communal table were receiving based on the menu descriptions.  If you are going to have an exotic menu, I think you need to give patrons adequate tools to make their choices.  My main concern, however, is that while the menu promises exotic eats, the dishes that are served are generally mediocre.  The $20-something beef tenderloin was just okay, nothing special.  The prosciutto balls (where's the prosciutto, by the way?) were bland.  The panini was just a fancy ham and cheese.  The saving grace for TPP is the pricing.  I thought the pricing was excellent and a good value for the location.  Overall, we had a fine meal and felt like we got our money's worth.  But the quality of the food was very disappointing based on the hype."
"Although it is supposed to be served tapas style, it is viable to eat individually with just a bit of sharing.I had the famous milk-braised pork shoulder and it was delicious. The cut of meat was of a good size too, but don't be fooled by the ""and mashed potatoes"" bit. The mashed potatoe is literally a thin paste on the bottom of the tray, and is used basically to mositen the meat. It was good, but it was only one spoonful :(The others in party did not enjoy their meals as much. They had the pork steak and the chicken kebobs, and while they weren't bad, they were supposedly nothing special. Still, a decently cheap eat, and for that I give it 4 stars."
"First there was Jimmy Bannos and his old school loop diner just nailing the New Orleans/cajun thang.  With no formal culinary training he catches lightening in a bottle. Fast forward a decade or so and his son Jimmy Bannos Jr apparently knew where the old man hid the bottle. They strike again. Junior, with kitchen duty cred from the likes of Mario Battali has executed damn near flawlessly a rambunctious menu of small plates (get the milk-braised pork shoulder sitting on a large dollop of creamy mashers, chicken kabobs with a creme fraiche like sauce and sauted fingerlings or the steak/onion plates), artisan cheese, ""smears"" - spreadable pates' and a terrific, well priced wine list. The service is knowledgeable and efficient. Let them surprise you with the cheese and wine selection.  Kyle knows from his pig and vine and cheese. I've been here five times and have not been dissppointed.  Wait for the warm weather to hit and this place will blow up when they get their outdoor seating set-up."
"Amazing wine...Portugal, Slovenia, and other unique swirls. However, if you don't eat pork (hence the name) don't come here for a full meal. It's their prime dish."
"My friend heard about this place and said it had pretty good reviews, so four of us went for dinner around 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We had no wait but was placed at one end of the communal high tables. It was a bit crowded, especially when the food plates started coming, but we made it work.I think the general theme of the food is small portions of oil, fatty deliciousness - starting with the fluffy, buttery bread.These were the dishes we ordered, shared family style:*Lardo Crostini - I actually can't remember what this taste like, must have not been that memorable!*Sicilian Marinated Eggplant - one of our few servings of vegetable, and very enjoyable topped on pieces of grilled bread slices*Purple Pig Platter - we didn't really know what was what on the cured meats section of the menu, so went with the platter to sample a little of everything. Even the waitress couldn't identify all the meats on the platter! I particularly like the Gabagool/Coppa, probably the fattiest piece of cure meat on the dish.*Whipped Feta with Cucumbers - refreshing and delicious*Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda - the mostarda was really delicious and went well with the rest of the spread*Prosciutto Bread Balls - this was fried and a little heavy after all the other dishes (came out last), but I liked how the prosciutto flavor was still quite distinct.*Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate - yum, I like quail. Not much pomegranate.Being as the restaurant at ""cheese, swine and wine"" under their name, we decided to order a bottle. None of us were very knowledgeable about wines, but the waitress suggested one and gave us taste. I found it satisfactory and so went ahead with it. They have many wines under $40, and ours was just around the $40 mark.We were too stuffed for dessert (a rarity for me). Split the bill evenly - $35pp. Not bad at all, especially on Michigan Ave.All in all, a delicious, happy and recommendable experience."
"Went for lunch and ordered several different plates including the pig ears which had tasty, tasty crispy strips of ear w/kale and a fried egg - but it felt kind of thrown together. It needs something to pull it together. We also got the roasted bone marrow which was super rich and relish. The meatball slider was outstanding and perhaps my favorite plate of the entire meal. The prosciutto balls came by mistake and were ok, but definitely needed more prosciutto. For desert we had the Italian wedding cookies which were so tiny and cute and so good. We sat outside in late October - and the tent felt like it was going to blow away and kept hitting ppl while they ate, plus one of the heaters kept going out. It took the staff forever to figure out that the propane tank for that heater was low. They just kept relighting it. Finally one guy figured it out. I wish I had his name so I could thank him personally and congratulate him on his superior problem-solving skills."
"My wife and i went for an early dinner on a weds. night.  The place is a little on the small side and IT WAS PACKED!!!!  We were both shoulder to shoulder with the people on either side of us.  Oh well, that's not their fault.  I had the almonds sauteed in pork fat...not sure how that sounds but it tasted amazing.  The milk braised pork shoulder was just ok.  It didnt live up to the hype.  I really want to go back and try other things on the menu.  Oh and the wine selection is pretty good.  I had a Spanish red which worked real well."
"I really hate writing negative reviews, but I had an unpleasant experience here last night.  I was supposed to have dinner here with 3 of my friends.  Two of us showed up and were told that we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there.  So my friend and I sat at the bar, ordered a couple glasses of wine, and then got the prosciutto bread balls because my friend was starving.  The third member of our party showed up and the place was starting to get extremely crowded (it's very small) so we nicely asked if we could be seated now, because our fourth person was going to be there in 5 minutes.  They still wouldn't seat us.  A few minutes later, our fourth person arrived and we went to the hostess stand and let them know our whole group had arrived.  We were told it would be an hour before a table of 4 would be available.  My friend looked over her shoulder at a huge table with nobody sitting at it and said, ""Why can't we sit there?""  And the hostess said, ""I have a party of 10 coming in soon and I have to seat THEM there.""  So, basically, they don't take reservations or hold tables...for most people.  And they'll hold a table for 10 people who haven't shown up yet, but 3 girls out of a party of 4 can't be seated.  So we left and I have no inclination to go back there.  The wine and food were good, but overpriced (sorry, $13 for a decent but not amazing glass of wine is just crazy to me).  I know this is a very hot restaurant and I really wanted to like it, but I was disappointed in the experience"
"If you like crowds and overpriced Dominick's deli fare, by all means drop by The Purple Pig. There was not a single meat or cheese on the menu that stood out as unique.   I could put together a better charcuterie spread at home with a quick stop at nearby Fox and Obel.  If you do stop by, skip the deep fried deviled egg.  The deep fried brussel sprouts were the highlight of this mediocre, over-priced meal. There is nothing special about The Purple Pig."
"YUM YUM YUM!  I wish I ate enough to be a pig because I want to eat (and drink) everything on this menu.  I only tried a few things, but each was so delicious.  I cannot wait to go back and have the milk-braised pork shoulder (I think that's what it was) and the deep-fried brioche dessert (oh. my. god.).  I love this place!  I was surprised how small it was.  I was there for a late lunch during the week and it wasn't very crowded, but I could imagine this place being packed in the evening (for a good reason too!)."
Great for wine and tapas! Nice atmosphaire and decoration. I loved the eggplant goat cheese spread and the hazelnut salad (I trully appreciate when people know how much dressing to put - perfect amount and throughout the salad. Good wine selection but rude waitress. Oh well. That happens. Highly recommend.
"horrible experience! food was only mediocre.. server Kelly needs to go! if you're in a large group she's the person to go to, if its only a couple you're screwed.. she just doesn't give a damn about you. 20mins in still didnt get to order.. had to talk to the hostess to find out who was my waitress.. after she took my order.. that was the last time i saw her.. she never came back to check up on us to see how we're doing.. oh she did come back to pick up the check.. lol.. anyway i ordered the pork shoulder -- well cooked very tender.. but the portion was too small for a main.. it was more like an appetizer.. this place is all hype.. our waitress did not care for us so i did not care for her.. only paid for our meal and left."
"Knowledgable staff create a very friendly atmosphere.  The exhibition kitchen lets you learn a bit about the menu before you dive in.  The wine list is impressive, global and modestly priced.  Must haves: Fried pig ears, Pork pate...we ended up sharing dishes with our neighbors."
"""PIG"" is a fitting name for this restaurant because that is exactly how I would describe the staff that we encountered here and especially the manager.  We went with a large party and were expecting a decent wait since they don't take reservations, however when we returned a little earlier than recommended we were given the run around and basically lied to.  In the end, we found out that they had screwed up, but rather than apologizing they put the blame on us saying that our party was not all together when we initally arrived!  The final straw was when the manager was rude and then actually started shaking his fist at our birthday girl!  It was shocking!  Completely unacceptable behaviour and of course we all left.   Don't waste your time or money!"
"Service - Stuck up and extremely slow.   Reservations - None taken.  Expect a wait, especially if you have a big party. The place is so small. Food - I dare say it's better than The Publican.  You may get grossed out thinking about eating certain pig parts but the chef does a wonderful job of preparing and pairing these dishes.  However, why are you so stingy with the bread? I get that it's a tapas bar but bringing out 4 pieces of bread every 30 minutes for a party of twelve?1. Spring Peas & Farro with Red Pearl Onions & Feta - Refreshing and tart.  Perfectly cooked peas.2. Peas & Bacon with Pecorino & Spearmint - One of my favorite dishes.  Light with the right amount of crunch from the peas and the saltiness from the bacon.3. Asparagus & Hazelnuts with Arugula & Treviso - First time I've had asparagus that have been sliced like almonds.  I loved how the dressing did not overpower this dish.4. Chorizo Stuffed Olives - I've never had a bad chorizo dish.   5. Prosciutto Bread Balls - Exactly like what it sounds.  Bread with bits of prosciutto.  Good dish but if you're coming in a small group, don't waste precious stomach real estate.6. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - Another favorite!  It's not what you think.  The pig's ear is lightly breaded and fried.  It tasted like fried crispy onions with a vinegary bite from the cherry peppers.7. Cured Meats - A little bit of everything.  My favorite was the dry salami.8. Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio - My friend loved this but I wasn't a fan.  I love pate but this tasted like a warm mayo meaty concoction to me.  I was grossed out.9. Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - Not a fan.  Then again, I don't like steak hams either.  Too dense and too sweet.10.  Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Not the best I've had although I loved the sea salt side.11. Cave Man Blue Cheese -  Another favorite.  I can't ever get enough of crustic grilled country bread, blue cheese and fig spread.12. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes -  I agree with other Yelpers.  I don't get the big fuss.  It was tender braised pork meat with little flavor and runny mash potatoes. 13. Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Finge - Must get!  Perfectly cooked and tender rling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette - Steak was moist and well flavored. Potato medallions were al dente and perfectly salted and crusted. 14.  Fried Pig's Feet - Too much fat for me.  15. Lemon Panna Cotta -  The pistachios broke up the tartness but the lemon was overpowering.16. Toasted Cinnamon Ice Cream - Rich flavor with a strong but not overwhelming cinnamon taste. 17. Affogato - Best dessert I tasted.  Strong coffee mellowed out by creamy soft serve and a rich cinnamon taste."
"I found this place since it was close to our hotel, and it was one of the first places on my Yelp app with a ton of good reviews. Not disappointed at all. We went on a Sunday night around 9 and it was pretty full. The food was excellent as was the service. We had most of the items on the fried menu, as well as the whipped feta with cucumbers....which was so creamy and delicious. They also have an extensive wine menu broken down by country. It got a little intimidating, but we were not disappointed with the Croatian red we chose. This was one of my favorite restaurants on my trip to Chicago."
"I'm only a visitor to Chicago but this is a place I asked to go back to.  I love the laid back atmosphere of the large communal tables.  The patio is excellent on nice days as well.  But the food, omg the food is delicious.  All small plates and so many kinds of delicious, decadent choices that change seasonally.... And the waitress was kind enough to bring out a new salad when she found out my friend couldn't eat cheese.  This place definitely gets my seal of approval!"
pork heaven!!!!! that is all.
"honestly, i dont know what all the fuss is about purple pig. most everything its just OK, not too many dishes are memorable or worth the price tag. the beets with goat cheese and the olive oil soft serve are awesome, but after eating here twice and not finding one stellar pork dish, id rather spend the dough at avec or bristol"
"Wow.  Great service even though completely packed, drinks while you wait,  fantastic food.  Under $100 for two including drinks felt like a pretty good value for the area.   A rare 5-star rating for me.  Love this place!"
"One hour wait on a Tuesday night. But we stayed since we really wanted to try it. I don't mind communal tables, but the animated talker next to me elbowed me the entire night. I asked him to move over, no dice. I spilled my wine on the 21st hit, got kind of mad. Whatever.The food: it's fine. Nothing is bad. It's just not incredible. If you're looking for this type of pork palace, you'll get a much better experience and value at Mado or Publican. The mortadella was just a paste spread on very chunky bread. I tasted more bread than I did meat. Same with the bone marrow -- way too big chunky bread. The most disappointing dish was the panini nutella dessert, which was simply toasted bread with nutella inside. Really? I could make that at home for like $.50 a serving.Pork shoulder was cooked well, but served on top of bland mashed potatoes. I did like the cucumber ribbon salad that came with the quail. There wasn't much meat to the quail though. Prawns ok, octopus ok. Nothing great.Our waitress was super charming though (if a bit pushy)."
"Community type portions (small, but you order a lot to pass around). Amazing food, but expensive. You get what you pay for, though! The service was a tad slow...we had to ask some passing busboys for water and a fork for our dessert. It was a very busy night, so I don't blame the staff - they were doing they best they could. After quite a few nights of trying to find good food in downtown Chicago, we felt like we finally had an Eureka! moment at The Purple Pig. Get the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with that order!! We went during the dinner hour and it looked like a good mixture of people who just got off of work and tourists. All were dressed either in business suits, trendy outfits or just looking really nice. Call ahead - it was absolutely packed when we arrived. We watched a family of 6 wait for at least a hour if not longer for a table. They looked miserable every time a table of two were seated (like my husband and I)."
"Short version--food was mediocre at best and prices were high.  Skip it.  If you really want satisfy a pork/beer/cheese craving, go to Publican which is a vastly superior take on this food."
"Have you ever been somewhere that after you leave you wanted to stop people on the street to tell them about it? Need to tell them? No? Neither have I, until last night. From the moment I stepped into 500 N Michigan, I knew I was in for something different. The smell of Olive Oil lured us in the right direction down the hall and into the unpretentious inviting room that was minimally decorated with wine barrels, Spanish mosaics and high communal tables. The vibe was energetic and the crowd eclectic making it a melting pot of a crowd. There was a wait so we started off at the bar with some wine, cheeses and meats, which kicked of our sensational journey into the Mediterranean feast that was ahead. No Passports required. The Manchengo cheese was my favorite paired with a nice bottle of red from Trentino made me jump in my seat with excitement. Next we were on to the antipasti where my favorites included the Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic, Salt-Roasted Beets and Shaved Brusselsprouts with Pecorino. The savory, sweet and salty mix among the trio was unbelievable. I never thought beets could be so addictive.Next we were on to the fried items were I mistakenly had the Prosciutto Bread Balls. Mistakenly, because I don't eat pork, they were so good I forgot I didn't eat pork and had a few more. The Winter Squash & Goat Cheese Arancini was also like nothing I have ever tasted before. Incredible. On to the Smears, most meat lovers would be enamored with the choices on this list. I opted for the Eggplant Caponata with the Goat Cheese spread and was extremely pleased with this authentic Sicilian dish. The meat eaters at my table were loving it too. After saying I couldn't eat anymore, I found out they had Olive Oil ice cream. We ordered one for the table, so we could just have a ""taste"" but I pretty much devoured it leaving not a whole lot to share. I hate when people do that! There is also a chocolate hazelnut variety for all you Nutella fans.The plates here are large enough to share but small enough where you can order a variety of dishes to really experience the talented chef's gift of flavor combinations and textures. Trained by Mario Batali, the Chef's food was so deliciously inviting you literally shared with your table - the people you came with and the ones you just met. For those of you who have traveled or lived in Europe and have a longing for something authentically European here in Chicago, run to the Purple Pig. It will bring back many memories of times abroad. The energy in the Pig is young, vibrant, eclectic - and authentic. I highly recommend you eat, drink and enjoy!"
"We had several dish here including the bone marrow, charizo olives, and pork shoulder.  While we didnt care for all the dishes most of them were very good and the dishes were creative."
"Not too sure what's gone on here since the last time I went, but the level of service has severely dropped. The last time I was here, the waiter was giving us suggestions even though we've dined here a couple of times. Our waiter on this occasion asked us if we had dined here before, and then just left us after we said we had. He was no where to be seen for the next 25 minutes. Didn't even ask if we needed another drink while we looked at the menu (we had a drink from the bar). At the end of it all, we didn't even wind up ordering any food. Judging by how long it took for us to even see our waiter again after seating us, we figured we'd be late to get back to work. I found out the waiter we had the first couple of times coming to the Purple Pig had left. Maybe the new wave of staff they have aren't as invested as the original staff since Purple Pig has become such a hit. I'll have to go back again when I'm not in much of a rush."
"Great small plates!  Some way over the top and very reasonably priced, including the wine lost.  Had a blast trying a few dishes.  The best food experience I had this trip.  Be sure to order the bone marrow, WOW!  I will be back next trip to try more."
"Went to the pig opening night--service was good, but something was missing.  If  you do make it there, the pate was very good--definitely recommed it!  The wine list isn't quite what I was looking for.  Nice for a drink and app. after work, but that's about it."
"Another recommended place to check out during my visit to Chicago.  The concept of the place is really cute - wine, swine and cheese.  Dropped in for a late lunch.  They have open seating at the bar, so I was able to snag a table relatively quickly.  The prices were extremely reasonble.  The dishes are a bit smaller in portion - more tapas sized.  Had the beets with goat cheese and pistachios.  A fail proof combo.  Recommended by the serve, had the cirspy pig year with the kale salad, topped with a fried egg.  I was a little hesitant about the pig year, but maybe because it's very thinly sliced and fried, can't really taste it.  The kale salad was a good balance to it.  Finally, had the port shoulder with atop mashed potatoes. The pork falls apart so easily and melts in your mouth. All of the dishes were solid. I really wish they had a place like this in New York, because I would definitely be going back multiple times."
"Had almost everything on the menu and like it all. It's all pretty good. nothing spectacular but a great space (albeit very small) with tons of energy, good food, and a great wine bar"
"We were visiting Chicago and happened to pass by Purple Pig.  Great food!  Everything on the menu was delish.  The only con would be the too tight seating arrangement and if you are not seated outside (we were initially sitting outside but it started raining and they moved us inside), the noise inside is way too loud that you have to yell at each other to talk.  Overall, a must place to dine."
"Holy Pig Heaven! We had a wonderful array of dishes to share.  Bone marrow, deep fried pig ears, sauteed ramps and green onions, whipped feta with cucumbers, herb salad, mussels, wagyu meatball slider, pig tails and more.  We were prepared to order more, but the waiter cut us off.  We initially thought, ""how rude"", but he knows his stuff.  There is no way we could have eaten more.  Service was quick and efficient, despite the restaurant being filled to the rafters.  Extensive wine list."
Honestly I was a bit disappointed. After rave reviews from my friends I expected something more than a less than equal carbon copy of Girl and the Goat. The food was fresh but the portions were small and were not as tasty.
Our group didn't feel it lived up to the hype. Spotty service was irritating. We tried 7 or 8 small plates and while some were good (baby artichokes) others fell short (the pork pate for instance). We were all glad to have tried it but no one is planning to go back anytime soon.
"The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Get the PIGGY PLATE, sooo good! They have a great wine selection, and the cheese selection was impressive.  I'd recommend it as a great place to go with a group. There are so many things on the menu it is hard for a couple to decide on only a few for dinner. Go with a group and try it all!"
"Sinfully good. The food is all good. Ive been here two times now and have had nothing that was bad. The Purple Pig is a Mediterranean small plates spot (which is to say they have Spanish tapas but include dishes with inspiration or origins from outside Spain). Each time Ive been here, I always feel a bit odd; a but out of place and outside my comfort zone, sitting at the communal tables, but at the end of the meal, after a couple or three glasses of wine, and perhaps a Pedro Ximenez aperitif, all is well and I have made friends with the strangers sitting across from me. Dishes of note: all of them. Pig Platter? why yes! Poached Tuna with french fingerling potatoes? Yes, please! Morcilla and fava beans...oh yeah...and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder....OMG YES!. The Purple Pig does not disappoint. My one criticism is that the space behind the seats at the communal tables is not big enough to accommodate wide Chicagoans sitting whilst the waif-like waitstaff pass behind us. Fun for groups especially, good for a date, but probably not a first date. One thing that was forgettable was the desert I had on my first visit, bit they made up for that with the Bread pudding desert the second time.Oh, and the manager needs to choose different music; 80's pop just doesnt fit in with the vibe from the food and drink. But go, because the food is just good enough to drown out ""Karma Chameleon"" for the umpteenth time."
"the wait was no joke. wednesday evening, 1.5 hour wait. at points we considered leaving, but stuck around and were thrilled we did. we had about 8 to 10 different dishes and each one was packed with flavor. everything was perfectly seasoned and prepared, quite delicious. standouts: fried brussel sprouts, butternut squash, pig's ear with kale & milk braised pork shoulder. next time i'll skip dessert and order more of the fried items ;)"
"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  Most recently, I had a great lunch with friends.  The food and service were great.  Everything we had was amazing, in particular the beets with goat cheese (hate beets usually) and the nutella & banana panini.  The specials were top notch.  The only downside is that it could be bigger.   The patio adds a lot of extra dining - and waiting space - but it's a nightmare to wait for a table in the winter.    That said, definitely the best place in the neighborhood and one of my favorites in the city."
"Visiting from LA. Love to eat out.  Have been to a lot of great restaurants around the US and Asia.  First time in Chicago.  Ate at Purple Pig last night. Party of 6.  Waited about an hour to get in. Had cocktails outside while waiting.  Crowded and noisy, but in a good way. Tapas-style menu with lots of exotic ingredients: pig tail, pig cheeks, pig ears. The seasoning and flavors were unbelievable!  Every bite of every dish was excellent.  I'm in my 50s and have eaten around the world and I think this is the best food I've ever eaten. Every dish was perfection. Desserts were unbelievable. I pray that the Owner expands to Los Angeles.  I cannot imagine how anyone could give this less than 5 stars. To me, price was more like $$ rather than $$$.    If you like food and are open to trying different kinds of food, you will be blown away by the magical way is place mixes flavors.  I loved Chicago. It's a beautiful and clean city. And this place is heaven. I'll be back to Chi town for sure, if just to eat here!"
"This place is terrific. Came with a couple of friends and enjoyed a glass of wine on the terrace as we waited for 30 minutes for a table.  The place was packed on a Friday night.  When called in, we were placed at an awkward seating at a communal table outside - after which complaining they soon moved us inside.  We stayed for a while and had a ton off the menu, including the burrata cheese, roasted butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (my fav!), milk braised pork shoulder over mashed potatoes (solid), chicken kebabs over smashed potatoes and tsaziki (mediocre), roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, fried deviled egg, and for dessert the espresso soft ice cream, olive oil soft ice cream (great with a sprinkling of salt) and the chocolate-marshmallow-banana panini.  Topped with several glasses of wine the bill came to ~$45 pp, and I thought well worth it.   Great food, and surprisingly not too bad of a tourist trap given the location."
"this place was surprisingly difficult to find considering i know the area well and had the exact address. you oddly have to go through their outdoor patio to get in...to what wll most likely be a very crowded bar area where you can hear almost nothing. this sounds negative no? but it's not i swear. the wine selection and beer list are great. the menu itself is also good. their estimation of the time you'll wait in said bar area drinking and standing awkwardly over the dining guests: suprisingly accurate. i happened to go on a wednesday evening and the wait was 45 minutes. i have to think in a few months it'll die down, but on the other hand i'm not sure since it's such a small space. what were they thinking anyhow? it's good booze and swine. it's downtown and reasonably priced. did they think that wasn't going to work? i don't understand. definitely share your stuff with other people. it's that kind of restaurant. their charcuterie is very good. their almonds are good, but too large unless you have a large table. skip those if not. bone marrow is really good and will keep you from a nasty hangover. get that for sure. pigs ear under the ""fried items"" is really good. they could stand to ditch the pickles in it however--sort of off. octopus. yes.the outdoor area is less loud, but you might get a draft depending on how close you are to the flap. i'd suggest eating there though over inside as it's not that cold and you avoid people eating over you during your meal."
"They have piggy paws, bone marrow, and piggy ears. Sounds appetizing right? For some people probably not, but it harbored my interest immediately. I've been dying to try this place and finally went last night with a girlfriend. We got in around right before 7 and the place was packed. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 mins and we saw two seats at the bar so I went to go snag them. But for some reason I guess the hostess miscalculated because there was a table available outside for two. Well why didn't you say it earlier? Oh, the indoor part of the restaurant is SO SMALL. I was doing my bag-lady look yesterday and I totally bumped into everybody and everything. Oops. So before you go, de-bag! We really enjoyed the outdoor seating esp since it was such a fab night. We got a half bottle of Moscato and 4 plates to share: roasted corn, bone marrow, melted cheese with truffle oil, and the fries of the sea. Everything was really delish. I think the roasted corn was our fave. The bone marrow was good but too much of it kinda made me feel a lil sick. The service was a little slow, but due to the crampiness, I don't know if they can stick another waiter/waitress in there. It's def a must-try if you like interesting dishes, sitting really close to other ppl, and bumping into everybody and their mothers."
"Purple Pig is definitely for foodies and for adventurous eaters. I ordered a bunch of safe items which were decent, but nothing to write home about. Most of the menu my husband and I were unfamiliar with so we did not venture too much. As people mentioned, it's community seating with a big wait. The food came out almost immediately and with the community seating, we felt rushed. The wait staff was very kind and helpful, but I couldn't help but feel rushed. Also, the location is a bit touristy. I don't think I will be going back."
"Shite. Service was good, though.  The food was not awful, but utterly gimmicky - we ordered the bone marrow, thinking that 'if they offer this, they've got to do something good with it', but no, it's dog food.  It even smells like dog food.  I noticed that at least one review says mmm BACON - bacon is conspicuous by its absence from the menu.  A strong plus point though is the music - while I was in there I heard Zep play the Lemon song, which is unusual.  However, the overall experience was bad enough that we will never be going back.  The promise of cheese, swine and wine is too heady compared to the actual offering."
