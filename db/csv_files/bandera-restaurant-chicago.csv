Bandera Restaurant
"Delish appetizers, salads, entrees and drinks all in a classy establishment!Recommendations:Tuna Polk: outstanding Grilled chicken salad: big salad with lots of great flavorsMacho salad: Also a big salad with goat cheese, avocado, cornbread croutons... Very tasty and satisfying!Drinks: If you like grapefruit go with the fresh squeezed greyhound"
"I came in for dinner and drinks with a friend about a month ago. The menu very simple and to the point; we both ordered the French Dip, which was pretty good. While my friend had to send her sandwich back because they overcooked it, medium rare is what she wanted, mine was cooked to perfection, medium well. I also ordered a Sidecar, which was just okay and nothing to brag about. We were just leaving as the Jazz band was playing, but I would have liked to hear them play.The establishment was a bit noisy, but not too bad. The atmosphere was relaxing and there is a great view of Michigan Ave.! They are a bit overpriced for such a small selection, but the food was delicious. I will return and try something different!"
"We ordered the cornbread after reading it was one of their staples. Sadly, I did not like it at all. I thought it was very dry and quite bland. However, my mom loved it. She especially enjoyed the crunchy top.I ordered the Snake River Farms Tri-Tip. It was good but would have been even better if it came with some type of sauce. There were certain edges of the meat that were burnt. My dad ordered the Famous French Dip, and he enjoyed the prime rib. My mom ordered the Cedar Plank Lake Superior White Fish, and she enjoyed that as well.We all loved their fries, and most especially their mashed potatoes. I hate mash potatoes but theirs was delicious. Their service was good, no complaints there."
"One of my friends suggested that we have lunch at Bandera's while I was in town.  It's a Hillstone restaurant so if you've been to Houston's then you already know Bandera.  At least it's from the same American/steakhouse bloodline.We sat in a booth near the front of the restaurant overlooking the Mag Mile.  There were lots of large windows letting in a lot of light.  A large mirror behind our booth made it even brighter.  There were no empty tables in our section.  Despite the fact that it was busy, our server didn't rush us through our meal which was great.I wasn't ready for their Iron Skillet Cornbread to be so good!  They brought it out to the table in a mini cast iron skillet.  It was a Tex-Mex style cornbread with corn and jalapenos incorporated into the batter.  I usually don't like anything but plain cornbread but their version was delicious.I ordered the Rotisserie Lamb Sandwich, thinly carved slices of lamb with roasted peppers and arugula stacked on crusty bread.  I had them take it back to the kitchen and cook it longer.  I am not Team Pink Meat.  I like my meat cooked very well even if it is ""overcooked"" by restaurant standards.  When it came back out it was still very tender so I didn't need the cup of au jus at all.  The arugula on the sandwich was coated in a light vinaigrette or lemon juice that added a bright flavor.  The side dish Corn on the Cob was buttery with a nice kick from seasoned salt.The convenient-to-downtown location, sunny interior, flavorful food, attentive but unfussy service made Bandera's a great pick for our meetup."
"In a city renowned for it's food, we spent a lot of time researching where to eat. We were nervous about making the right choice, but I am glad we chose this spot! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes and was able to recommend upon request.We started off with ceasar salads that were fairly sized. The kicker with these is that the croutons were cornbread. Never had that before but something I would definitely like to replicate on own.We also got a plate of fociccia bread and olives which were ok, the bread was better than the olives.I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes which came recommended by some yelp tips. I am happy to report that they were right. The meatloaf was topped with a bit of bbq sauce and was well seasoned. The mashed potatoes were ridiculously good. I ended the meal with a coffee as usual which was also very flavorful, definitely a solid spot!"
"The chili chicken soup is a good starter. It is a little bit spicy, not too much. The goat cheese brings a creamy taste. There are also beans in the soup. Like it a lot. The chicken salad is good, nothing special about it. Fresh fish with shrimp is a perfect entree if you are looking for a light dinner. It's coming with vegetables and smashed potatoes. The music here is wonderful. Nice dinner."
"I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!!this is my go to place all the time when I can't think of anywhere to go. this restaurant never disappoints me with each of its appetizer and entrée. They are all so flavorful and not too heavy. I highly recommend the seared ahi tuna.! always liked it~ the blend of mangoes with avocados and then the ginger with the tuna are such great combinations, making the plate so appetizing. I also recommend the chicken kale salad. One of my friends hate kale except for this kale in this SALAD at Bandera.!!"
"Ambrose behind the bar is a gem.  After just a few visits, he already knows when 11am or so hits and I bolt through the door like a bull loose in Spain, there's soon to be a lovely plate of rotisserie chicken over Emerald kale salad sitting in front of me with a frosty glass of Mount Beautiful Sauvignon Blanc.And they always get the music just right!Some days it's straight ahead jazz, some days it's soothing chill out music, but it always fits.It's quite shameful that maybe all 11 of my visits there were for the same exact dish. Was initially looking to shed some of that post holiday baby fatten, but it turnt into a high end, dark green addiction. That's ok though. I never get the sense that Ambrose is judging me and he's helped me consider a few other things once I'm weened from that bottle, including the Tuna ""Poke"". ;-)Maybe I'm ready.. soon.. ish... mayhaps.But until then..."
"Disappointed. So on a nice day in chicago biking my boo said that the ribs here were a must for dinner I said ok let's go. I ordered the enchilada with the steak and first my waitress didn't even ask me how I wanted my steak so it came out pretty rare. I didn't feel like the fight so I started eating. Steak was flavorless, enchilada was flavorless the best thing on my dish was the little salad that came on it. A very odd dish. I did try the ribs which were just ok, mashed potatoes tasteless, and chicken so basic. Basic like Boston market.  I also had a cosmo which lacked any alcohol. Fries with spicy mayo were greasy and also lacked seasoning. If the meal costs ten bucks it would have been semi worth it. But I have been to so many better places with better food and ambiance. Just wouldn't return for this basic meal that honestly I compared to a TV dinner."
"I am going to make this easy for you. Order the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich and thank me later. It's melt in your mouth delicious!!The meat is perfectly cooked (medium-rare), it's massive, juicy, and totally high-end on the scale of French Dips. I get mine accompanied by their homemade horseradish sauce.Overall, this place was well-priced, excellent service, and great atmosphere. Had a really good time start to finish."
"Great ambience, food and service. Ambience: Trendy-casual. Its dim lighted, but enough lighting where you can see the other person you are talking to. I love that there is live jazz playing , its loud enough that you can hear it , but not too loud where you can't have a conversation without yelling at the other person. Its just right, but I guess that would also be dependant on where you sit in the restaurant. Food: Started off with the iron skillet jalepeno cheddar cornbread. Not like any cornbread I've had. Nice texture, not too spicy and not too much cheese.. For the main course I had the emerald kale and roasted chicken salad that had what seemed to be a vinegarette and pine nuts. Simple, but delicious as well. Its not too heavy , but not too light. The whole serving will definitely get you full. Dessert got the banana cream pie. I believe it was homemade, doesn't look like something you'd get from Baker's Square. The cream was thick like a custard and the crust was thicker than a traditional graham cracker crust. Needless to say it was yummy. Service: You can reservations online, always a plus. Got seated on time and our server was very attentive and nice. All around great experience. Will definitely be back."
"Solid place for an after work drink - upstairs.  A houstons restaurant - really good. Dark, good smelling ribs."
"I'm still dreaming about this restaurant. We had such an amazing experience here! My fiancé picked this restaurant because they have live jazz music here during dinner time. Even though there was a 45 minute wait to be seated for dinner, we decided to sit and eat at the bar. Like I said, it was still an amazing experience. You must try their cornbread! I remember seeing it on display when we walked into the restaurant and was immediately intrigued. It's crunchy and crumbles in your mouth. The Ahi Tuna Salad is heavenly. The honey-lime vinaigrette makes the salad to die for. This is hands down the best salad I've ever had. I highly recommend it to those who want something light for dinner. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib. I remember all the guys around us asked the barista, ""WHAT IS THAT? I MUST HAVE THAT!"" It's absolutely HUGE!! And it's cooked perfectly! The food, service and atmosphere are wonderful here!"
"This was our first time at Bandara. (Thank you, Yelp!). We were intrigued by all of the rave reviews, and decided to check it out.  We were NOT disappointed.  The ambiance hits you as soon as you walk in.  Dim lights, live jazz playing, and an incredible view of the night lights of Michigan avenue.  The hostesses greet you enthusiastically with big smiles.We started with the chips and Duo Dip.  The guac is excellent, and the southwest dip compliments it quite well with deep flavor and nice heat.I had the rotisserie lamb sandwich.  It was outstanding!  It has fire roasted red chili peppers and arugula with a tart dressing.  They bake their own buns daily.  My wife had the cheese burger.  I had a couple of bites of it and wow!  They grind their own chuck daily for their burgers.  She had hers cooked medium, and it just might have been the best burger I've tasted.  We also got the corn bread after reading the Yelp reviews.  It's the first time I have eaten cornbread without honey or butter.   I didn't miss it at all.  Really good!Our server was Michelle.  She was knowledgeable in regards to the menu.  Very friendly and attentive.We will be back here every time we come to town!"
"I may be the only person that has never eaten here but that all changed this past Thursday as a friend and I stopped by for lunch. They open at 11 so we figured it would be smart to reserve @ 11:30 since we figured the place would be packed around noon. Good call as when we got there it wasn't anywhere near crowded, but a little after 12 and the place was swamped and looked to have a wait at the door. We were seated instantly and was told they have their grilled artichoke back on the menu for a limited time. My friend loves their artichoke and was hoping that it would be back. The appetizer came with 3 so we had 1 each and split the 3rd....very good and grilled/seasoned to perfection. In terms of the entree I went with the Rotisserie Lamb Burger which was very good as well. It came with roasted peppers and arugula which definitely added to the already delicious flavor. I had the option of fries, coleslaw or tabbouleh...I went with the latter. I'm not the biggest tabbouleh fan, but this was really good...best I ever had actually. I looked around at everyone's plates and everything looked scrumptious! Our server was really nice as she took very good care of us...very informative and personable. I love the scenery as we got a seat by the window which was cool to watch all the foot traffic on Michigan Ave from up top. I definitely wanna come back at night so I can hear the live jazz they play here."
"We were touring around the city and chose this place based on reviews. It was known for its salads and corn bread (odd), but it did turn out to be true. The corn bread appetizer is great... moist and fresh. We had two different salads and both were as good as the next. Full of flavor and the chicken was melt in your mouth tender. Great atmosphere for a cheaper but nice date night."
"As a Chicago local, I don't head to Michigan Avenue for dining too often.  There are far too many good restaurants in the neighborhoods, and the Mag Mile is far too stuffy and full of tourists who drive me nuts.  That being said, Bandera was WORTH. IT.  I selected Bandera for a luxurious, romantic dinner before seeing a musical in the theatre district.  This evening was an anniversary celebration for my boyfriend and I, in fact.  So we had high expectations.  Those expectations were met and exceeded!  The food was TO DIE FOR.  Service was FLAWLESS.  Ambiance dark, sexy, romantic.  The live music started a bit later than I had hoped (around 7), and we were only able to enjoy a few songs during our dessert.  A bit tricky to find from the street.  Yes, it will appear that you are entering a Men's Warehouse.  But it's up there, tucked away on the second floor.  And you are immediately transported away from the Michigan Avenue chaos and into Bandera's sexy, dark, deliciousness.Too expensive for us to enjoy regularly, but we'll be back again for another splurge meal.  If only for that FOOD.  Because every single bite was truly just WOW."
"Get the booth seats in the back if you can. You'll get the best view of the house.Pros: - Corn bread. What is this addictive corn bread and why is it so good?- Ahi tuna. Fresh, delicious. I always get the ahi tuna- It's close to where I work/ live. Very convenient and inviting- Solid playlist. They'll play bossa nova, Bonobo, Thievery Corporation, et ceteraCons:- Can be very crowded at lunchtime. Without a reservation, you may have to resort to eating at the bar, arms clanking into your neighbor's plate"
"When we arrived and asked for a table, we were told the waiting time was over an hour but we were free to eat the bar or wait there with a drink. We decided to wait and drank while watching sports on the TV. It gave us time to enjoy the atmosphere and listen to the great live jazz band. We ordered some nachos to kill the time and we even got some extra nachos for free since the wait took a bit longer. After being seated we ordered barbecue ribs and the lamb sandwich. The food arrived on time and was very well prepared! The ribs were extraordinary, probably the best we've ever had. The lamb sandwich was good and tasty but not extraordinary. The live band once again gave an extra as it made the stay more pleasant. The staff was friendly, kind and takes care of you, even if the wait is longer than expected! Would definitely recommend it!"
I highly recommend this place. The salads are heavenly. The burger is awesome.Sometimes when a person eats a veggie burger and they are not a veggiterian; what happens is they end up gagging. Not so here. The veggie burger is awesome. It is so tasty. I am on a diet so the salads are 2nd to none. When I was not on a diet I had some crab cakes.  I am a huge fan of the grilled chicken saladHave been here 5 times in the last 6 months. The music is awesome. very chilled out for Michigan Ave.The servings are not stingy and often times I find myself asking for a to go container because the portions are huge.Be prepared to be impressed and you will not leave hungry. If you go after 7:30 PM it wont be as loud as it was at 5PMdecent wine selection and a good after work scene at the bar
"This could become a go to place for biz meals.  My first time here for lunch was terrific-- and this is eating at the bar with a colleague.  Great atmosphere and friendly service was topped by the best French dip I've ever had.  Ever.  Perfectly cooked beef, toasted roll,  savory au jus,  and the braised cabbage i subbed out for fries were awesome!"
"Went here last night with some coworkers, I'd never been but I've heard good things about it. Can't say that I was disappointed in the least, the staff was wonderful and our server was a lot of fun. Loved the fact that they had live music, and yes the musicians take requests! Despite being dark in the restaurant I didn't find it being a problem, it was definitely a lot dimmer than where I work so I thought that was odd but had no problems seeing what so ever. Regarding the food, definitely would go back for a special occasion. It's a little pricier than I can generally afford but that's not to say I won't be back. The food was good, we started out with the Dip Duo (guacamole and queso). Jonathan (our server) said it had a bit of a kick to it, and he was right. Not at all a bad thing, but I would have liked more guacamole to balance out the heat. Other foods ordered: Prime Rib - slow roasted on the bone served with mashed potatoesCenter-cut Prime Filet -with mashed potatoes and broccoliDing's Crispy Chicken Sandwich crispy buttermilk fried chicken, baby swiss, spicy slawHouse-made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches - with dark chocolate sauceAnd some apple pie thing. All of it was super yummy."
"Jazz and classy bar and grill on Michigan Ave? Yes please. The ambiance is lovely and service was great. My other half (the fiance) and I both love it here, and the prices are fitting for the area and well worth it in our opinion. It feels like a meat-eaters delight when here though with my crew as they all seem to order ribs, prime rib, french dip, lamb and all things meat meaty and meatier.Although there are a few salads on the menu, it lacks a bit for the vegetarian since all the salads are based around meat or fish on them (such as the tuna, roasted chicken, grilled chicken, etc.) It would be nice to have a vegetarian salad that included some vegetarian protein as well such as quinioa or something. The veggie burger has some type of strange sweet flavor and not a fan, but they do have a veggie burger for those interested. They offer take home roasted chickens (whole) and they do a really good roasted chicken so that's a total plus. And, the banana cream pie has caramel- enough said!Tips learned:-Go on a night with the live jazz, it really makes the place THAT much better."
"Pros:- Tasty food and drinks- Lovely lighting and ambiance- Attentive serviceCons:- Live jazz music seemed to stop by 9pm (at least the night I was there), so plan accordingly or ask in advance if you are going for the music============================================My fiancé made reservations for 9:30pm on a Saturday evening for our post-engagement dinner. We had been walking around all day so we stopped in around 8 hoping to get seated early, but it was PACKED and were told the wait would be an hour and a half anyways. The band was playing and it looked lively and fun. We left to grab some coffee at Starbucks to pass the time, but when we came back the band was already done playing --- kind of a bummer, but everything else made up for it.Our server came by and recommended the Vesper when we asked for a cocktail that was not too sweet. It has gin, vodka, and lillet blanc. It had just the right amount of gin in there to not be too overpowering but still had the lovely fragrance of juniper berries. I would totally get this and/or make this on my own! Thank you James Bond for my new favorite cocktail.For food, we had the Ahi Tuna Salad and Spit Roasted Pork Filet. The tuna was perfectly seared and delicious. The honey-lime vinaigrette was light and refreshing and went really well with the mangoes. The pork dish came with mashed potatoes and HOLY MOLY were they a little ball of buttery goodness. The pork was a bit on the dry side, but it was a huge portion of meat so my fiancé was a happy man.I would definitely want to come back at an earlier hour to get to enjoy the live jazz, and the cornbread that everyone is raving about as well."
"The food is yummy, grilled artichoke appetizer is gooooood. Sounds strange but the butternut squash enchiladas are amazing. Fellow diners really liked the ribs, barbecue salmon, burgers. The cornbread was also pretty good.Apple pie dessert great onsite but neither it or the banana pie travel well It's a little loud if you're trying to talk to your table mates but the music was pretty good."
Very cool atmosphere with amazing food.  The corn bread is a must and their specials are always amazing.  Any sort of beef entree is cooked to perfection and you will not be disappointed.
"Looking for a break from the hustle & bustle of Michigan ave? This is it! It's located on the second floor of the building right on Michigan ave. It's warm & its cozy. There's jazz music on certain nights & the staff is great. I like it for a nice glass of wine after holiday shopping or just to people watch from above. The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars for me is the menu. We just can't seem to ever walk away with a memorable meal. Not that anything is bad, it's not. It's just not over the top. This is just me. I can't ever seem to order that one item that blows me away, or that I can't wait to order again. Maybe the warmth of the dining room trumps the food. I've been here 15 times or so, and I could not tell you what to order. I suppose the rotisserie chicken is a good bet. It's still my Michigan ave spot & a great date spot!"
"Started with a glass of merlot, which came out to be about $17 after tip. Ordered the fish of the day. Fish was fresh, but it was basted in too much butter for my taste. The sides were good - mash potatoes and rhubarb. The ambiance is nice (live jazz) and the servers were very attentive. Great location for tourist. Probably won't be back unless someone really wants to try it."
I have had the Beef BBQ ribs twice. They are fall off the bone good. I usually don't like coke slaw but I love their cole slaw. They have a cornbread dish that is amazing. I love this place. Worth the walk through the Chicago cold.
"Okay let's be real, when you order focaccia bread it comes with butter and 3 almonds, and your gf drops one almond on the floor does the 5 second rule apply?  This butter was beyond scrumptious!!  I ordered a salad with avocado, goat cheese and wait for it...corn bread croutons. I wasn't going to eat them initially since my carb intake was heavy with the focaccia but I ate every little perfect square of goodness. My lady had the veggie burger which she adored and despite it looking like raw meat it wasn't. Bc that would be straight up rude to do to a vegetarian. Beyond rude. Like if it were ground meat PETA would prob be there picketing by the time we left the place. The burger came with a perfectly made side kale salad. We sat at the bar...service was great. Attentive to our extra butter needs. I still can't believe she dropped that almond.Moral of the story...when you go, order the butter."
"It has been several years since the first time I dined at Bandera but I had great memories of this place so I was excited to return as part of a team outing.  A small group dined here on a recent weeknight.  The atmosphere and decor hasn't changed from what I remembered - comfy, dark and warm - which was perfect for this cold late winter evening.  We started with appetizers that included the dip duo (guacamole and queso w/chips) and the Tuna Poke and their famous cornbread.  Everything was really flavorful and they were decent portion sizes.  The cornbread, which I breathlessly anticipated, was good but too crumbly which made it almost impossible to eat.  Instead of biting into moist and tasty pieces of warm cornbread - we had to basically scoop the crumbs from the plate and eat it with a spoon.  I raved about this bread to our diner companions so needless to say I was very disappointed.  If it was a bad batch, I can understand - if this is the way they now make their cornbread, I will take a pass next time.  Everything else was delicious - I had the Macho Salad and it was excellent, loaded with avocado, and dates (what a nice addition!) with tasty cornbread croutons with sliced, tender marinated pieces of steak.  I was not very hungry after the appetizers so this was a perfect entree choice for me.  The service was very good and I think the prices are fair for the portion size and quality of the food - there is a reason this place has been a Michigan Ave. staple for so long."
"Had a great time here. We had reservations that ran a bit late but the hostess was great about keeping us up to date. The bar was way crowded to wait at, but my wife scored a stool and the macallan pour was generous so we were happy.Once seated the service was snappy and friendly. I had the french dip, which i really enjoyed, but i kind of wish I'd ordered something else. It was a really good french dip, but not the show stopper others describe. If I'd paid $8 for it at a deli I would be ecstatic. I never caught the name of the jazz trio playing but they were really good. I have never seen a band pack up and leave so quickly though - never got a chance to shoot them a tip. Dang, 'cause they were really enjoyable.Overall a really good experience here."
"I've had two wonderful lunches here. The most recent was last Sunday - we walked in, no reservation needed, and even got a window table. Great food, attentive service, swanky atmosphere. The chicken salad with the lime vinaigrette was fantastic and something I immediately tried to replicate at home (close, but no cigar). The lamb sandwich was out of this world. Tender, flavorful, delicious and enough for a second lunch. My only regret: I caught a glimpse of the skillet cornbread on my way out, and WOW did that look amazing. Sad I hadn't ordered it. An absolute must next time."
"I'm giving this place five stars not only for he food, but also for the service!  We had an exceptional waitress who seamlessly moved from talking food to wine with intelligence.  Her attentiveness to our table was above and beyond.I was on the Whole 30 (30 day reset plan) when we are here, so many menu items were out of the question.  She helped me navigate and visited the kitchen to see what they could do.  She had also done Whole 30, so she understood. My meal, smoked salmon, kale salad in balsamic, and white fish with veggies, was nothing short of delicious, nutritious, and filling.  My colleagues also had wonderful meals and wine.  I highly recommend this place!  Just be sure to call ahead!"
"As wonderful as usual,  this is my 8th time here. I love how do they keep the taste of everything the same every time! Very classy and suitable for dates or family gathering."
"Excellent food service and ambiance.   Had the lamb sandwich which I thought was amazing, the enchilada was also very good.   The server even brought over a fresh chilled martini glass halfway through the cocktail to keep it cool!"
"Had an absolutely fantastic dinner here yesterday. The service was great (our waitress Christine) the food was amazing (had the fillet and kale salad), and the crisp martini is simply what is needed to ease your day.  We had reservations and there was no issues at all getting us seated. In fact my friend was 30 mins late and the waitress was trying to help get him to the restaurant (he was lost!!).I would defiantly come back. Thank you for a lovely evening"
"LOVE Hillstone Restaurants, when I am traveling they never let me down and are always consistent with quality and service. Bandera was no different and was the perfect choice for our last night in Chicago.We came in on a Thursday and enjoyed a bustling bar scene as we waited for our table and then were seated right next to the Jazz trio (does it get any better?). The ambiance is perfection with low, soft lighting, soft jazz and just enough people to feel like you are at a 'happening' spot without it being too loud or overcrowded. I enjoyed their Rotisserie Chicken, which I highly recommend, and the husband had their mushroom meatloaf which he thoroughly enjoyed as well. Then came dessert....which part of me regrets due to the small food baby I left with while the other part of me is drooling because it was so good. The Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich.  Now I know what you are thinking, lame...been done before...an Oreo? Yes, but it's homemade Oreo cookies, homemade whipped cream, amazingly smooth ice cream covered with chocolate espresso sauce. It will literally change your life, and quite possibly your waist size, but it's worth every bite."
"What's not to love about this place? Great drinks. Great food. Great live jazz music. Great views. I'd suggest going on a night where you have no where else to be so you can sit, relax eat & drink and listen to some good music. While its right on Michigan Ave., you really have to be looking for it. Kinda got the sense that it was less touristy and more of a local attraction; which I love! The staff was great! Took good care of us, both at the bar and in the dining room. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town. Should you go? Yes!"
"This is my favorite place hand down. The food is simply delicious. I had the Cedar Plank lake Superior white fish and my boyfriend had the roasted chicken and rib combo. The fish melts in your mouth and the fries that it came with are the best. My boyfriend loved the chicken, but the ribs were ok, a little over cooked and didn't fall of the bone as easy. Their Ding's coleslaw is to die for! It has a great, cozy atmosphere. It was perfect for a birthday dinner date. The background music wasn't intrusive, although they do have live jazz music there as well. The waitress was very knowledgeable, but only checked on us once through the visit. Overall, I would highly recommend this place. Great location, great atmosphere, great food."
I love this restaurant. They have the best lamb sandwiches I have every had. Their rotisserie chicken is very succulent. The skin is crispy on the outside while juicy and flavorful with each bite. I love the setting of the restaurant. It is dim and romantic which makes it perfect for an anniversary dinner. The waitresses are always nice and their drinks are tasty. Will definitely be coming back.
"Loved the dark and cozy atmosphere. Making reservations was a breeze. Service was friendly and on-point. Dinner was delicious--ribs, prime rib, salad. It was all perfectly executed. And the location is great--right across the street from the Marriott and close to everything on the Magnificent Mile. Will visit every time I get a chance!"
We made a reservation a couple days after Valentines Day. Our seats had a pretty view of the night lights outside. The cornbread is a MUST TRY! Don't miss out! My boyfriend loved the ribs. I got the salmon and it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back. BTW: The atmosphere felt great with the live jazz.
"I've done a nation-wide tour of nearly all of the Banderas, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. The experience at any Bandera is consistent- from the dim lighting to the great, professional service and the corn bread that will knock your socks off, Bandera is an old standby for me.Their burger is great (order med-rare to truly appreciate it!), the tuna poke (when in season) is my appetizer of choice, and I have a hard time being swayed away from the gorgeous seasonal veggie platter as my dinner entree (just be prepared to ingest Paula Deen-level amounts of buttah and salt). Yay Bandera! I love you."
"First time visiting this restaurant and upon entering you automatically notice the great ambiance of this place with live jazz musicians playing and if you love jazz like me, then it's perfect. Kind of a long wait to get a table, but that's expected on a Friday night. I had the Rotisserie Lamb Sandwich with fries. It was amazing, so delicious and worth it. It was just so perfect, I cannot wait to go back here and have it again. I normally never eat cornbread, ever, but upon my friends insistence I tried some. It was so tasteful and delicious. Try it for sure.  The service was great and quick and overall a very nice place for dinner, definitely recommend!."
"Cool ambiance, live jazz music while you eat and dim lighting make Bandera a great place to have dinner. I enjoyed the meat loaf, brussel sprouts and mash potatoes. The meat loaf was hearty and the mash was incredible. My mother in law has the best brussel sprouts so it's hard to compare however they were fresh and had a good snappy texture.We only had a few days in Chicago and I am glad we chose to come here. It was a unique experience that I highly recommend."
"had a group of 8, they spit us up into two tables.  somehow we ended up the new guy?  Derrick (sp?) seemed confident but kept forgetting everything.  water, martini, our corn bread, side dish or Brussels .  never came back to fill my water.  I felt sorry for him because it was now ridiculous.  never apologized. we asked for our corn bread half way through our meal. then we told him not to charge us for the side dish because we never got that either.  if it was based on the service, this would be a one star review. however, the food was amazing, prime rib for most of us. and the free corkage saved us from being angry.  we were fine, had a great time and yes I would go back. Thank goodness Derrick didnt have our other table, that could have been ugly...."
"Reservations a must.  Live jazz was very pleasant.  Had the veggie burger - tasty but texture fell apart.  Sauteed spinach as side was good, good for two people to share.  Husband had meatloaf with mashed potato and brussel sprouts.  Overall a good experience."
"Great food. The french fries appetizer was a winner, as was the Macho Salad, which was so big that I couldn't finish it. It's a classy place - on the menu, diners are advised to keep the cell phones off at the dinner table. The lighting is dim, which adds a nice ambiance. With the live jazz (who take requests), one can spend a lot of time in this gem of a place. Get casual and eat at the bar, or request a table with a view of Michigan Avenue. A bit pricey, but the atmosphere and food is quality."
"Ah, Bandera. Such promise...but you make the dining experience annoying and sometimes painful without apology. It's like you want US to thank YOU for the dining experience even when the customer service fails so remarkably with a giant thud. The food is fine here and maybe better than most casual, non-chain places on Michigan. Is it great? No and never has been. I'll still take consistently good even if they are heavy handed on butter/oil/glaze--everything is shiny. They definitely embrace new food concepts like chipotle seasoning and kale and sweet potatoes but those trends seem so outdated now. Perhaps they only feel they need to compete with Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux and that's a low bar. By the way--no breadbasket here but please buy the massive calorie laden jalapeño cornbread at $8. As for service, they consistently strike a low point. My strong suspicion is that they follow a decentralized service model with pooled tips: a random array of servers take the drink order, deliver drinks, take food order, drop off food, clear plates, etc.  Here is the problem:  no one is actually making sure your order is correct, your food is good and that you get drinks refilled. It was comedic today to count the number of servers who walked past us and noted our empty glasses and plates and offered nothing. Our supposedly designated server seemed upset that we wanted a drink refill when the meal was clearly finished. Maybe I would have ordered dessert if anyone asked...but no. Really no one gave a crap whether we were there or not."
"Walking in to Bandera, there's a definite relaxing atmosphere. The hostesses were welcoming and attentive. My guest and I had the option to sit at the bar or to wait 20 minutes for a table. We were both quite hungry so we sat at the bar.I greatly appreciated the upper class atmosphere, they played a great range of lounge appropriate jazz. To my knowledge only two live jazz musicians played about 30 minutes after the time I came in (at around 5:45-6). They chose a few classic pieces (for the live music and the stereo soundtrack) that I greatly appreciated.Our server at the bar was fast and amicable. And the food was excellent. I got the small Caesar salad and the apricot rotisserie chicken and my companion for the veggie burger. The chicken was moist and tender. It fell off the bone. The accompanying quinoa(I don't remember what it was exactly) salad was tart and complementary. A great combination. My partner said the veggie burger was ""the best veggie burger I ever had"". I didn't have time to take a picture of it, he demolished it so quickly. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake. I found the crust to be a little crisper than I'm used to, but it's a thick and substantial filling. Very creamy and not too sweet. I enjoyed it and it paired well with my glass of sauvignon blanc. The wine was excellent and moderately priced. I'd definitely come here again."
"I've heard very good things about this restaurant and maybe I just didn't get the right thing. We went at lunch and this place is dark. I mean DARK. Almost uncomfortably so for a business lunch. We shared the Iron Skillet Cornbread and it was dry and should have come with butter or something to maybe help, but didn't. I also had the Macho Salad which was recommended by the server. Just wasn't a fan and ended up mostly just eating the avocado out of it. Something about the chicken. Overall I was very disappointed. I would say that my experience will keep me from going back given all the amazing restaurants Chicago has to offer."
Service was great but the wait was long on a Friday night. I had the cornbread as an app and the kale salad was awesome. It came  as a really big portion size and you can fill up on it as an entree.
"I'll start by saying that I did enjoy the Ahi Tuna salad although they could have used a little less salad dressing. The cornbread was good overall but a little on the dry side - with a small amount of uncooked mix left in. The service was mixed with one bartender being average and inattentive and the other being better. The music, which later included live music, was great. I would visit again but definitely sit a table or booth next time."
"On a whim, we decided to eat a late lunch here with the intention of having a light lunch in preparation for our heavier dinner. But yeah..we failed. We couldn't resist the amazing sounding dishes here. What we had: - roasted artichoke: the special of the day. And it was delicious. Perfectly roasted with some salt and the dip was a perfect compliment. - french dip sandwich: devoured by my friend. DEVOURED. With him going ""omg, I wish I didn't eat it all because now I feel so full but it was just too good""- pan seared ahi tuna: the tuna was perfectly pan seared with a great drizzled sauce. I really loved the mango avocado salad that it came with! A good amount of mango and avocado and the dressing was yummy. The ambience of this place is quite dark and intimate. In a good way! Great for a date . We also ordered some drinks: dark & stormy and a pomegranate martini. Both were quite good. My friend said: I would DEFINITELY come back! And I completely agree."
"Love this place! I went for dinner a couple years ago and just went to lunch on a recent work trip. For my dinner visit the jazz band playing made for a romantic ambiance. We had a cozy booth and the bottle of Syrah was fantastic. For lunch last week, I ordered the butternut squash enchilada with white cheddar. It was a very unique dish and it tasted fabulous. The portion size was appropriate. I highly recommend this place. Great view of Michigan avenue, too!(This restaurant is on the second floor. Enter by men's warehouse and go up the escalators. The entrance to bandera is on the left.)"
Loved the food and atmosphere at this restaurant! Jazzy music in the background was a perfect touch. The skillet cornbread is a must!
"The place was packed to be sure, but we were able to get a table within about a half hour.  We spent the waiting time at the bar enjoying the jazz music and libations.  I really liked the ambiance!I guess I'd describe the food as a kind of Southern remix.  We had some awesome appetizers of the dip duo and the skillet cornbread.  The cornbread had some peppers in it so there was a definite kick!I opted for the ribs, because the waiter said they would fall off the bone... and he wasn't lying.  Who'd have thought after six years in the South, some of the best ribs I've ever had would be from CHICAGO!  It was seriously amazing.Also, everything my coworkers ordered was top-notch as well."
"Nice spot. Location is very unassuming from the street since they are renovating. Located off N. Michigan Ave.Service was excellent and attentive from the bar to the server. Great backdrop of traditional live jazz while one dines. Only complaint was it was dark or light was darker than most I seen but for all the positives I can see why it is so highly rated. Food ordered the Louisiana Pecan Trout. One word with three syllables de-li-cious! Light, flavorful, and well prepared. Many times you this of dishes with Louisiana and dish is overpowering of blacken or some Cajun sauce.  Not this one. Great hidden gem."
"The whole restaurant experience was amazing!From the food, the very attentive server, to the music, the whole package  was memorable. Best Kale salad ever. Do try the corn bread too. The portion sizes are big. Enjoyed every minute and bite."
"GET THE FUCKING MEATLOAF. Seriously the best meatloaf I have ever had. Sorry mom.4/5 stars because we had a reservation and they didn't sit us until 15 mins after. Good food, good live jazz, friendly wait staff."
"I was exploring downtown Chicago one night and decided to pay a visit to Bandera. Luckily, I was alone, so I immediately got a seat at the bar. For those in groups, if you don't want to wait in line for 30+ mins on a weeknight, either make a reservation or claim seats at the bar which are first come, first served. Their dim lighting makes it difficult to see where you're walking in some areas of the restaurant. The live jazz music sets the relaxing ambience, but don't sit too close to the band because it may get too loud. For vegetarians, definitely order the veggie burger which is delicious and big enough to separate into two meals!"
"My friend and I paid a visit to this Bandera recently. We both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves that night. My friend ordered the chicken sliders, I ordered the slow roasted lamb sandwich and for  our appetizer we ordered the corn bread. The corn bread was absolutely amazing and a must for anyone going to Bandera. Along with our meal we ordered the margaritas , which were pretty good. Everything came out in a timely manner , we didn't wait to long for anything. The menu was very simple and not to overwhelming like some menus. The ambiance was great with the live jazz music, a really nice touch to atmosphere at the restaurant. My friend and I have no complaints and highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. I plan on coming back very soon to try more items on the menu."
"Made reservations for bday dinner for 5PM on a Saturday night.Started off with white wine and the cornbread appetizer - was delish! The waitress noticed our 1st one wasn't cooked thoroughly so she immediately took it back and came back with different one. It was just enough for 4 girls.Ordered the ahi tuna salad -- it was perfect! Tuna was perfect and the salad with mango and avocado was really tasty. Would order it again.For dessert, we had the oreo sandwich -- YUM! I normally love oreo ice cream anything and this was no exception! I would recommend it.I would totally come back and order the same items or try something new.My friends ordered the kale salad (really good as well) and the dutch chicken and bbq ribs. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. Perfect."
Bandera is a fantastic place with a lively atmosphere and a very helpful wait staff. Their cornbread is amazing and it's a must-have. Just melts in your mouth!I ordered their veggie burger with an order of fries. The burger came with a kale salad and peanut dressing. I couldn't decide which was more awesome. The kale salad was probably the best I've had in a long while. The veggie burger was just moist and very well put together.  In hindsight maybe I shouldn't have ordered the fries because I hardly touched them. They were average at best. The portions are pretty generous and you can get pretty full with the corn bread and an entree.   We didn't have any room for dessert. I heard great things about the dinner salads here. I will be back to try them out. Excellent restaurant!
"Do not, I repeat, do not order the veggie burger. It was nasty! Other than that, this place is awesome. My friend had the beef ribs and they were fabulous. The cornbread is world class! The atmosphere and staff are the best. Just don't get the veggie burger!  : )"
Excellent food and service. We had the spinach and artichoke dip as a starter and it was delicious. We both had the prime rib sandwiches with tabouli as our side -- outstanding.  The service was amazing make sure you visit it!
Went there for lunch with colleagues. Good service and great food. A tad on the pricey side but what do you expect from a Hillstone Restaurant?You can sit and have a great view of all the hustle and bustle of Mag Mile. I didn't order a cocktail this time but I'm sure they are great. You should order the quest dip. So flavorful!! I ordered the French dip sandwich.. Delish but a super big serving. And my colleagues ordered various salads. Everyone was quite happy. :)
"GO.You would think I would try to convince you by providing a list of this was great, those tasted awesome, the servers were fantastic, the place was what everyone said, but honestly I can be full of praise but nothing can sum up the stellar food and wonderful night out experience that is waiting for you here.This weekend was at least my 8th time here, and it has never disappointed, so my simple and un complicated advice to you:MUST GO"
"As restaurant groups/chains go, Hillstone has got to be one of the best. I always have a great experience at their restaurants, and last night at Bandera was no exception. Normally, when I'm traveling I make it a point to eat at local places that I won't have the chance to try anywhere else, but last night I got into town, checked into my hotel, was starving, and there was Bandera, right next door.Our party of six walked in without a reservation, and were quoted a wait time of about 30 minutes. Turns out it was way longer than that becaue the table we were waiting on lingered for about an hour after paying their check. The hostess was fantastic--kept us updated on their progress while we had drinks at the bar. We were not in a rush, but she ended up comp'ing us two appetizers because of the longer-than-expected wait. Super nice. While we waited, I sipped a Vesper (North Shore gin, Grey Goose vodka, Lillet Blanc, and nothing else). Whew! Not for the faint of heart, but if you like boozy drinks, it was delicious. Once we finally made it to our table, which was a great location in the corner, near the live jazz music, they brought our appetizers, which were wonderful. The spinach dip wasn't anything fancy, but was really, really good (served with salsa and sour cream), and the smoked salmon with remoulade and brioche toast points was amazing. It was a big piece of salmon (not thinly sliced), and was smoky and salty and really delicious. The remoulade was the perfect counterpoint.Our server was great--helpful, friendly, and there when we needed her.Since we're big on sharing, I was able to munch on a few different entrees. First, the Macho Salad. Once of my very favorite salads ever. It's beautiful, and super flavorful--mixed greens studded with big chunks of avocado, Bandera's famous roasted chicken, and goat cheese, and sprinkled with chopped almonds, corn, and bites of sweet, chewy dates. So. Delicious.House-made Veggie Burger (with sweet soy glaze and jack cheese) was decent, but not amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. The patty looked like raw meat (beets, I'm guessing?), which is a bit off-putting in a veggie burger, and not particularly delicious or flavorful. It was served with an Emerald Kale Salad, which was really nice--the kale was chopped pretty finely, so wasn't a textural issue.Butternut White Cheddar Enchilada is always good. It's slightly sweet from the squash, but balanced by the enchilada sauce. The Mexico City Rice is great, and I'm not usually into that sort of thing. It's surprisngly spicy. The Escabéche is cucumber, sliced carrot, red onion, and avocado--really crisp and fresh--and is a great complement to the enchilada and rice.I've eaten at Bandera restaurants before, but this was my first time having the Iron Skillet Cornbread. It will not be my last. Sweet and buttery, but savory from the green chiles and cheese. Great texture, wonderful flavor. Maybe I need to start a list of favorite cornbread. This would definitely be at the top.Banana Cream Pie. We ordered one slice to share, and probably could have finished off four. The crust is amazing. I couldn't identify quite what was in it--maybe house-made graham crackers? It's thick and chunky and super flavorful. They top it with pudding (vanilla, I think, not artificially-flavored banana), then whipped cream (not too sweet), big slices of fresh banana, grated dark chocolate, and caramel sauce. It's really the best banana cream pie. I was going to give Bandera four stars, but I just decided to up it to 5 based on the number of times I've called something ""my favorite"" or ""the best [fill in the blank] I've had"" in this review. But the pie. It's this amazing medley of flavors and textures.  Not too sweet, so you feel like you could eat it forever. I may just have to stop in for another slice before I leave town!"
"I came here for lunch with a small group of friends. It wasn't that busy, this seems more like a swanky dinner spot, but I was happy I made trip. Apparently this place is one of those must go mainstays in Chicago. Service was good but unmemorable. Skillet Cornbread - I love cornbread and I really wanted to love this one. I felt that there were too menu veggies in this cornbread. Almost as if someone accidentally dropped a jar of salsa in the batter.French Dip Prime Rib Sandwich - Decent sandwich, the beef inside was excellent, maybe I'm not a fan of soggy sandwiches.Caesar Salad - This was one of the best Caesar Salads I have ever had...the lettuce, the dressing. It was all perfect."
"This place is ALWAYS crowded at lunchtime and that obviously means something. It would be a lot more crowded if the restaurant entrance was right on Mich Avenue street level but it's a bit hidden upstairs. It's worth finding though. Dimly lit (but not in a bad way) with dark wood and a fantastic view of Michigan Avenue, this place is a bit of s throwback. It's not a 4 star restaurant but the food is very very solid (outstanding salads!) and the service has always been top notch and unusually fast which is great for a biz lunch. Can be a bit pricey, but that's what you'd expect on Michigan Avenue.  Bandera knows what it takes to keep people coming back- great ambiance, consistent high quality food, attentive and friendly (but not overbearing) servers, oh and a great view. What's NOT to like?"
Good food and good service. Definitely not a place for large parties. The cornbread was definitely to die for. Can I have recipe please?
Love that they actually serve beef ribs. They are very good here. They literally fall right off the bone. Also a huge fan of their dessert menu. Defiantly one of my favorite places to go eat some ribs
"Easily one of my most favorite and memorable dining experiences in Chicago thus far! The 1hour+ wait on a Saturday night was expected which lead me to roam around Michigan Ave to kill time. If you'd rather wait inside, go ahead! Soak up the relaxing atmosphere. The ambience was very genuine with the dim warm lighting, constant muffled chatter, all of which was pulled together by the live jazz. Its a pretty busy and happening place no matter where you're seated. +1 StarAlso, the service was phenomenal. I don't know if everyone was just on their game because it was a Saturday night, but each employee I came in contact with was just really friendly and accommodating. Ordering was fast and no more than 5 minutes our appetizer was already out on our table. Then our entrees came out within the following 10 minutes! Right then and there I was sold. I don't remember the last time my food was prepared so quickly.. Maybe I was just lucky.+2 StarsFood review:Appetizer: Went with the Yelp highlights and ordered the cornbread, which was really good. It seemed a bit dry or lacking in butter but the cornbread itself was very wholesome and still flavorful with a touch of jalapeño. It could easily feed 4. My dad and I ended up boxing half of it. Entree: My dad wanted to change things up and chose the Veggie burger with a side of cole slaw. I tried both and I recommend the combination of the two! The cole slaw was a bit mustardy but very fresh tasting.I got the Rib Eye which came with mashed potatoes. Awesome deal for the price. My steak was cooked medium. Juicy inside and crispy on the edges.Dessert: Oreo Ice cream sandwich. It was our last dinner in Chicago so I had to try their dessert before leaving. I'm a huge fan of Oreo, and this dessert was pretty much perfect. Not one of those desserts overloaded with sweetness but rather a mix of dark chocolate, lightly sweetened whipped cream, oreo cookie and ice cream. Let's just say that I'm going to miss this place. Til next time Banderas!2+ Stars"
"Seeing how I live close to Bandera I've been here so many times I have seen waiters/waitress come and go. I always have a great time here because the food is delicious, the drinks are tasty, the view of Michigan Ave is nice, especially at night. The only downside of Bandera is that the menu is limited. I wish they would add some new dishes to the menu and replace some of the old ones. Favorites:: Iron Skillet Cornbread, great starter dish and good to share with another person: House-made Veggie Burger, this burger is huge, flavorful and a must try...even if you're a meat lover: Famous French Dip, this was the first dish I ever had at Bandera and it is one of the top 5 french dip sandwiches I've ever had.: Side note: If you can try to sit in Jack's section. He's a great waiter.: Footnote: This is a good place for a first date. If you come during the week early enough see if you can get a booth off in the corner."
"I had an all-around solid experience and will be back to explore the menu. Here's why:1) Service-Despite our last-minute reservations by phone, we were still able to get a table during prime dinner time on the same day2) Live jazz / string quartet3) Get the Macho Salad!! -A generous portion of some of my favorite ingredients in one: avocado, toasted almonds, and dates"
"I visit this restaurant a couple times a month because the food is so good. When I have guest in town; Bandera is at the top of our list for places to grab a bite to eat. Everyone can find something on the menu that's good. They smoke the salmon in house which is amazing!!  I live in the area (one block away), so sitting at the bar for a bite to eat and a glass of wine is the perfect evening. The problem? There is one bartender who has a bad attitude; its nice nasty...... It is so unfortunate for such a lovely place."
"The food here was fine. They were out of the roast, but had some hearty sandwiches au jus. The service was fine, but unremarkable. The plus one star is for the proximity of our booth to the live jazz band: three guys who, in any other context, would not look like jazz musicians. You'd say: history teacher, weights and measures inspector, or something. But they laid down some smooth grooves that went will with the jus."
"I definitely agree with the others who stated this is a wonderful place to impress out of town visitors. As an out of town visitor myself, I really enjoyed it and think it s a good place to please a wide range of people. It was also easy to get a reservation for a big group, and they took good care of us. The hostesses especially get big points from me: when the overheard my sister say she really needed to nurse the baby, they set up a chair in a private area for her. We started with the grilled artichoke, which was very good. My sister and I split the crispy chicken sandwich with fries, and we each ordered our own salad. I had the Caesar and really enjoyed it. The drinks were strong, the atmosphere pleasant, and I would come back here in a minute!"
We were here a couple weeks ago and had a great meal. The food and drinks were excellent and the server nice. It is part of a small-ish chain but I didn't hold it against them. It was close to the hotel which is another plus. I'd go back.
"Despite our first NYE option being ruined, we decided to walk to Bandera at about 5:30pm. We were expecting a long wait but it was actually only about 20 minutes. We lucked out and even got a window seat! We had the chips and spinach artichoke appetizer, the chips were warm, fresh, and to our surprise-they were bottomless! For dinner I had the Prime Rib French Dip (amazing) and my boyfriend had a burger. I'm a fan."
"This place deserves more reviews. It is actually the best meal I've had in Chicago so far (granted I've only been to few in town - Purple Pig, Gino's, Giordano's, Volare). We went here on a week day night and there was an hour wait. We ordered the corn bread, BBQ ribs, and prime rib French dip. Best corn bread I've ever had...and I don't normally like cornbread. It was also pretty big - 6 people can share. Actually, the portions here are generally large. The French dip was good by itself, but with the addition of horseradish on the side, it was delicious. So good. The ribs were good. Sautéed spinach was a bit bland. Fries were good not great, but the spicy mayo dip was really good. I docked one star for service. The waitress we got wasn't very friendly and did not smile at all. It just made for awkward exchanges."
This place is my go to lunch spot when I head to Chicago for a day (which is a yearly thing). I always get the macho salad. I just have never had a salad as fresh and complex! It's a 10/10 definitely. I've also tried the apricot glazed chicken and the sweet potato enchilada! Both very good as well. The only reason I give this place a 4/5 is the service. But other than that I recommend this place to anyone!
"Bandera had excellent service and a great atmosphere. The live music was nice when we had it, and the service is exceptional. I've been there multiple times; the best thing I've had there by far are the ribs. Like others have mentioned, they literally fall off the bone. The cornbread and queso are both phenomenal as well. The only issue in terms of food quality I've experienced is the veggie burger--my girlfriend really disliked it and had very little integrity-- it fell apart as she ate it. However, the server noticed she didn't eat much and refunded the whole thing without any of us complaining--I thought this was extremely good on the part of the server and restaurant as a whole.Solid place, definitely worthwhile to visit."
"Great service, awesome live jazz.. and delicious food. Definitely a go again place :)"
"Fantastic Ribs! Wow. People often say, ""the ribs are so tender at so-and-so's place, they just fell off the bone."" In my experience, that's more often than not a polite exaggeration. But tonight, the meat was so tender that it legitimately fell off the bone onto my plate! Simply, to die for. You also can't because the comfy seats and live jazz music. A very classy place. I will remember this for future Chicago trips! Oh! Definitely try the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich. It completes the meal. :)"
"I've been meaning to write this review. So I took my parents here a few Thursdays ago for their anniversary and didn't get the night we were expecting. We had a reservation for the three of us and were seated fairly quickly, at a really nice big table in the corner. it was really great at first, but before we even got a chance to look at our drinks, the manager came over and told us there was a bigger reservation that was supposed to have our table. Now, I worked at a restaurant in college, and once you seat people, it's really bad manners to ask them to move. Like our reservation wasn't as important as the other people the had the table for? ok.. He said one of the new girls made a mistake and grabbed our menus to take us to another table. Now sitting in a booth, he took our drink orders, said they were on the house and left. We didn't see a server for a few minutes, but when she finally came, she asked us what we'd like to drink, and we said the manager already took them. She was really confused. Later the manager came over apologizing for everything and said our whole dinner was on the house. He kept checking in with us every ten minutes, and it honestly interrupted our nice dinner. I guess it was cool that we got the meal for free, but honestly, I wanted to treat my parents myself, and it just turned out that we were reminded all night that we had to move tables, and couldn't have a private family dinner.It was just an uncomfortable experience and frankly not the best service I've had there. The waitress was nice enough, once she figured out what was going on."
"My husband & I went to Bandera while visiting the city for a vacation. It was a crappy, rainy Monday evening so we wanted to stay somewhere close to our hotel which was near Michigan Ave so we tracked down this place on Yelp and were extremely happy we did.Based on recommendations like below- I had the roasted apricot chicken, my husband had the meatloaf- and we shared a cornbread- both were unbelievable.Then came dessert. We were stuffed after shoving our faces with dinner but had to try the Oreo Ice Cream dessert- literally one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. Truly life changing- Our waiter (who's service was above & beyond) also recommended we have a side of caramel with the dessert which was a total score.Definitely recommend checking this place out whenever you're near by!"
"I've eaten here three times, gotten three different entrees (and admittedly sampled off my date's plate), and was blown away by how consistently delicious the food is. Gorgeous bar, live jazz, great service, and Kanye West sightings oh my. Get the ribs, get the steak, get the salad. Just eat here."
Omg. This is a chain restaurant and they have the most amazing kale salad and lamb sandwich. It is right next door to where I work. It is a little pricey for what it is but you will never go wrong with a lamb sandwich and a side of kale salad.
Had a great visit and nightcap at this Magnificent Mile institution.
Really like this place -- been to AZ location before and Multi times to Chicago. Like the Chicago vibe and great view over Michigan.You should always start with the cornbread as it's amazing. And the Macho Salad is amazing...never disappoints.But the service has always been just ok and actually a rude hostess twice. And not a good Bloody Mary. It was odd like it was watered down even though spicey as I requested.I still highly recommend if in Chicago as consistently great food here.
"Nate was great as our waiter! The hostess was very accommodating on my girlfriend's birthday celebration even though their four top tables are bolted to the floor the half-round booth fit all of us cozily. The food was great - the cornbread and grilled artichoke were very tasty. The piano and guitar duo were amazing! They played all of my requests with pleasure and passion: Al Green, Bee Jee's, Stevie Wonder, Beatles and Oldie but Goodie Sleepwalk by Santo and Johnny from the movie La Bamba! I just played samples from Spotify and that was it!!!"
Had a great evening at Bandera - made a reservation through Open Table and they had a street window table available when we arrived (even though they had people waiting). Nice little jazz trio playing music while we dined. Having dined at Bandera years ago in Scottsdale I was looking forward to the skillet corn bread and was not disappointed. My wife and I shared the ribs and chicken dinner and it was just enough for us with the cornbread. Ribs were tender and moist but I didn't feel the chicken had the great open fire rotisserie taste u had enjoyed in AZ. Not sure the Chicago location has that same capability. It was still tender and juicy but not what I had been looking forward to. Very reasonable pricing for a great MI Ave location
"Came here again for dinner with my boyfriend, nearly a year after our first visit. I ordered the macho salad -- overall it was filling but way too much dressing (next time would ask for the dressing on the side). We also had the corn bread which my boyfriend thought was not as warm or moist as he remembered.Overall, just an A-Ok experience this time around."
"How have I never reviewed Bandera before now?! This is hands down one of my favorite go to places in the city. I've been numerous times and brought my parents here too when they visited from out of town.Ambiance is great, kind of an upscale bar and grill. Perfect for a more intimate group of 2-4. They have a live jazz group too on some nights.The Prime Rib French Dip sandwich is AMAZING!! Seriously, the best French dip I've ever had...tender, melt in your mouth amazing. I think it may be the only thing I've ever ordered.... Fiancé and other guests have had the lamb sandwich, cheeseburger, and rotisserie chicken (to name a few dishes) and all have been quite flavorful as well. Service is generally attentive. The only 'cons' I've experienced have been their fries (skinny, salty, underwhelming) and the duo dip w/ chips appetizer. Neither was bad enough to stop me from returning. The prices are a little higher, but quality is worth it! Not to mention, it's not unreasonable for such a nice spot right in the middle of Magnificent Mile."
"Macho Salad.  Macho Salad. Macho Salad.Although I typically get the Macho Salad, I've tried the cornbread and enchiladas, as well.  Food is flavorful, portions are perfect and ingredients are fresh.The Macho Salad consists of a lot of my favorite things:  dates, goat cheese, rotisserie chicken, avocado and toasted almonds.  Every bite is a party in my mouth.Ambiance is great too.  Very mixed crowd consisting of older and younger patrons, families, couples and tourists.  Love that they accept reservations now!"
"Great atmosphere, good service.  The lamb sandwich wad only ok as it was a bit gamey. Ordered a Pimm's Cup and the ginger ale was flat. I'd come again for dinner."
"Great Michigan Avenue spot and very fun on Friday or Saturday nights during the summer season. I've had dinners and lunches here and both tend to be good overall from a service and quality perspective. Definitely a great option for groups of friends and is bustling at night with music and performances. Try to get seated overlooking the Mag Mile. Recommended dishes include: Rotisserie Chicken (you walk in up the stairs to see the rotating whole seasoned chickens), Barbecue Beef Back Ribs, Wagyu Beef anything, and most salads are actually quite well prepared (chopped chicken)."
"I visited on a Saturday afternoon (several months ago) and really enjoyed it.  This is a nice restaurant, but dress is pretty casual.  Service was great.  Super location across Michigan Avenue from my hotel.  When I'm back in Chicago, I'll be back at Bandera!"
"The food and ambience of this location is excellent. The food is a bit on the rich side, but completely delicious. Yesterday at lunch we ordered the jalapeno cornbread and french fries as an appetizer. Cornbread was perfectly made, with corn pieces and moist on the inside and cripsy on the outside, I'm sure it takes a lot of butter to do that!!For entrees we got the $17 Grouper fish sandwich and it was again perfectly crispy grouper in a bun with coleslaw and a string of red onion. Also go the ala carte buttenut squash enchilada. Again it was perfection. My complements to the chef!"
"Wasn't that hungry so I had two appetizers - the tuna poke, which came with chips and was delicious (for an app, it was a big portion). I also had the Pine Room salad which was well seasoned and also very satisfying. Compared to the other bland food at Chicago mainstream restaurants, this place was a welcome departure with flavor (but not overwhelming). Nice ambience and jazz music. Crowded and loud on a Sunday night because of the conference I was attending, but probably not as crazy busy on a normal weekend."
"This review is long overdue. I discovered this hidden gem back in February while I was staying at the International. One evening I was was eagerly searching for a place to have dinner, I tend to be a creature of habit, so I wanted to dine at a restaurant I hadn't yet visited and with good food. To my luck I stumbled upon Bandera here on yelp. Once I looked at the four star rating and reviews, I was sold. While I was looking for this place I was a bit confused because I stroll along the mag mile quite frequently and had never seen this restaurant before, to my surprise, Bandera's entrance is through the Men's Warehouse doors and right up the escalator. Once I arrived, I was expecting to be waiting awhile but I  was graciously greeted and seated promptly. I ordered the Famous French Dip and the Oreo Icecream Sandwich for dessert, everything was delicious! And the ambience is quite delightful along with the soothing live music playing in the background.Fast forward.....the next day after dining at Bandera's I definitely had a sweet tooth for another Oreo Icecream Sandwich. So as soon as I departed my office and before heading to my hotel room I ordered the Oreo Icecream Sandwich to go. As soon as I arrived, the hostess and the manager say ""You're back!"" (I guess they don't forget a face). I was shocked that they remember their customers. Long story short, the manager hands me my order and proceeds to tell me to ""Have a great night!"".... FREE DESSERT! OH YEAH!!!! Because of their amazing food and superb customer service I spent my birthday at Bandera last week and everything was phenomenal. This time I had the ribs, mashed potatoes, and coleslaw... Amazing. And for dessert I had my usual lol. Bandera will always be my go to restaurant whenever I'm on the mag mile."
"Came back recently at lunch time, and had their ""Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich"" - which was TO DIE FOR. The flavor was so good. And DAMN their french fries! They are just so good and addicting! (They're the little shoestring french fries). Some of the waitresses annoy me. They can be kinda bitchy/snooty, which I don't appreciate. We had one today. She just kinda had a snarky response whenever we asked for something, and never brought the waters we asked for - TWICE. Finally another girl we asked brought them.  Sometimes it's just the little things. And for as expensive as this place is, I don't appreciate an attitude. However, I must say it's not ALL of them. There was one super friendly waitress, and the bartender I asked for a 'to-go' bag jumped right up to get it for me, and did it with a smile and a genuine 'Have a nice day'. Even with the annoying waitress, I'm going to bump up my rating to 4-stars because the food is just so good."
"Great American fare. The jazz band was a little loud, but they were good. Very crowded Michigan Ave spot.  Definitely worth a try.  The enchilada is fabulous!"
"Delicious burgers, delicious desserts!  The servers were very friendly, though the wait was long.  There was a slip in quality control, though, and I got a cracked water glass, with a ragged edge on top!  Otherwise, great experience, and the food was good as leftovers."
"This is a fun, lively spot even on weeknites. The jazz band is great and not too loud. You can still have a conversation without screaming (unlike Mastro's). The butternut and white cheddar enchilada is my staple here. Not your typical enchilada, but it's definitely full of flavor. Their veggie burger is also a good one to try. Check this place out if you're in the area!"
"Pricey, but worth the cost. Love the location and the fact that it's upstairs."
"Dined in for lunch today.  The service was good, the food was good and the price point was about what to expect for the location.  I had a side order of the skillet cornbread.  The cornbread had nice crunch on the outside and moist on the inside.  I think the cornbread could have been served a little but hotter since it is served in a skillet I would expect it to be quite warm.  For my meal I had the macho salad.  The salad had a great sweet and savory mix of fresh colorful ingredients.  Roasted chicken, dates, avocado, goat cheese, etc.  I would definitely recommend this for lunch and suggest trying the macho salad."
"Best.  Chicago.  Restaurant.I can't say enough about Bandera.  The quality, service, and ambience are exceptional.  Low key vibe in the heart of the  city.I have tried several dishes here but keep coming back to the lamb sandwich.  I grew up eating roast lamb, but hear it's an acquired taste.  It is beyond heavenly and every time I leave, I kick myself for not getting one to go for the next day."
"Nice dark atmosphere, good food, and an overall solid lunch. The smoked salmon appetizer featured a generous serving."
"I love Bandera. It has a really cool vibe, overlooking Michigan Avenue, with live music (jazz, piano) on some nights as well. I highly recommend the Macho Salad, as well as the Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich (which is off-menu). The dip duo is also very good. The wait can be a bit long during peak times, but they accept reservations. The service is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is intimate and trendy. Definitely one of the top spots near Michigan Avenue."
"Really enjoyed the macho salad.  The cornbread is good but ... maybe it was hyped up too much. There is some of the cornbread in the macho salad. :D Great service, great music and great location. :)"
We are a busy professional couple and eat out in Chicago six or seven nights per week.  This is our favorite restaurant.  I take my visitors here to see how a restaurant should be run - it has the best trained staff I've ever seen.  The red cabbage is a surprising treat and I often order an extra side so I can take some home for lunch the next day as well.
"Sorry I'm not sorry I liked this place!. I went here on a girl date because my husband refused to go as he pretentiously thinks it is too touristy for his taste and scoffed at the idea of going with me! So I took matters into my own hands and planned a date with my friend that is always down for ""touristy dinners"" (Grand Lux Cafe anyone?).What a great place! The food was just OK, but the atmosphere was so nice! We got a table right by the window and right near the jazz band. Service was great, music was great, view was great! I recommend for a fun ""touristy"" night out in Chicago!"
"Had lunch here today - four words: Seared Ahi Tuna salad!  Very good, and healthy yet filling.  Excellent and efficient service and the rest of the menu looked great too."
This is the best restaurant for a great meal--the corn bread is phenomenal--in Chicago. And the atmosphere is good for conversation. The jazz is a delight. I love this place!
"ITS POURING OUT OF ME LIKE LAVA! *unleashes drool tsunami* Hehe, sorry about that. Well, let's get to the good stuff. The service is always nice, but one lady looks like Lady GaGa...O-O Anyway, the food is AMAZINGGGGGG. Try the skillet cornbread, and eat the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich thingy. Nice jazz, lovely decor, nice aura."
"Corn bread was ridiculous, and the steak was juicy as hell, cocktails were strong, I was having a buzz before the food even got to the table."
"Make a reservation!! our party of six was told there was an hour wait and we waited 1 hour and forty minutes. The hostesses weren't nice either. Due to our long wait, they said they would give us a free order of corn bread.  No big deal.  It was so hard to enjoy our experience because we were so frustrated by the wait and super hungry.  The atmosphere was lovely, the cocktail I tried (their signature margarita) was yummy...the chicken dish I got was pretty good, but nothing to really write about.  Overall, I would like to come back again if it wasn't for the nasty waitresses cackling as we waited-when there are so many places to eat in Chicago, I would skip this one. Customer Service is not their forte."
"Didn't have high hopes for this place. It's called Bandera, it's on tourist trap rowe and overall felt gimmicky, but the food was definitely above average.Got enchilada's with grilled tri-tip. Asked for medium rare and it came out more medium, but it was good and surprisingly flavorful for tri-tip. The one half of the enchilada was filled with some kind of spinach filling with a mole sauce and the other with sweet potatoes and a sweeter sauce. I was surprised the sweet potato filling was better than I could imagine. Also the food came out very fast.Just a warning, Google maps shows the place off Michigan as opposed to on Michigan, bastards had me walking around confused as hell."
"LOVE this place. Ambiance, food, service, drink ... ridiculous. I work in town each week and honestly look forward to coming here alone, sitting at the bar, and hoovering their chicken and ribs combo. So dang good."
I have never been to this restaurant before.but I have been to the sister restaurant called Hillstone. I enjoy the Houston's restaurants which is from the same chain in Texas. Food and the service was absolutely outstanding. I have favorites for each of the restaurant types especially the tortilla soup.
"A must eat here restaurant.  I absolutely love this place!  The food is fantastic, the casual atmosphere is great and the service is always stellar.  I visited here for my 5th trip in 4 months last week and the place rocked.  The prime rib sandwich is to die for, and of course we had to have the delicious cornbread.  The manager (Hilary I think) stopped by our table to make sure everything was perfect, that was such a nice touch, it made the trip to the restaurant very special.  We will definitely be back soon.I have relatives come in all the time to visit Chicago, and this is the one restaurant that I recommend over and over."
"First meal in Chicago - For lunch I ordered the cheeseburger! It was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the BBQ ribs... I liked the cheeseburger better :) The only downfall would be the noisy construction during the day :( other than that, great service, great food!!"
I was excited to eat here after a long day of walking around the city. The main reason I chose to eat here was because yelp claimed that it was vegetarian friendly. I didn't enjoy one thing I ate at Bandera.I've tried my fair share of veggie burgers and my BIGGEST pet peeve is a veggie burger that falls apart. This one feel apart right as I picked it up! I originally wanted the butternut enchiladas. But it wasn't specified on the menu that there was chicken in it. (Glad I asked) Long story short we spent $60 on lunch that barely got touched and there is very little for vegetarians to actually eat.
"I ventured into this classy restaurant located just above Michigan Ave. Since I was solo, I sat at the bar and started my evening with the Laredo Cocktail- a unique combination of Maestro tequila, freshly squeezed grapefruit, ginger ale, cucumber with a hint of jalapeño. My entree choice was a single butternut white cheddar enchilada. Wow, it was flavorful with two different sauces to adorn. Both were flavorful and delicious.  The Macho Salad was so good. Just the way I love, with lots of flavorful additions to my greens. While I enjoyed the people watching and the live jazz music, I couldn't resist ordering my after meal dessert of Tres Leches dessert. It didn't disappoint my sweet tooth, and it was creamy and delicious. While I have enjoyed many great dining experiences during my visit to Chicago, this is one restaurant I would add to my list of ones I'd like to return to again."
"""Hit and miss but sexy in the process""This place is really like a 3.47, but I can't round up.This place is warm and cozy and hidden and induces conversations with it's soft lights and deep booths and craft cocktails. So maybe this is the place you meet for drinks and app-ees. They are know for their martinis.. i had a tequila one with pink peppercorns and it was quite tasty.. I had 3!Yet, the food is not overly one way or the other. Some dishes are tasty and some leave a bit to be desired. The service is the same way. I've had amazing service and some that's just meh.. like they are mad we are there.All in all locay is fantastic and right off of every major mode of transportation which makes it totally convenient. I go back with managed expectations."
"Visting from Miami and this was the first place I wanted to try.First impressions - Beautiful door/entrance, great lighting, ambiance was very laid backDining experience - I choose to eat at the bar as it was a wait to be seated (so I cant speak on the waiter/waitress service). The bar, IMO, lacked personality in regards to service. Yes, they provided exactly what I requested in terms of food BUT usually when you opt to sit at a bar there is some interaction/conversation with the bartender, in this case it was all transactional. At times it felt like I was disturbing there work flow.Food - I had a slice of corn bread which had a hard top and soft inside. I also had the Seattle BBQ Salmon with mashed potatoes. Overall, the food selections were tasty but nothing spectacular.Overall - Great location and decor."
"Bandera is a great place to enjoy a meal. They have live jazz type music on most nights and the window seats have wonderful views of Michigan ave. I highly recommend the Artichoke appetizer when in season. The chicken is always spot on as well. The bar makes great drinks, albeit a little pricey, but if you are looking for a budget meal you probably aren't dining on Michigan ave. Highly recommended."
An excellent restaurant with a fantastic view of the mag mile! Stopped for a late lunch.  The food and service were supreme.  Loved the seating with a beautiful view.
"This place was a lovely surprise! I was looking for a simple, early dinner and am thrilled that I found Bandana on yelp!  At a small table, I didn't have much of a view of the magnificent mile, but with all of the windows it was a nice (although still a little dark), lovely place for dinner. I ordered the salmon and a side of asparagus and it was fantastic! The salmon was a bit asian-inspired with a very mildly sweet glaze. It was fantastic! The side of asparagus (although delicious!) wasn't necessary, but I was craving extra vegetables with my meal. I would love to come here again and try other things on their menu!"
"I just had my birthday dinner here. It was amazingly good!! I wasn't be able to make a reservation, so we just walked in. Actually just took about 5 mins to seat us. The service was very nice also. Very polite. Live music from musicians. The most important, food was fantastic! Everyone satisfied with the food we ordered. We shared a cornbread. I had Seared Tuna, and my friends had pork filet, French dip. The sauce of salad was tasty and special. Over all, very nice!"
"Great food, huge portions. Get the skillet cornbread - it is not too dry and almost dessert-like. BYOB no corkage fee! Live jazz every night. Only downside is the Michigan Ave location which is very touristy."
Fancy place. Elegantly decorated. Live Cello and Piano. Really tasty food and super fast service.
"Amazing food but above all amazing service. I have been twice and each time was 5 stars. The prime rib is the best in the city, and the filet I had last night now ties with Gibsons for the best I've had in Chicago. The manager came to our table and was so nice it also helped understand why it was ran so consistently well. Kudos to Bandera and their manager Shannon. We will be back again soon."
The food here is amazing and enjoyed with a great view of some of downtowns best shopping. We had the dip duo which included fresh guacamole and a jalepeno cheese spread. Both were very fresh and vibrant. I also tried the fish sandwhich and it did not disappoint! I didn't get a chance to try dessert but the apple cobbler looked amazing.
"This location is not near as good as the rest of the Houston's/Hillstone/Bandera chain. I think it's gone down hill in the last two years. I've lived in Houston, Atlanta, and New York and visited all the locations in each city. I love the spinach dip and the burger is my fave. However, my recent visit to Bandera was a failure. They changed the burger and bun, discontinued some of the condiments, and changed the fries recipe and decreased the portion. It went from being my favorite burger to a mediocre, unmemorable sandwich. Im hoping when I visit the other locations around the country they're still as good as before. Still have to give 3 stars for ambiance and other menu items like the tortilla soup!"
"BFF & I thought we'd try to score a table at Bandera - at the heat of lunch hour - & we were lucky to hear there was only a 15 min waitI had 1 of the best Veggie Burgers I can remember - oats, mushrooms, & black beans were combined w/ other ""stuff"" in their secret homemade mix & fried to deliciousnessPaired w/ this wonderful kale & peanut salad - lovely vinaigrette dressed this side but maybe a bit less dressing next time would have been even betterBFF got the Chicken Tortilla Soup & Macho Salad.  She has an extended & ongoing list of chicken tortilla soups & after 1 bite said this was now in her Top 2.  It was thick & hearty & had lots of chicken w/ a nice spicy kickThe salad was huge & contained just about everything but the kitchen sink - I saw lettuce, corn, tomatoes, black beans, avocado, chicken & who knows what else was in there!!  But it was A LOT & it was incredibly good ( as deemed by BFF )Sofia Beer to pair w/ my burger - contained live yeast & this provided an interesting compliment to the veggie burger; Malbec to pair w/ BFF's salad.......we're fed & liquified & all is right w/ the world!What a fantastic & delish welcome to Chicago & our Girls' Weekend!"
"Hmmm... I'm torn ...I think this place is just a tad bit dark for my liking on a Saturday lunch.Food is ok.People are raving about the corn bread.,,Of course we had to try it... Verdict ..... Sorry.....It's dry.... Not moist...Not warm enough... We had to ask for butter to give it flavor.. Too crumbly..Nothing great :/I mean, doesn't it come with butter on the side to begin with?! It's corn bread for crying out loud....GaaahIf you're from the south ( my bf's family is ) he said there's real corn inside the cornbread and really really moist and butter on the sideAnyhooo... We ordered the French Dip -- this is really good... The bread was deliciously buttery and prime rib was cooked tenderlyMy bf ordered the Beef ribs... It's pretty tasty ... I love that it came with this peanut coleslaw... It made the dish special :)We ordered the banana pie... And it's just okAmbiance is cozy.... Wait staff is snobbish...Our waitress Stephanie I think her name is, very gracious .... But these other gals walking around, bringing your food or drinks... Those girls are just not smiling at all..I mean... C'mon now... If u can't smile you can work in the kitchen ...This African american girl with long hair.... Brought my Pinot Grigio not even smiling or letting me know that she is setting down my drink. Ugh... Seriously?!Our bill was $105.... appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and a couple of drinks, not bad at allMaybe it would've been better to go at night? Don't know... Welp there's always a next time"
"Great place that my wife and I frequent each time we visit Chicago.  My wife is a vegan and they have wonderful options.  Friday was a bit abnormal as it seemed that they were understaffed and were seated and very rushed to take our order and to get us out of there.  Food is always great, and bar service was excellent.  Being seated just was not up to their standard."
"Legendary cornbread n rotisserie chicken. I love the macho salad. Piano player is fantastic. Service is impeccable!!! If u appreciate impeccable service, this is the place to come. Low key n classy. Great to bring that special someone. During the day u can people watch everyone on Michigan Ave. from the front windows. (Presently windows r covered due to renovations.)"
"We had a nice quick lunch here.  Both of us had the Macho Salad and were impressed with the quantity and the nice mix of flavors of chicken, avocado, goat cheese, and dates."
"Oh yeah! Live jazz and good food? Where have you been all my life?Even though this is part of a chain, I loved every minute of it.I had the trio tips, enchiladas - so delicious. My fiance enjoyed the lamb sandwich which disappeared so quickly, I did not get to taste.Our friend had a cheeseburger made to order. There was all sorts of good stuff at our table.Complimented by the perfect glass of red Zin my meal was tops!.Add old college friends, a good man and a jazz trio - count me in.Even with an hour wait, it was totally worth it. Great experience!"
"Dinner plans at other restaurants fell through, but we were so lucky they did, because otherwise we would never have gotten the chance to visit Bandera!SERVICE: Service was superb, from the maitre d to the wait staff --- everyone was attentive, friendly without ever being intrusive.  We had a short wait since we did walk-in, but the maitre d was nice enough to offer my son some french fries, who happily chowed down.  Very thoughtful gesture.  Waiter was also impressive.  One of the few restaurants where we never felt like we had to look for him, since he was already attentive but not overly so.  Always kept an eye on our water glasses, sodas, and check/bill.  We never had to wait long for anything to come around.FOOD: Food was absolutely wonderful.  The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was very addictive.  It was rich but not heavy, perfect level of flavor without being too salty.We also  highly recommend the Snake River Farms Tri-Tip & Buternut White Cheddar Enchilada.  We've had a lot of enchilada before, but this one was hands-down the BEST. Texture was amazing, perfect temperature, enough cheese to not feel like there's too much tortilla, two different sauces to keep it interesting. Wonderful balance all around.  The Seared #1 Grade Ahi Tuna with mixed greens, mango, avocado and honey-lime vinaigrette was also delicious.  Perfectly seared Ahi tuna, the vinaigrette was refreshing.The House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches were amazing!  It comes in a decadent chocolate sauce, and along with a bit of whipped cream, the French vanilla ice cream coupled with the Oreo cookie crumbs ended our night on a high note.Only thing I would not recommend is the Iron Skillet Cornbread.  It was dry, but was much better once you request and spread the butter.AMBIENCE: Some live music, dimmed lights... Average noise level.  We can hold our conversation just fine.  Mostly business / travelers, very few children if any.  However, our toddler had a great time as well!Loved it! Will visit again!"
"The rotisserie chicken in this place is out of this world. The Macho Salad that my fiance got was absolutely delicious - and I got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Roasted Chicken instead - such a great choice! It was moist, delicious, and a little healthier than a crispy sandwich :)The fries were decent, nothing super amazing. A little soggy actually. The wine list for by-the-glass is pretty extensive, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was dark, intimate, and rustic-modern. Overall, I dig it, I'll definitely be back."
"Dinner?  On the spur of the moment?  On a Friday night?  On North Michigan Avenue?  And only a fifteen-minute wait?  Sold!In all fairness, the hostess quoted us forty, and it probably would have been closer to that if we'd waited for an actual table.  But my husband and I actually rather like sitting at the bar, so when a table-headed couple offered us their seats, we plonked ourselves down, ordered drinks, and immediately began perusing the menu....And this is where I make an admission.  Well, two admissions.  First:  I've always been a broad rather than a deep drinker - I love to try everything, but I can't put them away like some folks do.  Second, and related:  I will rave to you about the drinks here.  The Crisp Martini I especially recommend, which is high praise from this martini traditionalist.  The food, though?  I'm sure it was excellent, because in this town (and in that neighborhood), if the food's *not* excellent it's a surprise.  But I'll be damned if I can remember much about it.  Still, that's far more a reflection of the fact that I was two drinks in when the food came, and continued to have a glass of wine (which I also don't remember much about, other than its deliciousness) with my salad.  For the sake of my reputation as a reviewer, then, I shall have to return on a less celebratory day and pay better attention.  Oh, the sacrifices we make."
"Excellent restaurant, highly recommended! Very reasonable prices but fancy enough that Kanye was in the adjacent booth.Food was awesome--meat portion sizes were ample (rare was especially good), lighter options like ahi tuna were well-balanced with flavorful salad. The oreo dessert was delicious and just the right size.Ambiance is great for a nice dinner--dark stylish lighting and noise level are perfect for having a conversation but yet feeling that you're in a lively environment. Live music. Service was great--Derrick was especially good. Nice, great pointers about the items, fast, very professional. The bar was also good at suggesting drinks that fit each dish.Clientele on a Sunday evening included mostly middle-aged adults, smart casual.Good location within easy access of the EL, construction out front (no impact on inside ambiance).Reservation recommended."
"Came here for an early New Years Eve dinner. Great location so I had high standards.The atmosphere is calm and dark...Very dark (maybe too dark?). This seems like a great place for a date actually.I loved the live Jazz Music (who doesn't love live music!?). Even when they played it wasn't too loud so you could still have a conversation.I had already checked out the Menu before arriving and read many reviews...so I knew I had to taste the corn bread! Definitely get the corn bread!Four of us were seated at a booth. We all ordered different entrees (Salmon, Cheeseburger, Rotisserie chicken, and I ordered the Enchiladas). Personally, I think the menu should have a few more options (vegetarian options).I was surprised to see only 1 enchilada on my plate..along with a veggie mix that I did not like and the rice (yum)...but I do have to say it was delicious! It had two sauces...and wow they were both great. I finished that enchilada in no time. Then I realized that I was actually full! The Enchilada had cheese and squash and potato inside...very different. Now i am not sure if it was worth $19 . Now I am not a cheap person but definitely not worth the price for just one enchilada!Everyone else seemed like their meal. Chicken was also very good (you can tell it is a popular dish), but once again you feel you are paying for the location versus the food. However, the meals are filling. :-)"
"What a great atmosphere. Darkish, comfortable booths, semi open kitchen and live jazz music every night.Though apparently the food used to be better, I really enjoyed the chicken and the fact that I'm getting to do it again for lunch since the portions are massive.I also thought the service was good and the wednesday only tortilla soup was fantastic!Although chain-y, Bandera is a great option and one of the more* inexpensive places to go after an evening troll down Michigan Ave."
"Caught a friends Jazz act a few months ago here. Never knew about this ""upscale"" ish chain before. We had a reservation,  but ended up waiting at the bar for about 15-20 min. (which was fine) it was a busy Sat. night) drinks were ordered,  food was eaten, music was great!  Everything was A- OK as they say in Yelp land."
"Good food, good atmosphere, good music.This place has it all.  The food is excellent (we tried the french dip sandwich and bbq salmon), the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is excellent.  They have live jazz music in the evenings and if you get a window seat, you can people watch all the action on Michigan Avenue.  This is a must-try place when visiting Chicago!"
Went there again and was not disappointed. Tried the kale and peanut salad.  It was to die for.  Not a fan of kale but this made a convert out of me.The beef ribs were also outstanding.
"AWESOME!!! We sampled a few items. The smoked salmon with toast triangles melted in our mouths like butter! The cheese burger was perfection. The macho salad was wonderful! It had everything!! (roasted chicken, avocados, dates and goat cheese) We finished with banana cream pie! Absolutely loved it!!"
"Was looking for Houstons but found Banderas. The spinach dip was great. Not a huge fan of the winter menu options, but everything was still delicious. I got a kale and chicken salad and it was soooooo good. The Jazz playing was awesome. I watched the bar tender make drinks and she is very generous with the alcohol, and topping off not full drinks with liquor instead of filler. My waitress was very friendly and attentive."
So yummy!! Love the food and atmosphere. Corn bread is awesome for app and the salads are super delicious
The food here is too pretty to eat!  The smoked salmon and ahi tuna are my favorites.  Great band and view.
"Good Lord, Bandera  I love you.My mom and I come here every time I visit her. I highly recommend the Bandera Cheeseburger as well as the Caesar Salad. Actually, any and all salads that I have had here have been delicious. The location is prime- right in the heart of Chicago, the greatest city ever.... next to San Francisco ;)"
"First off, on a Wednesday night there was a 30 minute wait - good sign.  I opted to grab a spot at the bar, where they offer a full dining menu. (None of that ""you can only order easy crappy food from the deep fryer"" business).  Awesome bartenders! The grilled artichoke with remoulade was amazing - smokey, charred, smooth. And fun to eat, if you know what you're doing (which I do - mom is 100% Maltese, so I ate a lot of artichokes growing up). I ordered the veggie burger - which may sound boring, but you'd be very mistaken to overlook this item. Oh. My. God. I've had horrible veggie burgers that taste like the corn we used to feed our hogs, thinly veiled with a few sad bits of onion and carrot. And I've had some pretty good veggie burgers - hearty, substantial, crispy edges, savory. The kind that doesn't leave you with buyer's/diner's remorse. But this, this is in a class all by itself. So, technically it is a veggie burger. I suspect some sort of sorcery going on. This thing is so damned good. The patty is delicious. Wearing its sweet soy glaze, it sits regally atop a bed of crisp lettuce, holding court over fresh sliced tomatoes and cold, crisp dill pickle chips. I couldn't figure out the cheese, and was too embarrassed to ask what it was, but I can tell you it was pure goodness. Provolone, I think. Melty and gooey. And the bun- a beautiful, golden sesame seed bun, sweet and firm. A perfect choice. All of this is paired with a delicious kale salad with peanut vinegarette. Awesome pairing, as it is light and zesty and perfectly offsets the burger.  A great meal, with live jazz that was neither overpowering nor overpowered by the ambient noise. I will be back."
"Last lunch in Chicago- and after careful consideration of many highly rated places nearby I am glad we chose this spot. Bridget was a lovely attentive server who could offer great recommendations for us. I had the soup of the day (7) which was like a nice tender chicken chilli on the spicy side which I enjoyed. Chamomile tea - with honey very tasty. We also enjoyed the in house smoked salmon (like butter in your mouth). For entrees we got the lamb sandwich which like all reviews already state - is outstanding- so rich and creamy. As well as the white fish which is a smaller plate compared to the lamb but still plenty with two sides accompanying it. We sat near the window enjoying the view of Michigan with a bottle of Schramsberg. A perfect end to out Chicago trip (and our salmon was comped  )  Ask for Bridget, she was truly great."
"I came here for my first meal on my first trip to Chicago!   The second floor restaurant off the main shopping street of Michigan Ave is sleek and modern.   I felt slightly under dressed in my jeans and winter fleece.  Because I was alone, I sat at the bar. Staff (bartenders) were very helpful and friendly to me.Tried the famous cornbread and what they call a macho salad.  The food was excellent.  One of the best salads I can remember in recent time.   Figs, walnuts, chicken, avocado... very very filling.  The slice of cornbread was pretty tasty as well.  So why only 3*?  I ended up spending over $30 for a salad, a beer, and a slice of cornbread which seemed a bit much to me.   Maybe because this is Michigan ave?"
Two words.Macho Salad.
"Bandera always knocks it out of the park. I have never been disappointed with a Hillstone restaurant, they know their concept and they do it right. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the food is amazing, and the drinks are great.  Bandera has a swanky and sophisticated atmosphere without being intimidating. Great for a casual get together or a date.Some of my favorites:Ding's Crispy Chicken Sandwich- best chicken sandwich ever, and consistent across all Hillstone restaurants that feature this item. The Dip Duo- pimento cheese on one side, guacamole on the other, chips in the middle. A great way to kick off your meal.The Burger- flavorful, always cooked properly and made with careThe Paloma - great cocktail, has pink peppercorns and isn't too sweet or too bitterReally you can't go wrong here, I can only say great things about Bandera."
"Hadn't been here for ages, but the food was exactly as I remembered...and maybe even better.  It seems like it might be just another 'touristy' spot, per it's location on Michigan Ave.; however, it really is an oasis for anyone who wants a classy but down to earth dining experience.  Gotta try: the Macho Salad (I order it w/ extra avocado every time...) and the cornbread that comes in its own skillet.  One word to sum up Bandera?: Delectable."
"No complaints here, thorough service and delicious food for the price. Make sure to get a reservation if you don't prefer waiting at the bar. There is live jazz music which is nice at first but make sure you're willing to shout to talk to your friends or family."
"Wonderful culinary experience, perfect location on Michigan Avenue. Start with the Tuna Poke delicious appetizer,  and Grilled Artichokes!! We had great choices around for the four of us you just can't go wrong here!! Ahi tuna salad, the macho salad is a wonderful combination of goat cheese, dates, cornbread croutons...yummy! My daughter had the barbecue Salmon with spinach and mash potatoes.  Banana cream pie is awesome! Fresh gourmet delight overlooking the Miracle Mile (music every night) our Waitress Anna served us with great attention to our needs! (Nice smile too) Don't miss this!"
"For years, Bandera's has been my go-to lunch and dinner spot for the Loop. Until the Gage, etc. opened several years ago, there just weren't many reliable, ambient joints in the area. I'm so glad it remains.Reliably tasty/niche food, good prices and ambience are probably not so unusual in a world-class city. What makes a handful of venues exceptional, such as Banderas, is as busy as they typically are, most staff maintain not only a smile but an air of appreciation for patrons. I never mind waiting.With an estimated 45 minute wait for a booth, we had bar stools in 10 minutes. Beverages and bar appetizers were fast. I had three coffees with Bailey's in addition to several glasses of water and appetizers. Not once was I made to feel like I was a bother. Perfect.Once seated, my party enjoyed the signature cornbread (needs no butter or ANYTHING, among the best of ANY Chicago restaurant I've experienced EVER), apricot glazed rotisserie half-chicken and the prime rib. The chicken was delicious as usual. And although the steak was cooked more than requested, my dinner companion refused to return it because it was still moist, tender and tasty. Sides included traditional like sautéed spinach and garlic potatoes as well as a very fresh, tasty tabbouleh salad. Service was provided by three folks during the course of our meal, each one fast, efficient and friendly.Finally, the spot offers love jazz combos on the weekends. Fantastic background for the ambience.If you seek a special spot without astronomical prices in this part of the city, give Bandera's a try. After patronizing for about 15 years, I have never regretted a visit and doubt you will."
"Great food, great ambience, great service.  Had grilled artichoke, Macho salad, and seared ahi tuna, all really flavorful and fresh. Dessert was Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich; not as exciting as app and dinner. Overall a great experience that didn't break the bank.Tip: entrance is on Michigan through the door marked Men's Wearhouse. Take the escalator to the second floor."
"Good food, it taste very good....It's a little bit darker for me but it has a very nice setting with live jazz music.Staff is fine too!Pretty good experience :) Definitely, I would come back....."
Brought my coworkers here during a business trip.  Ask your hotel concierge to call ahead so reduce your wait time.They have a great wine and beer selection. I got the macho salad again - very filling for salad.  My coworkers finished their plates clean as well so I take it they enjoy their meals.  A great option on Michigan avenue.
"Last minute decision, was hungry and it was right across the street from us.  Great ambiance, you can see the kitchen in action from you seat. We had the following:- Cornbread:  this is some very delicious cornbread, can be eat hot or cold, took it to-go and it was still good!- Dip Duo:  do not mistaken that the Spinach and Artichoke will be included in this; it actually comes with an avocado dip and some sort of spicy crab? maybe.. the spicy dip was good.- Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich: delicious sandwich, great flavors- Rotisserie Chicken: split roasted dutch country chicken served with Mexico City rice; the chicken was okay, not that memorable - Home-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches served with dark chocolate sauce: this was also okay, expected a lot betterI would of never gone here, but we got hungry last minute.. Maybe I would come here again, there food was overall not that bad."
"A colleague of mine and I lucked into eating at Bandera after realizing neither of us wanted to wait up to two hours for a cramped spot at the Purple Pig at 6:30 PM on a Thursday evening. I spied the restaurant across the street and said, ""Let's check it out."" So glad we did!Even though we had to wait about a half hour for our table, we were able to score a couple seats at the bar where we enjoyed a pre-dinner drink while listening to the lovely jazz combo - piano and bass - playing nearby. I heartily recommend the Signature Margarita, but there are ample beer and wine options as well.Service is exceptional, and if you have a food allergy, they will steer you to safe menu items, which I always appreciate. I decided to order the grilled chicken salad, sans peanut sauce, and it was quite delicious. In fact, it reminded me of a very similar dish I've often eaten at my local Atlanta Houston's restaurant. Which is not so surprising, as both Bandera and Houston's are run by the same parent company, Hillstone Restaurant Group. I normally avoid chain restaurants when traveling, but Bandera did not feel like a corporate chain in the least. In fact, it reminded me of my time in Chicago twenty years ago, when I frequented the Green Mill for cocktails and live jazz.While there are currently no gluten free desserts on the menu, my dining companion quite enjoyed his banana cream pie. It looked and smelled amazing."
"We sat at the bar for great service and delicious food. All the plates we saw looked creative with heathy portions. Try the Tuna Poke, it's worth the trip."
"First thing I have to say is that the service was GREAT! I had the rotisserie chicken and it was very good. It was paired wit the brussel sprouts which were very good also. I was at a table for 6, and most others had the Tri Tip Enchilada plate, which looked very good as well. The entrance to the restaurant was almost hard to find, as you have to go into the entrance for the Men's Warehouse and ride the escalator up one floor, then walk down a hallway toward a dentists office. All part of the adventure."
"Great atmosphere, right on Michigan Avenue. Ate here on a weekday evening, surprised by how many people dining out at 8:00 pm.Food was very good. We especially liked the vegetable sides, like the sautéed spinach. That dish, topped with some wickedly flavorful white cheese, was so good, we ordered a second.The tuna entree, served on a salad, was perfectly cooked, raw in the center, medium on the outside.Live music was a nice touch, but a bit too loud to maintain conversation."
Awesome place even it's on my least favorite street Michigan ave! I tried their salad once and it's super legit. Nice ambience for dates or friends. Definitely want to come back again.
"In 2005, when I was visiting Chicago while still an itinerant technologist for my old employer, I had a free evening for dinner, and ended up at Bandera on Michigan Avenue at the recommendation of the concierge at the hotel.Sense memory is a funny thing, overall, you've got a set of neural pathways that remind you how something tastes, and it's like an instant flashback to that moment. Like that. Wham. You're down the rabbit hole and out in your memory space. That's Bandera.So we walked in tonight, and I ordered what I always order: the prime rib sandwich. It's a french dip, with horseradish on the side, and fries. The prime rib is perfectly medium rare, cut in slices so thin they meld together into an amazing whole. The bun it's served on is buttery and slick without being greasy or slippery. That first bite is a bit like heaven. The roll, the steak, the horseradish, the au jus, it all comes together in this nuanced moment where time stops and only your taste buds are taking in sensory data. I'm fairly sure I was blind there for the first 5 seconds. The fries are a light and crisp accompaniment, but neither add to nor detract from the rest of the sandwich. The sandwich is the star here, and the supporting act will not be getting a contract.We began tonight with their duo of dips, a fresh guacamole, and a spicy cheese spread, that were an excellent rejoinder to the Old Fashioned from the bar. While the drink was sweet, the existential nature of the bourbon and the bitters more than held their own with the simple syrup, and the house-made preserved cherry.Our second round of drinks was a Sazerac (for me) and a Manhattan (for Tiff) and they were as good as I've had in all of DC, and would not have been strangers at a place like The Passenger or The Gibson. The Sazerac was particularly well-balanced, using Templeton to set off the absinthe, and the Peychaud's was not overpowering.Dessert we sadly could not stay and savor, as Charlie was beginning to get riled, but we took away their Banana Creme Pie, and it was every bit as good as I remembered, with about a banana and a half in each slice, as well as some excellent chocolate and house-made smoky caramel sauce.The thing about memory is that it can betray you. You may remember something being better than it actually is. I can happily say that no such thing happened tonight at Bandera, where the food was every bit as good (if not better!) than it was a decade ago, and where the drinks have raised their game. Go. Now. What are you waiting for?"
"Love this place!  Never disappoints and I wanted to highlight two things or maybe three or four that were just stellar on my most recent visit.  Sitting at the bar you see that any ""juice"" drink you order is fresh squeezed and shaken... very impressive and incredibly delicious ... especially for me, the vodka/grapefruit.  This time of year they were serving the most amazing black eyed peas and cornbread.... I was blown away and cleaned my plate... BUT i ALWAYS leave room for dessert at Bandera bc they have one of my favorites... Banana Cream Pie.  OHHHHHHH mYYYYYYY is it scrumdillyicious.... Obviously my most recent visit continuous to remind me why I love this delicious, often missed, neighborhood haunt."
"The food is decent. However, it's really irritating when you want to order a salad and you ask to customize it and the kitchen refuses to do it...Especially when the waiter claims it's not premade.Hostess gave me attitude when I was trying to get an accurate estimate on how long it would take to get our table."
"Very good food. Love the live jazz music. Nothing jaw-droppingly life changing, but everything is very good. Their kale salad and fried chicken sandwich are always safe bets."
"Bandera is a Chicago staple and consistently serves up yummy food year after year!  The moment you walk into the space you are enticed by the woodsy smell of the wood fire oven.  Everything is wonderful from the salads, sandwiches, entrees, and wines. In my most recent visit I tried their Veggie Burger which was a really good handmade burger. The waitstaff said it was award winning. Not sure if that is true but it was better than most.  I would only ask the chef to consider a different bun than the sesame that it was on.  My friend had the French Dip which looked and tasted amazing.  The waitress told us it was the best sandwich in Chicago.So for the ""best and award winning"" food make your way to Bandera. Ask for a window seat if you want a view of the shoppers below."
Looking for a beautiful restaurant over looking Michigan Ave with live music and awesome cornbread? Go to Bandera!
"Delicious pork. Given the huge number of restaurants around here, it was still a great choice!"
"Amazing service, location, and atmosphere!!We ate the best salads we've probably ever eaten! We ordered the duo appetizer which came with guacamole and spicy queso with chips-- all were top notch!"
Great lunch place. Comfy cozy atmosphere overlooking Michigan Ave. Great salads. Must try the skillet cornbread. The chicken corn salad with peanut dressing is also excellent. Good wine and beer. Great stop after a hard day of shopping.
"Wow, I was honestly surprised by how much I LOVED this restaurant. I tend to write off the restaurants on Michigan Ave because they are so tourist-oriented and usually overpriced, but this is a great spot. My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's day and this restaurant perfectly fit the bill. They put us in a huge booth with a view of the live jazz band, and we were able to get very cozy in the dark restaurant. However, Bandera is very smart because they have recessed lighting that specifically lights only the table area. You can see your food perfectly, but you are still in a cozy dark environment. Also, the tables/booths are separated and spacious enough that you don't have to hear anyone else's conversations.Anyway, the wine selection was decent, and we ended up ordering a bottle. Our server was great (perfectly attentive without being annoying), although I don't remember her name. We shared the skillet cornbread to start and it was delicious (if you like that sort of thing). I ordered the prime beef as medium (but it was probably medium rare), which was so filling and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend got the tuna, which comes seared lightly with a big salad, and he loved it. Overall, the meal and the menu selections were just great. If someone asked me to recommend a romantic restaurant downtown, this would totally be it. Excellent service, food, and ambiance."
"Right on michigan ave. Entrance may be a little tricky to find. Been here only a couple times, and they always had live music playing. The music, downtown street view, dimly lit lighting, and solid food and drinks! Last time we were here, we had ahi tuna, crispy chicken, and spinach artichoke dip. All around very decent American food."
"Here is the secret to happiness:Bandera's Crispy Chicken Sandwich and a glass of  Pinot Grigio.If you haven't had this remarkable lunch paring, your life has been dull and dreary - get out there and live, kid!Chicken is what these people do! It's their life. The chicken is crispy (as advertised) but also juicy. The bread is perfect (made in-house!!), and if you believe there is no such thing as 'too much mayo' then, you and I can be friends. Ask for a side of spicy mayo and live the vida loca!On a serious note, Bandera's service could not be better. Our server Chelsea  was very nice and answered all of my silly questions with a smile (I can be very annoying as I think I am VERY funny sometimes). That white wine I love so much - her idea! Everyone who worked there kept smiling at us and each other like they were happy we could all be here together.So, if you find yourself in need of a life-changing lunch with a great staff and amazing food AND if your boss is cool with you having a glass of wine with your lunch - then get thee to Bandera!"
"I love love love this place. Bandera and I had a hard time a few years back when I showed up for the tuna poke and it's wasn't on the menu ...I felt betrayed but I was in the wrong there is so much good stuff I was just looking past.  There are a ton of restaurants in the area but Bandera is just easier than most, it's relatively cheeper and easy to get into. It has a affordable wine list, great food, and a sexy atmosphere. It's a great place for a work or lunch date and just as great or better in the evenings."
How can you go wrong with this place. Location is first rate. Try to find in New York City right in the heart of where you want to be and leave completely satisfied for under $40 per person. Add a great darkened atmosphere. Throw in unbelievable mellow jazz and I still did not say the food is great and you will leave full and completely satisfied.
"I was introduced to this restaurant several years ago and try to eat here at least once every time I come to town. The food is consistently very good and very reasonably priced, - especially for downtown Chicago.  The wine list is also quite nice and reasonably priced. I'm a lover of Jazz, so listening to great live music while I dine is a bonus. This time, I stopped by for lunch (as well as 2 dinners) and was very impressed by the hamburger.  At dinner, I had the Cluck and Moo - rotisserie chicken and beef ribs - which isn't on the menu, but you should ask your waiter/waitress about it. The second night, we had the roasted artichoke and smoked salmon appetizers, both of which were outstanding. The only down side is that it's usually packed and there can be a long wait. Plan on it and relax in the bar while you wait. It's worth it!  I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in town!"
"I was here for lunch recently and I was shocked looking at the menu to see how pricey it was - for lunch nonetheless. I went with the smoked salmon, which was considered an appetizer and still rang up at $14...that's Michigan Ave pricing for ya. I must say that the fish itself was rather delicious and a decent size for an appetizer portion. My friend ordered the cornbread & focaccia appetizer plate and we were both loving that. FYI that this place is known for their skillet cornbread - it's delicious. And the focaccia we tried was definitely quite yummy too - the outside had a great buttery crunch to it, yet the inside remained so airy and perfectly focaccia-like. The restaurant itself definitely has a clean feel to it. My only complaint there is that the place is super dark inside. Now if I were coming here around dinner time, I wouldn't mind this so much (as it's already dark outside). But at lunch time, it was kind of a depressing atmosphere, especially with the shades pulled down covering what I knew was a gorgeous view of the shops and crowds on Mich Ave. A decent spot if you find yourself here, but with all of the other fantastic dining options in the area - I don't see myself coming back here."
"I've been here many times for lunch and dinner, with parties and without.  This is a solid and consistent restaurant located overlooking Michigan Avenue with live jazz nightly. The Macho Salad here is fantastic, as is the Lamb Sandwich, Cheeseburger, and Prime Rib Sandwich. The cocktail list is nice, with classic cocktails such as Sezarac, Manhattans, Moscow Mules, etc. The service is always prompt and professional."
"Very nice place and delicious specialities! Second time here, will visit more~"
"Good food but our server was not good. We saw the manager more than our server. She took our order, got us water several times and visited just to make sure everything was OK. She saved us from not complaining. She deserves a raise_ wish I knew her name! Pricy drinks but it is Michigan St in Chicago."
"Still love Bandera's. The combination of fond memories,  location, nice atmosphere and good food make me want to come back here when we are in (down) town. Right off of (above) Michigan Ave a rather large, dark-ish, jazzy restaurant 'hides'. You'll have to walk a few stairs to get there, but it is definitely worth it. The first time my husband took me here I compared it to a speakeasy, the whole stairway thing and all, I guess.. Filet and steaks are fresh, juicy and good. The fresh fish selection is always changing and there are good-looking vegetarian options to be found.The drinks, crab cakes and mashed potatoes are to die for. They serve a crispy skillet corn bread which is hard (okay, impossible) to resist. We used to come here frequently together or with friends and family. It is a good place to have a chill get-together at a prime location when staying in one of the Mich Ave hotels, or after a long day of walking around."
Bandera is delicious. A bit on the pricey side for me but it definitely competes with some of the other upscale restaurants in the area.The love their classic caesar salad and corn bread appetizer. The chicken sandwich is also another great thing on their menu. I had one cocktail there - the vesper and it great. An excellent place to go for an indulgent lunch.
"It a Friday night, we just got into town and Bandera was our first dinner. Service was excellent.  We got there at 5:30 no wait for a table but by the time we left at 7:30, there were quite a few people waiting for a table. Ribs were excellent. The Macho salad was stuffed with chicken and large variety of items. The Kale salad had a nice peanut dressing. The chicken as always was outstanding, juicy and flavorful!"
Our first trip to Chicago and this place was recommended. We loved it. The live music was wonderful and we had a table by the window. It is worth the extra wait for a view like that! I had the macho salad and it was so good. My husband had the burger and he loved it as well. We finished off with the Oreo ice cream sandwich and it was great! We will be back next time.
"About a 2-2.5: I was referred here by a co-worker who raved about the wonderful salads they had.  We were seated promptly by the window, which was nice. Our server was friendly and asked us what we would like to drink.  We ordered right away, since a specific menu item was suggested.  For appetizers, we started off with the Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  The bowl was an okay size, and the the thin tortilla chips were not enough (but, you can ask the server for more servings, which was not a problem).  The dip also came with two sides of salsa and sour cream.  This was very good since when you mix all of them together, it made the dip even more enjoyable (the artichoke dip itself was a bit cold and bland to begin with).   We ordered the famous Macho Salad, which came with roasted chicken, avocado, dates, almonds and goat cheese.  The dressing was a champagne and raw egg yolk mixture - weird consistency, and you can taste the sliminess of the yolk and a hint of the bubbly - there weren't any avocado or goat cheese in the salad, so overall, the meal was pretty disappointing.  However, I was glad I was able to try this place out, but I don't think I'd go back!+Macho Salad - can cause stomach issues T____T"
This place is great. We popped in here waiting for a table for Purple Pig.Amazing place and nice service and The dip duo is great! I would like to go back for a full munch up!
"Great atmosphere with live jazz and friendly and attentive staff. I came with a friend bc we both heard about the macho salad, and it did not disappoint! I usually don't order salads at restaurants, but I loved the goat cheese, dates, cornbread, avocado, dressing, etc in this one. We also shared a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, which was huge and delicious - perfect for fall!"
"Great atmosphere.  Great jazz music.  Great waitress.  Terrible for vegetarians.  I ate cornbread and spinach.  Couldn't order salad without meat.  Couldn't order rice because it's cooked in chicken broth.  Won't be back.  I don't expect every restaurant to cater to my vegetarianism, but having one or two basic options seems reasonable..."
"First time eating here and I had a great experience with my girlfriend. We enjoyed the view of Michigan Avenue and the live jazz. I had the beef back ribs, which I enjoyed and we're definitely up there on my list of ribs. My girlfriend had the prime rib and it was TO DIE FOR!"
"My family and I were in town and decided to check out Bandera. Bandera is one of the restaurants under the Hillstone chain. We came around 2:30 in the afternoon so we only had to wait five minutes before being seated. I ordered the NY strip which came with a side hand cut fries.When asked how I want my meat cooked, I always tell my servers ""medium rare"". Typically, the meat is overcooked, and a few occasions undercooked to the point where the meat is pure red. To my surprise, the meat was cooked close to perfection. The steak was tender and savory while the fries were mediocre.Overall, the food was good; however, the service was a bit off. There wasn't much interaction, and our waitress appeared to be uninterested in serving us. We basically ate,paid for our check and left. I expected better service from a chain like Hillstone. I've been to Houston many times and I never felt a negative vibe from my servers. Out of the two Hillstone chains I've been to, I still prefer Houston's because of their menu selection and service. If you have the choice, go to Houston's!"
"I brought my parents for dinner and really enjoy the experience. excellent food, superb service, beautiful jazz and great ambience n unique deco! will definitely visit this restaurant again.I definitely recommend the pork filet. it is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The spices used to season the pork really brings out the sweetness of the meat. the meat is fresh and the serving is huge.what I really like about the meal is that they serve equal servings of meat and vegetables. they serve stir fry spinach with garlic, celery, and bell peppers. I love the spinach as it has a slightly garlic and salty taste to it. This combination is perfect and genius! a good fusion of both European and Asian cooking method."
"Extremely long wait, even with reservations, but the service made up for it. Their cornbread is the BEST i have ever had! The environment was great, food even better! I had the turkey burger and it was pretty good. My friends had the sliders and they loved theirs. Definitely try their cornbread!"
Great restaurant. Service is top notch to match the food quality. They are thinkers here and know how to provide great service.  We came with a baby and they we're prepared
"Bandera is great!  The atmosphere, even under construction, is cool.  It does remind me a bit of Houston's, which is owned by the same group.  I had the beef spare ribs.  They are other-worldly great!  Divine.  Superlative, superlative, superlative; on the short list of best ribs I've had anywhere (including pork ribs).  They are served with a delicious kale salad and fries with house made spicy mayo and ketchup.  The service was gracious.  The cocktails were expertly made.  The meal was so good, that we went back the next day!"
"My husband and I dined here on a Friday night shortly after arriving into Chicago on a late afternoon flight. We found the service to be top notch. Casual, friendly, but not intrusive. The food is quite good (comfort fare, mostly). Loved the live Jazz and the bar makes great cocktails. Looks like a Houstons (it's owned by them, but a bit more authentic)."
"I'm a big fan of Houstons/ Hillstone to begin with so expectations were high and this didn't disappoint.  Really terrific experience.  Ask for a table by the window as the view of the ""miracle mile"" was fantastic.   The wine list is incredibly well priced so take advantage if you like reds.   The food was excellent (literally the best Caesar I've ever had).  No clue what  was in the dressing but the flavor was unique.  The ribs were great as well.    Service terrific and overall, a must see if visiting Chicago."
"Came in by myself for my favorite, the Grilled Chicken Salad. The bar was packed and I might not have stayed, but for the delightful hostess Maggie. She carried out a stool, made room at the bar for me, and then I was quickly sitting and eating. Service was fast, salad excellent."
"Passes all the tests of the Houston's/Hillstone/R&D chain.Great atmosphere. Excellent Service. Consistenlty great food.Can be a ""go to"" restaurant for all types of occasions.Window views of Michigan Ave are outstanding."
This pace is amazing!!! I was in Chicago for work and came here for dinner solo after reading reviews. I had the small caesar salad and bbq salmon. Everything tasted divine. Not to crowded and seated near the Windows with a great view of Michigan Ave. I will definitely be back!!
"So for a place called Bandera, I assumed that there would be a number of Latin options for food, but I was wrong.  We got the dip duo with tortilla chips.  The portions are pretty small considering it was supposed to be an appetizer for 3 people.  I got the salmon with brussel sprouts with a side of green rice.  All very good.  My fellow diners got the macho salad that was delicious and the french dip sandwich which was good, but not great.Overall, because of the prices and the slow service, this place is just OK."
"What a difference a year makes.A year had passed since I last went to Bandera. It was a constant haunt for lunch. Since then, I had left Chicago, returned, and had not been back to the end of Michigan Avenue where Bandera is.Then I went to meet friends for lunch there.The service is still outstanding. The cornbread is still worth the rave. But what happened to the salmon? This may have been the one day when my food roulette didn't pan out as expected. As tasty as it was, the salmon was bordering closely to dry. The brussel sprouts were seasoned, a nice complement to the salmon. I missed having the rice pilaf, though, but restaurants do change their menus.Far from an experience that would have me panning the restaurant. I will have to see what the next lunch or dinner experience will be like."
"I went here about three weeks ago on a Saturday night. The place was busy, but the service was great! My waitress was friendly and took time to chat with my friend and I even though she had other tables. She always had a smile when I saw her which speaks volumes to me considering how packed that place was. There was live music--jazz that evening--which made the experience even better. The food was amazing and their chefs cheesecake was SO yummy! It's a temporary dessert, so go in before the end of Nov to try it :)"
"I recently tried this place out with a few others. I think it's just ok. Overall, all of us felt the food was decent but definitely on the salty side and a bit overpriced. Dishes ordered included the pecan trout and ribs. The mashed potatoes (mixed with green beans?) that came with the trout was pretty good, but the main part of the meal (e.g. sauce on the trout, and sauce on the ribs) made all of us drink lots of water (during and after the meal).PSA from me to any restaurant that wants to be rated a 4+: Salt is NOT a substitute for good flavor. a good sauce stands alone....it doesn't need anything else. Service was average only because no one ever came to fill our water glasses (vital due to comment above). Otherwise, the server was friendly when he/she did drop by Soooo many better places out there (for less money)...won't be back again."
"After plans to dine at The Purple Pig fell through (we couldn't justify the 2 hour and 45-minute wait), we walked a little down Michigan Avenue and discovered Bandera. We did not have reservations, so we were fine waiting an hour before a table opened up for four. My friends enjoyed drinks + a bottle of wine from the bar and we could lean on a sort of window sill (minus the window) protruding from the wall because every seat at the bar was taken.We were seated and enjoyed the corn bread for our appetizer while perusing the menu. This corn bread was delicious and a little more savory than store-bought cornbread I've had. The portion is generous, so we boxed up half of it for leftovers. My mouth is watering thinking about it now! I definitely advise you try the cornbread if you come here.The waitress described the vegetarian options for us when asked and even though I was the only vegetarian, another member of our party thought it sounded so delicious that we both ordered the veggie burger. The burger was heavenly and unlike any veggie burger I have ever tasted. This veggie burger put all others I've had to shame! As if that was not overwhelmingly delicious enough, the roasted peanut coleslaw completely knocked it out of the park. If possible, I almost enjoyed it more than the burger. My dining companions were equally impressed with their meals.The server was very friendly and very apologetic when she accidentally brought us the wrong check. Our waters were re-filled twice during the evening and we felt that we were attended to. The server was also very familiar with the menu and gave us thoughtful, personal and personalized suggestions.After all my raving about the food, I have not even gotten to the atmosphere! The ambiance is my favorite: warm, cozy, romantic, dimly lit, trendy-ish, with LIVE JAZZ MUSIC. The jazz music sealed the deal: I love this place. Overall, I had an incredible experience at Bandera and it makes me question that a few of the other five-star reviews I wrote deserved it! I will definitely return the next time I'm around Michigan Avenue.Note: The coat closet is not supervised, so use at your discretion. We opted to just bring our coats with us to our table."
macho salad is awesome!
Went to bandera for my birthday. Good food and service. It was nice and romantic. The reason I gave them one less star is because they had us wait for 40 mins even though we had reservations. We finally got seated my the window and the view of michigan ave was pretty.
"I can't say enough how great this place is.... I can't come to Chicago without eating here... Food is incredible, service is fast and impeccable... Eat the French dip and cornbread... Also, found out today the bloody Mary's are the bomb!!  The only issue is they don't have beds to nap in after your meal!!"
This place is wonderful! Definitely a great place to impress a date :) there's live music and the staff are so nice and accommodating.  The food is delicious in general (though I would avoid the hand cut fries and cornbread - those were not that great). Highly recommend visiting!
Ate at the bar had the duo dip which is spicy cheese and guacamole. Also had trout. Definitely substitute French fries because they are awesome. Ask for their spicy mayo it's fantastic. Trout was good a little too sweat of a glaze with walnuts but not bad. Had a bottle of wine to go with dinner. Wine selection here is not bad with most wines being from california. Overall not a bad place with live jazz. Would definitely recommend it
"When you go into a beautiful restaurant  like Bandera for a cocktail, you do not expect to see diaper-clad infants sitting on top of the bar. When a family brings in three children - and they are all sitting at or on the bar and the infant starts screaming...makes the beautiful environment - not so beautiful. The staff didn't seem to think this was an issue - however, it was a problem for my friends and I. No longer will visit Bandera - and children should not be allowed to sit at a  bar! Apparently Chicago Liquor licenses don't prohibit this - not sure why? I have been in many Chicago restaurants in which the owner has politely asked families with children to move from bar stools - I guess Bandera management thinks it is ok..."
"Ate here on Thursday, when I was in town on business. Fantastic experience and great view of ""The Magnificent Mile"" from the bar!"
"Visited with a large group for dinner during a work visit to Chicago. We were trying to avoid the noise and mayhem at other places because it was St. Patrick's Day. This was the anti-St. Patty's location - quiet, sophisticated, relaxing, and subdued. Had a delicious meal and a few glasses of an outstanding pinot noir. Service was very friendly and professional, and never rushed."
"Just wow. First starting off with a complaint. We were expecting a wait, sure. Head vet, they told us the wait was going to be ~30 minutes and it ended up being closer to almost closer to an hour. Which is odd because I think most restaurants try to overestimate how long the wait will be so that customers feel like they we're let in sooner. Anyway so the waiting was not funHowever otherwise this place was great. The atmosphere was so nice - absolutely loved the live jazz! The portion size of the food was substantial. Fr example,  I ordered the cornbread expecting a slice and instead I got something closer to the size of a cake. The honey salmon was some of the best salmon my family has claimed to have."
"This is truly one of my favorite places in the city. I live right around the corner, so it is really convenient.The food is excellent; their queso dip is to die for (I don't even like queso). The macho salad is delicious. All of their sandwiches are great, especially the burger. It is unique and not something I've seen anywhere else.The service is top notch. We usually eat at the bar, and the bartenders are excellent at what they do. Friendly, fast, and attentive.The drinks are wonderful as well. Best margarita in the city, I am sure of it.This really is a gem of Chicago...."
"I ate at the bar to save time and because I was alone.  Very usual for my business travel.  Service was still spot on.  More importantly, the salad was so good that I could have eaten it alone and been content.  It was so wonderful the barkeep could have slapped me mid-bite and I still would have loved it.  The seared ahi-tuna was even better than the salad."
"I had the kale salad with roasted chicken tonight. Wow, the flavors were just amazing. Flavorful dressing with a spicy kick and super moist roasted chicken. I'd come back just for this. Awesome cocktail. Great server. I was reluctant to come back because I had been here before and always like to try new places. So glad the other ""new place"" decided to close early tonight."
"Been here a few times, always left satisfied. Never spectacular, but always a fan. I highly recommend the cornbread, it's always fantastic and I get it every time.I've only been to Bandera for lunch so I've pretty much stuck with their sandwiches and salads. Their chicken is what they're known for and the chicken sandwich is second to none. I also enjoy the Macho Salad which just has so much great food on it. The food doesn't necessarily seem like it all goes together on one salad, but it works somehow. This most recent time I had the French Dip which was OK at best. There was a LOT of fat on the roast beef but the au jus was good and I liked the spicy mayo the fries came with. It may seem a bit on the pricy side for seemingly simple dishes but you're paying for the location, the gorgeous decor, good service as well."
"Get the chicken! It's wonderful and so is the cornbread. A little more strict than other restaurants of this caliber, asking gentlemen to remove their ball caps when they have on jeans and gym shoes.  However I would recommend this establishment for a quiet night out with the significant other."
Amazing! And I only truly give 5 stars to the best. We had family in from out of town and searched yelp and found decided on this restaurant on a whim. Excellent food - from the cornbread to the grilled chicken salad. I also had an alcoholic beverage - Pimm's Cup I believe it was called & I loved it! I also loved how greatly staffed this restaurant is - our waitress was able to be super attentive this way. I will return and try out great items on the menu!
Bandera is a must go place for yummy food!!! I had the veggie burger and it melted in my mouth!  The side was a kale salad and it was the best kale I've had. So good. The wait staff was great and helpful. Will return here!
"Great evening with my brother and his wife back in the Fall. The ambience is great, and we didn't have to wait long to be seated. The night we went, they were running a special on baby back ribs, which were the most tender and delicious ribs I've ever had. (Sorry Memphis!)My Old Fashioned cocktail to start was well-mixed and delicious, and our server was attentive but not pushy. The background music was soft and enjoyable, and we definitely did not have to compete with it to enjoy our meal. I hear they have live jazz here, but I think we ate before the band came on - would be interested to come back and enjoy that some time.Overall, a very enjoyable restaurant to spend some quality time with friends and family. Definitely make reservations, since I hear it's often really hard to get a table if you don't!Will definitely return."
"Great atmosphere,  great jazz music, great food and cocktails, great service. What's not to like?  Prime Rib came out from the kitchen exactly as we ordered it, rare and juicy with great mashed potatoes. Ribs were fall off the bone tender with a tasty sauce. Seared Ahi cooked to perfection. Nice unexpected touch when the waiter brought fresh chilled glasses to swap out for our straight up Manhattans which we had lingered over. A great go to restaurant for people in the neighborhood."
"Bandera Restaurant is a great place for a nice evening dinner. I went here for New Year's Eve dinner with a friend. Without a reservation,surprisingly, I was able to get a table for two without having to wait too long. The atmosphere is a ambient with dim lighting and nice music. For starters, we ordered some artichoke and spinach dip, which was very good but a bit overpriced. For our entrees, we ordered the Macho salad, which is recommended by many, and Seared Ahi Tuna. Both entrees were delicious. The roasted chicken with the mixture of dates, avocado, almonds, and goat cheese makes for an exciting, flavorful salad. The Seared Ahi Tuna  was also very, very delicious. The thin cut pieces of tuna were tender and packed with flavor.; the side with this dish mixed green with mango and avocado was okay, nothing terribly exciting. To top it all off, we ordered House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches with dark chocolate espresso sauce, which was decent. Without the dark chocolate sauce, it would be pretty bland and not worthwhile to try.Overall, service was decent. It is definitely a good place to get decent dinner without breaking bank in Chicago downtown."
"Holy cow.... Love, Love, Love this place! You would seriously miss Bandera even amidst the in-your-face storefronts on the Mag Mile! Across from Nordy's, Bandera's ambiance the moment you step in is inviting with it's rotisserie chicken and slow roasting lamb cooking behind glass doors near the entrance, dark woods, and comfy booths. Though you may think you've walked into another stuffy, uppity establishment in downtown the minute you lay your eyes on it's dim-lit and fancy interior, trust me... you will be pleasantly surprised.During the lunch hour, this place is packed ANY day of the week I've gone. So, either be prepared to wait, get there at the non-rush hour, or just pull up at the bar! Tony, the bartender, not only makes mmmm drinks, and is super friendly and funny, but is amazingly knowledgeable about Bandera's menu and how things are prepared. Atypical, but so awesome I'd say!My fav stuff here are anything with its perfectly not-mayonnaisey or tart roasted peanut slaw! (runner up with Grand Luxe's peanut slaw). The veggie burger here will raise your expectations of all veggie burgers you HAVE EVER EATEN after this one! And, well, my buddy had the slow roasted lamb sandwich that was cooked to perfection.There's nothing about Bandera's I would change. Conveniently located with bus stops steps away as well as garage and valet parking, there's no excuse for not dining here!"
"I was a little skeptical of any restaurant that's on the Magnificent Mile since most look like chains.  I sat at the bar, which was pretty crowded.I ordered their rotisserie lamb sandwich, which was very, very good.  The meat was prepared so that it doesn't have the normal gamey taste that lamb is known for.  The cole slaw, which had cilantro, really complimented the sandwich.  I washed it down with the Green Line beer on draft, which was a Pale Ale.  I enjoyed the meal so much that I actually got a banana cream pie.  That was also good, but I probably should have went with a dish of ice cream instead.  An added bonus was the live jazz music in the background, which was just loud enough to hear, but not enough that you couldn't speak to people.  I did talk to two ladies sitting next to me and it turns out they live right around the block.  Good to see local endorsement."
"Bandara is one of my favorite places in the loop to dine. The prices aren't horrible, and the food is fresh and delicious. I first came here with a friend for lunch. I got the macho salad, which was huge, and made with rotisserie chicken, dates, avocado. They roast their own rotisserie chicken, and it comes out super juicy and tender. My friend got the rotisserie chicken sandwich and loved that as well. It wasn't until I came for dinner that I tried the cornbread. It's served hot in a skillet and mmm mmm! It is a must try! I've been here a few more times for dinner and have yet to try anything else, because I literally have come back for the cornbread and salad-- which is something I never thought I would say about a salad!The restaurant is dim and romantic, but still great for a night out with friends. They oftentimes have live jazz playing, which is a plus. Also, the staff is very well trained and polite. Definitely worth checking out."
"One of my all-time faves, and I'm a Chicago lifer!  Always great food; this time I was craving a burger and theirs hit it dead-on.  Music always a plus and non-intrusive.  A newer server, Cameron, was spectacular-she really knows her stuff, including when to stop by and when not to (and this is a fine art!).  Incredibly nice.  Can't wait to go back!"
This place is my favorite so far. Have you ever had kale? It's healthy and earthy and yummy! These people know how to pair healthy together with delicious. Try the kale salad with chicken. The chicken cooks for hours. The cornbread is made uniquely as well and pairs nicely with their black bean soup. It's spicy. Enjoy
"I went to Bandera almost 3 years ago, but the experience is still very memorable.  The ambience was great, it was quite full in the evening and we had to wait at the bar to get a seating.  The music was fabulous.  We were a group of 5 and all of us enjoyed our time there."
"I hit this place by convenience, good feel and service was excellent for a small place.  I had the corn bread & prime rib sandwich.  Both were good and I would order those dishes again.  I ordered a Heineken lite beer so l cannot give review on drinks, but my eating companion ordered the ""Pimms Cup"" cocktail and she liked it.  My cousin had the ""Macho"" salad and loved it.  I would go again."
"The Only REason I give this restaurant a 4 star instead of 5 star is because my sister's entree wasn't a ""5-star"" dish... BUT OMFG~ you MUSt MUST MUST get the macho salad!!! Even if you're not on a diet... gET IT!!! it's probably the best salad you'll ever have. I was craving this salad for a whole WEEK cause it was just that good~!and the live jazz is pretty cool too get the MACHO SALAD !!! GET IT!!!"
"They severely overdress the salads and the menu does not have very many options.  However, the atmosphere is great (live jazz, old fashioned steak house vibe). I had the ribs and a side salad. The ribs were good, the salad was not."
Just meh.  Limited menu.
"Delicious roast chicken! Awesome cornbread. And when they have it, order the grilled artichokes. Draft beef selection  very poor."
Nice place for drinks. Don't forget to try their corn bread :) Live Jazz music some nights.
"The food and presentation was on point. The wait serve were very professional and courteous without being over the top/fake friendly! The prices were not outrageous and for what you're getting, very well worth it. The live music (Jazz Piano) was a very beautiful addition. The wine selection could be more robust. For the calibre of the presentation, valet parking should be offered to accompany the ""nice touch""- given that parking is impossible downtown Chicago. Make a reservation (we did) and still had to wait about 15 mins for our table- which isn't bad but heard others being told the wait time was 1.5-2hrs. Overall an excellent experience."
"Update to previews review : I emailed their corporate office and few days after I send my email I received phone call from manager ,she left me  voicemail that they would like to invite me again ,also she apologized  for the situation and informed me that they will send me out gift card.  I think it was very nice that corporate office react like this . I really like this place especially their  food , and I would hate to give up on them ..."
"Stopped in after shopping on Michigan Avenue. Ambiance nice. Food average. I ordered the chicken everyone raved about. Came with the green rice. Both good enough. No extras offered so I added the cornbread which was average. All in all, not bad, not good, just pretty average."
Love their burger and chicken. Great cocktails and solid wine list. They also have live jazz. Doesn't get better than that.
"Recommendations:-- Appetizers: Spinach & Artichoke Dip-- Entrees: Rotisserie Chicken, Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich-- Dessert: Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich Tips:-- Expect a 30-40 minute wait for dinner on weekends (make a reservation!!) -- Live jazz pianist! -- Lounge-type atmosphere, dimly lit, classy & upscale-- Bar seating is full menu and open seatingReview:I didn't realize this at first, but Bandera is one of the restaurants owned by the Hillstone Restaurant Group. Hillstone also owns and operates a couple of other nice restaurants I've been to around SoCal - R+D Restaurant, Gulfstream, and Houston's, as well as Rutherford Grill in Napa Valley. Bandera's menu was very similar, if not identical, to Rutherford Grill's menu, as I imagine most of their restaurants have somewhat similar menus. This was good for me because I absolutely loved the food at Rutherford Grill. Located in downtown Chicago, on the Saturday night before the annual Chicago Marathon, we knew we were going to have a hard time getting into dinner at ANY of the restaurants within the downtown Chicago radius. Bandera had the shortest wait (which was about 45 minutes), so we waited it out. By the time we were seated, we were all starving, so the food tasted even better. We started with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip, which was served with tortilla chips and was absolutely delicious! We ran out of chips pretty quickly, but luckily our waitress was attentive and brought us more right away. For the main course, my friend and I both ordered the Rotisserie Chicken, which came with Mexican rice, for $22. I thought the chicken was flavored perfectly and extremely delicious, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the Mexican rice, unfortunately. At Rutherford Grill, the chicken was served with mashed potatoes, which I thought worked a lot better. You will definitely have leftovers, so consider splitting the dish if you aren't that hungry. My other friend got the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich with fries for $20, and she said it was really good. She was also able to save half for later.We didn't have enough room for dessert at that point, but I would recommend the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich from when I had it at Rutherford Grill. They also have a large selection of drinks, wine and cocktails, and a bar area with a full menu that is first come/first serve seating, so you can try looking for a seat there instead of waiting for a table.  Overall, I'm a fan of the food and atmosphere at Bandera, but it is a little on the pricier side if you're on a budget. Appetizers are $8-13, and main dishes average out at about $17-22. Besides what we ordered, they also have salads, sandwiches, fish and salmon dishes, steak and BBQ ribs. The atmosphere is pretty classy and upscale, with a jazz pianist playing in the corner, and it is pretty dimly lit so it would be good place for an intimate evening or somewhere to just come with friends."
Fantastic atmosphere and view. The live jazz was amazing. The coffee was spectacular!
Excellent food and service! We had a lamb sandwich and a burger for main course and grilled artichoke and marinated olives for appetizer. Very delicious! We are definitely going back once we are back to Chicago!
Great romantic atmosphere (very dark inside with lit candles). Got a few different salads and they were fantastic. Service was polite.
"This place has very delicious prime rib French dip sandwich, so juicy, tender and flavorful. Their salads are also very good. If you have a sweet tooth,you cannot miss their Oreo sandwich I chocolate. Cornbread is also good.I love their live music too. I sat right by the jazz musicians a couple of times. What I love most is that they don't just ""play"" music, they sincerely enjoy it and you can so easily tell.But be cautious, you will be eating a ton of calories here (assuming cornbread as appetizer, French dip sandwich as main dish, and Oreo as dessert, I know, it's easy to get greedy...)"
"Yes...5 stars!My wife and I love eating at Banderas any chance we get.I fell in love with Banderas about 13 years ago when I used to work for the Banderas back home in Corona Del Mar...the menu hasnt changed a bit, and still has the same delightful wafts of BBQ notes mixed with a true warm & intimate dinning experience.Chicago Service was top notch. The food was even better.Order the house margarita, and you cant go wrong-promise!For entrées, the BBQ beef ribs are so good. Try the Macho salad. And of course if possible, try a grilled artichoke.Bon appetite ~"
"Good food, I had Macho Salad and it was delish. Corn bread is homemade and yummy. Service was very good. We sat at the bar because there was a long wait for a table. Live duo for music.. They were good too! I would go back!"
Being located on Michigan Ave. I expected more. It has dim lighting and a view of Michigan Ave. if you are located by the window. Live jazz entertainment was nice. TOURIST TRAP. The food was ok-at best. My friend ordered the roast beef au jus and I ordered the tri tip. Wouldn't go back.
"Wonderful evening! Our waiter, Michael, was very friendly, knowledgable, helpful, and had perfect timing. The food was excellent. We started with the skillet cornbread followed by tortilla soup with their famous rotisserie chicken. As an entree I had the filet mignon with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. Best steak ever. My only regret is we were too full for dessert. I recommend reservations, very easy to do online or via phone; we went on a Tuesday and it was busy."
Absolutely love this place!!!!!! Outstanding burger and great fresh meats and salads. Perfect location on Michigan ave in downtown!!!!! I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
"The service was a bit slow but the food was good.  We ordered the macho salad was excellent.  We also ordered the Dip Duo and Iron Skillet Cornbread.  The cornbread was really good.  The dip duo came with guacamole and something claiming to be queso.  It wasn't bad but it definitely was not queso.  Overall, it was a good experience."
I haven't been here for a few months but thought I'd add a review now. I remember loving the atmosphere but that the service was slow. I ordered the burger and I liked that it came on a bread roll rather than a bun. I devoured the entire thing along with the fries. Ah-Maz-Ing.
Only had the corn bread it was respectable but good. The corn bread comes with jalapeños which was different but didn't do enough to wow me. Staff was friendly
"This place was amazing, everything you expect out of a good restaurant is here. My wife and I ate here and we were very impressed by the courteousness of everyone from the greeter to the waiter. The food was amazing . My wife ordered the chicken sandwich which was awesome I ordered the veggie burger which was delicious. They had live jazz playing the whole time and we ate as we we looked through the window onto Michigan ave. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a decently priced restaurant with out of this world quality."
"Bandera was just OK-barely three stars.  The ambiance was the best part-lively with a piano player yet it's mostly booths that are reasonably private and still good for conversation.  The trip-tip was dry and dull but its accompanying cheese enchilada and salad were both above average.  The worst part is the service, which was rushed (entrees arrived mid-appetizer and they were clearly trying to turn the tables over quickly) and  robotic.  No pretense of hospitality here.  Might go back and give it another shot but in a city full of options probably not."
"Came in with pretty high expectations and they weren't met. Service was good, atmosphere was good, but the combination of the food and prices weren't that good.$11 for the duo tortilla chips. Two dips with about 12-15 tortilla chips. Really? I had the rotisserie chicken which was good, but I didn't feel like I got near enough food for what I paid. It came with mashed potatoes and that was it, perhaps another side would have done the trick?One saving grace was that my date had the Macho Salad which she said was amazing.The cocktails we had weren't very good, but they weren't awful either.Overall a place that was okay, but for this area there's no reason to go back to a place unless you loved everything about it."
"Bandera has good food at a decent price (considering the location, it is ALMOST too cheap.) I'll focus this review on the two OUTSTANDING characteristics of my experience. Overall, I have no complaints and everything was 'good' or 'great.' You should eat here.Here are my highlights.Bandera's service is excellent. No one does service as well as Hillstone Restaurant group. No one. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated like a millionaire at a high-end eatery. You will never have to wait for an item or look for the server. The staff know every food item, every preparation method and can help you decide among the menu items, if you'd like.They have live jazz music at night! LIVE! A real, human band! Not canned crappy muzak. I could not believe it. Nothing makes you feel more like a big shot than bringing a client to a place and getting sat next to a band. It's like the 1940s. Granted, I am a jazz lover, but I cannot imagine anyone not loving real, live music in Chicago. This alone is worth the price of the food and is so unusual that I will be returning again and again just for this single feature.Overall:food - great, simple American cuisine. perfectly executed.service - flawless! I could not have been happier.overall decor - very nice. Clean bathrooms, and fun lighting overall.perks - the live JAZZ BAND! and the view of Michigan Ave from certain tables.Will I return? Well, I'm sort of a regular already, this review was a memory of my first few experiences. So, yes."
"Ok the cornbread is for 2, but is was a bit dry. The meatloaf was really good. It has a lot o mushrooms, as it should for a mushroom meatloaf. But it isn't over the top."
"Delicious and great location. The Spinach Artichoke dip was a phenomenal start, the french dip I had was so good I am pretty sure I dreamt about it. My sister had the burger but it was more like two burgers, the portions were huge.The ambiance is perfect and the staff was all very helpful, professional, and friendly.  This is going to be a new must go for every visit to Chicago."
My wife and i went to Bandera for our anniversary.  The food and the ambiance was very nice. The best part was the Oreo Ice Cream!!!
Cornbread was really good. Also the chips and queso dip were good. I ordered the rotisserie chicken. It was horrible. It was partially uncooked and there was lots of visible blood. When I informed the waitress she said that since it was half a chicken sometimes there are blood lines that are left in. The manager then came to our table and also reiterated that I shouldn't worry because the chicken was safe to eat. They did not care that I didn't want to eat a half raw chicken. They did not take the chicken off the bill. Poor customer service.
"This restaurant has great ambiance, live jazz music, and fantastic service.  We started our meal with the skillet cornbread, this was a recommendation from a friend who had come before. This cornbread did not disappoint at all. The barbecued salmon is a must try, it's grilled to perfection and sprinkled with a honey glaze. My husband had the roasted chicken that was flavorful and juicy.  We topped off our meal with the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich that was delicious. This place is a must try."
"Stopped in for lunch, and the food was good. I had the Lamb Sandwich (without bun) and my lady had a Macho Salad, followed up with some tea.The lamb was okay tasting, but cold by the time it got to me. The Macho Salad was very good, wasn't over-dressed, and had a good balance between leafy things, meat, and dressing. The service was poor. Our waitress was nice when she was around, but didn't stop by to check on our food or refill our drinks at any time, so I had a single glass of water until I flagged down a busser for a refill. I think what REALLY got me the most mad about her was that my bill was $39 and change, I put down 3 $20 bills. Obviously I want the third $20 broken so I can tip! She brings back 2 $10s. Seriously? You think I'm tipping you over 20% for never being around and making me flag down a busser for water? You're out of your mind, lady. Luckily my lady had some $1s and she got a much more appropriate tip. Her response to the 2 $10s was, ""It's a good thing I've got some $1s, otherwise we'd have to wait for her to come back so she could break one of those.""The tea was good tasting, but of mediocre quality. Artificial ingredients, etc.I wanted to give this place a 2 -- the waitress annoyed me so much -- but my girl makes a good point: the food was worth a 3-star rating."
Make reservations if possible. Awesome views of michigan avenue.  The menu is simple but adequate. Jazz played nightly is a wonderful bonus and the band takes regular breaks which I find helps while conversing.
"I honestly come to Bandera whenever I am in Chicago! You really can't beat the nice ambiance, friendly and quality service, and delicious food! Coming from the south I appreciate some quality corn bread and I say order the cornbread (and french dip sandwich) and I promise you won't regret it. Tip: Totally worth the wait to get a table by the window!"
"Really solid place... Went on a Tuesday night and it was jam packed.  Had the daily special of roasted artichoke, which was meh.  But luckily that was the only downside.  From there, I had the wagyu tri tip with an enchalada and a purple cauliflower salad.  Was amazing.  I cleaned my plate... Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well.The Oreo dessert was great as well."
Great salads.  We enjoyed the roasted artichoke a lot. Lighting a little too dim for my taste.
"Kale salad is absolutely amazing... definitely a must as a starter OR main course. Our waitress, Lucy, was very helpful. Great atmosphere with live music. The bartenders pour a healthy bourbon. Make a reservation or sit at/stand around the bar while you wait for a table... worth the wait!!"
"Great food, great atmosphere. The smoked salmon is delicious. Live jazz music every night."
Best burger in Chicago. Period.
"On my first night back in Chicago for the first time in eight years my soon to be fiancée and I went to this place. I was hoping to take her out to a nice dinner so I ordered reservations and talked to the supervisor about getting a table. When we got there we were seated right between the live jazz band and the second story window looking out on the Michigan mile. The appetizers were phenomenal the entrées delicious the beer selection endless and all in all we were so satisfied that I was going to leave a 45% tip.  in the end their business was so eager to satisfy their customers that after being kind and eager to eat there,  they rewarded me with a complimentary meal and paid my entire tab for the night. Aside from that our service was fantastic and our waitress was eager to get us anything we wanted whenever we were ready I give this place five stars and I generally critique places with less than four stars at all times I am thoroughly impressed and eager to return there again soon. I suggest this place is highly as I possibly could and hope you enjoy your night as much as I did"
"I have passed by Bandera in the past and blown it off.  With its second story perch and bold block letter name beaming out toward Michigan Avenue, I figured it must be popular due to location alone, as it appeared to me to exude chain-like facade.  Boy was I wrong.  After receiving an enthusiastic Bandera-endorsement by my fellow passenger while stuck sitting on the tarmac in a hefty snowstorm at O'Hare, I made a note to give this place a try--especially in light of its proximity to my hotel.  The live jazz was outstanding.  Small, unobtrusive flat TVs at the bar allow catching the game of the night.  In between jazz sets, the likes of Ryan Adams and Ray Lamontagne pipe in through speakers.   It seems as though no detail or sensory aspect has been overlooked here.The seared tuna salad with mango and avocado presented mouthwatering ingredients at the peak of their freshness.  The greens were coated with just a bit too much dressing.  The a la carte enchilada with shredded chicken and spinach-- doused in two sauces-- understands that when contrasting flavors are this good, they must be included in the same dish.Every entrée I observed and every scent I smelled looked to be something I could and would enjoy.  The staff was courteous, and though bartenders often had to be flagged down, they were cheerful and accommodating when you could get their attention. Bandera provides another example of how sometimes all you need to do to find great restaurants in Chicago is to look right under (or above) your nose.  This is not necessarily elevated cuisine, but it is solid Latin-influenced fare.  A very nice surprise, and highly recommended."
"Since we were from out of town, we wanted to go to a place recommended on Michigan Ave to get a full experience of Chicago dining.  We were not disappointed with Bandera even though we picked it at the last moment on a Friday night.  From the awesome cucumber salad appetizer with cornbread appetizer to the much reviewed (deservedly) Macho salad and rotisserie chicken entrees, we were delighted at every turn.  Service was some of the best I've experienced - knowledgeable and timely without being stuffy.  Topping it off with a delicious bottle Reisling and the accompanying live jazz and it really couldn't have been better.  A great place for that nice dinner when visiting Chicago!!"
"As much as I love their food ,their customer service is horrible ! The bar, IMO, lacked personality in regards to service. Yes, they provided exactly what I requested in terms of food BUT usually when you opt to sit at a bar there is some interaction/conversation with the bartender, don't ask the guy any questions about the drinks, because he will does not know. At times it felt like I was disturbing there work flow.  I was a little taken back when the bar tender wanted me to leave a deposit, before I went to the bathroom. like I was really going to leave my coat on the chair, and swoop when is snowing. LOL. I do want to say that a lady names Kristal seemed to be the only one working, she was very nice, and gave me my appetizer. I was so impressed watching her work I tipped her, and gave her a flower. The rest of the staff needs some training.Thanks for LunchAnthony"
A great meal at the bar - order the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwiches!
Excellent atmosphere. Loved the live music. The veggie burger with kale salad was superb. Both were among the best I have ever eaten!!  Never thought kale could taste so good!  The quantity was great. Had dinner and lunch from my one order!  Tasted just as good the next day. Had to wait 30 min on a week night but worth it.
"Had dinner here recently and it was as good as I remembered from the last time I'd been.  We showed up with no reservation on July 3rd and expected a wait.  We were told 25 minutes but it was closer to 20 so things started off well.The cornbread is served in a small cast iron skillet and is excellent.  It's big enough to split between 3 or 4 people.  Definitely try it if you go.  I had the NY Strip, it was cooked a perfect medium and the mashed potatoes were very fresh, almost like they'd made a small batch just for me.  My dining companions both had the cheeseburger and it is huge...also well cooked and flavorful.  I've never had room for dessert here but the ones I've seen look very good.  I will continue to visit Bandera when I'm in Chicago."
Came for lunch due to ratings.  Spot on food was good and place busy.  Sat at bar to eliminate wait.  Had french dip and was outstanding.  Coke products in bottles - no free refills.  $17 for sit down lunch.
"Very good food and lovely atmosphere. I had the emerald kale and chicken salad and it was yummy! I was a bit hesitant to try but it was shredded kale with big pieces of chicken, cilantro, peanuts, and a very good peanut vinaigrette. Would definitely recommend!"
"I dare you to find one thing wrong with this beautiful restaurant! A recent Yelp search while I was in Chicago led me to an excellent evening at Bandera.This dark, cozy restaurant has live jazz and great bar service while you wait for your table. It's the perfect place for truly enjoying a night out.  Our server was on top of things the entire night and we were never rushed. The dip duo was  a great start and the reviews had us ordering 2 Macho salads, the chicken salad with peanut sauce, and a grilled salmon special. The signage is not street level so it was a little hard to find. The restaurant is on the second floor above retail shops."
"The very very best french dip and leg of lamb sandwiches are at Bandera.  First class.  Awesome.  I can't say enough!!!They also have a very interesting cocktail, the Paloma.  It is completely unexpected, and not what you think based on the menu description.The jazz is great during dinner.  Nice atmosphere and not too too loud."
"The bad review from John B. from Rochester NY below is not accurate. You can't take teenagers to this place, it's a romantic place for the adults to intimately dine and listen to jazz music!! It's disappointing that you took it out in your review!! TGI Fridays is down the street on Ontario...take the teenagers there next time!!Anyway, this place deserves the four stars I'm giving it. The rotisserie chicken is phenomenal. As is the french dip sandwich. As is the mac and cheese. As are, well, all things on the menu I usually eat at an upscale American restaurant.The service is great, even though you don't get the same server the entire time, the server you have will know who ordered what.Don't make the mistake John B. made by taking your kids or a group of teenagers here. This place is for neither."
"Delicious southwest comfort food accompanied by live jazz. The cornbread is served in a skillet and is perfect! The margaritas come strong with a salty rim. You won't leave hungry even though everything is ala carte. We loved the Caesar salad with a mustardy sauce and the chili was spicy and perfect for dipping the cornbread. I enjoyed the apricot marinated rotisserie chicken but it's a ton of food! Ahi tuna was refreshing as was the trout. Melt in your mouth. Service was pretty good but we were spoiled from amazing first class service the night before at coco pazzo. I recommend if you're in the mood for protein, spice, comfort food and love jazz"
"It is hard to find a place downtown to eat that is not either super expensive or super touristy, and that has good food. This place is a perfect balance. The food is comfort food but done really well. I had the rotisserie chicken. It was tender and juicy. The porkchop however that my table mate had made me a little jealous. It was more like a pork tenderloin than chop. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the corn bread looked amazing but was a little dry. Service was very friendly and prices reasonable."
"I come here for one thing and one thing only, the best burger in Chicago.Let me start by saying that this is one expensive burger but it is 100% worth it.The service is excellent, the atmosphere is amazing, and the burger is my favorite thing ever. It is classically served with french fries and doesn't include anything ridiculous. They just make a beautiful burger like true artists. The best tasting meat with fresh ingredients.p.s. they have great live music."
"Excellent food!  I had the black bean and brown rice veggie burger with the peanut slaw. Delish! Hubs had the prime rib. Also amazing. They had a small live jazz band- wonderful..and if that weren't enough, it is on the 2nd floor so we had a great view of Michigan Ave! My new favorite in Chicago! :)"
"We enjoyed our meals at this restaurant and the service was very prompt.  The only complaint I have is with the menu; it is not very descriptive.  We ordered the cornbread & focaccia appetizer....which sounds like two different things. It was cornbread.  Very good, but the description confused me.  My boyfriend ordered the Macho Salad (roasted chicken, avocado, dates, almonds, goat cheese) and he loved it.  However, they were many other things in the salad not listed in the description. So if you did not want something in there like tomatoes, you would not know to special order the salad.  I ordered the rotisserie lamb sandwich (roasted red peppers, arugula, and coleslaw).  I believe there was some sort of sauce on my sandwich, but I am not sure.  And the 'coleslaw' came on the side, but I believe I got the roasted peanut slaw that is mentioned in other items since mine clearly had nuts (an allergen) in it, but it was not mentioned.  Our food was very good and the lamb sandwich was amazing.  The lamb was very thinly sliced and juicy and the bread was soft and chewy.  If they can get their menu a little more accurate, I think this place would be great."
"Great food, and a nice vibe. Go with a date, or with a friend. The cornbread is awesome, be sure to try it."
"Incredible lamb sandwich. We went back twice this week just for that.But nothing else we tried compared. The ahi tuna was particularly disappointing. We really should have sent it back. But by the time two of us had tasted it, it was mostly gone.The Moscow Mule was also great."
"Brilliantly awesome. I had dinner at the bar and could not have been more impressed.I ordered the Cajun Trout and had the Banana Cream Pie. Both were insanely delicious and were served very promptly. Even though I was at the bar, the service was fantastic. The ambiance in the restaurant is lovely. Beautiful lighting and furnishings. There was no live music by the time I got there (they said it ended at 9:30), but that was fine by me.  A perfect night out."
"I travel to Chicago several times a year and made a reservation here during a trade show I was attending. I'd never visited this restaurant but it was close to where I was staying and reviews were good.  I was BLOWN AWAY by the customer service.  I've gone to many high end chop houses downtown and nothing compares. We made reservations at 8:30 and it was swamped due to all that were in town for the show, we sitting at the bar delayed about 25-30 minutes. The staff continually checked in apologized for the wait and then we were seated. I ordered a steak sandwich and the tortilla soup both were amazing! When my brother and I got to the end of the meal to pay, the waiter said no bill.....he said the manager wanted to cover our dinner because of the wait. We hadn't complained or even spoken to the manager but the fact that she noticed us in a crowded restaurant and went above and beyond to accommodate will have my return business every time I stop in Chicago. Service was so good we referred a colleague the next day. He did not make reservations and again the restaurant was swamped. He ended up having to wait over an hour for a table (without reservations it's to be expected). When he told the manager he was going to leave because the wait had been to long she asked him to give her 5 minutes. She apologized sincerely and asked him to please return again and handed him a 100 dollar gift card. Again BLOWN AWAY! You just don't see that kind of service these days. I will be a regular every time I'm in Chicago! Lovely restaurant great atmosphere excellent food!"
"I've stayed away from Bandera believing it to be a touristy, expensive restaurant on the Mag Mile.  However, I was definitely proven wrong with the delicious sandwich I consumed!  Came for lunch with some friends who love the burger here and were raving about all the food.  After looking over the menu, I decided on the rotisserie lamb sandwich.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats and I don't see it on menus often.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and was thinly sliced and piled high on buttery, toasted brioche bread.  Each half of the sandwich was topped with a thick slice of roasted red pepper and a handful of arugula.  There was a small cup of au jus to dip the sandwich in as well as Bandera's famous peanut coleslaw.  The coleslaw was fabulous.  Not your typical mayonnaise based cabbage slaw.  This is a bright and light slaw with peanuts and cilantro.  Again, I would highly recommend the sandwich and slaw.We ended the meal sharing the banana cream pie.  The ""pie"" came out more like a pile of graham cracker crust pieces, banana pudding and chunks of banana.  The ""cream"" tasted like a pudding mix and it was not the most aesthetically pleasing dish.  Overall, service was great and we did get a table over looking the Mag Mile, which was definitely a bonus as the rest of the restaurant is rather dark."
"Not nearly as good (food, service, ambiance) and the location in Corona Del Mar. The location in CDM is always consistent --- food and service -- so I was rather disappointed with this location. With so many amazing restaurants here in Chicago, I won't be returning to this one. I will get my salad and artichoke fix when I am back home!"
"I'm not usually a chain restaurant fan, but you'd never guess Bandera was one.  Amazing apps: skillet cornbread and tortilla chip duo.  Enchiladas and the burger are always awesome, but so are the salads.  Dessert: Oreo cookie sandwich!  This is a must whenever we're downtown."
I found this place last minute and never have I been more surprised! This place is a gem! I went on a Saturday night and the place wasn't too crowed. Live jazz band playing every night. And the food was really good for the price! Order dessert!
"Best hamburger ever!  Service is great! Live jazz music, great ambiance.  I highly recommend this place. Right on Michigan Ave.  Do some shopping, have a great meal, and shop some more!"
I love the SoCal bandera spots as well as pretty much all the hillstone joints out there.. But...The service here was just off. Stuff you would expect them to be better at too.. Like we got the artichoke starter and just as we dug in the entrées came out.. That type of thing happens at Applebee's not at a place like this. I got the wagu enchiladas and the beef was cold.. We also got the wrong check at the end of the night.. Our drinks sat empty..So disappointed in this place. I was a statue at the south Beverly grill and honor bar (hillstone joints) but I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. I'll just wait till I'm back in Cali.With all of the other great dining destinations in Chicago I would avoid this place and leave it to the tourists that don't know any better.. And this is coming from a guy that loves the bandera in Brentwood!!! Ugh..
"I would like to give this place 5 stars.  I really would.  But there is something rather demoralizing, really, about expecting a prime rib sandwich and instead opening your carry-out bag to discover a fish sandwich.  I'm not really sure how the mistake happened.  It was very noisy on the phone when I placed the order, but I think I stated rather clearly that I wanted a ""prime rib sandwich--the French Dip.""  I suppose I really should have checked the bag before I left to make sure it was what I wanted, but I hardly think the responsibility is mine.  Fortunately, I wasn't charged for the French Dip or I might have been really upset (it is about $4 more expensive).Still.  I was hungry.  I was already back at my hotel.  I was most decidedly *not* going all the way back to Bandera.  What can I say?  I ate the sandwich.  And I'll tell you what: If I *had* been planning on a fish sandwich, this one would be the one I would choose.  Very tasty.  It was not what I wanted but at least it was good.Meanwhile, the reason this is a 4 star review as opposed to a 3 star: the cucumber salad.  Seriously.  It's just sitting there in the corner of their menu all unassuming, like, ""Oh don't mind me, guys, I'm just here if you need me.  Whatevs.""  But holy side items, Batman!  This was the most delicious cucumber salad I have ever had.  Not just basic cucumber and onion in vinegar.  Oh no.  They throw in sweet corn and tomatoes and olives and gobs of creamy goat cheese and avocado and act like it's not going to change your life or something!  I would go back again just for that.  (Although next time, I will be sure to have them repeat my order back to me--I'm surprised they don't do that as standard protocol!)"
"This is an American food speciality place. To arrive and not have the cornbread would be a shame. The rotisserie pork with red cabbage is juicy and delicious. The chicken is its signature specialty. Food is terrific. Service is friendly and efficient. If does get real crowded so make reservations, and even with reservations there is likely to be a wait (!). Drinks are generous, atmosphere is a little dark. When live music plays it can be loud... But it's quality jazz and conversation although challenging us yet possible even close to the music. Recommend highly."
"Went here the other night when on the mile. Almost missed it since it is upstairs, but I was glad we found it. The environment is more upscale, no hats in the dining room, no sleeveless shirts for ladies, etc. but I was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans and it was fine...Now, the food was great. Cornbread was excellent for an appetizer, and the lamb sandwhich I had was great. The salad that came with it was fantastic, with a lot of fresh ingredients.The environment was semi-noisy with live jazz music, and the waiting staff was good. Overall a great experience."
"For a chain restaurant... this place is great!  Service, food and atmosphere... all get an A+ in my book.  I can't go to Bandera without ordering the grilled artichoke which is now a ""feature"".  Thier macho salad is my favorite thing on the menu.  The wine selection is also outstanding."
"On sat .they hav a live jazz ,if ur lookin for a place romantic ,casual and a beautiful view this is the  place , food is awesome !!"
"For the last five years this has been my go-to restaurant in Chicago.  I probably ate here once a week.  I probably should have written a 5-star review over the past five years, but I never did.Now, unfortunately, I am having to write a 3-star review because over the last six months or so our experience (and I usually go with the same person) has really slipped. In our minds, the place used to be perfect.  Every dish was so good, and the service was perfect.  When I used to tell other locals about it they would sometimes wrinkle their noses and say ""but it's a chain.""  Yes, yes, I'd say, just go.  And then they'd come back saying they loved it.So what's changed?  Atmosphere and service are the biggest changes.  Food ha also slipped a little, but not a lot.  Atmosphere: The music has gotten louder over the years.  I love the live band as long as I'm not too close and and I can still have a conversation.  All you had to do to make that happen was just not sit too close to the band.  Now, however, they are pumping the music through speakers around the restaurant and it is much more difficult to have a conversation.Also, the training for the waiters was extensive and the service was always 5-star.  I couldn't care less if we had a few bad nights over the past six months, but it's been worse than that.  Now I simply would rate their service 3.5 stars overall.The food is still good.  Years ago they had one of the best dishes in Chicago (the Poke Tuna), but they took it off the menu.  Even after taking it off the menu I would still rate the place 5-star, but now I would rate the food 3.75 star.  I have gone from a big smile over their food to a shoulder shrug.Bandera is always very crowded and noisy.  But I put up with that and called it five star based on the food and service.   The reason I am giving this a 3-star rating is because the items that have to be right to make up for the noise are no longer right, and the food has slipped.  And to top it all off they have turned up the volume on the band so that it is now very difficult to escape the noise.Bring the band volume way down and I'll change my rating to 4-star.  The problem is that I used to go here once a week at least.  Now I'm going once every 8-10 weeks.  If they fix the problems I've mentioned and I can see that for three visits in a row, then I'll write a new review.  But if I have a bad experience in my next visit then I probably won't return for another six months.  And then my next trip would be my last."
"Wow, what a great steak!  Start with the corn bread, sweet and savory.  We then ordered with one person ordering a strip steak, one ordered a cheese burger (he was in a burger mood he said), another ordered salmon and I had the prime rib.All enjoyed their meals and the burger, interestingly enough, was served quite uniquely, cut into 4 massive pieces.My prime rib was one of the best I've ever had.  Served on the bone and finished over a flame, it was well cooked and delicious.  We also indulged in deserts, ordering one of each, key lime pie, banana cream pie, and an Oreo cookie ice cream thing.  All were good but the key lime pie was outstanding.  I'd definitely order that again.Service was outstanding.  Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to be back in Chicago and go again!"
"Huge fan of sister property Hillstone in NYC- where there is always a wait, but well worth it. SO happy to be greeted by a friendly staff & seated immediately. Wine pairing was great with the food, and service was excellent. A Chicago gem."
"My fav place for lunch!  Be sure to get a window seat to watch the world go by on Michigan Avenue.  Queso appetizer, ahi tuna salad (which they now list as a main entree) and margarita on the rocks.   I get the same thing every time and I'm never disappointed!  The macho salad is also fab!"
"The cornbread lived up to our expectations after reading about it from other reviewers.  It was warm, just enough jalepenos.We had the BBQ salmon and prime rib - delicious.  The salmon was flaky and tasty.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and flavorful.Our server was attentive and very friendly.  After coming off a long flight, Bandera's knows how to treat its customers right."
Great place! Wonderful atmosphere and fabulous food. Second story so there's a nice view at night as well. Live band gives a nice ambience. Definitely get the cornbread skillet. Even their water is delicious. Enjoy! :)
Outstanding lunch at a reasonable price.  The lamb sandwich was kinda like a Mediterranean French Dip.  Packed high with thinly sliced lamb and sweet peppers...it is sure to please the heartiest of appetites.
"Band eras ChicagoI found this restaurant on the recommendation of a colleague when searching for someplace kinda special to celebrate a birthday dinner. This place was perfect. It was romantic, the atmosphere was great with a great live jazz music playing. In fact even the service seemed excellent for us. I found the cornbread to be over rated, but the chicken was not - mere perfection."
"Corn bread blows my mind. It is salty, sweet and spicy at the same time. I could call it a dinner after that.Their main dish does not disappoint me either. The pecan trout is one of the best fish dishes I have had in Chicago. Their macho salad is also delicious. It is quite an ingenious idea to put dates in there.Did I mention the live jazz and talk-friendly environment? It is one of those places that you can be loud yet no need to scream."
"We had dinner here on a busy weekend in Chicago. We ate at the bar. The food was really very good, and the serving was generous and appealing. The atmosphere is the nicest part of the experience. The music was lovely and not too loud. The staff was pleasant but not overbearing. The prices were reasonable. Overall, recommend."
"Been coming here off and on for years and the consistency in food, service and attention to detail has remained wonderful.We were a little apprehensive because we were sitting at the bar and realized the band would be almost next to us but they were a very pleasant surprise - added to the atmosphere and quite good!The cole slaw with peanuts has always been terrific and while they've tweaked the recipe it is still a favorite!  Yummy and maybe sort of healthy!  Roast chicken sandwich is delicious as are the fries and service was excellent.Go!"
"My three girlfriends and I went to Bandera a while back for lunch.  We were three, fresh-out-of-college girls, nothing fancy at all for this fancy establishment, but we were treated with so much kindness, respect, and attention you would think we were celebrities!Everyone from the host to the food runner, the manager, and our server greeted us with ""Hello, ladies....welcome"" and left us with warm farewells.  Service to me is so important having worked in this industry and they really set the bar high.The food is off the charts amazing.  I had the veggie burger (I took half home it was so rich and filling) and the queso dip appetizer I still dream about.  Very tasty and attentive place! My favorite restaurant in Chicago and, well, favorite restaurant ever.  Can't wait until I visit home and Bandera, again!"
"Bandera is not the usual kind of place I go to eat.  Typically I like places that are local, trendy, blah blah blah.  But Bandera is always an enjoyable place to go.  I have been to Houston's a few times, both in TX and when there was one in Chicago.  Bandera is pretty similar in terms of ambience, but perhaps their food leans a little more global in terms of flavors.I think they have an excellent house-made veggie burger, which is pretty much the same as Houston's.  I will say the burger is a bit expensive, especially since it's veggie, but it has a nice, smoky flavor from the wood fire and that's not common for a veggie burger.  I also love the sweet-salty flavor.  I have also tried several of their side dishes and they're all good.  I love the escabeche and the cole slaw especially.  The escabeche is a really flavorful mixture of a ton of veggies, including avocado.  There are so many that I can't really remember exactly what else is in there, but it's crunchy, creamy and fresh.  Yum.  The cole slaw is really crunchy with peanuts and the combination with the cilantro gives a slight nod to southeast Asia.  It is one of my favorite cole slaws ever.  My husband and I will sometimes go and split a main dish, such as the veggie burger or the butternut squash enchiladas (also delicious) and then order a couple of side dishes to share.  It's the perfect amount of food for when we're hungry, but not ravenous.Service is always very nice and professional here.  It's a good, comfortable place to bring a date, your parents, or friends who may not been into the whole trendy dining scene (that's what I have done, and they like it).  Some folks are not that adventurous with food, and the food here is not all that adventurous.  Yes, it's a chain.  And yes, it's kind of suburbany, vaguely global American food.  But it is good, so who cares?  My tastebuds sure don't.Seems like there's always a wait if you don't have a reservation, so book ahead if you don't like lines.  Otherwise you can always try your luck with bar seating."
"Stopped here for dinner while on biz --prompted by the strong Yelp reviews. Place was buzzing so I chose a place at the bar. Bartender courteous and helped me choose between salmon and trout.Ordered Scottish salmon with mashed taters and spinach. Greenline draft beer. Plate of corn bread for appetizer. With tip amount was $54. Meal was served quickly.Salmon was very fresh and prepared perfectly, sauteed spinach still had a nice texture --wasn't cooked until mush. Potatoes were perfect companion to salmon. Very good meal ---worth the price paid. Good service."
"Normally I would give this place five stars, but lately they have fallen off the ball. I don't know if there's been a change in management or kitchen staff, but something is amiss. My latest visit has to have been the worst thus far. I've been coming to this place pretty regularly for a couple years. Obviously the menu is going to change. The removal of the Tuna Poke app was a sad day. But I digress. When we arrived I wasn't expecting a wait but they said 5-10 minutes which wasn't bad. However the table we sat at was set and ready from the time we walked in the door and until the time we were seated. I'm not entirely sure what the wait was for. My party ordered two prime rib sandwiches which I would normally recommend. Today it was by far off the mark. The prime rib was overcooked and when it arrived the meat was cold but the bread was hot. Something I didn't mind, but it was clearly medium well. One of the other persons in my party had to send theirs back as it was cold and overcooked as well. When it came back out, it seemed as if they just heated up the prime rib in lieu of a fresh sandwich. Mind you this was 2:30 on a Thursday. It was not busy nor was the place packed. In my opinion there's no reason the sandwiches should have been overcooked and cold. I'm not sure if this is a timing error on the kitchen staff or an error with the expediter. Another note is that the ""special"" soup while its good, doesn't change ever. The server was the best part of the experience as she made sure to make sure we were accommodated and apologized profusely for the errors. This place used to be great, but now it simply seems like an overpriced Michigan Ave restaurant for out of towners. I was severely disappointed from entry to exit. I hope things change, but I'm not sure if I can go back."
"My girlfriend and I both agreed we will return to Bandera some day.  We enjoyed everything about this place: the service, the ambiance, the drinks, the food, live jazz music, and the wonderful view of Michigan Ave.For our appetizer we tried their famous corn bread which was out of this world.  I highly recommend that.  I can't remember what signature drinks we tried, but they were both unique and delicious.  For entrees, the lady ordered salmon, and I had the prime rib french dip.  The french dip is a solid choice as far as filling and taste -  I loved it.Besides the food and drink, we both appreciated the jazz trio and the variety of tunes they sampled.  Hearing the Beatles, NIrvana, and Rihanna featured as instrumental jazz music is not something you will hear/see every day.  Also, try to go to Bandera during the winter as you will be able to overlook Michigan Avenue when it's all lit up with Christmas lights."
"I didn't have any expectations going into my spontaneous lunch at Bandera, but if I had, they wouldn't have been met.Before we were even seated, I noticed a stench wafting through the restaurant...not a seafood stench (which to me is the only acceptable kind for a restaurant) but a ""I forgot to put deodorant on this morning"" x40, and it was overpowering until we got to our window table. In terms of the food, the cornbread was ok, great consistency but too sweet for my liking. I saw peppers in the bread but didn't taste them whatsoever. I ordered the grilled fish sandwich, which looked delicious but was lacking in flavor. The fries that accompanied the sandwich were thin but not crispy - two traits that do not go well together. The service was fine; our waitress was fairly tight-lipped but got the job done. All in all, I'd come here for a spontaneous work-day lunch again but probably wouldn't recommend it."
"This place is so wonderful.  They are owned by Hillstone - the same people who owned Houston's restaurants.  We figured this out when we tried the Spinach dip at Bandera.... it was so close to what we loved at their other restaurants that we had to ask.  The dip is creamy and wonderful - so are the chips it comes with.  We shared a Prime Rib French Dip - well, hubs ate most of it and I go about 3 bites.  The shaved prime rib, perfectly cooked to Med-rare, was melt in your mouth good and the jus that it came with was so flavorful.  The sandwich is huge."
"I have to preface this by saying, I never ate here.  I had drinks at the bar.  The drinks were good, but I saw something that was a bit concerning for a cleanliness aspect.  While I was sitting at the bar a waitress brought back a glass of wine that a customer sent back because it had something floating in it.  The bartender at Bandera's response?  She scooped out the foreign object and dumped the old wine in a new glass so it would look like they had replaced her wine.  Seeing this made me gag and we left.  I was sad because I really wanted to actually dine here!"
"This restaurant is a great place to come on a cozy date or with a small group of friends. We came here a while ago with my friend and her boyfriend. The live jazz music is one of the best parts. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. The menu has something for everyone. I wasn't that creative and got a steak. It came just the way I like it. The drinks aren't bad to sip on either! The restaurant looks over Michigan Ave., and in comparison to most of the restaurants in this area, they really aren't that expensive. I think you get your money's worth! I would definitely come back (and really should) just to experience a tasty dinner with live jazz music all over again!"
Since there is not a Houston's here this is as close as it gets. I always get rotisserie chicken and the spicy cheese dip.
I had a great experience here. The tortilla chip and dip appetizer was addictive and I ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad without the chicken as I am vegetarian and I loved it! It had a great peanut lime dressing on it and I'm sure it's also great with the chicken it comes with. I highly recommend this salad! I also liked the fun ambiance of the place and would love to visit Bandera again.
"Great atmosphere with live jazz, friendly staff and low lighting with a nice view. I have only been here once but I made reservation and befire the drinks we ordered at the bar were ready, the host had a table waiting for us. They immediately offered to transfer our drinks to our table. The artichoke dip was so good and a great starter for two. I had the Macho Salad which was more than enough food. I always get salads when I go out to eat and I am a big fan of Cobb salads because they are very flavorful. This was one of my top salads that I've tried. The Macho Salad had hints of sweetness to it which was a nice surprise.My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it was perfect. Our whole experience was great. We wanted to treat ourselves to a nice restaurant and splurge a bit. Surprisingly our meal  didn't break the bank and the portions were just right. I would recommend this place for a couple that wants to go out for romantic night out or a special occasion."
"Service? Fine. Food? Great. I had the Lamb Sandwich and Kale Salad and it tasted amazing...BUT by about 4am it became apparent that I had gotten food poisoning, and it absolutely had to be from their food. Spent 24 hours miserable, weak, shitting my brains out and wishing i was dead.Thanks, Bandera.I will never eat here again and would never recommend it to anyone.I am not normally the type of person to write a bad review about a business, so this review should be taken pretty seriously (please note there is another review below that also sites food poisoning from this place!)"
"Delicious food, big portions, and nice service.  Upscale when it comes to classiness and price, but not too pretentious.  Seating is spread out enough that you can have a nice, private conversation without feeling like you're on top of another table... so it's a nice place to bring clients."
"Four stars because they stopped taking reservations for lunch (won't even do 11:45am anymore!!) so I've had to stop sending our Executive team here for business lunches. Really a shame...however...Massive fan of the food here!BEST smoked salmon appetizer ever! Cannot recommend it highly enough. As others have stated, the salads and the cornbread are also delicious and atmosphere is also very nice."
PRO's - The food is GREAT! They have NEVER made me a dish i didnt love.CON's - long wait. Also have to BEG them to let me send an intern for PU. Oh Bandera thank you SOOO much for the opportunity to carry out food. COME ON SELL ME FOOD HA.
"I've had many meals at Bandera, although not recently. Both lunches and dinners -- every one was excellent.Inside, there's a full rotisserie right by the entrance (sure whets the appetite) and a full bar. I used to love going to the bar with coworkers for drinks after work before we settled down in the dining area for dinner.Bandera has a nice, comfortable dining area whose best feature (if your group is lucky) is a bird's-eye view of Michigan Avenue. When meeting for a lunch at Bandera on a weekday afternoon, nothing beats sitting at a table overlooking the Magnificent Mile.I'm definitely biased because Bandera is one of the highlights of the Chicago era of my life, but it's still a great place for a lunch or dinner. Enjoy!"
I really loved this restaurant. YOU must order the Bandera Salad with the dates and goat cheese. I have tried to replicate this for my family I loved it so much. It's very close to the Marriott across the street and access to great shopping. The live music was such a plus and the ambiance is wonderful. A bit pricy but I think worth it for the quality.
"The Macho Salad is among my favorite salads, anywhere. Great atmosphere, somewhere between Work Week Casual and Saturday Night Special."
"I took my date here after the wait at The Purple Pig was just too long. They said an hour to an hour and fifteen minute's wait, which was quite reasonable in comparison. It should be noted that the wait ended up being only a half an hour or so, and this was at around 6:45-7 on a Saturday night. If you want to take your date here, the mood is phenomenal. Live, upbeat jazz combo of piano, bass, and light drums are great for the atmosphere. Each table is candlelit, and that's pretty much the only significant light source near most tables, besides a few very soft wall mounted light fixtures. There is a lot of wood and dark leather, which furthers the cozy, romantic feel, but it's definitely a loud enough place that it won't feel overbearing to your date, but will still have that ""hey, this is a nice place"" feel. Oh, and if it matters, no tablecloths. Dress is pretty much anything goes, but to really match the restaurant, look good. Jackets are not needed, and might be a little too dressy; jeans can be worn with a classy top. I'd recommend no shorts or sandals in warmer months, too.Now, food. My date ordered the rotisserie chicken, and I the salmon (I don't remember the specific menu names, but it's a fairly small menu, so you can figure that out on your own). The food was FANTASTIC. Full of flavor, but not crazy, and large enough portions that won't have you leaving feeling unsatisfied. I haven't tried the rest of the menu yet, but I assume it's just as spectacular. The wait staff and hostesses were very accommodating and friendly, which always helps. My only complaint is the pricing, but a place like this on the Magnificent Mile, I wasn't exactly expecting a cheap meal, anyways. Still, if you come here, bring more than two $20 bills. Oh, and they don't take Discover cards, so there's that, too. I'll be back though. Hopefully sooner rather than later."
"I made reservations for my husband and I on yesterday night. We loved how intimate and sexy the restaurant felt. Our server, Chelsea, was so great. She was very friendly and she knew the menu very well, making suggestions on what to order which was right on point. We started off with drinks, I think I had the Pimm's cup and my husband had a glass of red wine. Then we had the guacamole/queso with chips....DELISH!! I think I could've ate the guacamole by itself! I ordered the apricot glazed chicken with mashed potatoes which was ridiculously tender, moist, and flavorful. My husband ordered the bbq salmon which really isn't bbq but was also incredibly moist and flavorful. For dessert we had the tres leche cake with fruit....YUM... because we mentioned it was our first time there, she comped us for the dessert. Overall, the staff was friendly, very attentive, and the food/drinks came out really fast."
"Been here twice now (once way back before I was on Yelp) and this time it was probably even better than the first. The wife and I got the roasted artichoke (so delicious as an appetizer, and their dip was just great), wagyu tritip, and the enchilada special.Seriously, get the macho salad. It's really full of macho good. The enchilada special was quite good too, but I'd pass on the waygu tritip dish if it comes around again. Just was not as tender and flavorful as I thought it would be.It was overall a really good anniversary experience though. They frequently have live jazz there, and did not disappoint us with their selection of Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock selections."
Came here on a Monday with my new boss. Great atmosphere: think jazz and wine. The salmon was good. Old fashion was superb. That's a cocktail I wouldn't mind paying 11 bucks for but it was the first interaction i had with my boss so i was preoccupied.
"Loved Bandera. Beautiful place, very nice staff, great food. I loved the prime rib french dip and peanut coleslaw. And I like that they leave water on the table for you to pour when you want it. Would definitely return"
Great service and the food came out very quick.Rotisserie Chicken - I replaced the rice with a slice of skillet cornbread. The chicken was very juicy and the sauce is pretty tasty. The cornbread was ehh just ok.. I was expecting a lot more. Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches - very delicious and highly recommend it. I just need a cup of milk and it would have been perfect.
this restaurant gets a star for the service and a star for the location. the food was very disappointing. yuck!
"""You up for Bandera before the storm hits tomorrow?""""Heck yeah"" I said as I grabbed my coat.  Instead of staying inside the pedway, we were going to dine out.  Score.I ordered the macho salad, which really hit the target.  The chicken throughly impressed me, though it's hard to say what exactly about the chicken factored into the positive rating.  It was just that good--something just clicked.  The cornbread croutons in my salad were delicious with their rich, slightly crispy, and grainy flavor; the lettuce was fresh and cleanly chopped.  The corn, nuts, and avocado were all of high quality.  I do wish there were more dates, as I think I had one in the entire, quite humongous, salad.Our waitress was incredibly attentive but not overly in-your-face.  Two things I was disappointed by was the lack of free bread at the beginning of the meal, and the lack of drink choices.  Starbucks, you can add another $3 to your income statement as I come for my daily latte."
"Several visits so far, always consistently great.  This is a very nice mid-upscale place to grab a meal if you're on Michigan Ave, and don't have too much time to spend, but still want quality sandwiches.  You must order the cornbread in the pan.  MUST.  Got my standby French Dip because they were out of the Lamb sandwich.  Excellently satisfying and delicious, perfectly pink.  Everyone else loved their dishes too.Would definitely return, and bring visitors if we're touring the Mag Mile (for the 1000th time)."
"The food is moist and gourmet. Pricy and worth it. I was unique and ordered the cheeseburger, it was fantastic, one of the most satisfying, flavorful meals of my existence. I also enjoyed the queso dip, spicy and thick. Very well done. I would also recommend the ""Oreo Icecream Sandwich"", it was creamy and the oreos were very pronounced."
"Delicious cheeseburger! Rainbow chard was good, but a little too oily for my liking. Fries that came with the burger were average. Service was good and prompt. Atmosphere was a little dark and noisy (not in a bad way...it is what it is)."
"The restaurant is kinda hidden (like most on Michigan avenue) - on the second floor of a building (you kinda have to navigate yourself).The decor is really nice - we were seated by the window so we had a nice view of MI avenue.Food was presented nicely - not lifechanging, but good.Our waitress was somewhat attentive but not very friendly...she looked like she didn't want to serve us.It's a bit overpriced for what you're getting."
We are visiting from Indy. We were looking for a light lunch. Saw the great reviews and decided to try. My wife had the Macho salad and really enjoyed. I had the kale and roast chicken salad. Even better than the Macho salad. Superior service. We will come back.
"Solid menu, but not incredibly unique or amazing."
"I've been here a couple times.  Great experiences both times, but the one thing I would advise would be to ask for a table away from the piano!  The jazz pianist is great, but definitely loud if you're right next to him.  If you can get a window view, even better.  It's a cool spot overlooking Michigan avenue.  I had the roast chicken, which was very tasty and excellent, and the French Dip, which was definitely one of the better French Dips I've had.  Food and service good, this was a solid spot.  You'll definitely want a reservation though, and for the vision-impaired, the lighting is kind of dim."
"Get the macho salad. It is the best salad I have ever had, and I want another right now. Three out of the four of us ordered the macho salad, and the one who didn't wishes she had. We ate in silence - that's how good it was. The fourth diner in our party ordered the beef au jus sandwich and it had a bit too much fat on the meat. The fries were just ok - I wish Bandera would do something fabulous with those. I repeat: get the macho salad. It is perfect."
My late lunch here was a very enjoyable experience. The decor is very nice and when I was eating I was seated at the windows and could watch Michigan Avenue. I got the lamb sandwich and a glass of iced tea. The salad that came with the sandwich had cilantro and they substituted a house salad. The lamb sandwich was very good.  Just when I was looking to get a refill on my Ice-T the waiter showed up with a fresh glass of ice tea. The sandwich with salad was $17 not bad for Michigan ave.
"The food is delicious and the service is professional. Agree with previous that I usually stay off of Michigan Ave. tourist spots... But love the atmosphere and live jazz music here too. Would give 5 stars except... service is a bit rushed. I know they are busy, but it feels like they rush you the check and are pacing for you to leave. And trust me we were not trying to sit, linger, and hold on to the table. I get it. But just wanted to drink a glass of water and let the food and wine settle. (They never refilled the water while we ate.)And lastly, PLEASE BRING BACK THE CRAB CAKES!!! They were wonderful! Other friends miss them too! That would get me back to 5 stars. Thanks!"
"I went to Bandera last weekend. Loved the decor. My salmon was just perfect. The champagne glasses were dirty... which was kind of gross, but the server brought new ones and re-poured our drinks. He apologized and even brought over a free desert after dinner. I liked the place. I see myself going back."
"The Hillstone Restaurant Group offers Bandera as their Chicago-offering of their chain in disguise. I came to Bandera for a business lunch which actually makes the chain in disguise concept somewhat appealing. Solid food options with decent variety that will please many palates. I'm a fan of this restaurant group for serving up one of the best house made veggie burgers at anything that resembles a chain. Although it suffers from the common affliction of many veggie burgers in that it falls apart, it's a a tasty combination of rice, beans, beets, and other goodness that will please even meat eaters. Bandera offers theirs alongside a serving of their tasty roasted peanut slaw. This is not a place you go to get a value but there's a price you pay for familiarity especially when it's hidden behind a different name."
"i found this place on the Yelp app this last weekend while visiting Chicago.  About a 6 minute ride from Hilton Palmer House.  It's located north of the river and just to give you a tip, the entry looks like you will be going to Men's Warehouse.  Just go in the door and go up to the 2nd level.  Nice atmosphere - we had reservations for 8:30 on a Thursday evening and we were seated upon arriving.  We were very happy because we were taken to a table overlooking Michigan Ave. and right in front of the Jazz trio that were playing that evening.  Two of us split an appetizer and a large salad and it was perfect!  The dip duo with chips - came with plenty of tortilla chips and two nice dips $8.00.  The Macho salad was excellent - very generous portion, perfect for two hungry girls - came with roasted chicken, avocado, dates, almonds, goat cheese, corn, purple onion, and a balsamic dressing $17  We both really liked the salad!"
"My husband and I had dinner here on the 4th of July. Our original dinner plans fell through so we had to find a restaurant that was close to our hotel, had good reviews and was actually open. We decided on Bandera and I'm so glad we did...in fact, I'm glad our original plans fell through.There was an hour long wait, which wasn't surprising as it was a holiday and the restaurant is right on Michigan Avenue. We sipped ice water and looked over the menu which is pretty small...it all easily fits on a single sheet of paper. I made the comment ""With such a small menu I would expect that they've perfected these recipes and the food is really good."" We were seated in a surprisingly comfortable booth and Trey, our server, greeted us right away. We knew what we wanted immediately...we HAD been looking at the menu for an hour. We skipped appetizers, though they were tempting, and went right for entrees (hoping to have room for dessert). I ordered the butternut and white cheddar enchilada with roasted corn on the cob and green rice. My husband ordered the barbecue beef back ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted corn on the cob.The food came out rather quickly and looked and smelled wonderful. The roasted corn on the cob was perfectly charred and lightly coated with a mildly spiced butter...it was excellent.  The green rice was delicious; perfectly prepared, light, fluffy and flavorful. Far too often rice ordered from a restaurant is dried out and tasteless but this rice was seriously good.  My enchilada was really, really flavorful. There was a bit of heat to it that required several extra sips of iced tea, but they were delicious. My husband told me his food was excellent and how glad he was we ended up eating there. We both easily finished our food as the portions were just right and we eagerly ordered their house-made Oreo ice cream sandwiches for dessert. It was amazingly good....order it!Trey was attentive and thoughtful and helped make our dinner that much better. Yes, the restaurant attracts tourists due to the location, but so do dozens of other restaurants. The most important thing is that the food and the service at Bandera are both wonderful and we would absolutely eat there again....as a first choice!"
Service and atmosphere was amazing..what am i saying? EVERYTHING was amazing!!. The food was fresh and delicious. I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich. with a caesar salad on the side. Fantastic...love the home made cornbread croutons. The home made oreo ice cream sandwiches are mouth watering.
Their guacamole is absolutely excellent.
"I have friends who absolutely love Bandera. I mean love. So, I'm often forced to go once a year. Although, I've never had a bad experience, the food overall never wow'd me. I can appreciate the lamb sandwich and a glass of Merlot. Other than that, the menu isn't intriguing, inspiring or adventurous enough for me to go back on my own.In short, everything is not for everybody."
"Live music? CheckGreat atmosphere? CheckGood drinks?  CheckDamn Good Burgers?  Cha-Ching!So not Chicago, but essential for Michigan Avenue.  It somehow fits in.  See Coleen C.'s review for the best description:yelp.com/user_details_re…Cheers!"
"I love that Bandera offers consistent quality food all over the country!  This is definitely one of my favorite Hillstone establishments.After a long weekend of business dinners and lots of heavy food, all I wanted for my last meal in Chicago was a salad.  Fortunately, my hotel was right next to Bandera and I was able to end my gastronomic tour of Chicago with a tried and true favorite -- THE MACHO SALAD. Yum!"
"Great food, excellent service. I went with my wife and 4 teenagers and amazingly everyone was pleased."
"We recently enjoyed this restaurant on a Chicago trip with family. Although the service and food were very good, the decor was dark and woodsy, which may turn some people off in the summer. We really enjoyed a wide range of meals, from my BBQ beef ribs, to my wife's macho salad, and other family members' vegetarian burgers. In fact, I tried the veggie burger, and it was the best I've ever had! Unlike most, it was not only flavorful, but also moist and tender inside! In short, Bandera is not extra-ordinary, but certainly makes for a satisfying and reliable dining experience in the Windy city!"
I frequently visit Bandera and usually order the Kale and Roasted Chicken salad with extra peanut vinaigrette on the side.  I visit the restaurant today and the not so nice bar tender tells me I couldn't get the dressing on the side and she would bring me another dressing instead.  I asked for the manager and bar tender made sure she informed him not to bring me the extra dressing.  The manager did just that; he had his mind already made up when he approached me!  Inconsistent customer service. Awaiting to hear back from Hillary for resolution.
"I had the occasion to go to Bandera by myself for dinner on a Friday night.Thankfully, not as lonely or sad as it sounds.I ate at the bar, had a couple martini's, and enjoyed some delicious winter squash enchiladas. The bartender was friendly the food was very good and I enjoyed myself. Only downside it was around 8:30p.m. and they were out of many menu choices including banana cream pie. I was going to take the pie to go but I was left to forage for dessert elsewhere (see my consequent review of ENO).P.S. was totally unaware that Bandera is a chain restaurant."
"This is my FAVORITE place to take friends and family when they are visiting Chicago.  Hidden out of the way but still on Michigan Avenue, LIVE JAZZ, great food and waitstaff- always a winner!I just celebrated my 43rd Birthday here with a very good friend and the experience was amazing!  Started with a classic dirty martini at the bar- made just right!  Onto dinner with a glass of Pinot and chips/cheese plate-YUM!  I had my absolute staple: roasted chicken.  My friend ordered it as well and loved it....  the waitress convinced us to try a slice of their new cheesecake it it was to DIE FOR!   So nice to leave with a full stomach and full heart.  Thanks again Bandera!!!!!"
"Came here on a whim during a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I'l be returning again! I was a little unsure at first approach since there's a sign on the door stating that proper attire is required. Mind you, I'm not gonna roll up to a classy joint looking like I just got tossed out of the blender, but you know, I'm a casual dresser (jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, occasional baseball hat) and there was a line in the dress code alerting me that ""hats must be removed in the dining room."" Yeah, I'm wearing a hat.Not a problem, I'll belly up to the bar. I ordered their signature Manhattan - well actually I ordered the Old Fashioned, but got the signature Manhattan instead. It's ok, because it was a fantastic cocktail and has a unique twist that /I will leave up to you to discover. I also have to give a shout out to the Kitchen in the round -- No clowning/yelling/crazy kitchen shenanigans to be had - just professional food prep/creation.After savoring the cocktail, I inquired with the bartender about the rotisserie chicken, which I've heard nothing but rave reviews about and then asked about the rotisserie lamb sandwich (yes, you read right). The bartender put things in perspective for me, which I find incredibly helpful when at a new place and explained that, while both are very good, the lamb sammie is going to be more of a signature offering. SOLD!The sandwich came out just as the attentive bartender  was bringing me a Bell's Oberon. First off, the lamb was thin-sliced and was accompanied with a cup of au jus (I love au jus). On the sandwich was roasted red peppers and arugula as well as a some kind of possibly horseradish mayo. I took one half, dipped the end in the au jus and enjoyed what was to be the first of many tasty bites. The lamb wasn't the least bit gamy, nor was it chewy. The au jus just enhanced the flavor of the meat and softened the bread so it all just melted in your mouth. There was also an accompaniment of Bandera's legendary peanut/sprout/cilantro slaw.Needless to say, I had one of the finest meals to be had in a while. I wish the price wasn't quite as steep as it was, but hey, it's the Mag Mile, so what do you expect? Definitely a great place to treat yourself or a friend/special someone."
"Bandera's is a classy restaurant with food and drinks to match the ambient settings. What I like about its location is that it's right up my neighborhood. It provides garage parking and is good for groups and I was there with my office colleagues on a Friday evening and had a great night. What's more, vegetarians can join in the fun because they serve one hell of a veggie burger.Some ordered the chicken salad with cornbread while others had the macho salad and one had the veggie burger. We were all in agreement that the food was tasty and well prepared. You could sense the attention paid in its preparation and the quality was up there with the rest. The wide selection of drinks to choose from complemented our meals and the staff were warm and accommodating, considering every minute detail and request that we had. The live jazz music topped it up well and we'll definitely go back soon"
"We thought it might be a tourist trap but this place is the real deal. Had the house salad which had an amazing dressing. Lamb sandwich (skipped the bread) and for dessert, had the banana cream pie...definitely will add it as a must for visiting Friends and family..."
"Excellent! Sit at the bar to avoid the long wait. Bar is first come first seat. We ordered the pork chops, salmon, and rice. Everything was delicious. The pork chops was so tender and the salmon melted in our mouths. Can't wait to try the Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert!"
"The food is 3 1/2 stars but the service and atmosphere are 1 at best. They just really need to make up their mind about what kind of restaurant they want to be. White table cloths but they put a sheet of paper over them, too fancy to push two tables together for a large party, but when you order a coke you get a warm unopened can and a glass of ice. Is this a burger joint or a sit down restaurant? I don't think they even know."
"We sat by the window and had a great view.  Started with the artichoke and spinach dip and the cornbread.  Both were delightful.   There were four at the table and we each had a different entrée. We had the meatloaf, pork filet, salmon and the barbecue ribs.  All were fantastic.  Our waiter was Jim and he did a fabulous job.  We were very pleased with the entire evening."
"I've been pondering this review and even discussed this restaurant with friends of ours.  I felt a lot of pressure from the reviews my other Yelp friends have written to give it a four.  But I am not a fan.  Maybe if I came back and heard the jazz and ordered differently?Tip before you go:  Definitely have a reservation and when you call to make it, get the name of the nearby parking garage where you get discounted rates.  We did both of these and it made for a stress free night.  The restaurant itself is very sleek and beautiful.  The bathrooms are a delight.  Our server was perky and good.  The lighting and conversation level were perfect.After that is where my conflicted feelings came in.  It's named Bandera, Spanish for flag and it's listed as traditional American.  They have chickens on spits when you come in but are sortof a steak house?  With Mexican type sauces on things, sushi grade tuna with avocado and tortilla chips as the appetizer?  The menu is so small, how can it be so unclear what type of restaurant this is?The tuna poke appetizer would have been better without the avocado, make it more of a straight up ceviche.  But it was tasty enough.  My lamb was good, a more than generous portion that I had requested with the sauce on the side.  I tasted the sauce and it was just plain awful, so glad I had it on the side.  The cucumber salad was a jumble of flavors that just didn't match the dish at all and I hate it when hot food and cold food are all on the same plate.   When the food is plated usually  one temperature will suffer and sure enough the potatoes were good but lukewarm at best.  We split the cold asparagus which was delicious.They have two dessert options and we chose the banana cream pie which was bland except where they heavily sprinkled the cocoa powder, that gave it a bitter flavor.  Added to the soggy crust, I was very disappointed.  Should have tried the Oreo dessert.We entered full of anticipation and left vaguely let down.  Darn it, I had thought it would be a favorite."
"Nice place.  Fancy and expensive, but it's Chicago."
"My wife and I came here before a play at the Lookingglass the other night, it was close by, had good reviews and featured two of my favorite foods - Prime Rib and Banana Cream pie.  Maybe that's the problem with favorites, you remember how great they are at other places.  They weren't great here and who do you mess up such classics?  The place was nice looking and the young waitress was very eager to please. Maybe if she had done the cooking?Not sure what I am missing but I won't be back. Too much money for average. I can get average for a lot cheaper at a chain.  Damn, now I still want some good Prime Rib and Banana Cream pie."
"Really very good. In town for convention downtown and made reservations. Had a bit of a wait but it was worth it. Really tasty for all of us, service was very nice and pretty quick. Full bar and a jazz trio playing live music. Spent $155 for three with cocktails and tip. Would definitely go back."
"A very cool spot to eat and watch the foot traffic on Michigan Avenue. Long wait to get a window view, but worth it. Definitely get the cornbread."
"I took daughter and two of our friends for her 10th birthday to Bandera with our two friends. We specifically went there to get my daughter's favorite food, baby back ribs.  Unfortunately, they ran out of ribs as we sat down.  It was a major disappointment being that ribs were the impetus for dining at Banderas for her birthday.  Not only did our server handle it with such grace but then the maitre de /house manager followed up with a heartfelt apology and accommodated us by offering a special order not on the menu.  They were so accommodating and kind which I do not experience as often in the chicago restaurant scene to begin with.    It turned into one of the most special nights for us all due to how lovely they were.  Additionally, they sat us right by the jazz band where we got to enjoy a personal performance of Happy Birthday for my daughter.  The ambience and warmth of the environment mixed with the awesome jazz music and amazing attentive staff made this stand apart from so many restaurants on or near Michigan avenue.  My disappointment over the ribs turned into a magical, enjoyable evening.  They topped it off with a sweet birthday card on top of the complementary meal.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and will be returning there for the ribs soon."
"Went for the dessert ...banana cream pie and homemade oreo ice cream sandwiches. At $8 a piece, I question their value, but you are on the Mag Mile.I was not such a fan, but my partner LOVED the banana cream pie dessert. The crust was good, but I thought the rest was average.I enjoyed the oreo ice cream sandwich. If you are a chocolate lover, this is the way to go. Two huge ""cookies"", or ice cream with a thick cookie coating, all drowning in a delish chocolate sauce. mmmm..PS. On a side note, the soda costs $3. That is a crime."
"My family and I came to bandera today for Mother's Day. We have been here a few times before and have always had a great experience. This time, we had a special appetizer- grilled artichokes. They were delicious. We also had the cornbread- this is a must! Made fresh in a skillet with a few jalapeños for a kick. I ate a waygu beef and enchilada dish. The beef was cooked to medium and was a bit spicy. The enchilada was a little sweeter- butternut squash and cheese (this is not a Mexican enchilada so don't go in expecting that and you will be fine). I really enjoyed this dish. It was a nice mix of spicy and sweet. I also had a Paloma, a type of tequila martini that I recommend to anyone. This is a great dinner spot. We were all happy with the food and the service. There is even live jazz music, which makes this place stand out from many others in the river north area."
Excellent ambiance and location - especially if you can grab a seat by the window overlooking the Magnificent Mile. The macho salad is solid. Soda in a can was a bit odd.
Ridiculously overpriced pretentious food served in a dark claustrophobic environment...teens found nothing they liked and hated their food.  Almost $130 for 5 with no apps or desserts...difficult to find and unpleasant to remember...worst dining experience in Chicago by far.
"This place knows how to cook delicious food. I had the black beans with their burger  and it was DELICIOUS! My husband had the ribs which were huge and so yummmy. Can't wait to go back and try more. Great food, great location, nice ambiance. You'll love it I'm sure."
"I've been here twice now and both times I was highly satisfied. I took a friend from out of town here for a weekend evening meal. We all loved the ambiance and the jazz entertainment. Had the rotisserie chicken (I think they call it something else on the menu) which was much larger than I expected. Cornbread was great. Service was also excellent. Second visit I took my parents for lunch, service was not quite as good this time, but food was excellent again. This time I had the macho salad am I'm glad I did. Overall, this is an excellent spot for a nice meal that isn't outrageously expensive."
"With a set up similar to that of J. Alexanders, this establishment is a contemporary American steakhouse restaurant. The food is delicious, the service is friendly and prompt and the location, overlooking Michigan Avenue, can't be any better. No fancy attire required, jeans and a t-shirt is still acceptable. This place is great for a date night or just a place to meet some friends. I was there multiple times on week nights and they always have a live jazz band which really sets the mood and makes the meal all that much more satisfying. My favorites have been the Macho Salad, Tuna Sashimi Tataki salad, Veggie Burger (with the most amazing coleslaw ever!), Jumbo Crab Cakes and the Key Lime Pie is to die for! If you happen to be in Chicago after a hard days work of shopping, I absolutely recommend that you stop in for a wonderful, well deserved meal!"
Everything I've had here is amazing. And I've been here 4 or 5 times. Highly recommend.
"If you like the selections at the other Hillstone chains, definitely come here.  Service is always good even if you eat dinner at the bar by yourself and catch a game."
"I was surprised that this restaurant is a mix of Mexican and American cuisine.  We ordered the BBQ ribs, prime rib, and grilled artichokes (purely addictive, I love artichokes and these were the best I've ever had...the saucy was also super yummy!).  I liked it all.  I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir while sitting at the bar waiting on our table (make sure to keep your cork just in case you don't finish the bottle), the bartender was awesome and set the night off right.  Our table was in the window and had a fabulous view of Michigan Ave.  I liked the ambience, it was intimately dark and the live music (a pianist and guitarist) was nice. Great date place or a place to go with friends, family, or on business!  I saw some of all when I went."
"Good American joint, good food, great drink service.  Pricey, but that's what you get on Michigan.The restaurant is a little loud for my taste; although the jazz musicians there were incredible, the noise level of the patrons in the restaurant was pretty distracting.The music on Saturday night easily would make this a 5-er, but the ambiance of the place felt lopsided and inconsistent."
"Bandera was very sweet and allowed me to sample their wares even though I was out on my bike and was wearing only an old t-shirt - Thank You! Great for me but I guess if I was here with someone special I wouldn't appreciate seeing the likes of myself and the way I was dressed - very confusing, but I hope you know what I mean.Bandera is elegant and if you are lucky to get a table overlooking Michigan Avenue even better. Live Jazz kept us entertained, they have a cornbread skillet which is absolutely to die for. I enjoyed the prime rib French Dip Sandwich which was perfect; shaved prime rib on a freshly baked roll and au jus with hand-cut frites.This is a Big City Date-Night joint if ever there was one. I will be here again for a Friday Happy Hour, I will be dressed appropriately, I will enjoy the live jazz, I will share the time with close friends, I will drink the wine. I can't wait.SlainteDanno"
"Brought out of town guests because always liked this restaturant. Food delicious, service horrible. I have been here many tilmes and always enjoyed Bandera. First, hostess ve ry curt. Second, server brought entree before salad finisished. Because still eating first course, the servers acted put upon when told we hadn't finished. Server took wine glass before finished. WILL NEVER go back."
"Came here after shopping down the street, seated promptly although I didn't expect it to be very busy on a Sunday afternoon.  We started with the Spinach Artichoke dip(we usually do), and I liked that it wasn't too oily or cheesy, just a healthy amount of spinach with some thin slivered artichoke.  I was torn between the Hacked Chicken Salad with Honey-Lime Vinaigrette and Peanut Sauce, the BBQ Beef Back Ribs with fries and roasted peanut cole slaw, and the classic, the roasted Chicken Bandera-style, which I had the first time I went 7 years ago.Luckily my wife ordered the Hacked Chicken Salad along with a side of Mac n Cheese(wasnt sure about the walnut cornbread crumble on top but it was good!), our friend ordered the Roasted Chicken and I got the ribs.  The chicken was predictably delish, my ribs were fall off the bone tender, I was able to eat them with knife and fork, and my wife loved her salad!Quick, friendly service, good food served hot and promptly.Just a reminder,there is paybox street parking available on Ohio, or you can go to the parking lot at 56 E. Ohio, Bandera will validate your ticket and your parking will be $12 for 3 hours.  OR if it's Sunday or a holiday, you can go south of the river and there is free parking on the east side of Michigan south of Wacker."
"GREAT view of the city, so it is a great place to take anyone from the country or 'burbs who enjoy watching the traffic of the Mag mile.The bar is dark, so if your looks are on the unfortunate side, I think this is a a good spot for a first date.  (It is so dark, you might get a second one!)The food is RICH, and they do not have ONE healthy choice on the menu.  If you ask for a special order, you get the ""high eyebrow and roll of the eye behind the back"" kinda look.  So, if you are here...enjoy your phat self and order the baked five cheese macaroni. Delish!  I hear their meatloaf is to die for, but I am still ""working off"" my last splurge!"
"Came here for dinner with my wife and like said, this is a place is a place you can bring your date.  Contrary to what people are complaining about with regard to noise level, I think it depends on where you are seated.We were seated away from the bar at a table by the window and it was fine.Window tables are a great spot overlooking Michigan Avenue during the evening.  We were right by the live jazz musicians and my wife remarked that this was such a romantic spot.  The dimmed lighting, the drinks, the decor, the music, the view off the 2nd floor.On to the food....The cornbread was ridiculously good!  It was so moist on the inside, you could mash it with your fork.  It was so good, I can just come here, order cornbread and only eat that for dinner and leave!  It's that good.  I'm more of a steak and potatoes guy rather than someone who likes prime rib, but OMG, that prime rib was good.  It was huge and I damn near killed it!  The garlic mash was also good.My wife had the fire roasted chicken which was good.  I don't normally do desert, but the key lime pie was great.  Staff was great."
"Live jazz trio very cool, great ambience very sexy......... Here comes the but....  the food came out way to fast not even half way through our appetizers ""I'm a fast eater"" the entrees would put basically on top off the apps. Should of sent them back my bad. Curios to see. If anyone else had this prob, server apologized but didn't seem to concerned"
"It's kind of a mixed bag here. First, I have to say that the bartenders here know their business. We were seated at the bar, and I had the chance to watch them work for a while. They were like machines, punching out orders with grace and efficiency under fire.The food itself is fairly simple, which isn't a bad thing. There's nothing terribly surprising or crazy, or things which a terribly high level of technical difficulty. The food (cornbread, hamburger and shaved lamb sandwich) is comforting, but it really isn't over and above the call of duty. It's fairly expensive for mostly average food, but the ambiance is nice."
"Banderas is owned by a group that has a restaurant in Sacramento where I live.  Having been to Bandera quite a few times in my life, I knew what to expect going in to this experience.  Since it was a Saturday night in an unfamiliar city we called ahead to find out how long the wait would be for a party of 3 and were told there was currently no wait since it was on the early side (5:45) but we were also told that it could change at any time.  Once we get there about 15 minutes later there is a wait of 30-45 minute which ended up being an hour and 15 minutes....  Minus one star.  That being said the restaurant is dark and masculine, aided by the beautiful sounds of a 3 piece band on piano, bass, and drums.  The menu is varied with an offering for anyone's hankering which included my desire for seared tuna.  Served with an amazing sauce and greens it priced out in the mid to high $20 range.  Their wine list is also extensive and does provide some options on the lower end of the price range as well.  Our bottle ended up to be about $33.  The service is impeccable which is to be expected in this type of establishment and is on par with the service I've received at other Bandera restaurants and at their Houston's chain.  The bar also provides a nice space to listen to some great music and relax with a martini (or two... or three) and is conveniently located along the busy Michigan Avenue stretch!  For a nice dinner out on the town or a celebratory occasion, you can't go wrong with Bandera's ambiance, food, or service."
"I love this place!  I highly recommend the grilled artichoke, the skillet of fantastic cornbread and the Macho salad.  I've give them 5 stars if they didn't have such a nutty  lunchtime RSVP policy.  Before 11:30 or after 2.  Downtown business people really don't have THAT much time to wait before a table is available. We always have to make plans for an early lunch when we go here..."
"It was a wonderful experience! Went Saturday around 1 for lunch and got seated right away at a table by the window overlooking Michigan. The waitstaff was beyond friendly and attentive.  App: Grilled Artichokes and aioliMeal: Cheeseburger and Chicken chili w/ black beansBoth the appetizer and meal choices were incredible. Thoroughly enjoyed the chilli and the burger was unbelievable quality. All the flavors of the burger went really well together in one bite. I also loved that the cut the burger into three pieces--made it easier to eat and portion off.The lighting was a little dim for my liking, but it didnt hurt my experience. I also loved how comfortable the chairs were. Next time I will definitely try the cornbread. It looks beyond delicious!"
"Great food, nice music, the service way too quick! It's like they want to get you out of the place. Please take it easy!"
"The other reviewers are right--the Macho salad is delicious!  The crabcakes were really good but oddly familiar.  Following a hunch, I checked Google and discovered that Bandera is owned by the same company that owns Gulfstream (Hollywood), the Woodmont Grill (Bethesda), and Houstons.  So it's the same crabcake at every place.  (The crabcakes are also quite similar to the ones at District Commons).  Don't get me wrong, they are quite good, but I wouldnt go out of my way to get them in DC.  I think the slightly mushy interior (due to the fact that it isnt all jumbo lump crab) and the bread crumb coating (which pales in comparison to the crispy exterior of most Maryland crabcakes) prevents me from putting it closer to the top of my list."
"After a few more visits, I think Bandera deserves that 5th star. One main reason is the Macho Salad and the corn bread. The other is the warm romantic ambiance. The food is always good here, but I didn't think a salad could be this delicious--especially when it's called the Macho. It contains roasted chicken, avocado, dates, almonds and goat cheese. All the ingredients are fresh and delicious--the dates and avocados really make this salad. And it has chunks of corn bread in it. Definitely take your out-of-town guests here to impress them."
"Beautiful decor, personable host. Crowded entrance area...may need a more streamlined seating process....Jesse Jackson was here the night we went and he took a photo with us! Okay, celebrity aside, I liked this place enough--but I had been wanting to try this restaurant out since I first saw it and unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Yes, I gave it four stars though.The server was nice, but I suppose she forgot we were there for awhile because the appetizer had come and gone and she was nowhere to be found. The menu was underwhelming. While the double dip duo appetizer was delicious, I kept going over the dinner menu over and over to realize that there wasn't that great of a selection here. I ultimately chose the macho salad and tortilla soup. The soup was great. The salad--not so much. I'd recommend for a dinner night though if you're in the area."
"I live less than three minutes from Bandera and have eaten there so many times, I know the menu and staff by heart. I tried to make a dinner reservation for a party of eight and knowing it's a small place, thought 5:30 would be reasonable, but the manager at Bandera was so uncooperative, she said the best they could do would be two tables NOT NEAR EACH OTHER. I am disappointed that a neighborhood restaurant wouldn't be the least bit accommodating to a regular customer. Actually, I guess I am now a former regular customer. The food is good, but in Chicago, we have so many choices, it's time to find a new favorite."
Loved it.  Great service and delicious food.  3 out of the 4 of us got the French dip beef and it was outstanding.  Great location and easy to find when you are a tourist.  Very reasonable for the quality of the meals.
"These guys over-hyped their own food.  The host and then the waitress also told us that their veggie burgers are the best in the world.  Supposedly the NY Times has said so.  So that was exciting to hear.The burger itself was good.  I don't know if it was the best ever.  If the bar hadn't been set to high, I might have thought it was better...  IDK... mind games!"
"This is another one of those places that never disappoints. And has not, for 15 years! I mean . . . this place has been more of a constant in my life than a lot of things!Met my best pal here after his freelance gig tonight. Told the bartenders I was meeting ""my brother!"" (so he could flirt with them IS IT SO WRONG?). Their wine pours are GENEROUS and their appetizer menu has good stuff on it for not a lot of coin. The bartenders are SWEET and wonderful.I've had some milestones here in my life (albeit 4 or 5 years ago), so this place will always be a favorite. At times a wistful favorite, but a favorite none the less."
"I came to Bandera after a morning of sightseeing with the fam.  We saw the good reviews on yelp and had just come off a boat tour and decided to try it!  I have to say we all loved it!  My mom and sister both got the Macho salad and coudn't say enough good things about it.  I didn't try it, but they loved it, said it was the best salad they ever had in a restaurant.  I got the lamb sandwich, and while it wasn't at all what I expected it was SO good!  I thought it was going to be more like a gyro but it almost looked more like a roast beef/french dip sandwich.  It had roasted peppers on it and the bread was super soft and delicious.  It came with this side cole slaw with peanut dressing on it that was also super yummy!"
"Dined here for lunch with the hubs on a recent trip to Chi-town. Very swanky joint even at lunch, seemed to be a place to see or be seen :-).   They make a great Sidecar martini!   Lamb French dip sandwich, sweet potato fries and turkey burger that we shared. All delish!    Service was fast and friendly."
"Been here quite a few times now and the service and food are always on point. Quality American favorites, generous portions and nice atmosphere. Try to get a table by the window so you can watch the passers by - it's a great view and quite magical around the holidays. This spot is definitely worth checking out...chicken, steak, seafood, it's all wonderful."
"I haven't been here in years, but it never ceases to maintain the steller quality of service.  One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the lighting... each table has its own individual overhead lamp which makes the dining experience seem more intimate and the racket of the other tables/aisle traffic seem to disappear.  Again, the wait staff do a great job.There isn't anything here I haven't enjoyed, but here are some select highlights:veggie burger (it is VERY good)cucumber salad (refreshing)corn bread & foccacio (highly recommend, tho it is a bit oilier than greasy from the last tasting than expected)pork chops (delish!)Oh yeah, live jazz during dinner hours.  I was seated right across from the piano. How nice!"
"I made a reservation, day-of, for 7 pm. Arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately without any waiting. The place was full but not crowded. Ambience was nice, definitely not a quiet place, but the live jazz was good (nothing groundbreaking, just piano, bass, drums). Good place for a date. The menu was not particularly inventive, but the food we had was executed very well. Grilled artichoke appetizer was delicious with the proper amount of char. Wagyu tips with enchilada and prime rib (which was huge, probably 14+ oz) were both better than expected."
"Alright, I know this is supposed to be a tourist-y kind of place, but hey, I was a tourist! And it was perfect.I ordered the Macho salad with delicious roasted chicken (their specialty) avocado, goat cheese and a fantastic vinagrette...it was light and satisfying & not as pricey as the other menu items.We had a beautiful table by the window, overlooking Michigan Ave. (I highly recommend getting one of those tables if you can) and there was some light Jazz music going on in the background. The service was friendly, the ambiance was classy, without being too pretentious....it's a win!"
"The restaurant is great. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is fun, and the window views are splendid.  But holy smoke, they don't take reservations, and we waited at least 2 hours to get a table for 3. And it was 2 hours of CRAMPED in like sardines by the bar.So actually, the only way I'm going back will be a weekday at like 4pm. Because by the time we waited the 2 hours, ordered, dined, and chit-chatted a bit, we'd closed down the place and they seemed to want to wrap up our ticket. And it's just not exotic enough for me to put in that kind of wait time for a chicken dinner or the macho salad. (however, the macho salad may have been the best salad I've ever had.)Again, the restaurant is great, but plan on a long wait for a table."
We ordered the cornbread it was burnt and salty and tasted terrible. We couldn't even eat it so we returned it. We both left the restaurant feeling that it was a C+ food
"Eating at any Hillstones joint just warms my heart b/c it reminds me so much of memories with an old friend.  Even when it's not what I want, I still go so I can pay homage to nostalgia.  **Tear**Alas, the food wasn't good this time, which was a stinker since I always thought of this place as a staple.  The macho salad was horrifyingly, soakingly overdressed (and gee, who wouldn't rather be undressed?!).  Service was super friendly as usual, and they made nice accommodations for me, a hobbler-on-crutches.  I'll still go for the memories and love of my friend, but no longer for the food."
Great meals. Best mash potatoes in town! Last time we had their Caesar's salad which was excellent.
"I love Bandera.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date night, which is exactly why we were there.  Dimly lit, cozy and just loud enough with the live jazz music that you can only hear the people you're with.  The service was super friendly and quick.  The food was awesome.  We started with the dip duo which was a cold queso and a guacamole, both excellent.  The house salad was the best I've ever had.  I could've eaten 3 of those for my dinner and been satisfied.  The vinaigrette was amazing and it had cornbread croutons and goat cheese too...so good.  I had the rotisserie chicken and my manfreddo had the filet.  There were only two strange parts about the entrees:  1) his sauteed spinach was basically just warmed through spinach leaves, was more like a spinach salad, spinach only.  2) The rice that came with my chicken was a dead ringer for Chipotle's burrito rice.  Delicious!  But surprising.The chicken and steak were perfect though.  Pretty reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back, loved it!"
I love this place!  Live jazz and good food.  The macho salad and ahi tuna salad are terrific!
"Stopped in for lunch after a hellish day shopping on Michigan Ave.  Bonus for having booths in this place.  YAY.  Another bonus for having unsweetened iced tea that I was craving!  I know, weird right.  I really want to give it 3.5 stars....so I am sticking with 3 just because it wasnt a four....and it really wasnt a 3 but....Anyway, we had the spinach and artichoke to start and it was pretty, pretty, pretty taste-y.  The only problem was not enough chips for the dip...BOO on that.  Rounded out the meal with the veggie platter and caeser salad.  I loved the artichoke on the veggie platter but other than that, nothing else was that good.  It had some cabbage and cauliflower...but nothing too exciting...I probably ordered wrong.  You know, sometimes thats half the battle...getting whats good at a restaurant.I love that you can overlook Michigan Ave and the swanky, yet relaxed vibe in here.  I think that I need to head back and order something else from here just to see."
"We came here to eat with a friend who had come into town for the weekend... overall a good experience. By the way, they will not let you sit at your table (despite having reservations) if your entire party is not present. LOCATIONConvenient, in the loop.. gotta go up escalators to get into the restaurant. Located adjacent to the store that has been ""going out of business"" for the past 5-6 years. AMBIENCEdark, live jazz music.. it was a great touch! There isn't much of a view but the waitress we had was really nice. We liked seeing the rotating chickens on the rotisserie in the front of the restaurant. FOODSpinach & Artichoke Dip: standard. Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon served with seasonal vegetables: pretty standard.. the salmon was cooked well.Prime Rib* roasted on the bone served with a caesar salad: GOOD. VERY JUICY. marbling was great.. the au jus was alright, not the best. Rotisserie Chicken spit-roasted dutch country chicken with green rice: the chicken is delicious. Moist, the skin is crispy... ORDER THIS FOR SURE. Like I mentioned before, it's cooked in the display area. You'll understand why you should get this once you get there. Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolate: good. just good. whipped cream is made in house... so so good."
"It's been a long time now since I've wanted to try the food at Bandera. The restaurant interior was beautifully laid out and I adored the open kitchen. The host was friendly and we were sat immediately on a Friday afternoon. Our hotel, Swissotel, mentioned that we should try the Macho Salad, which I ordered. I was floored by the flavors in this dish. Dates, big chunks of chicken, avocado and goat cheese. My friend ordered the lamb sandwich with coleslaw. The au jus completed the sandwich with its rich finish and melt in your mouth bread after soaking. Before these dishes, we had the dip duo, with a cold pub cheese and guac. The pub cheese was really creamy, and had a bite to it! I recommend any of the above, they will not disappoint."
"A friend took me to this restaurant after shopping on Michigan Ave one day. I must say this restaurant is a very lovely place. Nice ambience with a lounge feel. It is located on the second floor of a shopping plaza so you can look out the window over the busy Michigan Ave. street while you eat. It is beautiful when it is snowing outside. I tried the cornbread, OMG, it was so good, it comes with olives in it. There was also a live pianist playing jazz music while we ate which gave the restaurant a very classy and elegant feel. The food was all reasonably priced. To conclude my meal I had the Oreo and ice cream desert. It was so good, very rich and creamy, it went way to fast. I always have to stop in at this place when I'm on Michigan Ave."
"The food is mediocre at best and the steaks are way overpriced for strictly average or below.  Our family went here to celebrate my son's 21st birthday.  Be warned, if you are celebrating a birthday, they do not give you a complimentary dessert.  When I asked the very rude hostess about this on the way out, I was told they do provide a complimentary candle and light it free of charge!  Wow isn't that big of them?  After spending over $500 on dinner and drinks, they can't throw in a dessert?  How cheap!"
"So definitely a bit of a hidden gem, smack in the middle of the tourist-ridden Magnificent Mile.  I was in town for work earlier this week and someone in our group recommended this place... at first I was definitely hesitant, considering it's location, but boy it really delivered.  It was crowded by with a professional crowd, not a lot of loud casual tourists... and they had live music to really set a relaxing mood.While we waited at the bar I had a drink, and I highly recommend the pomegranate martini- really fresh and fruity tasting.  Yes, I am a girl, I like fruity things.  But they also have a good wine list, so I can also recommend that :)  It has some medium-priced selections that are great for big groups that are planning on drinking several bottles.When I was there I ordered the ribeye special, but unfortunately they were out of that, so I got the filet,  cooked and served like the ribeye.  I LOVED that they were willing to cook a substitute specially to accommodate my original request- I think that's the sign of a true customer-focused restaurant.  That's actually why they get a five in my book.  And yeah, my filet was awesome.  It was cooked simply and served with huge fresh tomatoes sprinkled with blue cheese and drizzled with some sort of bearnaise sauce... really good.Now I will say, they don't have a really extensive or different menu, I only saw a few things I really thought were innovative (there's a tuna appetizer that's got fruit in it that I tried - it was served with chips, it was good).  But what they do, they do well, and that's all anyone can ask for in my book.   I'll definitely come back here next time I am in town."
"I've been here twice. The first time, my salad was great and I liked the cornbread. It was a bit expensive but not too bad. I came back and got a little fancier and ordered the filet with brussel sprouts. the filet was disgusting. i mean... add a little salt. I couldn't finish it. The brussel sprouts (which are normally my favorite vegetable) were insanely sweet? I mean, I add a little sugar to mine at home, too, but this tasted like it had syrup poured over it. Just a huge mess. I paid over 100 for two people with tip and left hungry."
"I really like this place and it's location is key when ur downtown shopping on Michigan. It's a very dark and contemporary, kinda sexy ambiance, and has simple uncomplicated yet delicious food. They change their specials all the time which I love. The views are great, overlooking michigan ave and it's gorgeous at night especially during the winter when the lights are on the trees. I went here on a Monday night so it wasn't crowded, but it does fill up on weekends. However, the bar serves awesome drinks so sitting there and waiting is never a problem. Definitely a good place to hit up with friends or after a day of shopping on mich ave."
"Possibly the BEST veggie burger I've ever had. Definitely one of the top two (the other one was from Veg N' Out in Los Angeles). Their veggie burger is an in-house recipe, with a unique recipe by the restaurant. It's a medley of brown rice, spices, and other delicious ingredients unbeknown to me. Melted monterey jack cheese, along with the standard mayo, mustard, lettuce, and tomatoes accompany the patty. It was mouth-wateringly delicious. (My only complaint is that the rice was a tad colder than I would've liked--but it may have been due to the mayo). They serve their veg burger with peanut coleslaw, which was well, awesome b/c peanuts are awesome. Mom had the french dip, which she liked a lot too. The ambiance is dark, romantic, soothing, and calming. There is a nice view of the Magnificent Mile if you get a seat by the window. Prices are a little steep, but you definitely get what you pay for. Service is friendly. The crowd consisted mostly of young professionals. Overall, a great experience if you're looking for something a little more special."
"Bandera Bandera Bandera! Where should I start? Should I start with the mouth-watering scents that inundate your nostrils the minute you enter the joint?  Maybe I should start with the dimly lit ambience and jazz band that reminds you of a throwback 5-star from the days of Sinatra and Rickles?Nah - I got it! I'll start with the amazing vantage point the place has of Michigan Avenue - sitting one story above the most MAGNIFICENT street in the world - conveniently called ""Magnificent Mile."" Well it is a restaurant right? And these reviews are supposed to talk about the food above all, right? Well I guess - I'll talk about the food and get going.Steak - THEE BESTSalads - THEE LARGEST and FRESHESTSeafood - THEE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND TASTIEST AQUA-BORN DELICACIESChicken - THEE JUICIEST AND MOST PERFECTED BLEND OF SEASONINGSIf you don't like awesomeness - you can't take crowds - and you don't like large portions of edible miracles - then stay away from Bandera. It's definitely not the place for bland food lovers who dine in complete silence."
This was a great place for a social/work lunch. The macho salad and corn bread were outstanding as well as the Oreo cookie ice cream desert. Service was really good.At lunch they didn't take a reservation so there can be a bit of a wait.
"Love this place.  Here's a  secret menu tip (sorry if this has been restated)  - get the ""Moo and Cluck"" , it's essentially the roasted chicken dinner combo'd along with the beef ribs.  The portions are dialed back, but it's tons of food.  Your welcome."
"A solid 3.5 star.Like most yelpers have stated, this place is definitely very similar to Cheesecake Factory--fairly large portions and the ambiance is very swanky.  This place is conveniently located near our hotel and Michigan Ave--the middle of Magnificent Mile. We ordered and shared:ROTISSERIE CHICKEN: 3.5/5--very moist with delicious green rice (spinach)MACHO SALAD:4/5: yum, it has dates in them--although I SHOULD'VE asked for dressing on the side. Good selection of Wine--our waitress seems to be very knowledgeable about the wines."
My fiance & I wandered to Bandera on a recent visit as we were leaving town and had time for one meal. We read some brief reviews on yelp and most seemed good. I was a little concerned as we had limited time but service was quick.. and we initially felt a little under-dressed (jeans) as everyone there seemed to be in brunch gear. I ordered the burger and he got the french dip. I loved the shoestring fries as well as the burger being cut into 3 bite-size (although large) portions. The bun was toasted and it gave it extra flavor. It was on the greasy side (which is what made it so yummy IMO). Good value ($12-15/ea) as well. They had a Oreo ice cream sandwich we didn't get to try as we were stuffed and close on time but will definitely come back next time we go to Chi-Town.
I have dined at numerous Hillstone restaurants. Usually very good.  This was not good. I like their chicken. Here it was really overcooked  and tough. Go with something else.
"Appeared very LGBT friendly. More than half so.The chunky ""queso"" that accompanies the chips is served chilled. The waiters don't ask, ""May I take anything away for you?""; they ask, ""Are you still enjoying?""Water is served without ice out of glass milk quarts."
"We had dinner here on a Sunday evening. And while the food was good, it wasn't amazing. And the service was slowwwww. Also, my Manhattan was watery.  But the cornbread was delicious! I ordered the steak & enchilada, and my colleagues ordered the prime rib and the seared ahi tuna. They both report that their meals were okay.  They had a live jazz band playing who was pretty good."
"The burger is amazing if you want easy fare. I also highly recommend the prime rib. And, fruit with cream is an amazing dessert. And, I love the music they play!"
"The vegetarian burger was unbelievable. It had so many flavors within it. It was a HUGE portion and it was priced well. Probably the best vegetarian burger i've had in Chicago. The ambience was great, we had the corner round table. The servers were absolutely knowledgeable about their menu and had good opinions and recommendations. Would recommend this place for sure."
Forgot about this place.  Used to go here when worked at the Trib and they had the million dollar steak sandwich....which they got rid of asses...The french dip and pulled chicken sandwich are the best in the city.  it is packed at lunch so hit it after 1 or before 1130 and they are $16 or $18 but wow the roast meef  melts in your mouth and the chicken that is spinning in your face from the second you walk in is great.  Cornbeard is fun but filling
One of my favorite American Style restaurant. Love the food and the setting. Not the lightest food around but definitely the right place to go for anything that you want to go for on the menu. Only thing to avoid is their disgusting expresso!!! All the rest is just good!
I went to Bandera on a recent visit to Chicago for work with 3 of my co-workers. We showed up pretty late on a Wednesday night and were surprised to find a wait of 90 minutes but it was definitely worth it. It was crowded but had a great energetic vibe. The moscow mule was amazing. Everyone loved their food from the cornbread and soup to ahi salad and a burger.
"The food here is really phenomenal, but it loses a star for ridiculously long  wait times and terrible acoustics.I usually get some cornbread and the macho salad when I'm here, but I've tried their sandwiches and some of the entrees and I've never had anything bad. The cornbread is the best I've had in the city, and I crave the macho salad very often (first salad I've ever had with dates in it). They have live music, which is nice but also really annoying if you're trying to have a conversation because the acoustics are pretty bad. It's best to ask for a table that's not right near the musicians.Also, they take reservations but they're not really reservations, it's almost more like call-ahead seating, so don't expect to get in and get a table. Definitely worth it on a weekday when there is less of a wait."
"The ambiance of the restraunt is great. The staff service was ok. I work in the service management hospitality industry and the waiter seemed like they are programmed and they where not really providing genuine service. It felt like we where talking to a computer or robot. Yes, I did tip the waiter well because he did change our drinks to something that catered to our taste. Oh they don't serve mash potatoes until 5pm only.I would not recommend this restaurant if your going on a date. Im just keeping it real. :) smile!Im having dinner at Maggianos restaurant now and we see a big difference in service. Maggianos waiters personality and smile and service is very genuine. The waiters asked if we wanted bread and what type of butter would we like etc. If you are downtown shopping (or even if you are not) on Michigan Ave this is a great spot to stop for lunch only. I love the ambiance of the lighting. If you are lucky and get a window seat, it is one of the few places in Chicago where you can actually look out over Michigan Ave. The menu selections are all delicious. The steak is amazing.There can be a long wait from time to time, but there is plenty of room at the bar while you wait."
Love the barbecue salmon from here!  Best dish ever!!!
"We went here as an alternative to the Purple Pig, which was (of course) too damn crowded. We almost missed it; the entrance is also the entrance to a furrier, and the restaurant is on the second floor.The staff was friendly, prompt, and courteous. We tried the corn bread and it was wonderful. I had the prime rib french dip sandwich, and it was delicious. My friend had the aged prime rib, slow roasted. It looked like something you'd see Fred Flintstone eat, and he enjoyed every bite. Before we were shown to our table, we sat at the bar. The bartenders were attentive and tried their best to recreate the grapefruit cocktails that I'd loved at the Yelp Elite Event at the Capital Grille in Oak Brook. They didn't quite hit the mark on that one, but I gave them points for trying. The atmosphere was classy casual and very comfortable.All in all a great meal with great service. It's a new staple on my ""What restaurant would you recommend?"" list I'm always rattling off at the nearby hotel where I work."
"My wife and I are loyal fans of the Bandera/Hillstone collection of restaurants, so we looked forward to the kind of first class experience that we typically enjoy at their restaurants.  This was our first visit to a Bandera outside of California, The food was great as was the service, but it was a huge surprise to be charged for seconds for a diet coke and an Arnold Palmer.  Actually it was more of a disappointment.  It's surely a minor issue but it sure tainted our experience."
"Great food, great staff, great music. Prices are reasonable for this kind of restaurant."
"Went here on a recommendation from my dad, a frequent business traveler to the area. I must agree that it's a nice place to eat. I enjoyed the Macho Salad, the mixed drinks, and the live music."
Good standard mix of American fare. I prefer the Hillstone in NY but they are very similar. They can be busy depending on the day though so better if you make a reservation.
I like bandera. I'm going to havemto go on a night when they actually have live jazz. The food here is great. The only downside to this place is that everytime I go they always run out of this pork w/ Apricot dish I want to try. Never fails. That gets a little frustrating.
"Went there on September 21. I had the Macho salad , and we split the signature cornbread, which was very good. The salad was fine, absent the ""grilled chicken"" which had the consistency of tofu, complete mush.My wife had a soup, which was fine."
"Restaurant reviewBandera is located right in the middle of the Mag Mile. As a chain restaurant from the Hillstone group, I was expecting an average meal; but I was surprised. Unlike some restaurants they do not give you bread at the beginning of the meal. We ended up ordering the cornbread which comes in a cast iron skillet enough for 4 people. This was simple delicious (fresh, sweet tasting, and light). The menu is rather limited and is available on their website, however the portions are moderate/large size. The servers are attentive and your glass is always refilled without asking. The other nice features include window seating overlooking the Mag Mile and daily live Jazz that starts around 7pm. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, but the perfect setting for a romantic dinner or simply going out with friends.Meal:Appetizer: Cornbread $5 and mac/cheese $5Meals:Roasted chicken with spanish rice- large portion, amazingly moist. Pricey given the ingredients $19Cheeseburger - fresh ground in-house - with Hand-Cut Fries- comparable to steak house burgers, large portion of fries with orders $14Famous Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich with Hand-Cut Fries- simply delicious with a side of au jus, however small in size $16Pros- wonderful staff, live jazz daily, beautiful ambience, best cornbreadCons- limited menu choice, some items are pricey compared to other restaurantsHidden deals: Live jazz daily around 7pm. Remember to come later if you want to enjoy the music while having your meal, however you will have to compete wait to be seated."
"I came here for lunch on a weekday with a friend, who used her connections to get our meal for 50% off ;) At that price the cheeseburger and fries were well worth it- big portions, piping hot hand cut fries, and my burger was cooked perfectly. The service was friendly and seamless, and the location of course offers a great view of downtown Chicago. 4 stars because although the food didn't necessarily stand out to me, everything just worked really well together- the staff, the crowd, the ambience, etc. If I was ever in need of a nice place to eat on Michigan Ave I would come back."
Nice food... friendly patrons and workers.. I made friends in a place I was visiting so always a good thing. Very good suggestion with the Veal..
"Love the corn bread! So satisfactory. I had the signature chicken dish and it was delicious. The vibe was kind of intimate, with live jazz band playing. Good place for a date!"
"Located in the heart of the Magnificent Mile in Chicago sits an amazing restaurant for locals and tourist to come and enjoy a refined and delicious meal. First off, let me say this, Bandera Restaurant has the absolute best cornbread I have ever tasted. The moist and buttery bread was filled with flavor and was a great starter dish to tease the palates. The rotisserie chicken was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The meat was tender and savory and anything but dry. I have nothing bad to say at all except that there should have been more chicken on my plate. The mashed potatoes were a bit different and steamed brussel sprouts were simply steamed which kind of was a disappointment for me.A very upscale yet laid-back ambiance along with a friendly staff and delicious food made a Bandera a hit among my friends and I."
"Love, love, love their chicken dish. Very well cooked and the only comparable chicken I have had in Chicago would probably be the one from the Art Institute restaurant. The environment is great if you are looking for a nice music bar and nice ambiance."
What a total mistake coming here.  I am a loss for words and I really liked this place for many years.  The manager was so rude when I asked for the kitchen to split my plate.  Service has gone way down hill.  Will not be back
"It's a nice dinner, any way you order. But we left hungry and went to McDonald's afterwards. Just not enough food for the price. Sorry. If we went to the cheesecake factory, we would have saved 50 bucks and been full for an almost identical meal."
"I visited the Corona Del Mar locale a few months ago, so of course had high expectations for the Chicago location. We had a 7:30 reservation (and had requested a table at the window) and when we arrived we were told it'd be a 15-20 minute wait. After our 20 minute wait we were told it would be another 15-20 minutes for our window seat or we could just get a booth. We opted for the booth. Food is pretty good. The grilled artichoke was even better than I recalled. Honestly one of the best artichokes I've ever had. My salmon dish was prepared well however some elements of the plate were a bit on the bland side. We also sampled both desserts- the ice cream sandwich and the banana cream pie. Again, while they were both ""good"", it wasn't great. Our server was excellent, the live jazz, dark wood, and dim lighting attribute to great ambiance.One thing I didn't like, they don't offer valet. I get that it's probably a difficult place to have valet, right in the middle of the mag mile, so you have to park in a garage about a block east of the restaurant for $24!!!!! Not a fan. I did hear from our friend afterward that they do validate parking tickets but it wasn't mentioned nor did I see it posted anywhere. Boo."
"I came here with my sister and her friends around Thanksgiving last winter. The place was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a long time to be seated. This place somehow reminded me of Grand Lux or Cheesecake Factory, but the food is way better. The Macho Salad and Cheeseburger were both delicious! It was quite pricey. But I really enjoyed the food. Plus the portion was huge, so I am not going to complain. I am definitely going to take my mom here next week when she comes visit me."
"This was the second Bandera that I was at in the same week. The other was in Phoenix. Both were very good but the Phoenix prime rib was just a tad better. I think I just had a bit more of the ""crust"" in Phoenix and I do love that!That being said, I would go back here in a second and I have taken clients here and they were all smiles. If you like artichokes, then I suggest the roasted artichoke."
"Rib eye steak at medium rare, comes with fresh horseradish sauce and a side of mashed potatoes- 5 starsRotisserie chicken with special rice - 4 starsCaesar salad - 4 starsQuality rib eye steak. The rice with the chicken was on the more oily side that didn't complement too well with the chicken. Chicken was tender and juicy. Caesar salad was ok, the dressing is worth a try. It tasted like a fusion between honey mustard and Caesar. Will come again for the steak. Feels like you can't really go wrong with this place. Love the live jazz music!"
Great atmosphere and good food.  Service was great and good music.
"This restaurant thinks it is an ""exceptionally"" high end establishment when in fact....the service is bad, the hosts are rude, and ""exceptionally"" snobby. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. As a member of the hospitality community, I think every concierge in the city should refrain from ever recommending it."
"Man how i love the chicken salad here, oh and the cornbread!"
"My friends and I seriously had a spread the size of the last supper here!  Jesus (or insert  higher being of your choice here) would be proud.Grilled artichoke, a roasted chicken, spanish rice, roasted veggies, chicken and spinach enchiladas, macho salad....alll of it was sooooo good!Great night here! Live piano for a little ambiance, good waitress, quick service, good food, lovely time!"
"I've always enjoyed going to Bandera. I don't get to go as often since it's no longer within walking distance of my office, but that just means I appreciate it that much more when I am able to go.Always a creature of habit, I tend to order the Macho salad. It's chock full of rotisserie chicken, corn, avocado, goat cheese, cornbread croutons, dates and other unusual ingredients. I am also happy to report that they finally listed almonds as one of the ingredients on the menu description. I would always forget that the salad had slivered almonds on top until it was placed in front of me.Since the salad is liberally covered in them and I have a mild allergy to nuts, I would have to send it back to be remade. I always felt bad about this, but the situation could have been easily avoided had the almonds been listed on the menu as one of the components of the salad. I'd have discussions with manager every time. I'm glad they finally remedied it. Saves them money too, since I can't be the only one this has happened to.The service is pleasant and efficient, and the atmosphere is relaxed but somehow intimate.Tip: I always ask for all white meat chicken on my salad and most places would charge extra. Happily, Bandera does not.Great dining option for a date, business lunch, or just a meal with friends. It appeals to tourists and locals alike."
Macho salad is maybe the best salad I've ever had.  Skillet cornbread was a cool novelty that we had to try; would recommend. Staff was super friendly; great place.
"Excellent service. Great atmosphere. I ordered the rotisserie chicken. It was pretty good--not the greatest.  I know that is just  the DC girl in me talking--we have pretty high standards for rotisserie chicken. My husband ordered the prime rib; it was velvety. I was envious during the entire meal. Oh, and the oreo sandwich is ah-may-zing!"
We really enjoyed this place during a business trip to Chicago. Sat at the bar because it was quite busy. One of the most flavorful veggie burgers I've had. Live Jazz provided a great ambiance.
"Super touristy, crowded and loud. The place is huge and takes away from the wonderful, little 3 man band in the middle. Had zuchini corn bread (their specialty) and onion soup topped off with a glob of cheese (specifically asked for no cheese due to lactose intolerance). The waitress snarfed for not ordering full course dinner and literally threw the check at my side, along crumbles of bread on the table. Suggest customer service training for an establishment with prime location such as this."
"Wonderful, romantic, and beautiful restaurant! I went to Bandera for Valentines Day dinner and it was almost perfect. The service was friendly and the live jazz music was a delight. There was an hour and a half wait to be seated. However, we bought ourselves drinks from the bar while waiting, a mint mojito and Paloma (both delicious and not too strong). I highly recommend the queso dip to start off with. It was served cold, but so flavorful with a hint of spicy. I could eat it all day. I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend ordered the NY strip. His meal was delicious and cooked to perfection. My only issue was that since I had forgotten that I ordered the Seattle-Style Barbecue Salmon, I didn't realize that the salmon I got wasn't glazed with nothing more than salt pepper and a few herbs. No BBQ! After dinner I passed by another couple noticing she got the salmon as well.. Luckily hers was grilled and glazed with a BBQ sauce. I left before I could even say anything. Make sure your order is correct if you ever go!"
"My friends and I came to Bandera purely for drinks while waiting for our reservation at a nearby restaurant. I liked this place so much that is it on my list of places to go to next time I'm in town. The atmosphere is romantic/sexy- perfect date spot. They had live jazz music which was awesome (I don't find many date restaurants in Milwaukee with live music). The drinks were good and the bartenders very friendly. We ended up ordering the spinach artichoke dip- soo good. The drinks were a little pricey- but you are paying for the atmosphere, so worth it to me. I can't wait to come back here for dinner."
"It was nice overall. Good steak, okay wine and good ambiance. They play jazz music sometimes and it makes your meal more enjoyable. It is in a nice location. If you re a tourist like me and here for a while, you should check this place out."
"Quite possibly one of my fav spots next to girl and the goat. The ambiance of dimmed lighting and live music is great. The drinks (moscow mule) diverse. My hubby loved the ribs; said they were fall-off-the-bone good. My enchilada and cilantro white rice were divine. Great variety. However, this is not the place to just 'drop in' for dinner. Wait time for walk-ins range from 45min to 1hr 30 min. So be sure to call ahead."
"After hearing about Bandera for months, I was really excited to try the restaurant. To be honest, I didn't get what all the hype was about. The food was bland and uninspiring. I had the Bandera-style roasted chicken, which was so/so, and the mashed potatoes, a huge disappointment. Almost every dish is served with Spanish rice. Nothing on the menu deserves the prices Bandera commands.Overall, I'd recommend going across the street to The Purple Pig or leaving that tourist trap that is Michigan Avenue altogether. Bandera's food is just not spectacular."
"The Best Restaurant in Chicago! It's close to the shopping area and the contemporary art museum in Chicago. So, you can walk there if you you are visiting that side of town. I usually don't like sea foods. My husband ordered smoked salmon I guess. It was sooooooo good that even I liked it!!! I ordered Enchilada which was great too. They have live jazz music that was another plus!"
"The food is really good, we where seated right by the music and it was just too loud"
"I have been going to Bandera for many years now and haven't had a bad experience yet. I think what I like most is the consistency. No matter what I've ordered it's always been very good. Their fish preparations are always exceptional and they often times have some unique sides (I tried the spaghetti squash with mushrooms, raisins, and Parmesan which was fantastic!) I also really enjoy their salads (Macho and Hacked) which are very hearty and of course the cornbread and queso starters!The ambiance is great and I love the live jazz (though if you're sitting close to the band it can get pretty loud.) Service is efficient but I've never found the staff to be overly friendly, but that hasn't bothered me too much. Yes, it can get a bit touristy since it's on Michigan Ave., but at least the food is superior to other more mainstream options.This is definitely a place to check out!"
"The staff is exceedingly nice and the service was swift and consistent.  I really enjoyed my lunch there and as a vegetarian the veggie burger was a treat!  Made in-house, it is not a neglected after-thought as are veggie burgers in so many restaurants.  At Bandera the veggie burger is an inspired selection of exceptionally well suited ingredients and the result sublime.  After that awesome burger I decided to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee.  Not really expecting much (most traditional menu restaurants option for the cheap stuff), I was pleased to find that the coffee, even during the mid-day, was fresh and very, very good.  Excellent roast. I look forward to my next visit to Bandera!"
My first stop every time I visit Chicago! It's totally as good as it gets for me.My fav two vegetarian options are the vege burger with the peanut coleslaw or the macho salad without the chicken. The portions are huge.My meat eating friends love it. A place that satisfies both in the way this one does is rare. A++
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago. Classy atmosphere, good jazz music and delicious food. I especially recommend Baby Back Ribs."
"The ambiance of this place is what really makes it special.Bandera is located upstairs on Michigan and Grand, but you'll miss the entrance if you don't realize that it doubles as the entrance for Andriana Furs. Yes, they are apparently still around. Once upstairs, you are treated to the perfect combination of mood lighting, the buzz of conversation, and light jazz. Tons of people are usually crowded around the large bar eating and drinking. Definitely make reservations. The service is great, and they are very attentive. The wine and martinis are a delicious start, as well as the spinach artichoke dip. I just tried the queso dip for the first time and it's delish - spicy! The food is what I'd call American with a twist or ""Modern American."" For example, the croutons on the Caesar salad are cornbread croutons, and the mac and cheese appetizer is made out of mostaccoli.The veggie burger is the winner here. Large and juicy, and just as good as any cheeseburger. However, I was not impressed by the fries at all. Too skinny and too salty. Overall, the food is good but the ""twists"" they put on American classics don't always work that well. For the price - go for something fancier."
"I have nothing but great things to say about all the Hillstone company restaurants. This place is almost identical to ""Houstons"" and the grilled chicken salad is out of this world. I ordered it here (and I always order it when I go to Houstons). The other people I was with couldn't stop raving about how awesome the interior is. Dark wood with very cozy seating, ask to be in a booth if one is available! This place is like a little hideaway from the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave."
"I'm a sucker for great service and well prepared Ahi Tuna.  Bandera rose to the occasion in both areas.  After numerous people telling me to give this place I try, I ended up grabbing a late lunch here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago.  Our waitress was superb, knowledgeable, and pleasant and my food was delicious.  The ambience of the restaurant was relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience.  I will certainly be back."
"Based only on the food, I would've given them a 4, but because the wait time was so bad, I'm bumping them down a star. I had made a 9 o' clock reservation for 6. We arrived at 8:55 pm and ended up waiting until 9:25 for a RESERVATION. I thought the whole point of making one was so you wouldn't have to do that. The place definitely has a very nice vibe too it with live music in the background and a second floor location overlooking the Michigan Avenue.We grabbed a round of drinks (Moscow Mule for me) and the queso which was different than your usual melted version. It was chunks of cheese and cold, but the chips were fresh and crispy so it was a very good combo. I got a Kobe-style beef with an enchilada. The taste of the beef was wonderful, but it was a little overcooked for my taste; they did not ask how I would for it to be done, but maybe it's because it comes in little strips.After the whole reservation fiasco, the food was actually pretty good so it redeemed itself a little."
"Bandera has seen better days, I'm afraid. I know it has. I was there for them. It can't be easy to be a staple of Michigan Avenue when so many variables are in flux (economy, tourism, tastes, etc.). But, that's the thing about being a staple: you have to be reliable. When the economy is in the pooper, people are getting shot on/near Michigan Avenue and the culinary trends of the day skew towards prepay, citizens look to staples to a source of familiarity and comfort in uncertain times. Like Superman.Well, this Jimmy Olsen definitely got the blues on his last visit to Bandera. Everything was all over the place. Despite coming on an uncharacteristically sparse Saturday, it took a while to be seated. Once we were seated, it took a while to get a server. Once we got a server, it took a while to get some water. Once we got some water... you see where this is going (ie nowhere good).Once we finally received service, it was inattentive at best. I had to have my meal brought out three times because the first two times my order was wrong. Yes, you read that correctly: my order was screwed up twice. The first time, I was brought the wrong dish entirely. The second time I was brought the correct dish but with ingredients different from what I requested. By the time the dish came around for the third time, I'd lost my appetite and my patience. Figuring that I should eat *something*, I decided to dig into my sandwich. The bread didn't hold up well to the ingredients and fell apart midway through. I finished the sandwich with a knife and fork. Well, that is until I saw that it has mayonnaise on it. Despite not saying that the sandwich came with mayo on the menu and specifically asking about and requesting it not come near my meal, there it was. The proverbial strike three. The last straw was the bill. Nothing was comped. There was no apology from the server or manager. Our server simply asked if we needed anything else, dropped the bill off and left me to pay $50+ for a wholly unsatisfying (nay, disastrous) meal.Superman has left the building."
"YES.Came here on St. Patrick's Day because a friend said his 'last meal' would come from here.I get it.I had the Macho Salad which is perfect.  It has the perfect amount of everything and the ingredients are so tasty together - roasted chicken, corn, cornbread croutons, dates, almonds and the tastiest fresh goat cheese.  The roasted peanut coleslaw and the grilled jumbo artichoke were also delicious.We got Moscow Mules with whiskey instead of vodka - because it was St. Patrick's Day and because they just taste better that way and OH SO GOOD!We had a wonderful seat next to the window where we could be out of the crowds but still see the river of green shirts wandering down the Magnificent Mile."
"I am strictly rating this based on Yelp standards that two stars means ""Meh. I've experienced better"". I have come here a few times because of the ambiance. Great ambiance for sure and that's really about it. Two stars does not make this place bad, it's just...mediocre.It's been years but I do recall one time getting the Bangers and Mash and that was really nothing special. I can make great mashed potatoes and all I need is just to get some bangers from dominicks and we straight. I also recall getting some roasted half chicken another time and that was just ok as well. Don't run the other way seeing two stars, I just don't want to give another star making people think that the food is good. It's a great place to go for drinks and if you just base it off of that then well..I guess that will make the food decent after all."
"So my boyfriend and I went back because we enjoyed it so much the first time.  However, it wasn't as good b/c as we found out  they change their menu by season so in this visit we had a less than eventful mexican rice with our Rotisserie chicken.  If you go here, be sure to check the menu options ahead.  The cornbread still gets 5-stars!!!"
"I visited for lunch, around 1:30, which seemed like a great time to get in and snag a great spot overlooking Michigan Ave (from what I hear the place gets really packed between 11:45 and 1:00).  Very nondescript entrance off Michigan Avenue then straight up the escalator to the dining room.  The restaurant was dimly lit allowing for a lot of natural light through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Michigan Ave.The service was fine, very attentive and helpful, but not very friendly.  Not sure if I'm use to the southern hospitality in North Carolina or what, but our waitress obviously had one foot out the door.  My table started with the queso dip which I thought was excellent.  It was a variation on the typical queso dip - cool and light with a nice hit of spice.  Imagine a course pimento cheese with a nice peppery kick.  I had the fresh grilled fish sandwich which was amazing.  The wood-grilled flavor was superb.  The roasted peanut coleslaw served with the sandwich was clean and crisp - a lovely Asian inspired cabbage that paired perfectly.  The caesar salad was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the dressing - it didn't have enough of a zip to it -  that said you could tell it was fresh and was very light.  Others around the table enjoyed the macho salad which I hear is one of the big sellers and the ""hacked"" chicken salad, another specialty.  Definitely a great lunch spot and I look forward to dining here again."
"The Ahi Tuna was amazing! Live jazz at a comfortable volume for ambience, attentive and polite staff. Definitely make reservations, especially for a Friday (the place was packed!). I would definitely go here again."
"I was a little skeptical at first glance from the outside (as I couldn't find the entrance), but this lunch didn't disappoint.Immediately upon entering I noticed the many chickens roasting right next to me behind a large glass pane, definitely a good sign.Obviously I had to order the rotisserie sandwich and it was definitely one of the better chicken sandwiches i've had in a long time (if not the best). The bread was the perfect proportions, very thin and seemed freshly baked (fortunately it didn't overpower the chicken).The chicken was extremely moist and tender and there was a substantial amount, but not too large like most sandwiches in the city.The fries were no joke either, shoestring and cooked just right, leaving some crispy ones at the end.I'd be back anytime for this close to perfect meal..."
"What a great dining experience Bandera turned out to be.  My wife and I are visiting Chicago for the first time and walked a few steps from our Hotel into the doors of this great restaurant.  Great service, ambiance, and food.  We split the grilled chicken salad(delicious) and had grilled artichokes and the chips with the duo dip.  The live jazz is great and contributed to a fantastic evening!"
"We came for lunch and the hospitality was amazing and I loved the restaurant's American Nuevo vibe.  An empty glass didn't sit on our table for longer than 2 minutes, that's how attentive the wait staff was. We had the spinach artichoke dip, macho salad and burger and fries and I must say that it was the best dining experience we've had yet in Chicago and the price was reasonable.  Ingredients were fresh and cooked nicely."
"One of the best restaraunts ever. A wonderful atmosphere and fantastic food, went here for lunch again today and everything was just as good as the first time I visited. I love that it's located right on north Michigan avenue with a gret view. The rotisserie chicken sandwich is delicious as well as the queso dip. The wait wasn't to bad and the service was good as well. Great for lunch, business meeting, a date, after work drinks, or a girl's night out.Went here recently for dinner with my friend, the service was excellent and the ambiance was wonderful, with live jazz music that was being played. It relly made me feel like I was in an entire new city. The oreo ice cream sandwich was super delicious. The used crushed oreo cookies that where pressed against yummpy vanilla ice cream with fresh made whip cream."
"I love this place.  I could eat here all the time if I could afford it!  I generally split a cheeseburger with my bf, since there's no way we can finish a plate on our own, but I've had some of their other plates, and they're delicious.  Their ribs are great, spinach dip is divine, their cornbread it fantastic, and their caesar salad is worth a try also!  As for desserts, I've only tried their Oreo, and I think it's fantastic!to sum it up:  great food, great service, great music in the evenings...!  I only wish that they had more dessert options and maybe BBQ chicken like they used to have at Houston's? PS:  they don't take reservations for lunch, but they DO in the evening (which is must, because it's always packed).  I did not find it touristy at all..."
"I am consistently underwhelmed by Bandera.  They have a good location on Michigan Ave and, being on the second floor, a unique view of the city from their windows.  The live jazz and dim lights make for a very classy atmosphere.  But if I wanted to sit in the dark listening to music and looking out my window, I could've stayed home.  I went to Bandera for the food and the service and that's exactly where they fall flat.The first time I went, they lost my reservation.  Poof, gone.  It was embarrassing for me and my date.  I assume that's a rare occurrence, but that's still no excuse.  Beyond that, the service is decent but the food is bland and uninspired.  And expensive.  Chicago has a lot of classy restaurants, there's no reason to bother with Bandera."
Great food and good atmosphere. Would highly recommend if you are a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Plenty of choices for the girlfriend.
"After actually finding the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised!  Live jazz started in the evening and the food was terrific.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that my colleague got a piece of fish with bones in it.  The waitress took the plate back and then returned with the same plate saying that someone had told her that sometimes it comes with bones.  I'm no food expert but I'm pretty sure the bones should have been completely removed, especially given the price.I had the spinach and chicken enchiladas and the mixed veggies that were served as a side were very good!  I was pleased with my food.I would definitely return!"
"I really like this place.  Love the view, the food (especially the corn bread-yumm!) and the location. Decor is nice, and gives off a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere.  I recommend this place after a long day of shopping on Mich. Ave."
"This is right above Citibank, but I'd never noticed it until a coworker suggested we try going there for lunch one rainy afternoon.  It reminds me of a 1990s movie about a 1980s restaurant where a lot of mafia cats would hang out.  This place is very sleek and has TONS of cameras.  Did someone get stabbed with a fork here? Anyways, after waiting maybe 10 minutes or so, we were seated at a little booth-table, and were promptly given water and told what the specials were.  Nice touch.  I decided on the Caesar salad, which was really nice and has cornbread croutons!  This was a very pleasant surprise, although I do wish there had been anchovies in the salad also (however I know that not everyone has this in their Caesar salads). I got the fish sandwich as my main, with a side of peanut coleslaw.   Damn!  that's a good fish sandwich- and I got two types of coleslaw, which were both great! I need to find a recipe for this peanut slaw, because that was a fresh take on coleslaw that is not chock full of mayo.My coworker got a soup (I believe it was French onion) and the macho salad, which looked delicious and she was very happy with.  Definitely will have to try this on another visit.Our server came back regularly to see how we were doing, and did me a solid by wrapping my remaining fish sandwich separately from the coleslaw so it would not get soggy.Really nice, a little pricey but a great place to go for lunchtime.  Must try dinner."
"Visiting Chicago with my wife and wanted her to eat at Bandera since I use to live in Chicago and worked at the Houston's.  I have to say a lot has changed since I have left...were have the standards gone???  Once seated a server greeted us and offered to start us off with waters after waiting 5 minutes, we were ready to order drinks, they were out of 2 sauvignon blancs but the server offered the rielsing???  Maybe she did not know that my wife was ordering a dry SB not a sweet white wine..weird.  The bartender dropped off the drinks but never saw the home base server after waiting an additional 10 minutes she finally came over to greet us and go over the specials of the day...we were ready to order, so robotic, they need to work on the servers having some personally at the tables.  Another server dropped off the food but did not ask us if we needed anything else and before I could ask her for the ketchup that the home base server asked me if I wanted with my fries she was gone!!  After waiting 8 minutes I decided to ask the manager running expo who was on her cell phone, dancing in expo and kept touching her face and hair without washing her hands...btw no cell phones in the dining room but the manager can be on her phone while running expo not paying attention to the food and her floor or health code.  Just as I was getting up the server came to ask us how everything was....word of advice make sure the guest have taken a bite of their food before you ask them how everything is....just need my ketchup that you asked me if I needed, did not notice that my margarita was empty...consolidate your moves.  When she came back dropped off the ketchup and I had to grab her to get another margarita.  By now my dip is cold not worth sending back, aujus lacked flavor and had good amount of oil in it.  The fries were super greasy, broke and the bottom of the mixing bowl.  Not sure if she was new or just had too many tables.  I know they closed the Houston's here but has George lost focus of the stores outside of the west coast?So disappointing!!!"
"I have been here quit a few times in the past, but I have to admit one of the more memorable would have to be my first time with my wife and this last time. The food and atmosphere are  impeccable. We sat at one of the best tables in the house right next to the Jazz trio who played a dynamic mix of well loved tunes from the past and present. Okay, now for the food, we had the famous cornbread- in- a- skillet, along with the artichoke and spinach dip. For the entree I had the Prime Rib with fries absolutely delicious and prepared to order."
"Bandera-I have a serious bone to pick with you! In this day and age....in a restaurant of your caliber...no free birthday dessert?!!??! WTH, Bandera WTH??BOOM! There goes a star."
"I was very impressed with our meal.(New York Strip meal, Beef Ribs meal, Mac&Cheese & Caesar Salads)Everything hit the spot!We ended it with the Oreo Dessert(Thought it would have been a little bigger for the price, but good!)Will be going back very soon!"
"Came late on a Friday night, had a 30 minute wait so it wasn't too bad. I had the butternut and white cheddar enchiladas. It was excellent, I would have liked two instead of one and I didn't like the cucumber salad that accompanied. The two sauces that came with the enchilada was incredibly flavorful. My friends got the lamb sandwich and ceasar salad and we all loved the food. I tried my friends corn bread croutons, YUMMY! The menu was eclectic but all the food we had was very good.I highly recommend and would definitely come again."
"Good to see that Bandera in any city is thriving! (I was a huge fan of the LA location).Stopped in here after seeing the sign and recognizing the brand, and the scene is pretty much the same: upscale, dark interior with live music. Had a drink and my favorite tuna poke appetizer. Lots of great things on the menu; must try the spinach/artichoke dip and BBQ salmon, burger, ribs..."
"What to say . . what to say . . .about a place that was ok at best but whose rave reviews on Yelp prompted me to give it a try the other day? Bandera is one of the few chains that gets consistently good reviews regarding their food. Maybe it is different at night- but on a recent luncheon experience, it was just ok. The dark clubby atmosphere is probably more suited to dinner than lunch although I did like the way the place was laid out and the abundance of booths. We were seated by the front window overlooking the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. While this table was prime at lunch- it's close proximity to the grand piano would probably make dinner conversation a bit challenging but the view is worth it, in my opinion. Part of our experience challenge was a server who acted like he really didn't want to be there and that he was doing us a favor by even waiting on us. I also didn't like that he stood behind us to take our order- a simple two steps to stand in front of me while I asked my questions would have gone a long way. A different server may have upped this review by a whole star! We went with the appetizer special of the day (duo dips which were guacamole and con queso served with chips). It was okay but more like ""bar food"" so we left most of it. Again- thought the server might ask why we weren't eating it? Our salads were quite tasty although my friend's Macho salad was the clear winner to my ahi tuna salad. The Macho salad was basically a chopped salad with some of their great chicken tossed in and served with a vinaigrette dressing. As for me- while the presentation of the ahi tuna lined up at the edge of the plate was lovely and the tuna fresh and tasty- the greens were a bit bitter and tasteless even with all the dressing they coat it with. If you drive- parking is a bit of a challenge around here- it's Michigan Ave, after all! There is a pay lot behind it on St. Clair but know before you go it is a bit pricey (about $18 for 2 hours). And one other thing worth noting- the bathrooms at this place are as clean as I have ever seen- the word sanitized comes to mind (good to know on those days you may be wandering the Mag Mile and need a little break!) I'm going to have to give it another go at dinner one night just for the rave reviews that so many people give Bandera. I must have missed the magic of this place!"
"My friend took me here for my birthday and I had an excellent experience! We had two waitresses (one was probably in training) and anytime we needed anything, the other servers were happy to help with our requests if our waitress was busy. What great team work!This restaurant does not take reservations. Luckily we arrived at 11:30am when they open. The restaurant was pretty full by 12 noon so make sure to go before that time, otherwise you'll have to wait.We ordered the grilled artichokes for appetizer. SOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS! I had the bbq ribs with fries and my friend had a tuna salad.  The ribs were falling off the bone! And the fries were so flavorful. I dont know what makes this dish different from any other bbq ribs and fries I've previously had but it was really yummie. My friend really enjoyed her tuna salad as well.After our plates were cleared off, our waitress brought out a huge cake with a candle!!! My friend had arrived early to drop the cake off for them to store! What a great surprise!!! This restaurant offered great food and great service. I had an awesome time here!"
"I have been coming to Bandera for years for the friendly service and the delicious food.  My wife and I along with 2 friends from out of town had 7pm reservations on 10/12.  After we arrived and the table wasn't ready we had a cocktail at the bar.  We then proceeded to be seated where after ordering two appetizers for the table and another cocktail each we were CUT OFF.  We found this out after trying ordering a bottle of wine with our meal(god forbid).  We were told we were being cut off because they have a 3 drink limit per person.I have to say that I am miffed by this and Bandera has lost a LOYAL customer who brought dozens of my clients there over the years for lunch and dinner.  Bandera needs a serious lesson on how to treat customers.  There are 100's of wonderful restaurants in Chicago and Bandera should be honored and grateful that people choose their restaurant.  At any rate, the embarrassment of being cut off and the simple fact that as an adult I couldn't have ordered another drink or our bottle of wine to enjoy with dinner is unexceptionable and unprofessional.Warning to anyone considering on dining there.  The staff isn't all that friendly, if you plan on drinking at all 3 is the limit... don't forget and lastly, be prepared to be rushed out of there (which I believe is the reason they cut us off, trying to turn tables on a Friday night).Thanks for trying to ruin our evening Bandera!  We went to Gibson's and had WONDERFUL service and a memorable meal.  I WILL NEVER COME back to Bandera or recommend to anyone EVER!Anthony"
"Head up the escalator!It's unassuming from the outside but worth the trip up.I remember a drop dead gorgeous server there which only made the experience more enjoyable, that along with the live music of course!They have really good prime rib here, and the lamb was also excellent.It's a while since I've been and I've only started recently reviewing the places I have been on my US adventure.If I get the chance to visit again, I surely will as you need to go a few times to get a real feel for a place. Having said that, I do remember having good food here hence the review."
"Taking some out of town family out on a Saturday night and only waiting 45 min to get a table with a 5 top.. definitely not bad! Ah, I love sitting on Michigan avenue enjoying my chicken salad. I thought the steak sandwich with ajous was delicious, the burger was cooked to perfection (pink entirely through the middle) and the chips with spinach dip were awesome (although we had to ask for more chips). I didn't get a chance to try the burger but I heard nothing but great things about the meal from everyone. The biggest surprise of the night was the tab..  $100 for 5 people.. are you serious? I have to admit that no one actually drank alcohol at this dinner but that's still pretty darn good for downtown Michigan ave pricing"
"On a cold night when we were thrown out of our planned dinner destination because of a private party coming in, we went to Bandera.  Huge, here forever, with 272 Yelp reviews, and ignored a thousand times when I've walked by - it's a good find.Stretching across the second floor windows along the Magnificent Mile, it didn't seem very appealing from the outside.  But inside is really nice.  We were lucky enough to get a table by the front windows, with great service, a jazz trio playing nearby, and fun views of Michigan Avenue.On top of which the food was excellent.  We started with a spinach and artichoke dip, which was good because it had lots of spinach and artichoke and not too much sour cream.  The item that warrants this review, however, was the barramundi.  Barramundi is a wild SE Asian ocean fish, which used to be found in northern Australia in the summertime.  It is now farm raised and has lost much of its flavor.  Still good, similar to a sea bass, but not rare and outstanding like it used to be.  As the fish special at Bandera, this was the best barramundi I've had in years.  It had so much texture, flavor, and delicacy, it made the whole meal.  Another close your eyes and hum with each bite experience.  I'd go back for the jazz and the setting.  But first I'd be sure I'm getting one of Jim's tables - he's really an outstanding waiter, anticipating not just reacting.  And then I'd cross my fingers that the special is the barramundi.  If you like fish, it won't get any better."
"Thanks to a colleague for using Yelp to find this yummy late night dinner spot. I had the Seared Sashimi Tuna salad with mixed greens, avocado and mango. Easily the best salad I've ever had and it was so beautiful too. The color play of orangy mango and red ahi was perfection on a plate and palate. Yumski! Servers were attentive and even refreshed our cocktails with icy cold glasses."
"I don't always dine here, but when I do I prefer (wait, that sounds like a Dos Equis beer commercial) to come for a business lunch or dinner for their live music.  I was pleasantly surprised by their ribeye and enjoy their mojitos, although sometimes it is not consistant depending on who is making it.  They have live Jazz everyday of the week, starting at 6pm on the weekdays and 7pm on the weekends, which automatically gives this place another star."
"The wait for two people on a Friday night was about 30 minutes. There was no wait at the bar so we sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive regardless of her busy work load making both drinks and taking food orders.Food: Ahi tuna poke and shrimp appetizer for $17 sounds a bit steep for just an appetizer but the portions here are very generous!! The combination of shrimp, mango, avocado and ahi tuna went very well together. This was served with tortilla chips. We asked for extra chips and was given a generous amount. Rotisserie chicken was also very good. The chicken was cooked to perfection: very moist and was not too salty or too bland. It was slightly charred which gave the skin a very crunchy texture. A curry-like sauce was served underneath the chicken along with rice and parsley rice. Rice was cooked perfectly and was very fluffy. YUM! Ambiance: Dim lighting with live jazz music set the mood for a great date night with my boyfriend.Overall, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing! Will definitely come back when I'm in Chicago again!"
"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. That's all I have to say. That, and GET THE CORNBREAD!! You won't regret it."
"I am an occasional business traveler and often eat dinner alone.  I waltzed on in to Bandera without a reservation and asked to eat at the bar.  Sometimes I feel weird dining on my own but, in this case, the bartenders were friendly and attentive and made me feel very welcome.  The live jazz music is low-key enough for you to enjoy it, but also to converse freely with your dining companions (or with strangers at the bar, as in my case).  The kitchen is open, but quiet, and super-clean; I like seeing someone preparing my dinner, knowing exactly where it came from.I enjoyed a glass of Belle Glos Pinot Noir, along with the Nice Little House Salad---super-fresh veggies, goat cheese, and a deliciously tangy vinaigrette---and the veggie burger, served with a rock 'em, sock 'em roasted peanut coleslaw.  This veggie burger is the best I have ever had in a restaurant and, although I am prone to the overuse of hyperbole, I am not exaggerating in this case.  It was made of a fine combination of black beans, brown rice, oats, and a lovely blend of spices, topped with Monterey jack cheese and vegetables, and served on a tasty bun.   All other veggie burgers pale by comparison."
Nice view of the Avenue. Even a bit elegant. Incredible chicken tortilla soup. Just a bit pricy at $8 for a small bowl but I guess you are paying for that incredible view and location.
"This was a wonderful and delicious dinner to end 2011 for me and my best friend in Chicago.The pricing was a little expensive, but I feel it was quite worth it. The service was fantastic. The environment was very chic and warm. The food was just out of this world. Our server knew exactly how to sell the menu and whatever she said was true. The ribs...they melt in your mouth.I will definitely return to this restaurant."
"I've heard about this place since undergrad, but never had a chance to visit it until recently. The decor is classy with jazz music. Was able to get a table by the window to watch the people on Michigan Avenue.Service was excellent. Drinks were super strong for the $13 price tag. Never had my money's worth for a drink. The drink was so strong that  I was still working on my martini all throughout dinner. But the best part was when the waitress brought a fresh, chilled martini glass to keep it cold."
A bit of a tourist place and a bit overpriced but my meal was still very tasty. Got the rotisserie chicken which was juicy and flavorful and the cornbread which was absolutely delicious. Music was kind of loud especially cuz I was sitting near the band. Anyways somewhat classy place I would come to again but not often
"I haven't been here in years - so when a lump of cheese arrived disguised as the queso dip - I immediately regretted suggesting this spot. Then I tasted it - delicious! My fears were alayed. My girlfriend and I both ordered the rotiserrie chicken sandwich - boring, yes, delicious, oh yes. The chicken is so juicy and flavorful, the bread is fresh and compliments the chicken - and who doesn't love thin, fresh cut fries!!We ended our lunch by splitting the oreo ice cream sandwich - nothing special but hey if you have a taste for oreos-why not?It's a bit more expensive than an average American chain - but it's true - you get what you pay for!"
"The service was great (Chelsea waited on us). We got seated right away on a Wednesday evening around 5:30. Ordered a couple of their seafood dishes and loved them. Great live music started around 6:30. For a seafood appetizer, two seafood main dishes, and 4 non-alcoholic drinks, it was just over $100 after tip. Pretty good for so much seafood in downtown Chicago. Atmosphere was very relaxing with the soft jazz and dimmed lighting."
"The food here hits the spot, but I wouldn't say that it is overly wonderful. Well, except for their queso dip appetizer. It comes out cool and un-melted, which I was at first confused by. I almost flagged back the server until my friend told me that is how it is supposed to come out. Their chicken is roasted on their open flames in the kitchen. And it's absolutely delicious. It's smoky and tender. They used to have a different salad than what they do now, and it was my favorite because it had everything I like about a Southwest salad....their chicken, avocado, tangy lime dressing. The place is great placement on Michigan Ave, but it can be touristy. So, be prepared. Also, you may wait depending on the time. You can have a decent meal there, but it's not going to blow your socks off."
What a restaurant!! First thing u see when u walk in: Rottisserie chicken spinning around!!! Its amazing!! Def come here if u want quality food!! Won 2011 best burger and I still think it'sholding that title! The trout is also amazing
"This has always been one of our favorite restaurants in the City.  Service is always spot on, food is consistently delicious and the ambience is tough to beat - particularly if you can manage to get a table by the window, overlooking Michigan Avenue.Go for the burger (I know, I know) or the hacked chicken salad!"
"Yum!!I am from the south so cornbread is its own food group!! Theirs is amazing!! If you come here for any reason you must get the cornbread. I got the butternut enchiladas. I should have known better than to order mexican style food up here but I love butternut squash! The enchiladas were not the type of enchiladas I am use to but it still had a very light, fresh flavor. The entree I ordered was good but was overshadowed by the most amazing cornbread!! When you walk into the restaurant you see the cornbread preperation area and you are surrounded by the smell of cornmeal, jalapenos and cheese. I plan on going back here on one of my visits to try the entrees again to see if I can make a better choice. I would recommend this to anyone!"
"Great room. Wonderful service.  Food...not so much.  Limited and uninspired menu for a lot of money. I had the mini Caesar and the roasted chicken.  All fine, but nothing I'd come back for."
"Came here for lunch on a business trip and used Yelp review to find this place.  I wanted a quick but good lunch so I grabbed a Pot Roast sandwich.  It was pretty good.  I didn't think there was much for quick meals so if you are in a hurry, I'd say try somewhere else.  But if you want some good food, come here!I'd like to try it again if I'm out in Chicago again to try the other items"
Yummy! My bf and I dined here on our first date. My bf would suggest the prime rib sandwich and corn bread. Happy  eating !
The food here was delicious! The chicken tortia soup is to die for. The chick is insanely good. The Banan creme pie would have been delightful if the bananas were ripe. Our waitress... N_______ often left us hanging. There were times she was non-exsistant.I  will definately go back.
"This place is awesome. I've been here twice now once with some close family friends and one time with one of my good friends from college, both times have been simply exceptional.One of my favorite things about this place is the ambiance, both times I went they had a chill Jazz duo setting the mood that made you want to kick back. The two-piece band both times was pretty good and for me it's a big plus. Another thing I liked about Bandera was the wait staff, each time they were very friendly and fun to chat with and made you feel very comfortable. I should also note the staff is very knowledgeable about their dishes and not to mention their wines and beers, another plus.On to the food...By far my favorite thing is their French Dip Sandwhich. OMG is that good. The beef is so tender and cooked perfectly. The au jus is also perfect providing a good balance of flavors without overpowering the beef. I've also ordered their famous rotisserie chicken which is also amazing. Easily one of the BEST rotisserie chickens I've had.I feel like I could order anything here and not be let down. Bandera has good thing going here. I'll definitely be coming back."
"I came with 6 girl friends from high school to celebrate a birthday. We had an awesome round table near the windows and live music...awesome music and atmosphere! Our server was pretty friendly and attentive. Two of my friends started with the queso appetizer and I tried it. It was actually not good at all! I definitely recommend not trying it. Most of us ordered the Macho salad with champagne vinaigrette which was so good! Cons: I barely had avocado and seriously only one tiny crumble of goat cheese which kind of sucked. I hate complaining so I didn't say anything. Next time I go, I will be getting the ribs and cornbread skillet which I heard were both fabulous!"
"Very elegant place.  Bartenders in white dinner jackets with bow tie.  Pricey, but very good for a romantic date."
"Bandera... Pretentious because we say so... Expensive because; honestly, you expected it... Bad food because we're not in the business of earning repeat business...Throughout our trip, we typically had a very early breakfast in order to set ourselves up for an early lunch. We found that the best way to get in busy restaurants around North Michigan was to hit places at around 11:30AM; never a wait. This also allowed us to sneak in hot spots for dinner at 5:30 PM.This day, Bandera was on our list because; honestly, it looked nice, had a great location, and seemed premier for people watching on Michigan Ave. We tried the Dip Trio, Enchilada, and Prime Rib French Dip. The Dip Trio was a 12"" by 3"" plate with a pile of guacamole, chips, and ""queso"". The guacamole was typical with some corn added it, nothing special. The ""queso"" was not queso at all. It was shredded white cheddar mixed with pre-made pimento cheese. Seriously, that's it. You can even find it in the deli section of some grocery stores and purchase it by the pound (usually labeled pimento dip). In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was purchased premade from the same source that the supermarket uses. To make it worse, you only get about 10-15 chips (also not homemade) that can fit on the plate.The enchilada was just a tortilla with cheese and butternut squash and will leave you wondering why you paid nearly $20 for 30 cents in butternut squash and a quarter pound of cheese, no chicken or beef. Sides didn't help as they had no flavor and frankly after shoving giant clumps of cheese and squash in your mouth, suddenly everything becomes unappetizing. The Prime Rib Sandwich was ""cooked to order"" apparently because they asked how I would like it cooked. I chose Medium, but it came Well-Well Done (zero pink) so who knows if that is true. What is true is that the beef is sliced raw and cooked in a skillet pre-sliced. Not a prime rib portion cooked to order on the grill/griddle, rested, and THEN sliced to put on the sandwich as it should be for $19. This was obvious as all individual slices were soaked with oil making the bread soggy. Not to mention the beef was not even seasoned. It was bland and had no flavor other than the vegetable oil it was slathered in. It came with a side of french-fries that did appear hand cut. However, they were cooked in a skillet because a good portion of the fries came apart and appeared mashed; undoubtedly because they stuck to the pan. I found myself searching through the fries to find any that resembled crispiness. The majority of the fries were soggy and undercooked. If you order a soda, you get the bottle shaped can that actually has less liquid than a typical can (8.5 oz vs. 12 oz). That'll cost you $2.50 and you don't get any refills. Total bill for two: Approx. $57 before tip.Skip it."
"I've been to this place a few times and each time I've had high hopes for what I'm about to eat. It has a great location above Michigan Ave, however, I feel that the food misses the mark every time."
"The food here was great!  Went with my boyfriend for an impromptu dinner on a sunday night.  There was a bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for some drinks and had the queso dip to start.  It was not a gooey cheese like you would expect, but a cold dip served with warm tortilla chips.  The crunch of the fresh jalapeno mixed with the chilled cheddar was amazing - a great texture and different spin on Queso.The wait for our table was quite a bit longer than what we were told, but once we were seated our waitress was very sweet and not overly attentive - and the food was just amazing!  We ordered the mac & cheese, which by the time our waitress got back around to us after it had been dropped off, asked if we had not received it, but ashamed by our piggyness had to confess it was gone in about 2 minutes.  We then split the Seared Sashimi Tuna Salad which we both would have been happy had we each ordered this as our entree.  Great flavors and just the right amount of fat left on the tuna.  For our entree we split the prime rib which is HUGE and cooked perfectly, but ended up taking much of it home and having to pass on dessert seeing that we were completely stuffed.I will definitely be going back."
"Amazing restaurant tucked above Michigan Ave!  I have been to Bandera three times, and each time the food was better then the time before. If you can, try going on a Saturday or Sunday- that's when they offer their black bean chicken chili.  I seriously have dreams about this chili, it is phenomenal!  If the weekend is not an option, you still can't go wrong- the enchiladas are pretty great too!  If you are able, try and get a table by the window, it offers a great view of Michigan Ave.  The restaurant itself is cozy and the staff is very friendly."
Awesome awesome restaurant for brunch. The fish burger was amazing. It's enough food just by itself.  Two tips for the restaurants that you have to get: the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and the Oreo ice cream dessert. Must haves!!!!!!
"After several attempts to get in, we finally made it  in for lunch last Saturday. They don't take reservations so it's always a gamble. We normally have a ""plan B"" just in case. We can see why there is almost always a wait. It is excellent in every way. The menu (have the Macho salad), the servers and the decor are all first rate. The corn bread cake in the sillet is adictive. The protions seem quite large but somehow we managed to eat almost everything. We were fortunate to have a window seat looking down on busy Michigan avenue which made our lunch even more enjoyable. Can't wait to try Bandera for dinner on our next trip to Chicago. Bravo!"
So we got there with 2 young kids and was told it was an hour and a half wait-- we decided to wait.  At 2 hours we were told it was another 25 minutes!!!!  There were tables open everywhere and I was told they did not have the staff to cover it... And we would have bad service.  I said we will take the bad service just let us sit and feed the kids.... She said NO.  Hostess was rude from the minute we stepped in until the minute we left.  Only reason I wanted  to eat there was because I love Houston's restaurant and I thought it was like a Houston's.   So walked to michael Jordan's restaurant and sat in the bar area with the kids and had the best meal ever!
Nice soup of the day. Goes well with the corn bread in skillet : ]
"Wandered in after finally figuring out how to get up there to the restaurant!   A lesser man might have given up!    lol  There is a door between two shops leading to an escalator.....a small sign on the door has the restaurant name.   Location is across the hall from a new Mens Warehouse, on Michigan Avenue just north of the river.  I sat at the bar and had a very expensive domestic beer.   ($10?   Really?)  And a cornbread served in a black iron skillet that might very well be the best corn bread I have ever tasted.    Live Jazz playing during the week, and no wait for a table the night we went, but have heard that they do not take reservations and on the weekends the wait is outrageous.    Might go back.  Nothing super special.  Kind of expensive.  Nice atmosphere."
"I love this place. It's a standard with shopping with my Mom and Sis. It's also a great place to go if you have friends or family coming into town and want a laid back dinner. It's especially pretty in the winter when it's snowing outside, and jazz music is playing, and you can look out onto Michigan ave... Anyway, the food is pretty good! I usually have the barbecued salmon, or the rotisserie chicken. Both are cooked to perfection. I also LOVE their cornbread. Some of the best I've ever had."
"This place is great!! For whatever reason, it isn't on our radar that often, but whenever we do remember to visit, we're never disappointed. Two minuses:1) The place is very dim-lit and noisy. 2) The wait is forever long almost always!All the pluses:- Their veggie burger and foccacia bread are GOOD- The service is nice- The music is good too!I would definitely recommend this place - but get reservations! Vegetarian-friendly too!(Veggie Burger Type from Soy, Vegetables, Seitan, BlackBean = Black Bean [breaded])"
"The atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice, the service great, and the food awesome. I chose the ""macho salad"" which was HUGE and amazing... the cornbread croutons are things my dreams are made of. The best part of eating here was not getting the bill lol.. This place is on the expensive side so if someone else is treating I'm sure that will make you (the eater) smile."
Really good food but the steaks were basically unseasoned.
"The experience we had here was Awesome! The service was very attentive and personal. The food was great! The ambiance was warm. I had the beef ribs (5 ribs), which was a very large portion. The meat is of such great quality and so tasty. My wife had the prime rib and cesar salad. We had the grilled artichoke with Aioli (not the dip) for an appetizer. The cornbread is addictive. This place is a must if you are downtown!! The live Jazz is pretty cool too. I can't wait to come back."
"I heart Bandera. Started going to Bandera in California and was pleasantly surprised that the Bandera in Chicago maintains the same standard of cooking and freshness. The rotisserie chicken is amazing. One of my favorite things is the rotisserie chicken salad- it's simply to die for. I just love coming to Bandera late in the evening when the jazz band is playing and it's cold outside. It's the perfect spot to have a great meal with a glass of wine. You can sit and relax and look out at Michigan Avenue without being surrounded by mobs of tourists. For vegetarians- Bandera has one of the best veggie burgers ever. It's homemade, super tasty and HUGE. I'm not a vegetarian and I order this bc it tastes so good. Oh- and if anyone knows where I can get one of those awesome sugar dispensers please let me know."
"My family and I came here on a Saturday and the food was excellent. I had the veggies burger and it was so moist and tasty. the rest of my party had beef, I believe the prime rib sandwich, it was also tasty. The cornbread they give you is to die for!!!! The waitsatff and the bartender are great also."
One thing that I really enjoyed at Banderas was the live band playing in the background while everyone is enjoying their dish. The dim lighting sets the jazzy mood of the restaurant along with the music. There is never a day where there wont be any live music which I thought was a big plus on my list.Their cornbread was delicious. My friend who works as a chef at the Hyatt took me here and worships their cornbread. I'll have to agree with him. :)
"I found this restaurant through Yelp before my vacation to Chicago and saw all the great reviews. We made a reservation and had a really lovely dinner there. We started with the cucumber salad, which was unusual, but delicious. I had never seen avocados, cucmbers, olives, red onions, and goat cheese in a salad before, but it was a great combination. We also had the seattle style bbq salmon and the one of the fish specials, which was crabcakes. First of all, the portions were huge. My piece of salmon was easily two portions or more and it was cooked very well. The green rice that it came with was delicious. The crab cakes were super fresh and we loved that dish except for the creamy sauce that it was sitting in. The sauce made the dish heavy, but man were the crab cakes good. I don't even know how they got them to be in crab cake form since I didn't taste any binders like breadcrumbs. It was all sweet crab. The peanut coleslaw that the crab cakes came with was super tasty. I loved the crunch of the peanuts.I had two different drinks and my favorite was the mag mile tea. Yum! Since we weren't that hungry to begin with, we didn't get the corn bread, which I reget now and we also didn't get dessert. The service was excellent and our waitress was really personable, yet professional. The jazz in the background was perfect and completed the classy atmosphere."
"Don't let the gaudy crystal & mirrored entrance deter you--this 2nd-floor find is classy & chic. There was a jazz trio playing Miles Davis on this Sunday night, but live free jazz plays every night of the week (they say). Live jazz can be one of those things that sounds better on paper than it is in person, as the music CAN be obtrusive... But tonight it was the perfect addition to a great meal. Three of us dined, and we had the French Dip, the ""Hacked"" chicken salad, and the roasted chicken with green rice (think steamed rice with cilantro, Chipotle style, not mold). My dining companions thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and I thoroughly enjoyed stealing the hand-cut fries that came with the sandwich, and tastes of the rice & chicken with the other dish. Both were great!My salad was large enough to be filling, yet light enough so that I had room for dessert. The salad had mixed greens along with pulled rotisserie chicken pieces, corn, tortilla strips, and a light honey-lemon-peanut dressing. In general I'm not much of a salad guy... But tonight I planned on being a DESSERT guy so I wanted to be sure I had room. Anyway, I've had really bad salads before--which, for me, means way too much dressing--but this one passed the test.Initially I came in with the idea of getting the homemade Oreo ice-cream sandwich dessert, but was swayed to get a special item not on the menu -- key lime pie. I think my slice of pie constituted a full 1/4 of the entire pie, and it was fantastic. I'm a bit of a key-lime fanatic, and this pie was light as it should be. The crust contained some chopped walnuts, which wasn't my favorite, but it was very well done...especially for the Midwest. Finally, our waiter Scott was top-notch. He was pleasant & attentive, and refills ended up at the table without request just as the last drops were consumed. When we peppered him (not literally) with questions about the ingredients of 2 of the 3 dishes he answered authoritatively and without hesitation. That's the benefit of a smaller menu--the servers know it, and (presumably) the chefs can execute it with perfection. Tonight they did."
"Came here because we were quote a wait time of 2 hrs at Purple Pig. Place looks like a steakhouse, dark lighting and lots of leather seating. Started with the excellent skillet corn bread. Then ordered roast chicken, Wagyu tri-tips & enchiladas, grilled smoked salmon and bbq ribs. The chicken was tender & juicy, smoked salmon cooked just right, ribs were fork-tender, and the wagyu tri-tip was also cooked a beautiful medium rare. I didn't care much for the enchiladas which was drenched in sauce and cheese, but really liked the cucumber salad that came with it. Overall solid fare, but prices were higher than what I'd pay for these dishes. Maybe it includes upcharge for the live music or location? Service was a bit rushed. Multiple servers came to clear our plates, one even attempted when we're still eating! I get that Mich. ave has a lot of people waiting to eat during dining hours, but if I'm paying that kind of price for a meal, I expect better service."
"Bandera is the child of the Hillstone restaurant group.  I've been to a few other Hillstone restaurants, R + D Kitchen and Houston's, and I'm always impressed by the professional service staff to the thoughtful and high-quality food.  Bandera is no different than what I'm used to from its other sister restaurants.  My waiter was informed and offered solid food recommendations.  I was a little saddened that the mac & cheese was out when I arrived there at 1:30 pm on a Friday, but instead got the cornbread and focaccia plate.  Not disappointed in that choice.  It was delish.  My friend and I split Macho Salad.  Hillstone also doesn't skimp on serving sizes, so I knew it would be enough to fill me up.  The rotisserie chicken was juicy, well-seasoned and tender.  The greens were fresh.  The addition of dates, cornbread croutons, and corn was genius.  The light dressing sealed the deal.  I was in heaven.  As a side, I ordered the new england style clam chowder.  Fresh chunks of celery and clams were in every bite.  Succulent.  Too bad I'm in Dallas or else I would be at Bandera all the time!"
"After a long day of driving from Madison WI, dealing with some Family biz and then onto some shopping to alleviate some stress, we decided to drop in here @Bandera after some purchases at my all time favorite Nordstroms.The menu is short, but sweet.  The three (3) of us had a half hour wait and had a drink at the bar to pass the time along with conversation.When it was time our waitress (Stacey W., very nice I might add) told us the specials of the evening and was quite knowledgeable about the menu.  The ambiance is dark, in a light-hearted type of way, a jazz band was playing complete with piano, cowbell, and upright bass and there weren't any obnoxious people talking loudly.  Everything around us looked good so I knew what I wanted.The better half got the BBQ beef ribs, Heineken Light with the peanut coleslaw and shoestring potatoes.  I got the Prime Cheeseburger (cut into three (3) slices) with shoestring potatoes with a Pomegranate Martini. The teenager was in a funk and simply got a Sprite and the Macaroni & Cheese.  All in all a good hearty meal after our day in the Windy City; I got a cup of caffeinated coffee as we weren't staying overnight this time and it was my turn to drive back to Moo Town...We did finish the meal off by sharing a plate of delicious Banana Cream Pie.  Friggin' Yum yo'.  Mmmmmm!*Men must remove their hats when dining here.  (as they should anyhow when dining...)"
"Great place, wonderful atmosphere.I recently had the chance to dine there about 3 times in 2 weeks...the staff was well informed, the band toook requests, and the drinks were well done.I especially liked just being able to relax over a good meal and conversation while looking out over Michigan Ave.  A nice place to just remember at the end of the day why it is that you put up with all the nonsense that went on during it."
"This is again a 3 and a half star place. This place is all about location, location, location!!!This place is usually crowded - expected as its on Michigan ave and it gets a fair share of tourists. I have been here multiple times mostly for work lunches. I usually order salads, and I particularly love their Macho Salad, always fresh and consistently good. Met a friend here for drinks after work - and we had a pleasant time. The location works out perfect 'cos its really close to where I work."
Great restaurant... Make sure to get the skillet cornbread appetizer and the ribs! Nice atmosphere and great service.
"We had a late lunch here on NYE. It was really delicious. I enjoyed the ceaser salad, and my dining mates had the veggie burger, and the other hand the cheeseburger. I am not typically a fan of veggie burers but this one was pretty delicious...and the cheeseburger was AMAZING. One of the best I've had in a long time!! Nice atmosphere in the resturant too!"
"Fantastic meal.  I had the Waygu Beef enchiladas.  The enchilada had different was covered with two different sauces, I really liked the spice red sauce.  The beef was perfectly charred on the outside and pink and tender on the inside.  I highly recommend getting an order of the corn bread for the table.  Everyone I was with loved their meals.  The live music is nice touch, although its a little loud.  Highly recommended."
"I came here a while back with some friends and had a really nice time.  Since my family was in town and staying down the street, i thought it would be a good place to take them.  Well when I called to make reservations, the girl on the phone was so rude that I don't think I'd ever want to come here again. I asked if there was availability and she gave me some attitude then slammed the phone down. Really?  I get that its Friday night and the phones are busy, but I don't think its appropriate to treat potential customers with that tone."
"Fantastic place. Paloma cocktail, Macho Salad & hand cut fries w/ spicy mayonnaise was an incredible lunch combination. Not too crowded on a Saturday @ 12:30; maybe it's just enough out of the way. Definitely returning!"
"Great food at a good price, can't beat it. Being a fan of Bandera from So Cal, their recipe for success is at their Chicago location in spades. Was there on a weeknight, and our party of 4 was seated immediately with no reservations. Live music was a nice touch. Hillstone restaurant group really has their act together, as the food and service is consistently good no matter which location."
Great ambience and excellent service. The corn bread skillet and Macho salad simply delicious! The views of the magnificent mile were beautiful. The jazz band playing soft melodies was very relaxing after a crazy day a work...Definitely worth giving a 4 star rating..
"The good:- No hats allowed rule is actually neat. It extends a level of respectfulness that is being forgotten/lost at the dinner table- Make reservations if you can; it might mean the difference between a slight wait and no-wait.The better:- The food is smashing! (... I'm salivating at the thought of that succulent stake, salmon... oh!)- Make room for desert (the oreo ice cream sandwich); thank me laterThe best/bomb:- Wait-staff was very polished and professional. We were fortunate to have in my opinion, the most amazing wait-staff led by Zac(h?) - the lad knows his stuff and his suggestions were spot on.- The music... tack on the view and the lot of the place made for a truly remarkable experience.We will be back soon."
"I'm not sure the open kitchen is such a good idea because we saw some amazing unsanitary handling of food while sat at the ""bar"".  Was going to get a salad for lunch but passed after seeing how it was prepared.  The grill area, while the guy was really nice, wasn't exactly practicing good washing either.  A little over priced too.  The plus was the cool decor but more suited for night time in my opinion"
"My boyfriend and I went for the first time in December. It was AMAZING. We both got burgers (mine was the veggie burger and his the traditional.) We were both blown away by how amazing the food was. The staff was practically invisible, yet our every need was met. The view of the street was beautiful, the decor was intimate and soft, and we will definitely be going again!"
"Great!  Recommended by the hotel staff, I trucked down Michigan Avenue to this very nice establishment. I got a tip to try the French dip so that's what I went with. It was great!  Also had a mojito, hand muddled of course!  Chicken tortilla soup was probably the best I've ever had and the roasted corn on the cob with chipotle butter.....let's just say I regret getting the soup because I had no room left to finish the corn. This foodie was happy!!!!"
Excellent service and the best veggie burger I've ever had. Also try their corn bread griddle.
"Easily the most professional staff I have ever experienced at a restaurant ever. From door to door.There was a wait so we sat at the bar and had a drink, watched the graceful movements of the two bartenders who were making drinks for the whole place. It was like a dance.We began to worry that the hostess was going to assume we were staying to eat at the bar so I went to tell her we were still interested in our table. She remembered my name and marked on a piece of paper saying that I checked in, and at what time. Without looking at her watch.And then our waitress. She knew every detail of the menu--not by memorizing, but as if she had eaten her way through it bite by bite.I had the veggie burger, which as you may know is the best in the entire friggin world. It's like a big mac with the pickle lettuce and sauce, but bigger and filled with veggies. This is the only place I'll eat one.So take off your hat, listen to some live Jazz and get treated to the best service in the city."
"I could have written this review at any time over my Yelp career because, for several years, Bandera has been one of the only places in the city where I can get a decent Tom Collins.  It's practically the only place that I can ever think of when I am downtown and someone says ""Do you want to get a drink somewhere?""  And since I am rarely in that part of downtown looking for a cocktail, I always suggest Bandera, and if we go, I always order the Tom Collins.  As much as I enjoy discussing the lost art of the Tom Collins, if I had written that review, I would have precluded my opportunity to review Bandera's contribution to The Perfect Day.  So I'm glad that I never got around to it.Every once in a very, very rare while, circumstance (or Fate, if you prefer) conspires to craft for you a Perfect Day.  You may be able to help it along with a little planning, but it is out of your hands in all the important ways.  The stars align, everything clicks effortlessly into place, and a giddy, confident feeling lights you up like a Christmas tree.  It feels like powerful, unseen magic at work.To make an extremely long story extremely short, my recent visit to Bandera was part of one of those golden, faultless days.  In fact, it may have been the main highlight, or at least the climax.  Upon entering the overflowing waiting area, we were glad that we had made a reservation.  My girlfriend and I were hoping for a comfortable booth but due to the crowd were apprehensive that we would have to wait or be placed at an undesirable table.  Golden Moment #1:  within a few minutes, the hostess escorted us to...not just a booth, but THE booth--a huge wraparound number suitable for six.  We thought sympathetically for a moment about those big tourist families who walked in to quotes of ""45 minutes to an hour,"" but were not about to question our luck.  Of course we slid all the way around and met in the middle, decadently scorning all the extra space to canoodle next to each other like teenagers.Golden Moment #2:  My ladyfriend, who rarely drinks cocktails, joined me in a Tom Collins.  Still one of the best in the city.Golden Moment #3:  The menu.  So.  Many.  Mouth.  Watering.  Choices.  None of it is very fancy but it all sounded alluring.  After interrogating our gracious and helpful server Dominique, I tossed aside restraint, followed my whims (which you must always do on a Perfect Day) and ordered an appetizer, a soup, an entree with the requisite two sides, and an extra side.  Yep.  That led to Golden Moment #4:  when all the dishes had been delivered but we hadn't yet finished any of them.  I looked out over the landscape of gluttonous luxury.  We had managed to fill all the open space on that huge table without even meaning to.  Golden Moment #5:  The black bean chicken chili.  Yes, I ordered chili in the dead of Chicago summer.  I couldn't resist the description, and by God was it amazing.  Prior to that we had nibbled on a very good spinach/artichoke dip, and there was more great stuff to come, but the chili was my favorite dish of the meal.Golden Moment #6:  The barramundi special.  I don't order fish too much in restaurants but if there were more examples like this, I would.  It was very simply seasoned and grilled, yet so effing delicious.  What a lovely piece of fish, and expertly prepared.Cucumber salad...green rice...fresh corn with chili oil...the mediocre-to-good collection of side dishes passed into the background as we devoured our entrees, the barramundi and the rotisserie chicken.  I have no idea how I found room for it all, but Golden Moment #7 was looking over the table at all the empty platters, save for the chicken chili, which I was taking home.  Whew.  I sat back in the booth with an incredible feeling of contentment.  The kitchen, the hostess, the waitress, the bartender...they all had a hand in it.  It wasn't the greatest meal of my life, but it was so satisfying on all possible fronts; the evening already had that intangible magic to it, but after dinner we were practically glowing.So cheers to Bandera for several years of being a downtown oasis of class and exemplary cocktails.  And an enormous THANK YOU for your part in The Perfect Day.  We won't hold our breath for lightning to strike twice, but we will definitely be back to dine again."
"First off, the service was stellar. We had a last minute addition and they accommodated us by moving our party to bigger table with out making it a big ordeal. Secondly, the food was top-notch. You get what should be pricey food and pricey atmosphere with little cost, they even have a jazz band there kick out tunes while you eat. Lastly, the service was impeccable. Our server was on top of her game, she never made us wait too long for a cocktail  and even brought our guy who was drinking martinis a chilled glass when his drink was half full. Amazing experience. The next time I visit Chitown I'm coming back here for surez!"
"We stopped in here because it was walking distance from our hotel. We were tired from moving all day. The atmosphere was relaxed, it was nice and dark and the tables look out onto Michigan Avenue and the swarming masses of people.The artichoke appetizer was possibly the best appetizer I have ever had. Maybe it was the beer (Goose Island 312 on tap) and maybe it was my weariness but I tell you, the grilled, halved artichokes with a real remoulade sauce was perfectly simple and amazing.They have high-end entrees like whole roast chicken, fresh-cut steaks, and prime rib, but I ordered a cheeseburger because I have never even seen a $14 burger before and like high-end booze, you have to try it to see if it is really worth it. The cheeseburger almost wasn't even a cheeseburger by the time the chef got ahold of the concept. It was loaded with good stuff and served on a long chunk of fresh bread (kind of like good italian loaf bread only not too crusty to make it unmanageable) and the whole thing was worth fourteen bucks. Excellent, even.I kept thinking of that Miller High Life commercial with the fussy delivery guy complaining about 'an eleven dollar hamburger' like it had to be a ripoff. They don't sell Miller here but if they did, it would be fine with this expensive burger...but not as good as the 312 poured just right in a giant glass."
"I hadn't been to Bandera for a couple years and undoubtedly the food is still pretty good but the prices are becoming exorbitant and I was not impressed with the service on my recent visit.  To start with, it would have been nice to have a menu that shows what they are actually serving - instead when I tried to place an order for the blackened/grilled fish sandwich with peanut coleslaw from the menu I was told that ""the menu is changing"" and now the fish sandwich includes fried fish (grouper) and is served with fries.  Okay, I am a huge fan of grouper so I decided to try it out and requested their amazing peanut coleslaw instead of fries (surprisingly, this was provided without an additional charge).  It would have been nice, however, to know that the ""new"" fish sandwich lunch comes with a mountain of  coleslaw on top so now I effectively had 2 heaping sides of 2 different types of coleslaw along with a small piece of (good quality) grouper which was heavily deep fried on a huge (but good) roll that was grilled with tons of butter and overpowered the fish.  Wow, this plate along with a small (and average) side of macaroni & cheese plus a Diet Coke came to a total of $30+ for lunch after tax and tip.I still love the Bandera cornbread and peanut coleslaw (and I'm not a big coleslaw guy so that is saying a lot) and I think the key here is stick to the rotisserie chicken or a burger (which would go great on the massive bun they used for my fish sandwich).  Even so, the prices are extremely high - we're probably talking a 20% food cost which would be well below industry average of 30-35% - and if you can't even give me an accurate menu I'm not sure this is someplace I need to return.  In general, I have always expected Bandera and the related Houston's chain to provide consistently good if slightly overpriced food but these prices are starting to go overboard.  I generally try to support locally owned places and my recent visit to Bandera only reinforced this choice further.  I'd probably give it 2.5 stars overall and a promise to rarely if ever return."
"The server was excellent. Best to go here for drinks and the atmosphere, dark with booths and candles, also nice bar seating, good wine selection. The apps were delicious but entrees were limited and not worth the price."
"I love this place! I would go back all the time except for the prices!My friend and I shared the queso dip for an appetizer. It wasn't what I was expecting but super tasty anyways.For dinner we both got salads. She had the ahi tuna salad and I had some chopped chicken salad that I have been thinking about ever since! It is so yummy since they do their own rotiseree chickens there.The atmosphere in here is really upscale and nice. I love how it overlooks Michigan Ave.Also, I was really impressed by the wine list by the glass!"
"I would definitely recommend this place to tourists who are downtown looking to eat good American food at a reasonable price.  The atmosphere is kinda swanky and low lit with a nice view overlooking Michigan Avenue.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating -- and knowledgeable about the food, specials, and ready to offer up recommendations. We split the spinach and artichoke dip and I had the halibut special -- both very good, but nothing particulary inventive or mindblowing.  This place is the spot for simple American cooking downtown.  Dessert was hands down the best part of Bandera.  We shared the house-made Oreo ice cream sandwiches with creme de cocoa.  It was dreamy."
"I went to Bandera on the 4th of July. We were just walking by and decided we should stop to get something to eat and wanted to try something new and spontaneous. We went up the escalator to the second floor and were pleasantly impressed by the atmosphere. There was a live jazz band, bustling but not crowded bar, and friendly staff. I had the most incredible burger and Bandera and we sat right by the window and jazz band. Bandera has the comfiest leather dinner chairs too! I look forward to the next time I go back. Enjoy!"
"This is a great dining option for tourists and locals alike. There are few places in the city you can head to for a great meal, strong drinks and live jazz (nightly I may add). The dim lighting, big booths and friendly (slightly contrived but overall good) service all make this a solid dining option for anyone looking to enjoy dinner after a long day of shopping on the Mag Mile.Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, baked cornbreads and other traditional American favorites. Love the artichoke appetizer (decently healthy, yes?) and Macho Salad (yes, a salad can be incredibly hearty). The veggie burger has been highly rated by a number of national publications so if you're a vegetarian (or just trying to eat healthier) this is a fantastic option."
"The menu kind of gives you a little bit of everything; if you are in the mood for Mexican, they have great enchiladas, if you feel more like American, they have excellent sandwiches and salads.  I am all about their drinks because they are not stingy and their wine pours are generous, too.The last time I was in, I had a great artichoke starter along with their house salad and the fish sandwich.  Everything was fresh and served in a timely manner.  Our server's name was Zach and the next time I go back I will be sure to ask to be seated in his section.  He was extremely well-informed about the food and was great about helping us choose a wine that we liked a lot.  His service was friendly without being over-the-top and he seemed to really like doing what he was doing.I will keep going back to Bandera for the friendly and efficient service and the fresh and tasty food."
"Came here twice as a tourist. I'm a huge fan of their coleslaw and drinks. Got the veggie burger as other yelpers recommended. I expected it to be savory, but it had a hint of sweetness. It tasted like it was comprised of beans, rice, and sweet potato among other things, but all in all, it definitely was really good. Props to other yelpers!The peanut cole slaw. One of the most delicious heaps of food I've ever tasted in my life. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but the crunch of the peanuts sold me. I went back for their corn bread and fish sandwich. I subbed out the fries for broccoli. Bad idea. The broccoli wasn't cooked thoroughly, so it was a bit stringy around the stem. I tried the fries off my friend's plate - they're shoestring fries which I liked. I kept sneaking my hand over for more. The cornbread was really good. It was definitely more savory than sweet with bits of pepper. The crust was my favorite part by far. Their this and thats (aka apps) were pretty big as well. If you don't have a big appetite and wanted to conserve your money you could definitely get full off of two dishes. The decor and ambience of the restaurant was really nice - dark, wooden over tones with low lighting. I loved their round tables for five. I adored their glasses - one had an etching of a mosquito near the rim! Bathrooms - very clean. Very modern. I wouldn't expect less. The design of their stalls were pretty unique. All in all, Bandera was a really solid restaurant in a sea of really good restaurants."
First time at Bandera. Seated by the window overlooking the street. Fab! Excellent service and the food was fantastic. Try the ribs. A friend had the lamb sandie... perfect.
"The cornbread is delicious.I had to start with that because it was seriously the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.  It comes out in a little cast iron pan and it is all homemade and crispy and mmmm delicious.  The restaurant itself is dark with a lot of luscious reds on the walls and tables.  The ceiling is a bit low, but nothing that was really weird.  A great place for a group of people or a date.My family took me here for my birthday and it was really great.  The restaurant was not packed when we arrived around 6 (I guess we must eat dinner super early) and the hosts were very nice and cordial.  We were seated immediately and the service was fast.  They had a decent beer selection and a full bar (my mom ordered a martini and said it was great).  We ordered that cornbread and it was awesome.  I want to go back and just eat that.  Seriously.  I had their veggie burger for dinner and it was excellent.  They handmade the patty out of beans and various veggies and it was just the right amount of delicious.  The fries were also good and it came with a side of this neat peanut cole slaw - yummy!  My mom and boyfriend enjoyed their meals too, although exactly what they ordered escapes me now.  We skipped dessert so we could go to Pops for Champagne, but the menu looked like it had a lot of good selections.  Definitely worth a trip if you don't live in the area (like me)."
GREAT salads!!!I've only been for lunch but I really enjoyed it.  Can't wait to come back for dinner.It is hidden a bit b/c it's on the second level of a building on Michigan Ave so you don't notice it at the street level.
"Great atmosphere and music. The food, as always, top notch. The Wagyu Tri-Tip & Enchilada Platter with cucumber salad is magnificent. The prime rib sammy is also a huge favorite. The Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolate wasn't as indulgent as I had hoped for."
"BEST. ROTISSERIE CHICKEN. EVER.I'm a serial chicken-orderer at restaurants, so for me, that's saying something. I've eaten at Bandera tons of times, and this chicken seriously melts in your mouth - the seasoning is just right, the meat is tender and juicy, and oh my god... it's mildly arousing just to think about. Order the chicken - it's their specialty!The live music at night is a great touch. I love this place, and shockingly, I don't find it overly touristy despite its location on Michigan Ave - might have something to do with its second floor location.If you come here and there's a wait time, definitely stay. You can always shop at Nordstrom across the street (or La Perla next door, mmm) to pass the time!"
"*Drinks/BarHad a beer first to get things going which was refreshing but sometimes a beer is just a beer. Next had the pomegranate martini with my meal. Sweet and tart for the perfect combination.*FoodPrime rib French dip sandwich with hand cut fries was hitting the money spot for lunch. It's warm, it's filling, and yummy. What more could a girl ask for? Sometimes salt is tough one for a dish like this because of all the different palates out there but for me... it wasn't not salty enough, it wasn't too salty, it was just right for this girl. Actually forget the three little bears, I felt more like the three little pigs. It was probably enough for two meals and I ate the whole darn dish clean!*Service/AmbianceOur server, Dan was amazing. He was very attentive and it didn't hurt that he had a cute smile. He didn't know too much about the touristy spots which my friend and I were trying to ask about to plan out our day but it was nice to hear about some local hangouts. He recommended some great places to check out in Boystown which we ended up later that night. All this conversation was going on right next to the window with a  view of Magnificent Mile which is gorgeous and also filled with folks shopping and sightseeing so great for the avid people-watcher. This is right across the street from my hotel, Marriott, so it was conveniently located.*OverallProbably geared towards the tourists in town so they can charge more but the food was decent enough to be able to pull it off and the service was impeccable. Food isn't really out of the ordinary or special to Chicago so check this place out if you're looking for familiar food with a pinch of flare.Rating: 4"
Loved it! I was really surprised. I didn't think this place would be my cup of tea at all. But I was across the street and starving and decided to give it a try. I had the pork chops which is very strange because I normally hate pork. They were awesome! I really wish I could remember my servers name because he was truly one of the best servers I have ever had! It's nice and dimly lit with great live jazz in the background. Awesome bartenders topped off the night with nice wine recommendations!
"Great food, service and atmosphere. I had the grilled chicken salad - extremely tasty, especially the dressing, and I loved the shaved chicken in it. My husband had the French dip with the spicy mayonnaise for the fries. It was cooked perfectly. It was our first time in that part of Chicago and we were very impressed. We were there for lunch and the place was packed."
"We had lunch here over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised because I was able to try some new dishes that were quite scrumptious.Spinach & Artichoke Dip - This was a good appetizer for our group and I believe everyone seemed to enjoy it.Roasted Chicken with rice - Wow, I really liked this dish!  The chicken was very juicy and flavorful and I kept stealing some more from my friend who ordered it. Mac & Cheese side - This was very cheesy and tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  Bangers and Mash - The sausage was quite good, the mashed potatoes were just okay and the spinach was just average.  (A little story with this dish...The sausages are huge and my friend had a hard time finishing this dish so she kept trying to push it off to our other friends.  I then decided to tease her by saying, ""I thought you liked big sausages"" at the exact same time one of the male servers came to clear some plates...He said with a smile, ""I didn't hear anything!"" and I replied with, ""No worries, this is just how we are!""  Hmm, I think I have no shame.  :P)And of course, I and two of my other friends had the seared tuna salad and it was delicious as usual!"
"Had actually seen this place for years but finally went in as the result of a foursquare check nearby, which offered a tip from Bravo.  Wandered in around 7 on a Thursday without a reservation to find a full house with short wait for a tables.  Being alone I decided to eat at the bar and listen to some great live jazz (nightly).  Enjoyed a reasonably price glass (or two) of Viognier and ordered the Seattle-Style BBQ Salmon.  The dish comes with two of their signature sides:  Green Rice and Cucumber Salad.Food was served very quickly, which created some concern at first but the salmon was fresh and perfectly prepared.  Green rice was alright but the cucumber salad was excellent with fresh avocado and goat cheese as well as some spice to it (jalapeno?).OK, so the trio started to play some Thelonious Monk and I had one more glass of wine but this time it was accompanied by the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  When you go there... get the pie!!! Overall:  Nice atmosphere, good food and affordable considering where you are."
"Oh Bandera.. you are my favorite spot for lunch anytime I go shopping at Nordstrom. My mom found this restaurant on a shopping trip to Chicago with her girlfriends and thank goodness she did.I've been here several times for lunch and once for dinner. The menu is same for both. I usually opt for the prime rib french dip sandwich and fries, which is pricey but absolutely worth it. I've also tried the seared tuna salad with mixed greens and the hacked chicken salad. Both are yummy! My favorite side has to be the cornbread. It comes in a skillet and is addicting. Then comes dessert and I always get the oreo ice cream sandwiches. It's a perfect ending to a delicious meal."
"Be sure to look up if you're looking to dine here since Bandera is on the 2nd floor and is easy to miss.  Very professional wait staff even though our group came in wearing Giants jerseys (we were playing the Bears MNF!).  Someone even came out from the kitchen to greet us and admitted to us that he was a Giants fan!  Cheers!The food was delicious.  We shared an order of Mac n Cheese, Artichoke dip and some chili.  Everything is exactly like you imagine it to taste like... good.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken w/ cilantro rice...yummers!  The chicken was juicy, tender and fell right off the bone.  There was a little bit of a sweet honey glaze on the skin that you can't get enough of.  Again... it tasted exactly like I imagined it would... delish.  If I lived in Chicago, I might be a regular... it's that kind of restaurant."
"At Bandera, there aren't really that many options for vegetarians like me. But whatever they have is amazing. The veggie burger is among the best I've had. And their seasonal vegetables are delicious too. Their service is impeccable and I like how they won't immediately recommend the most expensive glass of wine. They'll listen to what you actually want and make a drinks recommendation accordingly. It's a nice little restaurant perfect for a date, after work drinks or even a business lunch. As you can tell, I'm a fan!"
"Southern comfort food with a Midwest flare.  I'm addicted to the macaroni & cheese (beware of the nuts fellow allergy sufferers), macho salad (mmm cornbread croutons) and spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip is my new favorite........spicy and less creamy than I've ever seen it, but divine!Great location, smack dab in the middle of the Magnificent Mile with a great view.  This place fills up around lunch time.  I often place to go orders.  Ideal for business lunches (everyone around you appears to be in a meeting...), be sure to arrive a little before noon to avoid a wait."
It's OK.  Once you have gone to a Hillstone Restaurant... They all have a similar look as well as their menus!
"First time at Bandera with very high hopes after hearing raves about the food.  Walked out a little disappointed.  It was just OK... :-( The atmosphere and service were top notch however, from the hostess to the bartender to the wait staff, just awesome!  Had a glass of wine at the bar while waiting for my dining companions, wine was good and everything was very relaxing.  We were seated at a booth, very comfy.  Scanned the menu, everything looked great.  What to get, what to get...hmm, let's do the roasted leg of lamp!  Other choices at the table were salmon, filet, and the Macho salad.  All the entrees were brought at the same it.  My lamb looked beautiful, served with mashed potatoes and escabéche (basically a veggie salad).  Everything was barely lukewarm!  I was shocked, my mashed potatoes were cold and too salty, the veggies were tasty but nothing special, the lamb was just ok, and the sauce seemed over-seasoned.  Overall, it was just ok.  I didn't try the other entrees, they looked ok but not like anything you haven't seen already.I'd probably go again if someone would really want to and would try something else off the menu.  At that price though, there are many more restaurants in Chicago to go to."
"So with all the fab new spots in the Chi, I oft times neglect my Favs! But I make up well...visited Sunday and had to come back Monday! That damn Macho salad is delicious! And yesterday I had a bite of my friends enchilada and almost passed out it was so damn good! Thumbs up & I won't 4get u again....gives me a great excuse to stroll thru Nordstrom!"
The artichoke is unvelievable.  Cant find it anywhere else but Houstons and Bandera.  Prime Rib sandwich and cornbread is great.  Only issue is that the prices are high and the place is always packed.  But that is not a problem because I love this place.Burrata is great as well when it is on the menu.
"Stopped for lunch, and the menu said ""Our Famous french Dip sandwich"". I asked the waiter why it was famous, and she said just because it was so darn good, so I ordered it. It came out on a warm flaky light bread roll, with hot shaved medium prime rib, with this awesome horseradish mayonnaise. The Au Ju was rich and thick, and very tasty...not like the watered down broth you get at other places. I strongly recommend this Chicago landmark."
"Being from Hawaii and craving AHI in Chicago might happen to you..... so this is what you do! Bandera Restaurant had a dark gloomy type of feel. As I walked into the discreteness of Michigan Avenue, up the escalator towards the darkness with smells spewing out of just amazingness, The first thing I saw when I looked into the restaurant were the pans displayed  with what looked to me like a chicken pot pie inside, my fave! I asked what were in these Delicious pans, and they all said, ""it's cornbread!"" i was laughing and then had a sudden craving for cornbread. we waited at the bar to be seated since it was around 1pm, the lunch hour for the city! And people who live in the city obviously know where to eat..........Bandera!We were seated about a half an hour later. We sat right across from the kitchen, which I love, because I love watching chefs talk and cook!I was craving Ahi, I know Ahi from Chicago, how good could it be right!? But it was great, it was amazing, I got the Seared Ahi Salad and omg, I don't remember the last time I had that great of a seared ahi salad! There were about 5 little slabs of Ahi with the salad on the side with this wonderful dressing, just insane with flavor! My cousin got the hacked chicken salad, my auntie, the macho salad, and my mom, the Cesare and everybody loved their salad, but the raw fish lovers, my cousin and my mom, chose mine as the best! It was so good I literally finished every bite, and this rarely happens, I mean I wasn't even that hungry! Crazy in Chicago, get the SEARED AHI salad from Bandera! I mean if any of us Hawaii people make it to Chicago and are craving some awesome salad!!! Seared Ahi Salad to be exact!"
"For our first night in Chicago, we made reservations here because it was pretty close to our hotel.  When we arrived, it was jam packed, there wasn't even standing room in the bar.  Glad we had a reservation, but still had to wait about 20 minutes because they were running behind.  Once seated, I so liked the ambiance--comfy booth, dimmed lighting, candles, and live jazz music.  Because many fellow yelpers as well as our server recommended the corn bread as a starter, we could 't pass it up.  Unfortunately, it was very filling so I opted for a salad for dinner, but it was no ordinary salad.  The name of the salad was ""Macho Salad.""  So with the occasional Village People lyrics interrupting my thoughts and conversation, I got to be a Macho, Macho Man for the rest of the evening.  My husband, skipped the macho, and had the steak and butternut enchilada.  I tasted the enchilada, and thought it was the best dish of the night.  I would definitely come back just for the enchilada, and the live jazz (sans the Village People)!"
This is a great date night (romantic setting) restaurant with live jazz and DARN GOOD food. Our waitress was nice and we had good service. We had to wait awhile for table but it was worth it. We had a nice cozy booth. I think you are going to wait on Friday night in Chicago regardless where you go. I would go again and recommend the dip duo (yummy0!!!
"I've experienced better on all counts...the food was not memorable, the waitstaff was nice...I just feel that if I am going to spend fifty bucks on lunch it would be better?!  Am I suppose to assume that it is expensive because of the location...I mean it should have amazing food too!  I am a fan of food and ambiance is cool...but if I had to associate a cost based on what we experienced Food was 10 bucks and 40 for sitting over Michigan Ave.  This is Chicago...you gotta bring your A game to serve food downtown...I know, I know....but, come on have something delicious for the folks that live in the area and want to entertain guests from out of town!"
"This place was unbelievable. I went her during a networking lunch and as I'd never been, I was curious to see how it would be. It is actually a great place to take clients, co-workers in from out of town, a date,  or just to treat yourself to some good ol' Americana food.I ordered the seared sashimi tuna salad and it was AMAZING. I know a salad does not sound all that exciting but it is the best salad I have ever had. The tuna was perfectly seared and the salad had this absolutely delightful dressing. I can't even think to what it exactly it would compare but I think that is a good thing, as it is testament to its uniqueness. The salad also had mango and avocado peppered throughout which really added to the overall savoriness of this salad.We had to wait longer than expected for a seat (around 1/2 hour for a lunchtime spot around noon) which was annoying and it is even more annoying that they don't take lunch time reservations. But, when we were seated the wait staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.I would definitely come back here and I definitely will as I need to get another tuna sashimi fixing before it's cold and blistery outside where I'd prefer something a bit warmer. Seeing as I've only been here once though, I do look forward to trying out other exciting delicacies on this menu."
"I don't understand how anyone could say this restaurant is 5-star worthy. We had a 9:15 reservation on a Friday night, which may have influenced the service, but I was very disappointed.We were greeted, sat down, and ordered drinks. When my boyfriend and I ordered a glass of wine, the waitress took our ids to be ""black-lighted."" I expect to be ID'd everywhere in the US, but it felt like I was ""doing something wrong"" when they needed to be taken away and inspected. Maybe they had incidents of underage drinking in the past, but I just don't think that's very classy for a restaurant to do. Ordered an appetizer - the queso and chips - and was disappointed. The queso was a refrigerator-temperature (not on accident, this is how it is served), but spicy. It was an unidentifiable orange cheese. Very mediocre. Vegetarians - stay far, far away. The veggie burger is cooked on the same burner as the beef burgers and ribs, and the vegetables are also cooked on this same burner. I ordered the macho salad without chicken, but all of their salad dressings are made from raw eggs. You would think that, as a hip, Chicago restaurant, they would have a single vegetarian-appropriate dish. They don't. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main course, and they all came within 5-10 minutes of each other. We were given our check no later than 30 minutes after we sat down. At this point, the restaurant had calmed down, so why were we so rushed to leave? To spite them, we stayed another 30 minutes. One-star service. One-star food. I would give it three stars for atmosphere, but because we were so rushed, I didn't have a proper chance to enjoy it."
"The service was a little subpar, the food was good, and having a live jazz band playing in the background while you eat your meal overlooking Michigan Avenue is AMAZING.  At the end of the day, I wasn't blown away by Bandera.While my group was waiting for our table, we noticed two bready-looking things in small pie dishes and we started speculating as to what it was.  Answer:  not chicken pot pie, but it was probably the best cornbread I've ever had in my life.  Then we went on to the main courses... I got the prime rib, which was HUGE (as in, the size of my face).  It was fine, but it tasted more like something I would get from a lower-end chain, and I was a little disappointed by the fact that it only came with the mashed potatoes and nothing else.  If I were to come here again, I would definitely go for the sashimi tuna salad, which looked wonderful.The service was kind of on-and-off.  On one hand, they were really speedy, but on the other hand sometimes our server came in the middle of a conversation and looked intensely aggravated that we didn't stop immediately to pay attention to her.  The other thing I didn't really like was the fact that they had about five specials and our server talked so quickly through them we had to ask her to repeat.  And even then I still didn't catch some of the descriptions.  The same thing happened with dessert... if you're going to have a band playing in the background, I think it would probably be a good idea to have the specials and desserts on paper.All in all, this felt like a good alternative to Grand Lux or the Cheesecake Factory, but I would not be knocking down Bandera's door anytime soon."
"While waiting for our seat i went with a classic and named it ""ode to my grandfather"" drinking bourbon manhattans,atmousphire : nice - live jazey/ classical style music.staff: friendly - waitress average,  for some reason she would only ask if I was happy with drinks, salud etc... until I asked my wife if she was good as well. food: not bad, had better in chi-town the starter: was ok, caseco dip was best, chips were alittle stayal price: not more then I accepted but pricey for what we ordered.didnt knock my socks off- over all average at best"
"Bandera is my favorite lunch destination in the city...... it's right down the street from my office and I end up here all the time. It's the perfect spot if you're looking for a change of pace and more of an upscale lunch option. Definitely a place to take clients or co-workers if you're looking for a great getaway from the daily doldrums. They are usually packed during the lunch rush, but are understanding that their business-heavy clientele need to be moved in and out quickly and the service is always spot on without making you feel rushed.I appreciate Bandera, because although it is a chain restaurant (with 4 other locations) you don't feel nearly as touristy dining here as you would with some other convenient Michigan Avenue destinations (read: Cheesecake Factory, Grand Luxe Cafe, California Pizza Kitchen). The menu has some great items... do yourself a favor and do NOT miss the seared ahi salad that comes with a tangy vinaigrette and tons of mango. Yum! For a more stick-to-your-bones meal, the rotisserie chicken (spit-fired on the premises) and pulled bbq sandwiches are fantastic.     Hint: keep your eyes peeled for their street level entrance, I almost miss it every time while struttin' away down Michi Ave."
"This is a very nice place. I really like that they have the kitchen right in the middle of the restaurant. I was very enjoyable to watch them cook our meal from our seat. I also love the jazz band that plays during dinner. They play at a perfect volume that it's not irritating.  I went with my friend and we ordered:Seared tuna- So fresh and yummyCornbread - I was sweet and savory and was served with guacamole and toast. I loved it!Cheeseburger- I normally don't order burger at fancy restaurants, but it was highly recommended so I got it and OMG is was soooo juicy and flavorful! It was server with skinny fries that were very tasty.Ribs- My friend ordered the ribs and the were huge and meaty.  It was served with a side coleslaw that was crisp and refreshing.The only problem that I had was they ran out of mac n cheese : (  Overall I was very pleased."
"Hidden gem of the Mag Mile. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. Price is moderate, but damn the chicken is mighty fine.Can't wait to go back again, been here a few times."
"Warmly lit and cozy, this was the perfect place for our late afternoon lunch during our Chicago excursion this weekend. We didn't wait long for a table, and as soon as I sat to rest my feet, I wanted to stay for more than one glass of wine. The service was impeccable despite how busy it was. I was not uber-impressed with the menu as it was very small. The waiter explained that their restaurant group tends to focus not on liquor (no shots, etc), but on the food, which surprised me because one side of the menu was food, the other side: all liquor options. Nevertheless, they had some great brews - try the Matilda ale. Yum.I had the seared tuna salad (as did my 2 friends, boring! i know!), and it was excellent. Not and overload of too much food, and the salad had mangos and avacado in it - 2 of my favorite things. I couldn't put my finger on what the dressing was in the salad, but I am sure the tuna was covered in a peanut sauce of some sort. It was warm and sweet and oh-so-tantalizing. I always think that bread should be served with meals, and it wasn't here. Bread has gotten such a bad rap and is so underrated. It would have helped to round out the meal with some sort of carb.side note: the restrooms smell like oranges and made me crave dessert."
"I love this place! The food is great, the view from the window is amazing, the decor is inviting, and the service and drinks are great.  You cannot go wrong with anything you order here, as I am certain that I have tried everything that have."
"It's always packed like a Justin Bieber concert but it's so worth it. The veggie burgers are hands down, the best in the City. I can't write enough about them--they make my heart skip a beat. The crunchy slaw served with them or the red cabbage with goat cheese salad will get your undies in a happy bunch.Aside from the obnoxiously long wait, this place is heaven on the 2nd floor of Michigan Ave. Try their cornbread and you'll be hooked. Trust me, it's addictive."
Food was delicious. Get the cornbread! Tortilla soup was also good. Great location.
"Little pricy but great drink and food. Fast friendly service and cool,atmosphere."
"I don't necessarily expect the most out of restaurants on Michigan Ave as they tend to cater to the tourist crowd, but Bandera makes an effort to provide more interesting choices that just your chicken Caesar salads and burgers.  I was surprised to see how small the lunch menu was.  I don't need to have a menu thicker than a children's book, but a menu with more than 10 options would be nice.  I decided on the rotisserie chicken sandwich.  Instead of the standard lettuce, tomato and mayo, it was accompanied by arugula, tomato, red onion and an au jus sauce. Nice.  Also ordered at my table were a few of the salads that were chock-full of yummy things like cheese, avocado, nuts and vinaigrettes.  Make sure to order the corn bread for an appetizer.  It was out of this world.The service was much better than I expected.  Our server was pleasant without being overly chatty and she kept my diet Coke full throughout the meal.  Now for the bummer.... they don't take reservations (at least not for lunch) so we had a lengthy wait of about 25 minutes... an automatic 1 star deduction in my book.  Not a big deal for a normal meal, but when you are entertaining clients, you really want to get in, out, and be on your way!"
"I always assumed that Bandera was a touristy restaurant a la ""Cheesecake Factory"" or ""Grand Luxe Cafe."" I finally gave it a try after learning that it was a Hillstone restaurant and had a nearly identical menu as Rutherford Grill in California. Bandera is great. I'm so glad that I gave it a try. Their wine list kicks ass, their prime rib French dip is divine, and the atmosphere is cozy. It makes me feel like I'm honeymooning back in Napa Valley. I've eaten there three times now and it's never disappointed."
"I've been to Bandera many times, but this last time was awful.  My waitress did not care at all.  She never brought water, ruined orders, and never apologized.  When I'm ordering a bottle of wine and prime rib, I'm expecting half decent service. I used to really like Bandera.  They are one of the few restaurants in Chicago that cooks prime rib to my specifications (bloody).  However, it's a little over priced for what you get.  At a place like this, I better be receiving better service.  I'm not sure if I'll ever go back.  There's a bad taste in my mouth. They better do a Groupon to win back my good graces."
"This was a nice option off michigan.  I ordred the blackened fish sandwich which was well seasoned and came on a nice bun.  It came with a side of coleslaw which also had a nice kick to it.  The service and atmosphere were nice as well.  The place was a bit pricey, but we were on an expense account so didnt care much.This place is definitely a solid option--wont win an award but likely wont disappoint."
"You know? This restaurant has become very hit or miss for me with the cornbread, but everything else is always delicious. I've been here 4 times already. Twice the cornbread was delicious, but the most recent 2 times, it was pretty dry, and last night it was kind of cold and so dry that I finally just sent it back and ordered something else. Maybe it was because of the time of night that we went last night. We got there a little after 9,but it wasn't good at all. Other than that, I've had every appetizer on the list and they are all sooooo yummy! The burgers are always so darn good for some reason, and I generally order fish if I get an entree, and I must say, I really enjoy it. My favorite, which is unusual for me, is the coleslaw! I hate coleslaw in every way, but their coleslaw is so delicious with the fresh kale and peanuts...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! But everything from the fries to the coleslaw to the salads, burgers, entrees & drinks are really consistently good. So what's up with the cornbread Bandera?? All I want sometimes is delicious cornbread that I can't get from the south anymore, and you're it, so you MUST keep it consistent."
"Really, really not that good!?   A friend had recommended Fronterra and I got confused!? At any rate, the salad was only mediocre.  Their signature cornbread was not very good, at all!!   Seemed as if the batter was not well mixed...too much cornmeal in some parts, and not enough in others. Their other signature dish is the roasted chicken...I could not tell the difference from Boston Market...only that the meal was twice the price!? Really a disappointment!!"
"Excellent food.  I'm from the Pacific NW, where salmon is be-all and end-all of food.  (Slight exaggeration.)  But Bandera's salmon was outstanding: flaky, full of flavor, and very fresh tasting.  The meal, which came with a dinner salad and mashed potatoes and a veggie, cost in the high $20s.....not bad.  Cool ambience.  Our waitress was wonderful: very friendly, very professional, very courteous.  For dessert, definitely have the carrot cake.  Wish my city had a Bandera's.  It's outstanding!"
"I am on a 5 star roll as of late.  This place is swank, hip, cool and any other sweet adjective you want to use.  When I saw the huge oven roasting about 100 chickens I knew this place was for me.The restaurant is beautiful, nice and dark so you can't really see my ugly mug.  I love the live jazz although I would think the couple tables around the band would be a bit loud.  We were seated overlooking Michigan avenue, probably the best seat in the house.  I would recommend getting a window seat if possible.  Service was outstanding and our waiter knew his shit.I started with the Small Caesar Salad which I really liked.  The dressing hint a nice hint of anchovies and the corn bread croutons blew my mind.  What do you think I had for my main dish??!?  Yep, I had the chicken what an adventurous fuck I am.  I don't care what you think of me this is some seriously good bird.  Tender, juicy and complimented with delicious Spanish rice I was in poultry heaven.  They have an extensive wine list, so of course I had to have me a couple glasses.  A little Incognito for that ass.  Great wine and great food what could be better.In conclusion I think you should just go here, stop reading my horrible reviews and just GO!"
"I walked by Bandera about four times before I finally realized where it was. It's upstairs. Look up. Yup, there. Oh hai. I went hear for a very special Valentine's Day dinner. . . with three of my girlfriends. So romantic. But actually, it is a pretty romantic little date place. It's certainly a nice change of pace from the typical Michigan Ave restaurant, Grand Cafe, Cheesecake Factory, etc. They are apparently pretty famous for their chicken, while I went with the classic burger the friends who did get chicken really seemed to enjoy it. My burger was good, they make this long patty and then cut it into three smaller burgers. There's some kind of BBQ sauce on the bun that is pretty amazing. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm a fry connoisseur. A fry elitist. A fry jerk. Their fries were fine, nothing of note. Booyah, take that. I'd recommend for a Michigan Avenue dining experience."
"I came to Bandera to celebrate my birthday last week and once seeing the outside I knew it had to be good. I was right.My boyfriend and I had been wanting to come and check it out and when we did we were not dissapointed.The food was so delicious [bbq beef ribs was my plate] it was savory and the portion just right. The prices were reasonable. We were pleased for when you walk in you'd think it will be pricey. Service was good,very polite. I will definetly come back.P.s- We sat by the window looking out to Michigan Ave and infront of the band. A must for a romantic night out."
"I took my husband here for a little anniversary dinner before a concert. We started with the queso and chips, which was very good. The chips were warm which was a nice touch. I ordered a Mag Mile drink, lemonade, vodka with some acai berry something in it. Husband had the margarita (sneaky sneaky that one!). Dinner, I had the ribs. Oh My Gosh. Amazing. So good, my husband was sneaking bites from mine! The fries were also really yummy, like shoestring width. My husband had the rotisserie chicken which is why this is a 4 star and not 5...the skin was thick and soft and not SUPER flavorful but the chicken itself was really good. I think it's a bit overprice but it is on MI Ave, so what do you expect. We got what we expected and I would bet later in the evening, it could be a really romantic spot in a busy location. Would go to again!"
"Need a break from your shopping extravaganza down the Mag Mile? This is the spot - so that's exactly what I did on an indian summer afternoon in early November. I have been here a handful of times and always order the macho salad. It has mucho ingredients that compliment each other very well and it's chopped making it very easy to eat. Greens, cabbage, dates, goat cheese, fresh corn, roasted almonds, rotisserie chicken, avocado, cornbread croutons, chopped tomatoes and a light yet creamy & delicious lemony vinaigrette. I really love the ingredients but for the price (17.00) I would like to see some more of them and less of the lettuce and cabbage. I think there was one cube of avocado in the whole salad. And I LOVE avocado. I would deduct a half star for this. The atmosphere is great for a date due to the soft flattering lighting. It's very soft and dark.. so much so that I felt like a nap after my salad and glass of sparkling wine (10.00).  It's a beautiful place when the lights are going on the Ave for the holidays if you can score a seat by the window. P.S. The cornbread which is served in a cast iron little skillet is the bomb!"
"I liked the handsome, dimly lit interior and quick service.  The veggie burger was daunting enough to eat open face with a fork and knife and my diet coke was never empty.  Great for business lunches! Quick tip - try the coleslaw!"
My only reason for writing a review is that a yelper here said they def. woudl not be back but gave it 3 stars. 3 stars is supposed to be a-ok. See the issue mr. yelper? Come on people STOP OVERRATING in general.. place is a-ok. that's it -no more no less. Now stop it.
"This used to be a favorite of mine & my ex.  Can't beat the location right on busy Michigan Avenue & Ohio (so think  again if you think you'll find parking).  It's definitely one of those restaurants where you can barely see the menu in front of you so get ready for some ridiculous mood lighting.  They've got live jazz on the weekends too.They serve a great BBQ grilled salmon, crisp and carmelized on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside.  They've also got an awesome roasted chicken.  Their cornbread is to die for.  Not much of a beer selection."
"Bandera succeeds where most chains fail. The food always tastes fresh and retains much of the soulfulness inherent in the South American cuisine it emulates. The menu is characterized as American, but many of the specialities here have South American influences. The decor and service consistently exceed the expectations of what one would expect from a chain. That being said, you can easily spend $50 a person here. Bandera is owned by the same group that owns and operates Houston's. And if you have ever dined at Houston's, then you should know what to expect: very good American food, fine art displays, impeccably clean washrooms, and friendly service. I recommend the following staples: The Bandera Style roasted chicken- they marinate whole birds and roast them on a spit rotisserie-style - incredibly succulent Beef BBQ ribs with fresh coleslaw and fries- this is a signature dish. You haven't tasted coleslaw until you've tasted coleslaw here. Insanely visceral rush of fresh textures and herb flavors. Fresh corn bread- comes in a cool iron cast skillet. It's enough to feed 6 people. The rest of the menu is respectable, but I would stick to these recommendations. Request a table overlooking Michigan Ave which is beautiful at night."
"I love the food here!  Great ambiance and music to start.  The grilled artichoke appetizer is the best I've had around the country.  The cornbread has hints of smoked jalapenos, corn, cheese - I don't know what's in it but it melts on your mouth!  It's worth the calorie splurge.  I always order the smoked salmon and they always accommodate my picky food requests.  This time I had the Mediterranean sea bass.  Absolutely delicious.  The downer is that service has been hot & cold.  This visit the waitress was a train wreck.  Both visits before that it took the bar AGES to get drinks.  Once it was so long the meal was half over.  Thankfully the food and environment outweigh the unpredictable service!  I can't wait to try the desserts..."
"Bandera Restaurant is a solid place to eat on Michigan Ave, offering decent value, comfy decor, and great taste!  I was here with a group of friends during memorial day weekend.  We had just finished with our architectural tour on the river, and wanted to grab some lunch.  We decided to come here because our buddy Don S. heard it was good.  Well, he heard right.  I had the Back beef ribs at the recommendation of our server.  The ribs were in fact fantastic.  It was one of 'em meat falling off of the bone type tenderness.  The seasoning was just right, with the right tang and smoky flavor.  Another guy had the Prime rib Au jus, and was very satisfied as well.  Also, they served cold beers, which is a huge plus on a warm humid day in Chicago!I recommend Bandera for when you want a nice meal with price points in the mid-teens to low twenty's."
"In 2002, Bandera was my first dinner in Chicago....and quickly became my 5 star rating standard. I must have come here 8 or 9 times that year. Service, dinner rotisserie chicken sandwich, red wine selection, live jazz - it was well worth the wait. The wait staff were friendly, professional, and took their time. It's 2011. It is still good and the ambiance is excellent. But the past 2 meals I've had showed a definite decline in service and a menu that no longer blows me away. Bandera knows that it will be packed full of people throughout the weekend - and it shows. Servers are simply there to serve and rush around the restaurant. Food is there to be eaten and is fine. In fact, the food is comfort and tasty. But I miss the relaxed and professional energy of the staff and the incredible art in the food.End of the day: Bandera is a good restaurant if you are on Michigan Avenue, but not worth the wait or the rush."
"although i used to live in chicago, i never ventured to bandera.... until this past weekend as a tourist. At 6 pm on a friday, it was packed- i waited 15 minutes for a table for one.I loved the atmosphere, loud yet relaxing- dark enough- and just a vibrancy i cant explain.My server, Dominique was fantastic and super friendly- I settled on a light dinner, the Macho Salad and an enchilada a la carte.The salad was FANTASTIC- (?partially because i was famished) although for $17 they could have been more generous with the avocado and goat cheese and overall portion-size. I honestly don't think i've ever paid that much for a salad. Anyways, the spinach and enchilada was so perfect, completely hit the spot- and i'm craving it just 24 hours later. 4 stars for food, friendliness and great vibe- but i'll have to knock it down to 3 for the stinginess of ingredients in the salad."
"Recently moved back to Chicago, and I knew one of my first ""to do"" items would be to go to Bandera. It's a bit of a hidden jewel along Michigan Avenue, but the ambiance is great; many nights there is live music (small jazz band or piano). My favorite item there is the Macho salad which is like a Cobb salad with their well-known roasted chicken. Lovely staff, great food....so good to be back!"
"My wife and I had heard that the food is good here, but we hadn't had a chance to go to Bandera until recently.  I have to say this place is really, really good!Here is what we ordered:Starter: Spinach & Artichoke DipStarter: 2 slices of cornbread (they are known for it)Entree: BBQ Beef RibsEntree: Spinach & Chicken EnchiladasEverything we ordered was excellent.  The only regret we had was that we didn't have enough room for dessert afterward.The cornbread is not like any cornbread I've had before.  It's very moist and fluffy, and has what tasted like bell pepers and onions in it.  I think I may get one of those just to have with some eggs in the morning one day.Both entrees were really good.  The BBQ ribs were falling off the bone tender, and the enchiladas were very good with just the right amount of kick.We definitely look forward to eating here again.. and hopefully this time we'll get dessert!"
"Birthday lunch with m'girls required a carefully positioned restaurant with proximity to the shopping I was about to do, the Apple store and public trans. Bandera has been a topic of conversation amongst my co-workers lately, so it fit the bill. We arrived on a busy Monday incomplete, so we waited for our third and were seated just a few minutes later in a lovely half-moon booth. Our server was attentive, friendly and informative and after our drinks were ordered, we decided on entrees and settled in.The roasted chicken sandwich looked hearty and delicious, and the tuna salad was lovely on a plate. Being that I am a meat-and-potatoes girl, I went for the bangers and mash. Unfortunately, my eyes were a little too big for my stomach and the portion generous. The local sausages were savory, the potatoes were decent and the steamed greens were good but overall, I felt the entire dish was a little too salty. There was no gravy or sauce, and with just a small bit of brown mustard to dip the bangers into, was just all a bit too dry for me. This was my second time at Bandera and I haven't quite discovered why some folks in my life love it so much. I'll give it another shot eventually, but for now it's not on the go-to list."
"My family found Bandera years ago right after they opened on Michigan. We love, love, love going here.   Service is impeccable.  Everything is delicious. Live music is wonderful ambience.  Drinks are fantastic.  Great place for a romantic dinner or a girls night out dinner. Musts...MargaritaFrench martini Window table (ask when you make a reservation)Duo dip with the best guac and the very best cold queso dipRotisserie/roasted chicken Macho saladEnchiladasOut of this world veggie burgerBanana cream pie"
"The cornbread is the first thing you need to know about. It comes out to you in a skillet and all crusty and crunchy on top. once the exterior is broken, the cornbread is soft and buttery and melty. There's nothing but flavor in it, the best cornbread I ever had. I was there for lunch, so i can tell you their veggie burger was constructed by someone who knows that 9 times out of 10, other restaurants serve a cardboard stand in of a MorningStar patty....ooor the Morningstar patty itself. I LOVED this veggie burger. it had nice robust flavors and a meaty quality. It was served with this awesome slaw which I would give 5 stars if the hand wasn't so heavy with the cilantro. My coworker had a salad. It made me jealous. They do salad in that ultra find chop with a busy assortment of delicious. I can't speak for dinner service, but lunch was great. We sat at the bar, as the wait for a table was 30 minutes, but the bar service was fantastic and friendly. When you go, order a cornbread...just for yourself. Don't share it. Sure, you'll be known as a selfish hog, but you'll want to eat it all yourself."
"great everything!Been living here for 7 years always saw it never tried it..until today.we had the chicken, the house salad, and the brocoli.  All FantasticOn the sad to say its bland side was the mac n cheese!  It looks amazing but its not really ""cheesey""...  the cheese was way to mild, no gooey cheesey goodness, more like a sauce...a bland white sauce.  maybe throw some velveeta or cheez whiz in that..The banana dessert was good but not amazing, a tad bland.  maybe some sanders hot carmel?   sweeten it up a bit....But the fantastic chicken and salads and service and drinks will have us back soon."
This is a chain. It's owned by Hillstone the same folks that own Houston's.  Upscale good food but when I travel to other cities I want local.
"My coworker and I spent the only free day we'd have during 3-day conference on the Magnificent Mile shopping.  Between Grand Lux and Bandera, we picked Bandera soley because it had 1 more half star on Yelp and the overall more favourable comments.Although the lunch menu is not extensive, it covers most of the items someone would expect in an American restaurant.  I had roasted chicken with green rice.  The portion of the chicken was about 1/4 of a chicken and the pieces were tender and juicy although I did request for all dark meat.  The rice was delicious.  It was not green as the menu may suggest but is sprinkled with cilantro which added a wonderfully fragrant flavour to the rice.It was a great stop for us to refuel before we went back outside to do more damage to our wallets."
"Great cornbread and salads - the restaurant is a little difficult to find, but one of the better restaurants on Michigan Avenue"
"I suppose this is just reiteration of the already known, but Bandera is pretty great!I'm a fan of the open kitchen and rotisserie items right up front - kind of makes you feel more at home.  And the live jazz adds a nice touch!  It wasn't too loud, wasn't too soft, pretty much at a perfect volume to enjoy the music and the company of friends.Food was delicious!  I got the pork chops.  Kinda ironic, but the pork chops are 'limited availability' according to the menu, but my friend tried to order lamb chops and the prime rib, and they were both not available!  He ended up with the steak filet, which looked quite yummy indeed.  Anyway, back to the pork chops.. the portion size was humongous!  Two huge slices (?) of pork chops - I had my friends split one of them for tasting, and had just one for myself.  Nonetheless, I was still more than full after I finished the dish, but wow, they were so yummy and the apricot glaze went with it perfectly.  I'd definitely recommend.  My other friends got the ribs and fish special of the night, which were just as good.Oh!  And also definitely order the tuna poke appetizer, we all really enjoyed it.  Well, it has some of my favorite things - tuna sashimi, mango, avocado, shrimps.. Anyway, the food is a little pricey, but worth it for the ambiance, location, service, and good times."
"I am going to make a very bold statement: the best veggie burger I have ever had. In fact, I had never eaten a veggie burger before I came here a couple years ago because I am a meat eater. And the idea of opting for veggie instead of beef or turkey was just plain ludicrous to me. However many people had told me, ""You HAVE to order the veggie burger!"" So I did and it pretty much changed my life. I now order them everywhere I go and even make them at home at least once a week...so thank you Bandera. Let me also gush a little about their peanut coleslaw concoction. I was never a huge fan of coleslaw because it's usually a little bit of cabbage in a bowl of mayo. Once again, Bandera proved me wrong. Their's is light, made with more of a vinaigrette with chunks of peanuts that, trust me here, tastes amazing. I also recently tried their in house made oreo ice cream sandwich and it was phenomenal. Two big sandwiches in a pool of chocolate with a generous portion of whip cream on top. Oh lordy, this place fills me up. Definitely do not go here if you are looking for a ""light lunch"", I often fall into a food coma afterwards, but it is SO worth it. Great place for a nicer lunch, after work dinner, or date...especially in the colder months because this place has a very warm and cozy feel to it."
"Snobby Service.  Four stars for food (the cornbread and macho salad are tops) but service is condescending and ineffective.  It was about 50 degrees in the restaurant and we asked to move to another table (it was not crowded) and were told no. We were repeatedly told that they were lowering the a/c blowers and to just ""wait a few minutes"".  After three requests, we gave up.   Ruined our experience.  Sorry, Bandera.  You could do a lot better."
"We had a great time here tonight.  Sat at the ""Chef's table"".   Solid wines.  Great chicken salad.  Yummy sandwich.   Terrific atmosphere.  Dark wood.  Nice live Jazz.  Packed on a wednesday.  Best was the service.   Great recommendations, professional.   Very fun.  Kristy/Christy, nice work."
"I read that Bandera was owned by Hillstone Restaurant Group. They also own Houston's restaurants which are 4star-worthy. Bandera was disappointing though.The hostess was a bit sullen and a bit too abrupt. Our waitress was nice but not too fun or friendly though she was knowledgeable.We started out with the grilled artichokes and they were phenomenal. I ordered the halibut special which was overcooked and therefor dry and difficult to chew. My GF's enchilada was very mild and bland. My friends salad was flavorless. BUT my other friend's burger was delicious but $14. The fries are amazing. I liked that when we ordered fries, we were asked if we'd like ketchup, mustard, or mayo.This may sound like a 3-star review but our waitress never checked back with us to see how our food was - a peeve of mine. I had to flag down a manager to tell him about the halibut and my friend's salad. He took it off the bill without argument. I got a caesar salad instead which was quite tasty. If I return, I'd sit at the bar for fries and artichokes.FYI: groups of seven or more will be divided."
"My sister and some of her friends (well, three of her friends, because they ""couldn't seat 6 people"" at any point tonight, for some reason...even though it's a Tuesday) came here tonight for my sister's birthday dinner. She turned 22 today. I would generally not recommend taking a group of fresh college graduates here, as it costs a bit more than a TGI Friday's (not ridiculous, but when it's a birthday and drinks are $10+ a pop, it adds up...especially when people in your group suddenly realize they are cashless). Also, I would not recommend coming here if you live in Chicago and are bringing other people from Chicago. It's a little touristy (Michigan Ave. and all), and a little too hard to get into for what it offers. However, it is a great place to bring out of towners who want to feel like they ate at a ""nice Chicago restaurant"" with a cool view of the city. The menu is limited, but the wine list is good. The mixed drinks (especially martinis) are also very good. Everyone seemed pleased with their food, including myself (I had the French dip), and the service was quick and friendly. Not an overall bad place, but not sure I'd jump into the five-star hype too quickly. I'd put this restaurant on par with something like The Rainforest Cafe, minus the jungle crap and being good for kids thing: A limited menu that is slightly overpriced for some of the choices, highly saturated with tourists, but nicely laid out, in an area out of town guests will love to talk to friends about when they get home. Personally, if I had to head downtown for a meal...I'd stick with Cheesecake Factory. Similar price range, cooler ambience, hella more of a selection across the board."
"Wonderful food and elegant atmosphere, just what we needed as a break from boosting the Chicago shopping!"
"the reason(s) why i'm not giving this restaurant four stars is because 1) the waitress never gave us ice in our glass of water with a lemon 2) no straws were given.. as if we were supposed to drink out of the cup with a big lemon floating atop that covers the whole open portion of the glass 3) a lady in a scarf with a blue suit-like uniform dropped off our cornbread and didn't cut it up for us (they usually cut up the cornbread and serve it to each person).reasons why i would still come back to bandera is only because of the cornbread skillet and everything on the somewhat limited lunch menu is always incredibly satisfying. over the weekend, i had the macho salad. robust, flavorful, nutty, sweet, and fresh! my sister had the veggie burger with cole slaw. this was very good too. the cole slaw was smothered in a vinegarette dressing and the burger was just so juicy!!parking? what parking? there is no street parking. if you can, take public transportation because the garage fees in the city is such a rip off! we took public transportation. :)the restaurant is always kept so clean and classy. the view is spectacular and if you request for a window seat, they always try to accomodate you to the best view. the meal between my sister and i was ~$45 (not including tip) which isn't bad for downtown dining."
I loved everything about my visit to Bandera.  The service was spot on and had great recommendations!  The chicken was excellent but the winner were the beef ribs.  Hands. Down.  There were four of us and we had 2 bottles of wine over a leisurely hour and a half dinner.  The food was yummy with a capital Y.  The place gets busy and crowded and can be kind of noisy so maybe not a spot for an intimate dinner.  But several friends and some good convo and food - definitely make a reservation here!
"I really like the food here, for lunch or dinner. Its good without being too pretentious. I like that. I can go shop grab a bite watch the game and I'm happy. I only give it 3 because the drinks are kinda watered down. I don't like that. Oh, And the fish is great."
"I am definitely a fan of this place.  I started going here before I lived in Chicago, when I was here for a conference.  Bandera has never disappointed.  Of course, I have never tried for a table. We always sit at the bar for drinks and snacks and sometimes dinner.  The margaritas are yummy and the french fries and grilled artichokes are so good.  Great place to stop if you are downtown!"
"The first time I came here was with a group of 6 people for my aunt's birthday on a weekday. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait about 30 minutes (there weren't many large tables available and apparently there was a group of women enjoying themselves and staying longer than expected!). The staff gave us complimentary corn bread as soon as we sat down since we had to wait a little while. The menu is pretty heavy on the meat, and I didn't feel like ordering flesh that night so I got the veggie burger. I was not expecting anything special, but this was possibly the best veggie burger I've ever had. (The only one I could compare it to is at a restaurant called North Star in Columbus, OH -- the two burgers may be tied. And I have eaten a LOT of veggie burgers (and meat burgers) in my life). The veggie burger was $15 and came with an interesting (and tasty) peanut coleslaw. The veggie burger was enormous (if I didn't share it with other people I probably could have cut it in half and saved some for lunch the next day). Due to the size and deliciousness of the burger and the fact that dinner was accompanied by live jazz, I feel that my money was well spent. Most of the other items on the menu are out of my price range, but I went back on a Sunday night (so I could get another veggie burger!) with my boyfriend. We were seated immediately. Our food came almost too quickly because we hardly had any time to sip on our drinks before they brought our plates out. My boyfriend shared a few bites of his prime rib with me, and it was cooked to perfection.  It came with gravy, mashed potatoes, and a rich sour cream. For the second time, the veggie burger did not disappoint. I will be back again for sure."
"I've been to the one in West LA numerous times with a great buddy of mine! The ribs and Mac  Cheese are divine! This one, is on Michigan Ave, vs. Wilshire Blvd., and has a funny way of getting up to it. Once there, you are in the dark, clean, fun Bandera atmosphere. This was after a long Sat. involving a road trip to Notre Dame AND a Halloween costume party back in Chicago, so bloodys and food was in order. The bloodys were nice and spicy and the tuna poke with shrimp, avocado and chips more than got the job done! You really can't go wrong here! And, at the West LA joint, it is a solid, young professional vibe with live music!"
"Sorry, but I just don't get it. This seems like it has the potential to be a great restaurant. It overlooks Mag Mile. It has a very subdued atmosphere set away from the tourists, but there is nothing on the menu that is deserving of its price.I brought a date here, and merely ordered a mini appetizer and a Grolsch. My tab alone was over $15. That's insane. And the waitress, who was very attentive, recommended the corn muffins, so I had those. It was no different than a Jiffy Corn muffin you'd get a mix for $0.50 at your local grocery store. I understand some people love this place (including my date, so I guess it wasn't all for naught), but I just don't get it."
Hands down the best veggie burger around!
"So happy we found this gem of a restaurant tucked among the shops on Michigan Ave. After a morning of travel, we were in need of sustenance to fuel our wilting tourist bodies. While we spent a bit more than we were expecting, it was placated by the scrumptious food and easy service.I had the macho salad, while the bf ordered the burger. My salad was gigantic, which I assume is why they call it macho because the ingredients were not terribly masculine: grilled chicken, lettuce, avocado, dates, almonds, goat cheese, and corn bread pieces stocked my bowl. In fact, I thought there might have been one too many components but I was too hungry to care.The burger was also giant, and also freaking good. If you eat your burger for the beef, you will love this one. It was seasoned perfectly, and served on something other than a bun (baguette? hoagie?). The fries were cut small, and were crispy and addictive.The best part about this restaurant were the views. The whole front of the room is lined with glass windows overlooking Michigan Ave. If there's a table open in the front, make sure you request it!"
"My girlfriends and I had dinner here last night.  Here are the positives and the negatives of the experience:The Good:Great live jazz band.  But don't sit too close or you'll be screaming at each other.Comfortable seating, dark, candlelit (kind of romantic casual)Great views of Michigan Avenue.The Bad:There was a 45 minute wait.  When I went up to inquire about our status, she couldn't find our request card.  After fumbling with some papers, she said ""oh, it'll just be any second now.  That turned into 10  more minutes.Our waitress forgot our appetizer, came back and said - ""oh i'm so sorry, it just got lost in the kitchen.""  Which translates to ""oh, I forgot to put the order in.""Our waitress could not tell us about the various wines on the menu.  Her response to our question about two Pinot Noirs... ""oh, they're pretty much the same.""I got the pan seared rare ahi tuna salad.  It was just ok.  Nothing special.  One of my girlfriends got the pork chops and my other girlfriend got the rotisserie chicken with rice.  They enjoyed it.  The chicken actually looked really good.I might come here for the atmosphere after shopping all day.  I'm sure the views are beautiful during the holidays."
I've been a couple times for lunch and on dates.  Great atmosphere and ambiance and the food is undeniably delicious.  The staff may be hit or miss.  While some are quite friendly others may come off a little snobby though not overtly offensive.  They have live local jazz musicians from 6:30 til 9:30 daily: adding a little Chicago culture to the overall dining experience.  Recommended.
"Had the Macho salad and it was very good and hearty. I liked the layout and it was trendy and quiet. I don't see myself going back simply because I don't go to MI ave often. Service was ok, it could have been a little better - maybe they thought we were tourists?"
I like this place a lot. I wont go into too much detail but I will give you a few highlights.1. The cornbread is really good. You can get a skillet for the table. (or for yourself)2. Order off the menu. There use to be an item called the Cluck and Moo (or moo and cluck-doesn't matter)Its half a rack of ribs and half a bbq chicken. Its pretty darn good.You're welcome! heh heh
"Cabbage. Not something that most people would think is capable of melting in your mouth with sweet and savory goodness. But let me tell you, this place makes the most amazing red cabbage -- and if they can do that to cabbage then they can do AMAZING things with everything else on their menu. Romantic. Intimate. Cozy. Relaxed. Hip. Excellent service. Beautiful ambiance. Amazing lighting. And absolutely incredible food."
"It was the last day on our trip, and we had eaten at all of our ""bookmarked"" restaurants on Yelp. We were too hungry and tired to go searching and walking to another place beyond a city block. We walked down Michigan Ave, about a block from our hotel, and it hit us like a big red sign. This place is the same owners of Houston's, with essentially the same menu. I had never been to Houston's, so I figured why not try Bandera in Chicago.It's a very dark, cozy, and rather loud atmosphere. By glancing around, you can tell it's a very business-like and touristy crowd. We were seated along the window facing Michigan Ave, right by the live piano and jazz band. By now, we were starving and we just wanted to order right away. Unfortunately, it took a long time for the waitress to come to our table.We started off with the queso dip for our appetizer. It's not your typical melted cheese, but more chunky and hardened. Not bad, we ate it all up. For entrees, my wife ordered the salmon and I had the beef ribs with shoestring fries. Salmon was nicely cooked, moist and flaky, with a flavorful glaze on top. My beef ribs could have been more tender, and too much of a charred and burnt crisp on the outside. The shoestring fries were also a bit too oily.Yes, it's obvious that everything here is pretty overpriced for more or less average American food. We did enjoy the atmosphere, and people-watching through the glass windows was actually more entertaining than I had originally thought. We saw a cab break down in the middle of the street, and heard quite a few fire trucks and ambulances zoom by. Those sirens can get pretty darn loud."
"Same chain of restaurants around the country with different names. Food is solid.  I'd normally rate it 4 stars, but the service here was unacceptably slow.Food overall 4/5- Had the usual:   Grilled artichoke w/ creamy remoulade sauce    Soup du Jour (chicken tortilla on Sunday)    Sashimi tuna saladAppearance overall 4/5 - Live pianist; clean bathrooms; be careful with the wood floors as they can be slipperyLocation 5/5 - Good location if you're on shopping on Mag MileService 1/5 - Made reservations for 7pm, didn't get seated until closer to 7:30pm.  Appetizers took 30 minutes to come out, and we had to wave down someone to get utensils.  Although the waitress was sweet, she lacked the necessary attentiveness.  After waiting 45 minutes watching her walk back and forth, we had to wave down the waitress again for our checks."
"Bandera has become our go-to spot when we're in Chicago. It isn't as trendy as other restaurants, but the food, atmosphere and service can't be beat. I ordered the Braised Ribs this time, but have enjoyed the ""Cluck and Moo"" which is a portion of their rotisserie chicken and ribs as a combo (it's not on the menu, you have to ask). My husband had the crab cakes which we agreed was the best we ever had:  it is solid crab meat with no fillers and the portions are huge!  Last time, he had the salmon which was also delicious.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get. The best place to sit is a table overlooking Michigan Avenue, but the energy is just as good elsewhere. A jazz band plays every night."
"Bandera used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago.  So much so, that we also went to a Bandera restaurant in Santa Monica and another one in Los Altos now called the Los Altos Grill.I said used to be:  we were in Chicago and staying right across the street at the Marriott.  We were hungry, and short on time, so I ordered the Macho salad as carry-out.  My order was done on time, but the salad was not up to the usual standards.  Several pieced of the chicken were dry, and a couple had gristle.  The salad deserved a rating of 1 star.  I am giving them 3 stars because all of our previous visits have been excellent."
One of my favorite go-to restaurants in the city!!! I CRAVE their skillet cornbread OMG.  Also amazing is their goat cheese salad and the Tuna Poke is A-MAZING.  Please try that and thank me later!!!! Wait staff is great; love the upscale atmosphere as well.
"Macho salad is not all it is made out to be. Too sweet and calorie ridden to be called a salad.  My wife described it as a ""winter"" salad. Too heavy for a summertime salad and not my preference."
"I have to be honest, three stars is even a littttle generous for my first experience at bandera.  I'm bummed that it pretty much sucked because it's gotten great reviews so who knows what happened.A few girls and I went here for our lunch hour thinking it would be a good, quick and reasonable meal.  ummm, wasn't really good, we had to wait and it was not reasonable.first of all - the menu is minimal and there are not many choices.  my friend and i were torn between the veggie burger and prime rib french dip so we got both and decided to split.  the veggie burger was very strange and the consistency was almost wet.  it had a sweet taste to it that was not expected and not welcome by my taste buds.  it was falling apart all over the place and the bland taste did not make up for anything.  it was gross.on to the french dip.... so i've read fellow yelpers review this as the best item on the menu. maybe i got a bad one? first, it costs $18.  now, i am not a cheap girl, but really?? its a fucking sandwich and fries.  so whatevs, we order it thinking its gonna be out-of-this-world.  it arrives and it's not.  it was fatty and chewy and messy.  i had to slather so much horseradish on it, my sinuses were cleared for at least a month.   the fries were mediocre at best - warmish and shoe-stringy.my other gf got one of the salads and didn't say much about so i'm guessing it wasn't stand out.i would not return to this place - its expensive and shitty. sorry bandera!"
"The price-range is a little more than the $$ people have given it, but it was still worth it.  Just a straightforward, solid romantic meal.Beautiful ambiance: dim but not too dark, with nice lighting and wood decor.Solid food:  I'm sure everything is great, but the simple items were pretty above reproach.  The standard bandera roasted chicken (you can see the rotisserie turning in the lobby) was moist, flavorful, and great.  The salads were fresh and delicious, and the cornbread was moist and sweet and fantastic.Service:  Not hand over foot, but certainly acceptable.Price:  Salads were filling and cost around $13-$15.  Larger entrees started at $18 (standard roast chicken), and went up into the $40s for steaks and such.  The cornbread, however, which was a perfect starter all by itself (for 2), was only $4.Thus, with a glass of wine and a side dish, it's really more of a $$$ place.  But worth it, and you can definitely make it a $$ meal."
"Men will enjoy Bandera.  Just getting to this 2nd-floor restaurant means passing the sultry high-end lingerie shop, La Perla, wth the busty models scantily clad in stringy, tiny, lacey things and other unmentionables.  As you move up the escalator, you'll be fixing your hair and adjusting your outfit.  Or you might feel inspired to bust out in a disco dance since the walls on either side of the escalator are mirrored.  But before you get too far into your John Travolta persona and pull out your roller skates, you'll compose yourself as hear the distinctive thumping of a bass guitar and the tinkly notes of a piano...that is if you arrive in the evening for dinner.  This is often one of the main restaurants that people from out of town and staying at the nearby Intercontinental, Ritz, Sheraton, Allerton, and Westin hotels will dine at.  Its sophisticated dark decor is complemented by stunning black-and-white photographs of various subjects.  You can dine in the restaurant, and possibly score a cozy table by the windows overlooking Michigan Avenue....but most likely you'll need to wait if you have not made a reservation and it's 6 pm.  If you find a seat open, go sit  at the bar, since you'll have a nice view of the restaurant and have quicker access to cocktails and food than the service provided table-side.  Standard upscale American food in the form of steak, seafood, and enormous goat cheese-infested salads are served generously and presented beautifully.   However, I sometimes find the dishes a bit uninspired and bland.  The corn bread is great if you're missing a bit of the south and is a surprising offering on the menu.  Scanning around the crowd, you'll often see older couples on dates here as this tends to be for the 30 and up crowd.  You know, the kind that prefer bourbon, whiskey, cosmo martinis, and wine. If smoking were allowed indoors, most of the men would whip out cigars, while the ladies would have their Audrey Hepburn-esque cigarettes and foot-long holders.  It's a romantic place, and service seems to get more attentive and better with extra grey hairs and wrinkles.  And even more so, if you are dining with an attractive older man.  The waitresses and female bartenders here are buxom flirts who really work it with the men - irregardless if they're with another woman.  Ladies, if you're single and wanting to mingle, come here as there are alot of single men who dine here....and if no meat is available, you can always go down to La Perla, buy some power garments, and go next door to Eno (chocolate,cheese, wine bar) and go for a hunt with even more aphrodisiacs."
"Here is what Bandera is AWESOME for: Out of town guests who want to to dine overlooking Michigan Avenue, eat American food, and feel swanky...without paying huge amounts of money for some grub downtown. The food is well prepared, well priced, the service is good, the ambience is upscale without being stuffy. Piano in the corner, high booths, nice bar. Seriously, it does the trick every time. Never disappoints. It's not somewhere I'd go on a date or with fellow Chicagoans, etc...but defnitely with out-of-towners who want the posh experience wihout the tab. It's a go-to for me...along with drinks at the Signature Lounge...And um, who doesn't love to see little rotisserie chickens when you walk in? :)"
Wonderful respite from the tourists on Michigan!I had the Caesar for lunch (not too adventurous) and loved it.  It had GREAT cornbread croutons and great dressing.  It could have had a little more parm in it however.  The lettuce was very crisp and cut well.  Nothing worse than a Caesar with huge pieces.The iced tea was good too.  You could tell is was fresh brewed and hadn't been sitting around for a week.  The service was friendly but not overbearing.
"Bandera is a top-notch restaurant.  It's a little pricey, but I feel like that for the price is still a good value, especially compared to other restaurants that are even more expensive.  I've been more or less a regular at Bandera for over four years now (I end up going there between 2-4 times per month, sometimes more!)Very friendly staff, Bandera really sets itself apart, even from other comparably priced restaraunts!"
"Used Yelp to find this place while I was traveling for a conference.  Live jazz and great ambiance.  Good service.  The food was great.  I had the french dip and the grilled artichoke app, both of which were fantastic.  Would be a nice place for a date, but worked well for our group as well.Without reservations, the wait can be a bit, especially after 6:30ish.  Notably, the first time I ate here, we walked in just after 6 without any issue, so go early if you have a bigger group."
"I recently stopped here for lunch to try the veggie burger after it was reviewed well in the Trib. My husband had the cheeseburger. As a flexitarian who is adverse to condiments, I wish the menu had been more up front about what was on the burgers. If you are particular about mayo, mustard, or BBQ, be sure to ask. Even after inquiring whether the slaw was mayo-based (it's not, and it's delicious), I wasn't given a heads up that there might be mayo on the burger. The service was friendly. We were greeted multiple times by staff not waiting on us. Our server did not seem to inconvenienced by having to attend to us, which is a refreshing change compared to other places we have been recently. I've been to this place before for dinner and enjoyed it more that I did the lunch. I wouldn't order the veggie burger again. But I would not hesitate to return or to recommend this restaurant."
"Myself, my husband, and a group of friends landed here one night on our visit to Chicago.  Holy moly their house salads are possibly the best salad I've ever had!  And their prime rib is very good as well.  The drinks are good although expensive but what do you expect considereing the location?!?!  We enjoyed our meal and drinks and service was great.  I would definetly come back here if we visit again."
"Great Atmosphere, piano jazz, view of Michigan Ave, diffuses lighting and yet a casual enough environment! Great Food, fresh recipes, fresh ingredients, Brazilian flair! Great Service, polite, upbeat, accommodating!   I have enjoyed many meals here over the past ten years and I continue to enjoy the experience.  One of my favorite dishes is the Salmon -fire grilled with a delicious glaze.  I have recommended Bandera to friends over the years and they not only loved it, but also returned to enjoy another wonderful experience."
"The restaurant is pretty easy to miss if you don't know where it is located. You can see the sign on the outside but you have to go inside and up an escalator to find it. We had to wait a little while for our table, so we ordered some wine at the bar.  If you are lucky you will be seated at a table overlooking Michigan Ave. Do you like cornbread?  If so, try their cornbread served in a cast iron skillet for an appetizer.   I ordered the barbecue pork ribs and my boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken. Both were absolutely amazing. The ribs fell right off the bone and the chicken with rice had so much flavor. On this particular night they had a jazz band playing. I liked that the band was right behind us but they were playing quietly as to not disturb our dinner. The service from the hostess, to bartender, to the server were all amazing."
"We stopped in on a Friday night and were lucky to find a seat at the bar to avoid the wait for a table.Started with the pan of cornbread which isn't on the menu but we saw it by the hostess and asked about it.  It was quite good, a little different flavor with a few green pepper pieces mixed in.The wife had the rotisserie chicken, which she enjoyed.  The spanish rice left something to be desired, but I think I am always disappointed by spanish rice.I had the prime rib, which was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  Especially the outer edges, they were fantastic due to whatever spices were on there."
"Want some hairy fries? Here's where you'll find some! So I made a reservation to come here a week in advance for a friday night dinner at 6:15. Upon arrival I really loved the ambiance not TOO fancy but definitely a nice place. We were seated shortly after arriving near the live jazz band, which was perfect seating for a music lover like me. I decided on the cheeseburger after hearing from the waitress that it was award winning and I made a good choice. The burger was really really good BUT I found a hair in my fries, which really just kills my appetite and I should've just asked for my money back and left, but I didn't. I let the waitress know that a hair was in my fries, she apologized and brought out a new plate of fries. Don't get me wrong, this is an honest mistake, it's completely gross, but it happens. The part that really upset me is the fact that a manager didn't come over and apologize for the error, nor was my meal taken off the check. I receive hairy fries and you don't even offer me a complimentary dessert? In my opinion, this is very unprofessional."
"We always come once a year to enjoy the live jazz (excellent jazz ensemble always!), look outside at the Michigan Hoilday Lights, and eat decent food.  Excellent mojitos - they used smooth and delicious Appleton rum (it was mostly rum in my glass!) and fresh mint leaves.  Yum!Jalepeno cornbread was soft and warm, always a winner.Tried the rotisserie chicken for the first time b/c although this is what they're known for, I always opt for a different entree.  The chicken was good, not amazing, but tender and moist.  It was sitting on a sauce and was next to Spanish rice - the whole dish tasted like a soulful chicken tortilla soup.  It wasn't what I ordered/imagined but it was still enjoyable.  I wish it had a more traditional rotisserie flavor but b/c of the sauce, it didn't.Their best dish, which we never fail to order, is the prime rib sandwich.  The slices of prime rib is always sooo tender that it melts in your mouth.  Served with great au jus and fresh horseradish, it's a great way to end your day. We come back because of the atmosphere and reliably decent food.  The restaurant is buzzing with a cool but lively vibe and is filled comfortably with a mix of yuppies, out of towners, etc.  Service here is always welcoming -they know what service with a smile means.  We'll be back next year when the lights come on again!"
"First, let's take care of the ""issue"" we had at Bandara.There was a piece of metal grill brush in one of our party's veggie burger.  The manager immediately came over, identified the issue and offered a replacement meal.  BUT, it was still in the food which was dangerous.  They took the meal off our bill, but nothing else.Now, for the rest of the meal.  The french dip sandwich is amazing.  The fries are tasty and the service really is good.I've been for lunch twice with large groups and both times we have enjoyed the experience."
"Last night, I met Tom.  Tom Collins, that is.  Mama B's been a fan for years, but I never tried one until last night at Bandera.  I was there with a friend who insisted that Bandera had some of the best TC's in the city, so I had to try, right?  Well, I'm glad I did.The bartender was super-attentive.  Always right there to suggest another round before the last sip of lemon-ginny goodness left your glass.While I was only here for drinks, this place looked like the perfect place to take out-of-towners.  Its second-floor location gives a great view of the Magnificent Mile.  Be sure to request a table by the wall of windows to take in the view."
"When hungry and stuck in the tourist trap that is Magnificent Mile / Michigan Avenue, Bandera is a nice escape. It's not cheap, but it's not prohibitively expensive either. The dim lighting, ambient atmosphere, and nightly jazz also makes it a place to spend a romantic evening.As far as upscale tex-mex goes, I would expect more flavor from the food. All the same, it's good stuff and the servings are generous. During my visits, I've been privy to the salmon, crab cakes, and spinach and chicken enchiladas. All are very good choices.When dining here, you ABSOLUTELY MUST order the cornbread. It's the best I've ever had. My boyfriend hates cornbread but fell in love with Bandera's. It's that great. I also recommend the mojitos. I'm pretty picky about my mojitos and Bandera did not disappoint.If you're lucky enough to get a table near the window, you're in for a treat. It overlooks Mag Mile, so it's nice and scenic and you feel like royalty during your meal. In my experience, it's best to make a reservation and state your preference for window seating.Overall, this is one of Chicago's best Mag Mile dining options."
"Right on Magnificent Mile. Food was good except the selection was quite limited. Wait was long even we had reservation. The way reservation worked here was "" the next available table"". So if you were on time but no one was leaving, you would need to wait and if there were others before you, you would need to wait longer. We waited for 30 mins for our table. But once we sat down, service was good and prompt and we were done in 1.25 hr for a party of 4. The live music was nice but it might be too loud if you sit right next to it. The restaurant does take-out too. Next time we would order a take out for a whole rotisserie chicken which cost only $15. My husband had it for dinner and it cost $23 for half a chicken with green rice."
"Came here with a colleague that swore up and down this was THE place to be. Given the discrepancy in our ages, style, and just, well - general taste -  I was nervous. OK, I'll hand it to him. The view was great, the atmosphere was ""fun"" (it was packed), and we quickly made friends at the bar that invited us to dinner. Hey! Why not! Coworker had the cheeseburger that he tried to talk up to me, but by this point, I was intrigued by the identity crisis of the macho salad. Kudos to the name, I always love me a little wit. I wouldn't say I felt like chopping down a tree or starting a fight after this salad, but it was filling, yet light at the same time. None of the entrees really grabbed my attention, and I need to be a little more East Coast for a burger. Personal preference. :)  That said, I'd stop back into this place for a round of drinks + apps next time I'm in town."
"I've driven by Bandera numerous times and never knew what to expect -- then I went about 4 times in the course of 2 weeks because I'm addicted.  I love the location, above Michigan Avenue, and the decor - it's dark and I guess one would say ""romantic"" on the inside.  I'd recommend sitting in a booth or a table near the windows.  The live jazz music also is a plus.As for the cocktails - tasty, but pretty weak.  Food - delicious.  I've tried the ""hacked"" chicken salad, which I love, their queso dip (amazing and spicy), the pork chops which were also delicious.  I've heard the bbq salmon is just okay.You absolutely cannot leave Bandera without having their oreo cookie ice cream sandwich dessert thing.  Seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had.  Every time I eat it I consider ordering a second."
"Arrived @10:30pm on a Friday night 2 days b4 Christmas. Bar was packed, I was able to get a table with no waiting. Most guests grabbing a bite after Christmas shopping. Based on reviews I ordered the corn bread (pan) and the Macho Salad. Corn bread arrived quickly but disappointingly it was lukewarm not HOT. It was moist but could have used more butter in the batter. Speaking of butter I wasn't even offered butter with the corn bread. My  Salad arrived about 5 min later. The dressing was a jalapeno champagne that I felt was too strong for the salad.  The server bought out a cilantro based dressing that worked much better. The portions were large. The food was average at best. I was disappointed, this place is over-rated."
"I have been going to Bandera several times a year for many years now and have always been impressed with the ambiance, location and quality of the food.  My GF and I love this place and will try to grab a table there whenever we're in the neighborhood.  Everything you order there is delicious.  From the macaroni and cheese to the rotisserie chicken and steaks, it's all top-notch.  The wine list is pretty decent as well, with an ample selection of quality Pinot Noirs from a variety of regions.  Service is frequently very professional and personable.  All the way around, a very good dining operation.  My only complaint ever before today was that sometimes, the front-desk hostesses tend to exhibit a bit of arrogance and almost delight in telling you there are no tables to be had right away (though this was not the case today).Today was not my best visit with them, however.  I was really in the mood for a cheeseburger and saw one on their menu.  I ordered it, thinking that a Bandera burger would have to be out-of-this-world amazing.  The description simply said: ""Cheeseburger - Fresh Ground (In- House) with hand-cut fries.""  When it arrived, it looked juicy and delicious, but I also noticed that it had freshly-chopped, giant, raw onions and green peppers melted into the top layer of cheese, along with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on top of this.  But wait...that's not all.  Underneath the burger was a thick layer of coleslaw and mustard.  I'm willing to concede that there are probably a whole lot of people out there who would salivate over a burger like this and may think I'm crazy to be complaining.  However, I absolutely hate onions and I really cannot stand cole slaw.  I'm just saying...one would think that if the kitchen was going to take such creative liberties with a cheeseburger, they'd at least mention all these extra ingredients on the menu before people ordered it, right?  I am so tired of ordering something as described on a menu, only to have it arrive and see that the kitchen has decided to include a whole host of mystery ""surprise"" ingredients not mentioned on the menu.  Today's experience at Bandera was one of the most blatant of these occasions I've seen in a very long time and I was not thrilled to have to spend 5-7 minutes cleaning off my entire entree before I could eat it.  The waitress stopped by several times and saw me dissecting the burger and didn't make a comment.  I think an apology would have been proper in this case.  Something like ""Oh, I should have told you that our cheeseburger actually comes with 6 extra ingredients that aren't mentioned in the menu...my bad.  Let me take it back and get you one that only has what you want on it.""  Nope.  I had to pick every piece of onion, pepper and slaw off of that burger before I could eat it...and nobody offered to take it back.  Despite this unpleasant experience, the burger was quite delicious after everything offensive to my palate was removed.While this was not all too great of an experience, I will definitely be back because I know Bandera to be an amazing restaurant where I've had many, many a fine meal.  I can give them an occasional misstep after years of great service."
"Banderas is a must for me every time I visit Chicago.  I order the same two appetizers every time I go...the grilled artichokes and the skillet cornbread.  Both are fantastic.  I love the old steakhouse modernized feel of the place....but I admit I've only sat at the bar because the bartenders are spot on with service and the views of the dining area, music, street and kitchen are perfect. I always order a cosmo because the martini glasses are chilled...so your drink comes out with those little ice chips in it...perfection.  And my favorite part of all....if  you let your martini sit just a moment too long...before you can blink the bartender has poured the remains into a fresh frosty glass...who could ask for anything more?"
"Came here for a quick late lunch earlier this week and sat at the bar . A friend and I ordered the tuna appetizer, I had the macho salad and he had the burger. The portions are huge! And the food was pretty good. Our bartender was competent enough though devoid of personality or charm.I guess my question is? Do people really still dine like this in Chicago? I ate here years ago and the menu seems identical.....wheres the creativity, the charm, the style, the verve??.......I was bored by my experience. Nothing was wrong per se. But nothing was great.......and the servers seem (and act) like robots. The ambiance is blah.......And its a little overpriced.....Im being generous with my rating. But the food was tasty, the service adequate an the timing was prompt; but with all the phenomenal dining Chicago has going on right now, ....Bandera needs to step up its game to stay relevant..........that or come up with a new fresh concept. Thats some prime real estate on the mag mile.If your hungry and want a big meal, I say stop in. But bring a book, or an ipad, or an entertaining friend.......cause their aint much else going on."
"Good food, good service, and good live music! Quite pricey though"
"Bandera is owned by the same company as Houston's, my absolute favorite chain restaurant.  They both have a similar menu and a dark, homey atmosphere.  Houston's is always on my list of places to go when  I go back home to Boca Raton, FL but for some reason I always seem to forget about Bandera.  I'm not sure if it's the location or maybe it's just that Chicago has so many amazing restaurants that it's hard to remember them all.Tonight I did remember Bandera so my brother and I headed over there for an early dinner.  Although I was tempted to get their amazing cornbread appetizer (one thing I can't find at Houstons) I decided to be healthy and get the grilled artichoke appetizer...it's easy to be healthy when veggies taste this good. YUM! For our entrees my brother chose the Hacked Chicken Salad, which he described as awesome, and I went with the veggie burger.  I actually don't even like veggie burgers, but there is something about the veggie burgers at Bandera, Houstons, and J Alexander that makes me crave them! So yummy & so filling!The service was great and they had us in and out of there within an hour...when leaving around 7ish I noticed there was quite a wait for seating.  I may be forgetting about Bandera (although it will be hard to forget tonight's meal), but by the wait it looks like others are remembering how good this restaurant is!"
"Best value in Chicago.  Service, food and overall ambiance, incredible!Thanks Bandera!"
"A not-so-hidden Michigan Ave. gem, due to the fact that it does little in the way of standing out visually, but it's food speaks volumes.Once you find the door and escalator, and get over the fact that yes, this is the right way, you'll be greeted by a wall of slow spinning rotisserie chicken.  This is one of their specialties.  You'll notice right away that the layout is rather large and sprawling, but each seat intimate, even more so over by the booths.  The lights remain low, with dramatic highlights and the sound of music (usually jazz) playing softly in the background.  At times, there's an actually group off to the side near the bar.   The prime seats are over the by the windows looking out over Michigan Ave.  These slant outward and are a great back drop at any time of day.All the staff approaches friendly and are attentive, as their clientele are a mixture of visitors and locals.  This I've notice makes service always a little better, especially when people could be coming back the next week.  The food is lovely and succulent.  Kick off with the grilled artichoke, which comes as 3 halves, full leaf marinated and salted.  It's a rather unique side for a restaurant and done right.  The ""meat"" slides right off and the hearts inside are juicy as can be.  Plus, it's a share plate that gets all involved and is fun to eat.  The crab cakes were the special and done very very well, as an entire at that.  However, the peak of the meal was the Macho Salad.  A large helping of salad which has enough in it to make anyone happy.  I was raised by a chef known for her salads, and this one brought me back to my childhood days.  Now, being on Michigan ave, you have to expect the prices to be a little higher, but the overall decor and quality of food comes with that.  The servers will make sure you're satisfied and it's a sure thing.  Excellent place for a date night, double date night or relaxing dinner with friends."
"I still have dreams about their Macho Salad sometimes. Yeah, it's pretty cruel what it can do to you; it makes a Caesar Salad seem like a cheap hooker. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. The interior is private, dim and cozy. Not to mention the wall of rotating rotisserie chickens is enough to make your mouth water before you sit down. If you're lucky enough to get seated against the windows, it's also a nice haven to people-watch the rhythm of shoppers on Michigan Avenue below. The service is pretty prompt, and not snooty. The steaks here are tender and the jus juicy. I've liked everything I've tried on the menu before, though I do wish there were more options. The last time I came here, I also was a little disappointed by the Oreo Ice-Cream sandwich which was more like an overglorified Ice-Cream sandwich, and not so Oreo-y."
"Bandera has a very low-key entrance on Michigan Ave.  You walk in and immediately go up the escalators to the restaurant.  The staff here is nothing short of incredible.  Always very attentive, knowledgeable about the food, and you truly get the sense that they want to make your experience great.The cornbread is YUM!  Note that it is the Yankee variety, and not the southern type.  Plenty of vegetarian options here.  Everything I've had here was delicious.  Still need to try one of those rotisserie chickens they have spinning near the door.The atmosphere here is so comforting.  The lights are a bit dim.  Dark wood and soft seating litter the scenery.  The smell in Bandera is heavenly. If you aren't hungry, stop by the bar and have a glass of wine suggested by one of the bartenders.Edit:  The entry for Bandera here says it is good for dinner, but I've had lunch here many times.  Try it - just as good as dinner!"
"Great food! A little pricey, but it's worth it.The Macho Salad and the Trio of Dips are a must try."
"Oh Bandera, how I love you so!I  I think this is my 1st 5 star review given.  I have eaten here many times and I always get the veggie burger which is the best veggie burger I have ever eaten.  We also ordered the ""hacked"" chicken salad and that too was delicious.  They roast their own chicken and it is so soft that you can cut it with a fork.  We also tried their braised red cabbage with goat cheese.  Who would have thunk it that it would be as good as it was??  The live jazz music is a nice plus...if I had to say something negative is that it is just a little loud for the size of the restaurant which makes having an intimate conversation a little challenging. I would come here much much more if it was only more conveniently located.  It's always a hassle to get to Michigan Ave.  At least you can park a block away and they will validate for $11.00 which beats a cab ride."
"For casual dining, I found it okay. I wasn't as impressed with the place as other reviewers. The atmosphere was nice due to the view overlooking Michigan Avenue. But honestly, the food and service were fine for casual dining, nothing exceptional.The service was solid.The food was okay.The best thing about Bandera was the view in my opinion. I have had better casual dining food. I really think people are taken by the view coupled with the atmosphere so they might be romanticizing the taste of the food. Then again, my palate isn't the best. I am still bewildered by the number of four and five star reviews though."
"Had a great experience at this place!  Came here with my girlfriend and a few close friends, and we all agreed this place was worth it.The feel of the restaurant was comfortable and classy the minute we walked in, and the service reflected exactly that.  And the food?  Awesome!  Our appetizers were a solid start to the meal; we had the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and the #1 Tuna Poke.  The entree was what sold me on the place.  I had the Roasted Pork with Apricot Glaze and Mashed Potatoes.  Very well done on a classic plate!  And everyone else seemed to really dig their food by the looks on their faces and their empty plates.Dinner, drinks, and live jazz music made it for us on this night.  Would not think twice about suggesting it next time I'm around the area!"
"4 stars: Good food, classy atmosphere, prime place to stop in and relax from walking around Michigan Ave.Came here last week for lunch, and I enjoyed the food and the upscale feel of the restaurant (decor was simple and elegant). We got a table overlooking Michigan Avenue, which was cool. The Jumbo Grilled Artichoke starter was so good! It was seasoned well, but you have to know how to eat artichokes (pluck a leaf and suck and scrape w/your teeth). For the entree, I ordered the Blackened and Grilled Yellowtail Fish Sandwich, which I think was a special. It was pretty good and the portion was big (kind of sad I didn't have room for dessert, I would have tried the Banana Cream Pie). I liked the peanut coleslaw that came with it too. The Mac & Cheese side was just okay. Service was good and the food a bit expensive, but it's what you should expect from a nicer restaurant."
Nice restaurant with great food.  I had the Trout and it was cooked perfectly.  You can see the kitchen from where you sit which is nice.  My server seemed to lay on the customer service pretty thick but I guess that's better than nothing.  The brussel sprouts were just o.k. but everything else was great.  The wine list was adequate.
"Just one of those great places to hang out in Chicago and especially to escape the cold. (staycation in downtown). Staff really rocks and knew that we wanted to be left alone, but always made sure we had water and drinks. Very crowded but food was prepared great and we weren't rushed to get get outI always get chicken and I love their potatos. It has been here forever ... my pops would take me here when I was little. It is nice to see something last so long."
"I love this place!  Ambience is great, place is always packed and the chopped chicken salad is my consistent choice and it's always top notch.  I have only ever been here for lunch because I'm not waiting in their overpacked bar area for a table at dinner.  Lunch at the bar isn't bad though."
"Went with my family for dinner.We ordered cornbread and some kind of vegetable mix for starters.  The bread disappeared in a few seconds (out of this world~!) but the vegetable, eh, not as much. We just kind of picked at it until our friendly waiter save it from us with our entrees.I ordered a Seared Sashimi Tuna salad and my family split the Prime Rib slow roast on the bone.  My salad was okay, I was not too crazy about the dressing.  But oh wow, the Prime Rib is so tender and just amazing~!Will definitely come back for more cornbread, the jazz, and maybe that Veggie Burger that's been popping up in the reviews."
"There is so much good to say about Bandera. I first discovered the restaurant many years ago when I was staying at the Marriott across the street and noticed the easy to miss restaurant on the 2nd floor above Michigan Avenue. Once you find the entrance off Michigan Ave, you are entering into a relaxing and fun atmosphere. While at times the wait can be a drag, I recommend finding a spot at the bar and enjoying a lovely drink and maybe striking up a conversation with your neighbor. Between the weather, latest show in town, cubs, sox, bears, bulls, blackhawks there should be something to help you pass the time with your neighbor (and maybe meet a neat new person). Okay, since we're on the topic of the wait, if you have the time, I very much recommend waiting for a table overlooking Michigan Ave, particularly in the spring/summer/fall seasons. Great spot to enjoy a lovely meal and great people watching. That said, if you are on a date, the booths are a great spot. You can snuggle up to your honey and the way the space is configured you feel very intimate. Onto the food. First of all unless you absolute hate salad, you must try their salad. Their little side salad is to die for. I can fairly confidently say that it is among the best salads I have ever eaten. The portion is plenty to share if you're with that special someone. For your next option you may be tempted by the rotisserie chicken that you can see prominently as you enter and you would not go wrong with that selection. That said, it is fair to say that anything on the menu to this point has been delicious and I have tried to find a flaw. In addition the service is tremendous and you can have your food in just about any fashion that you would prefer. The daily specials are usually great fresh catches and other delicious seasonal favorites that are delightful. As one might expect on Michigan Ave the wine selection is solid. Lastly, worth noting, should you find yourself on the way to the little boys or girls room, don't forget to peek into the open kitchen, observe the master at work, and enjoy the lovely smells. In addition I must say and several of my female friends have affirmed this to be true from both gender vantage points, the place has a good amount of eye candy."
"Bandera has always been a neighborhood gem, nothing like it on the Magnificent Mile.  I enjoy the cozy, jazzy atmosphere after a long work day, service and food is top notch. Recent changes are a bit off but I'm keeping my figures crossed that it doesn't change too much.  Several managers parade around now in what looks like flight attendant uniforms w/neck scarves. Don't know why they feel they needed to do that because it just doesn't fit with the atmosphere. A menu item the is truly incredible is no longer offered ""tuna poke"".  It was truly a scrumtions appetizer that was large enough to be your main course (ahi tuna, mixed with avacado and macadamia nuts).  This dish was simply supurb.  WHAT HAPPENED!  Hopefully it will resurface and Bandera will go back to the quiet charming restaurant that it's known for."
"Lamb shank.... meh.  Cornbread skillet... BOMB!  Buttery, cornbread goodness.  I lost my umbrella there though.  Let me know if you see it.  It's black with a silver handle."
"A friend and I have been trying to eat at Bandera for awhile now. Every time we would show up on the weekend though, there would be at least a 45 minute wait and we were always starving, so we never hung around. Well, we finally wised up and went on a weeknight - got in immediately. First things first, I really like the atmosphere of this place. It's dark, but never feels TOO dark, and the decor is appealing. They also have a three-piece jazz band playing at the center of the place. Very nice. It should be noted that when I walked past the band, the drummer had the best ""I'm a badass jazz musician"" face I've ever seen.Anyways, on to the food. First off, I ordered the bangers and mashed, only to have my waiter tell me that they don't have it anymore and he ""wasn't even sure why it's still on the menu"". Kinda weird and I had my hopes set on it, but I went with my second choice, some apricot-glazed pork and mashed potatoes. Delicious. I don't have pork all that often, but this was very good. Very tender and the glaze was great. Maybe could have been a bit less dry though, but overall very good. My friend got a more simple (and cheaper) prime rib dip sandwich that I was skeptical about at first. It was also very good, however. Simple, yet delicious. The biggest downside to this place is it is a bit pricey, but considering how good the meal was, it really wasn't a big deal. I'll be going back sometime."
"My family ate here after my college graduation (without me =(  ) while I moved out of my apartment in Hyde Park.  Since I was so busy trying to rush my stuff out of my place, I missed the nice dinner with them, but they did order me an entree to go.  I asked my sister to order me a rack of ribs.  I didn't get to the hotel until 4 am to eat that entree, but even 8 hours after my meal was ordered, it was AMAZINGLY good.  On top of that, they had some GREAT coleslaw, and I don't even like coleslaw.  I went again tonight and it was wonderful.  The food was great once again.  My vegetarian friend who joined me said his veggie burger was delicious, and the atmosphere and ambiance is excellent.  There was a live jazz band too, which really made this place a wonderful choice for friends and family.  I highly recommend it.  The view of Michigan ave. is a plus as well.Entrees range in the ($) 20s."
Jalapeno cornbread is the best
"We came here on a Saturday late night but we still had to queue but the long wait was definitely worthwhile!  My bf had the catch of the day special - grilled catfish with hand-cut fries while I had the rib eye steak.  Both were DEE-LI-CIOUS!  The fish was grilled to perfection and the steak was one of the best that I had so far (better than the steakhouse that starts with an ""R"" or an ""M"").  We then had the banana banoffi pie to share, awesome cream topping.  Though a little on the pricey end, will come back again for more great food. Expect $25-30 / person and 15-20 minutes wait in the line."
LOVED IT!!  Best veggie burger I have ever had which came with a peanut coleslaw that was awesome.  Had the banana creme pie for dessert which did not disappoint.
"This place lives up to the hype.  The service is good, the servers literally walk around smiling! (if you don't believe me check it out for yourself) I went on New Years Day for brunch and everything was on point.  We had a FABULOUS clam chowder that was amazingly tasty.  I was slightly hungover so I went with a burger that had meat so fresh you'd swear there was a cow in the back.  I loved the banana cream pie, it is one of the best I've ever had. For our two soups, two bloody marys (average, go for a different drink, fyi), two sodas, a burger, fish sandwich, and banana cream pie with capuccino everything came to 80 bucks.  Very well worth it."
"Bandera hands down use to be one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I always get the same thing: a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the artichoke, the grilled fish sandwich with fries and the Oreo dessert. A night at Bandera meant I would be going home directly after, sliding on my fat pants and passing out on my couch five minutes after walking in my door. This had been my experience every single time  - until this Friday. The mood was light and energetic -I was with my boyfriend and another couple and we were all anxious as we were sat at our table and began to order our favorite dishes on the menu as we have done time after time. None of us needed the menu as we all knew  our favorite dishes by heart. As I ordered my usuals, the mood suddenly changed as the waitress informed me that my fish sammy was no longer on the menu. I glanced down in horror as she was correct - it was nowhere to be found. Granted, there are many good items at Bandera, but being a pescatarian there are limited options. The Bandera fish sandwich has to this day been my favorite sandwich in Chicago. Every bite was perfect - I never left a crumb on my plate. From the pickle, to lettuce and tomato and fresh grilled taste of the fish itself - i was in heaven with every savory morsel. Friday night I felt like Oprah without her favorite things, Ryan Seacrest without his hair gel, Paula Abdul without her medication. This was my staple item and it had been ripped away from me with no explanation! No notice! Couldn't they have put something on the menu to let us know ahead of time? A girl needs to prepare herself for such a loss!I wasn't going to starve, so I ordered the veggie burger instead. Of course,  I did speak with the manager to let him know my frustrations. He did give our table a free dessert which was great - but still did not make up for the death of my delicious fish sammy! So.. Chicagoans and people of the mile that is Magnificent.. this i ask of you. PLEASE HELP US GET THE BANDERA FISH SAMMY BACK!! Call Bandera - write reviews - but please HELP! Cows everywhere are begging!!"
Great service . I has the special pan fried salmon and it was great.... Nice place to take a date!
"Only the word amazing can describe my experience at Bandera. Really convenient location, super amazing food, friendly wait staff, and a great atmosphere. You must try their cornbread! It is probably the best cornbread I've ever had. I don't know about the authenticity of the bread since we're in the middle of a touristy area of Chicago. But it is still the best I've ever had. I got the porkchop. It was moist, perfectly cooked. I can't even describe how good this porkchop is, all I can say is my stomach is now growling from thinking about it."
"This place is DYNAMITE! I came here for my birthday and couldn't have asked for a better place to grub. Everything on the menu looked top notch and the food that my family ordered was unreal. If you come here you have to get their corn bread. I mean you have to get it. Seriously. Oh yeah and their banana cream pie is ridiculous. You can't beat the location on Michigan avenue and the prices are high, but not too high. Once you go here, you'll see It's definitely worth every penny you spend. Overall, it was a great spot with an amazing atmosphere and slamming food."
"So it's a chain...  so what? I REALLY strive not to eat at chains while dining around Chicago but have always wanted to give Bandera a shot. I mean, it's a lot less ""chain-ish"" than some of the other Michigan Ave-ish options--  Cheesecake Factory, California Pizz Kitch, Grand Lux Cafe yada yada yada...Anyway, so my friend landed at Midway at 8.45pm so we HIGH-TAILED it downtown for dinner. STARVING does not even begin to describe our empty tummies. We were seated immediately seeing that it was so late. We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke Dip to start with. I ran to the wash room to antibac my hands (yea yea I'm one of those germaphobes) and made it back to the table with a delicious spread of spinach artichoke dip, salsa, sour cream and chips waiting for me. PERFECTO. The chips were thin and salted to perfection, dips were beyond satisfying. I ordered the bandera-styled roast chicken. Figured I couldn't go wrong ordering the ""house dish"". I took a bite and wanted to yell ""FLAVA FLAVVVV!!!"" AH so good. It's all about the flavor. The chicken was seasoned extremely well. The macaroni and cheese that I ordered on the side was also delightful. It even had crumbs of cornbread mixed in. I was in heaven to say the least.The restaurant itself was nice...  if you want to go somewhere that feels a little bit more ""upscale"" but doesn't rape your wallet, hit Bandera. You can also be seated on the west side of the restaurant for a nice view of Mich Ave."
"The Hillstone has got their concept down to a science: simple, well-executed menu, ""rich"" looking decor, always lively atmosphere, and (best of all...) byob. I ordered the french dip with fries. Delicious, as always. Service was a bit slow (it was a busy night...), but I supposed that just gave us more wine-drinking time."
"Went here for a dessert and drink.  Sat at the bar and had a great time listening to the live music and having a good convo with my friends.  Drink prices are reasonable and the dessert was totally worth the $8 price tag.  I shared the banana cream pie.  It has a delicious graham cracker crust, velvety pudding, nice chocolate bits sprinkled throughout, and all topped with a lush caramel sauce and slices of banana.  Really really good!"
"Stick with chicken (roasted chicken, chicken sandwich, chicken salad etc) and you won't be disappointed.Tuna, grouper, salmon, burgers and roasted lamb are okay as wellDefinitely stay away from prime rib, salty and not too much flavorGood place for lunch"
"I almost want to give Bandera five stars. . . but I only get one thing when I'm there and that just ain't right. And so, without further adieu, I present you with the best salad I have ever had. The Macho. I know I am not the first to fall in love with the warm and cool of this big bowl, but the dates? Please. Dates in salads are unique and appreciated.Roasted corn, avocado, goat cheese. Are you feeling me? And the rotisserie chicken? It's such a huge, healthy, heaping portion for a not so heaping price. The cornbread is also not to be missed and every time we go, usually with my favorite aunt, we get a glass of pinot noir and banana creme pie. Not at the same time, that's gross. But both are perfect additions to a meal that will put some pep in your step for the rest of the day.I should really branch out, but why bother?"
"They say this place has really good burgers...and ""they"" are absolutely correct.I honestly do wish that I try more items on their menu, but I just can't stay away from the burgers.  I usually get mine well done with ketchup and mayo on the side (they have always asked if I wanted the condiments on the side, and I always say yes).It comes with perfectly thing shoe-string like fries that are crispy and soft in every bite.  Just doing this review is making me want some of their food right now.  Too bad I'm back in NYC at the moment.Their side Caesar Salad is a bit on the salty side, but the accompanying croutons are quite tasty.  They also have this queso appetizer that is also pretty tasty, not salty though, just plain 'ol tasty :-)I think the next time I'm in Chicago, I'll try something else on their menu....I think.A note about the restaurant entrance though....it is on the second floor of the building, so it requires you to go up the escalator.  What I find funny is that if you didn't know the entrance was there, you would think you were going upstairs to some fur/coat store or something.  I wish the door was marked better.  But oh well, as long as I know where it is, I'm good ;-)"
"I had always seen Bandera's large sign on Michigan, but never quite knew how to get to it.  It's a little tricky, but once you find it, it's worth it.  It has a very nice ambiance.  The lights are low and it's low-key. I had the Macho salad with dates, almonds, goat cheese, avocado and chicken. What a great combination of ingredients! The lettuce in the salad is shredded, which I really like.  The dressing is very light and delicious. The salad is $17 which is pretty expensive for a salad, but it was a nice splurge."
"What's a perfect Saturday afternoon? Well, mine was seeing my brother on his birthday and having drinks. The mister and I met up with my brother and sister in law here after they had a fun day of shopping and relaxing without two, very cute high energy toddlers. I too welcomed this afternoon excursion to get drinks and talk to company after doing laundry all day.Walking in here, it's a dark contrast to the brightly lit escalator. Instead, Bandera is dark and loungey with a large chicken rotisserie pit providing warmth and light nearby. I found my brother and sister in law at the bar enjoying Stella and queso dip. I ordered my usual drink only to find out that they don't carry flavored vodkas. What bar doesn't carry flavored vodkas? I settled on a Ketel One Citron with club soda and twist of lime. My drink was surprisingly strong. I usually expect weak pours, but these were some strong ones. The mister and I had the queso dip appetizer. It was alright. I expected it to be ooey-gooey cheesy, instead, it's more of a picnic mayonnaise based creamy dip. It wasn't very creamy, but more globular too. It had a mild kick to it; enough to please the non-spicy crowd. Frankly, it wasn't anything special. I had a wonderful afternoon drinking with my brother and sister in law at Bandera. I don't know if I'll go back because it's pricey and just alright."
"Went last night and had a blast.  I recommend anyone staying at the Marriott to quickly, drop what you are doing, walk out the door, across the street and up the stairs for some awesome food.      The waitstaff had the best table maintenance I have experienced in quite a long time.  We sat near the front window, and each waitress walked down the line like a model on the catwalk making sure every table was taken care of and every drink full.  Even if it was not their table, the servers,  would jump to the rescue if the table was missing anything, even if we didn't ask.  The staff were also extremely friendly and knowledgeable.The food was a unique spin on American Cuisine and I must say anyone dinning their should order the Cornbread it was quite tasty.  I think the price of this restaurant was extremely reasonable given the high quality of food, service, and the jazz band that was playing. (Seriously the piano players was awesome, seemed to be enjoying the moment and had extremely tasty chops).  I plan to eat hear more often even though I don't go to the magnificent mile very often."
"I have been here a few times, and it never disappoints!  Their French Dip is outstanding, and their Tex-Mex items are good as well.The ambiance and decor is just what you would expect, and the service is attentive.  Pricing is a bit on the high side, but I believe it is worth the money.  Quality and quantity are high.With the name, I was hoping for more of a Mexican type flair, but was pleasantly surprised with the regular type offerings."
"I went there last night on a first date. I really like this girl, so I was very disappointed that the restaurant didn't meet up to expectations. I called around 11am to make a 7:30p reservation..i called at 6pm to confirm my reservation. When I got there at 7:30p I had to wait for 20mins to get seated despite having made a reservation, and get this...they even sat a white couple who got there after I did before I was able to get a seat. When we finally got seated the seat was a really bad spot. There were nicer spots available but perhaps those were for 3-4 people... so we sat the corner right next to the kitchen and through-out the meal all we heard was plates, pots and pans from the kitchen. The Cornbread was really good...the Lamb was Not good at all.. they ran out of all the fish on the menu except one, and my date doesnt eat meat so she had no choice but to go with a fish sandwich, which was basically a fancy version of fish-o-filet from McDonalds. The decor of the place is nice...food is not that great..service below average."
"Such amazing food! One of my first restaurants I came too when I first moved here from CA. Great omniscience, fresh food, great setting, good spot! Highly recommended for a date night, or out with family or friends!"
"This Place is very Nice . Very good location on Michigan Ave , and the prices are not Very Expensive $30 for a main course . Excellent Food , and the Restaurant itself is very very Class . I llove this Place"
"All the foodies are going to shoot me for saying this, but the prime rib sandwich? (Which, by the way, OMG!!!!!) totally tastes like what Arby's would taste like if Arby's were a gourmet restaurant that used actual meat. Seriously. I don't mean that as a dig. What I mean is that I have this guilty pleasure sort of love for Arby's, fake meat and all, but eating the prime rib sandwich here made me realize what a roast beef sandwich really SHOULD taste like. It was just so omgggggg.I'm appalled that I just now came here for the first time, after living literally ten minutes away for a year and a half. But it's true... and the important thing is that at least I came here, eventually. The prime rib sandwich isn't the only good thing--the french fries and asparagus are good too. But my favorite thing was the tomato/burrata salad. OH LORD, it was so good I wanted to cry. Even the pickled beets were good. Really. I am not joking.Our server was adorable, classy, knew her stuff, and didn't care that we took twenty minutes just to decide what we wanted. Bottom line: Definitely worth the (somewhat high) price."
Great place. We had a booth and a great meal.  You'll enjoy dining here!
"In every city I've lived: New Orleans, Miami, Boca Raton, New York there is a Houston's Restaurant, a favorite of my whole family. I moved to Chicago, not two years ago yet, and expected to find one downtown for sure. To my complete surprise there is none. I called the management office of the one there used to exist (I don't know why it closed), and they suggested I tried Bandera, another of their chain restaurants. I hesitated, but went. It's HOUSTON'S! The same exact ambiance, decor, service, and even food. The best veggie burger ever, the greatest caesar salad, and like always, excellent service. I am happy! I only wish it weren't located in the middle of Mag Mile because tourists are going to flock in. For lunch or dinner I love this place."
Came here for my birthday dinner before going karaoking and clubbing.  It's a very comfortable and romantic place.  The food and service was great. I will be back for sure! I loved the live music on Friday night!
"Reasonable prices, fantastic food, and a great location on the Mag mile! I really didn't know what to expect as any place on Mag mile is usually over priced and not very good. However, it is not the case at Bandera's. They are on the 2nd floor and in a great spot. The atmosphere is very intimate and comfortable. Definitely a place where I would meet a friend for drinks. Even though I was there at 3 in the afternoon, I haven't had lunch yet and decided to order a sandwich. For some reason, the veggie burger jumped out at me and was also highly recommended by the waitress. WOW, it was probably one of the best veggies burger's I've ever had. It was served with a peanut slaw on the side and the burger was glazed with a miso sauce. I normally don't get veggie burgers and can't say I'm a veggie burger connoisseur, but if all veggie burgers were made this way, I would be ordering it a lot more!!! This place has my vote for the place to go for a bite on the Mag mile. The prices are also very reasonable as my burger was only $13 and worth every penny."
"Went here for lunch during a company outing, I thought the food was great but the place was very busy during lunch"
I have been here a number of times and this place NEVER disappoints!!Five of us went on a Friday night and off course made a reservation - which you absolutely need. We had a booth across from where the jazz band was playing and they were really great.  The place has a great ambiance and has a nice mixed crowd of locals and tourists of various ages (usually I don't see kids there in the evenings).For an appetizer we got the corn bread and focaccia - which is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!  The stuff is wonderful. Two of us got the Macho salad and the other three got the roasted chicken which came with Spanish rice.   We skipped dessert since we were all stuffed!The food and service was great and my four friends who had never been there before all really liked the restaurant.TIP: During the holidays its nice to sit by the window and see all the lights on Michigan ave.  These tables are in high demand so make sure and request them at the time of your reservation.
"Great Location, great service, great atmosphere and most of all, GREAT FOOD!I had the macho salad, the prime rib and the chicken dish (forgot the name) - prime rib was cooked to perfection and the chicken was the tenderist I've ever had.  The food came out in less than 10 minutes after we ordered (which we thought was really weird) but the food was sooo good our suspicious minds were happy in the end.Bandera made our trip to Chicago 10 times better!Thank you :D"
"This place has been raved about, so my Mom made us reservations for a quick celebratory dinner on Friday.We had reservations for 5, but adding a 6th person to our table put us at another hour wait.  Unfortunately, my brother's gf got sick, so we got a table for 4 pretty quickly right by the window.The bartender was very friendly and served us with a smile.  The hostesses were very nice and welcoming.Our server was really nice when she got to the table. I started asking questions about the enchiladas and saying how I didn't care for chicken, and she got a little short with me.  Guess they are really well known for their chicken and everything has chicken in it, except the burger and veggie burger. *shrug*I didn't want beef and I wanted an freakin' enchilada, so I ended up with the chicken enchilada and mac n' cheese.Chicken enchilada was good and flavorful, but the mac n' cheese was not. I was really disappointed in it.  It left me feeling blah.Overall, I didn't think this place lived up to the hype.I did like the view and the live jazz, tho."
The veggie burger was delicious. I nibbled my dates beef variety and was equally pleased. The service was friendly and engaging and pleasant. The expansive views of Michigan Avenue and the ambiance of live music made this restaurant a perfect place to to escape from the chaos of shoppers and tourists below.
The service was excellent. We were seated right away and our server was attentive but not hovering. My friend ordered the enchiladas and I had a leg of lamb sandwich. Her enchiladas a la carte were good but nothing impressive. My sandwich was much better. It had sliced roasted peppers and came with a sauce to dip it in. I would have loved it except that they left the skin on the peppers. It gave it this weird texture. The first couple bites I thought I was eating some kind of plastic paper. I spent the whole meal spitting out pieces of pepper skin because I couldn't chew it. We also tried the cornbread because we heard such good things about it but I didn't think it was anything great.I would go back and give it another try. But until then my review stays as a-ok.
"Bandera was a haunt of mine in the 1990's. I've been there rarely since, so having dinner there last night was essentially like trying a restaurant for the first time. And, to be hosted by one of my favorite cousins who came to Chicago to visit me and my kids, it portended to be precisely the treat it turned out to be.The salient aspect of Bandera is the service. It's excellent. The servers - even those whom are not ""your"" server  - all pitch in and help. There was a moment where one of us at the table didn't get just what she ordered, we summoned a server, who promptly corrected the situation, and all was good.My daughter ordered a prime rib sandwich that was so good  - as she said - she ate every crumb. I tasted her shoestring potatoes that were not greasy, but delicious.Two of us had prime rib entrees, and two had vegetarian sandwiches. The prime rib was unusually spicey and well, pretty damn salty, but YUM! (This morning my blood pressure pills asked me, ""hey, why do you bother with us?"")The mashed potatoes were almost good enough to order as an entree.The menu had great choices that all looked wonderful: lots of seafood and chicken dishes that would satisfy any hunger or level of palate discrimination, I suspect. It's pricey, and worth it. So, next time an out-of-town someone invites me to dinner, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Bandera."
"I've been going here for 10 years now, and the quality has stayed pretty consistently high over the years.  Way back when, I used to get the ""Cluck and Moo"" (the chicken and ribs).  It hasn't been on the menu for years, but they still accommodate when I ask.  I love the beef ribs, the corn bread, and the asian coleslaw (and the shoestring fries!)  I go back again and again just for those items.The atmosphere is great -- dark and cozy, usually with live (jazzy) music at dinner.  The bar is also an excellent place to grab a drink and a quick bite if you don't want to wait.  All-in-all, a great chain and good standby.  My biggest gripe:  I wish they took reservations and could accommodate parties over 6."
"My favorite bandera since its serves lunch, live jazz...better seating arrangement and love the stools beside the kitchen!  They have the same menu as the other."
"The prime rib french dip was delicious, though the mashed potatoes were not all I had hoped they would be. PLUS, my food was NOT hot when it came out. However, I would say overall, the quality of food is good, and they had some live jazz music, which is always nice."
The food is very good.  It has a trendy type environment.  It is in a great location on Michigan Avenue.
"Ah-ma-zing. We had the best meal here. The corn bread in the skillet is to die for, and we had great entrees (the pork and a filet). I even had a small salad which was awesome. Service was good, attentive and fast. We'd go back in a heartbeat! Be sure to get a reservation. We had to reserve an earlier dinner time because they were already booked for later times, but we got in no problem and had a great experience. Really great food at a not too fussy place, if you aren't looking to get dressed up for dinner. And we had a great table overlooking the hustle and bustle on Michigan Ave."
"Best monte cristo-ish dip sandwich I've ever eaten.  And their oreo ice cream sandwich?  To die for.  Plus, I didn't mind all the extra work artichokes are, because Bandera's are delicious, and I won't even talk about their margs, because they put me over the edge (as you can tell, I was drinking on an empty stomach)."
Great service - terrific food. Limited menu but good food. I made a to go order but the what I had was terrific. I had the tuna poke appetizer and the asparagus - both yummy. Decor is nice and staff are attentive - stop in for dinner.
"As others have posted, this is a good spot to try.  Music was great and the food was amazing.I had the Veggie Burger.  Unreal!  I sat at the bar and all the bartenders were more than attentive.  I even had a manger come over to ask how everything was.I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a casual restaurant with a upscale service model!Looking forward to trying something else there sometime this weekend."
"Bandera is a wonderful place to take guests from out of town.  They are very accommodating, and they even have live jazz playing sometimes.  The foods itself is so good- favorites include the spinach and artichoke dip, macho salad, burgers, rotisserie chicken, and the desserts are fantastic!  While overpriced, you can't beat the location.  The service is also wonderful."
I made an unplanned dinner stop at Bandera. What an absolute delight! The server asked if we were heading to a show or an event - which we did and he worked with the kitchen staff to make sure that we were served quickly and our check was turned around promptly. The dinner was wonderful! The cornbread app was the best cornbread I have ever had. I can't enough great things about this place and know that I will be coming back very soon.
"This is my 3rd time eating here, last time I ate here was in 2004 and I remember they had live music and my husband and I were sat right by it-We couldn't talk to each other the whole time b/c of the music, so after that incident we haven't come back-Now that I live so close to Bandera I decided to try it out for lunch-They had a special today, Halibut with rice and cucumber salad, which I ordered-When my entree was brought out I could smell fish right away, but I decided to take a bite-My first bite was not good, so I asked for some lemon, 2 more bites and it was bad-I kept smelling this bad smell from the fish, as well it was dry in some spots and mushy in others, clearly not fresh fish-I informed the waitress I couldn't eat it and to take a whiff for it was not a good piece of fish, she was very apologetic about it and brought out a manager to our table who asked if I wanted anything else, so that was very nice-I decided to try the key lime pie but it wasn't that good, Joe's Stone Crab & Catch 35 have a good Key Lime pie-The person I went with had the Macho salad and she seemed to enjoy her salad, it was very big so she had leftovers she took with her and no complaints about her meal-So maybe they had an off day with their fish but I think it will be awhile before I eat here again-"
"Great service, great food, but they've been squeezing me for years on the Macho salad, my favorite Bandara entree.  It's now up to $16 and I just can't resist it.  If you're not on a diet, try the freshly baked jalapeno corn bread, it's really not that hot.   Yum, we like to bring the leftover cornbread home and dump some homemade chili on it before finishing it off.  Double yum!  Ask for a seat by the window if you want to gaze out onto Michigan Ave.  If the wait is too long, you can always get a bite while sipping some wine at the bar.  For lunch, get here by 11:30 am unless you have a reservation."
"Prime  Rib sandwich with what appeared to be creamy boursin cheese with au jous and horseradish spread was unbelievable.  The mac and cheese was very tasty.  Probably the best thing I tasted was the cornbread that had a nice combination of sweet and savory, probably a little more on the sweeter side which I prefer.  The skillet portion is more than one person would probably want or need, so definitely enough to share.  Nice location with a view of Michigan Ave, and the live jazz musicians were a nice touch as well.  Would recommend"
"This is my number one choice for dining out in Chicago when my father treats (he lives near by).  The decor is swank, the waitresses are pretty, attentive, efficient, bartenders know what glasses to use, how to mix the standard cocktails, they know what you mean when you ask them for a good single malt scotch.  The best seating is by the windows overlooking Michigan avenue.  I especially recommend this restaurant for tourists and business visitors to Chicago, though you should know they've got some enforcement of traditional table manners, you shouldn't wear your hat while you're eating, and turn off your mobile phones.  Every night there's an excellent jazz trio, which really sets the tone for the sophisticated ambiance, so considering the excellent atmosphere, the prices aren't really that unreasonable for Michigan avenue, Mag Mile.  Yes, they give the same great service even if you're wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, but really, it's not that kind of place, so for the love of Mike, put on an ironed dress shirt and jacket, guys.  They are known for their rotisserie chicken, which you can watch slow cooking in big glass front ovens, but their steaks and macaroni and cheese are both pretty good too.  The one problem with this place is the way they handle reservations.  You really need reservations most evenings, it's pretty popular and they've got primo location, but even with a reservation, you usually have to wait about 15 minutes.  They very rarely leave a table open for long, I think their odd system is set up to maximize table occupancy rather than to make sure that reservations are honored to the minute.  It's going to be even longer a wait (with reservations) if you want a window seat, but for me, it is worth that wait, the bar is comfortable, it's okay when you know ahead of time that's what's going to happen (the first time I had to wait with a reservation, I was a bit insulted, but it's what they do here).  For those of you who don't know the Chicago Magnificent Mile, parking around here is a crime, be prepared to fork over $30 bucks to the corporate running dog capitalist pig spineless followers of American imperialism parking lackeys.  If it's an option, a better choice, though smacking of socialism,  is to take the people's Red Line to Grand Ave (and you get to hear the automated voice say ""This is Grand,"" without any self awareness of the irony involved) for a short 5 block walk (well a long 5 block walk in winter)."
"I've been here for lunch several times and the food and service is always outstanding. One of the best things is getting a table by the window and seeing the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. while enjoying a nice meal. It its the perfect city lunch experience.I was actually in the elevator at work yesterday and a co-worker mentioned going to Bandera for dinner. Next thing you know, the whole elevator of random people we didn't know starting talking about how perfect the veggie burger. Now that's a sign of a good restaurant."
"Love Bandera's french dip sandwich and dip duo appetizer. Their margaritas are pretty awesome, too. It's a little loud, but other than that great food and atmosphere. The wait can be long (over an hour) so I definitely recommend making a reservation."
"At a burger cook off, they were picked as the best hamburger in the city.  I had to check it out myself.  Every part was perfect.  The bread had substance, the beef was juicy and cooked perfectly and just the right amount of toppings."
Excellent food and service but shitty ventilation - your hair and clothes smell greasy when you leave so I would never be able to go out after eating there unless I wanted to attract other smelly people. But it is very good food!
I've there twice already and it is a really nice place. With good musicians playing and great food!
The food is good and consistent. I generally go here for business lunches with clients. Bandera has this skillet cornbread which is really good. And my out of town business guests always seem to enjoy it. :) Not great for vegetarian's usually end up getting a salad. If you can get a window/street view it is always nice.
"I know it's already been mentioned several times, but let me just re-iterate that the the macho salad here is absolutely fan-freackin-tastic. The chicken tortilla soup (when it's there on special) is also worth your attention.With it's dimly let interior, and cozy yet swanky decor, you will easily be fooled into thinking it's about 6 hours later than it is. Very dangerous if you're planning for a one-hour lunch on a Wednesday and then several glasses of wine later you realize it's 2pm and you need to go back to work..."
"It was a rainy Chicago day when a colleague and I were looking for a good lunch. We asked the concierge at our hotel what he would recommend within walking distance, and Bandera it was.The very second we walked in, I picked up a J. Alexander's vibe. Make of that what you will. Then I smelled the rotisserie chicken cooking. Oh god, the chicken. It smelled. so. good. It was about 1:30-ish, so there was no wait. I ordered the spinach and chicken enchilada. It was really, really good. I had a taste of the French onion soup my colleague ordered and I approved. She liked her gigantic  salad, although I can't remember which one it was.The service was much more polished than you'd normally get a mid-level chain (I know this isn't a chain like Chili's, but still). I would like to go back next time I'm in Chicago -- one of my favorite cities to visit! -- but with so many other places I haven't yet tried there, it might be a while before I get to it. Although I am staying at that same hotel again this spring...."
"Nom nom nom. I'm eating yesterday's Prime Rib French Dip and swooning. Delicious!This place is so good that it really doesn't matter that the menu only has 20 things on it. Just ignore that and try something! It's all so, so, so, so yum. Even the artichoke appetizer was as craveable as any jalapeno poppers you'd find anywhere else. It's low ceilings and low lighting at Bandera, and it makes for a very intimate atmosphere--even though it's packed. I'd describe it as Chicago cool. Swankier than it is romantic, Bandera's drinks are strong and mixed well. I had some kinda Ginger beer and dark rum cocktail that I didn't feel at all but I surely could taste!We saw the bass player, et al, setting up as we left. Wish we coulda stayed for the jazz. This place is a great downtown date spot, but here's a tip: You'll definitely want to make reservations."
"The location is great-it's in the middle of all the great shopping on Michigan Avenue. That's about the only great thing about this, other than the customer service. The staff is really nice. However, there is always a wait (you should probably just make reservations). The water told me that the restaurant is known for their prime rib sandwich, so that is what I ordered. It tasted like something you'd get from Arby's except that it cost me $20. I was highly disappointed! It was way overpriced."
"-Bandera's gets five stars because of their Macho Salad (sans dates). Have it, period, end of discussion. -Great place to take people visiting Chicago because it's on Michigan.-Make a reservation if you don't want to wait 45 to an hour for regular seating, an hour for sitting by the window, at peak dinner hours (7ish-8ish)-Service is always good. Hostesses range from nice to really nice. I've had Stacey as my waitress twice now (since I insist on sitting by the windowed seats for the view of Mich Ave.) and she is wonderful. Aside from the fabulous Macho Salad:-The queso dip is tasty and not the goopy cheese dip I was expecting, the mac and cheese is really good, I am obsessed with the Oreo dessert, and the banana cream pie is good.-The lamb sandwich tastes like roast beef and someone at the table next to me said the SAME thing when we asked how she liked it. I, however, don't like the gamey lamb taste so I welcomed the roast beef-ish situation. -Their fries are thin and yummy; always salted to my liking.-The ribs are tender, fall-off-the-bone goodness. I detest BBQ/A1 style sauce and I still was able to appreciate. A little too much sauce, though, but that's just me. Maybe someone who likes BBQ would disagree.-Oh and I almost forgot. The jumbo artichoke appetizer is YUM!-It could definitely be more affordable.Oh and the place reminds me of Houston's on Biscayne in North Miami. Turns out, they're part of the chain. It's no wonder."
Food was great service was wonderful will be going back!
"Went back there after a year...the service was great, no question about it..had a French Dip sandwich with fries.... it was OK, but NOT worth freeking $18 dollars.... and to their famous banana cream pie?  This time, for some reason-maybe they changed the recipe... it was truly disgusting... mealy, mushy and just not good......nice place but WAY overpriced..."
"This is somewhat of a hidden gem in Chicago. Everything on the menu is amazing. BY FAR the best queso dip I have ever had. I don't know what's in there, but it is crazy. I rarely order salads and I almost can't go here and not get the Macho salad. The hacked chicken salad is also really good. Great roasted chicken. Great burger. It's all great. It's also always busy, so expect a wait. It's a tad expensive for lunch. It's pretty dark in here so it's not always great for a group dinner. And you can't get a table with more than 6 people. But it's definitely worth the wait if there are a few of you."
"Everything about Bandera is forgettable.The space feels claustrophobic--dark, with low ceilings. And again, my phobia of seeing my food be prepared is highlighted here, as much of the food prep/expo is done right in the middle of the restaurant. The smell of rotisserie chickens wafts through the air, reminding me of the local Jewel or Dominicks.The menu is limited and simple. Simplicity is a good thing, but the food always leaves something to be desired. I have had the roasted chicken w/green rice, the prime rib w/mashed potatoes, the macho salad....and while the food was always edible, it just never quite hit the spot. Simple ideas, simple presentation, but just blah flavors.And worst of all--the place doesn't take reservations. Come ON!"
"My usual prejudice against chain restaurants prohibits me from giving Bandera 5 stars. Bandera doesn't even get a fourth star because eating here can be so irritating sometimes. One thing I hate more than chain restaurants is tourists. Especially when they get all up in my way when I'm trying to get some lunch. Also, although I like live music, I can do without jazz drumming in my ear at 1PM.On the other hand, the food at Bandera is pretty darn good. Check out the Macho salad and the little cornbread skillets. Do not, I repeat, Do NOT skip the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich. Have it as a side dish, or for dessert, whatever."
"Yummy comfort food with excellent service.  What's not to like? The crowd we were with were of the sharing variety in which we were passing samples of what we ordered to everyone else.  That was pretty awesome.The roasted chicken that I ordered was excellent.  I ended up trimming my half bird and mixed it in with my rice.  Too bad that day didn't have me in the situation to wrap some up to have later in the weekend :(My favorite was the sausage.  I wasn't sure what kind of sausage it was, but if someone could tell me, that would be awesome so that I could look them up.  Of course, lame penis jokes abounds with our lovely female friend who ordered it.  I'm not saying... I'm just saying... yeah we love you too ;)The tuna salad was solid.  It didn't come off as much of a surprise that 3 people at our table ordered it.The seasoning on the lamb sandwhich was reminiscent of Good Seasons italian dressing mix.... which isn't a bad thing at all!  However it makes it thaaaaat much less special.All that great food at generous portions with extremely attentive courteous service just makes me say, who the freak cares if it's a chain?"
I have had better food in the area...   really nothing special but our waiter was really nice thus the extra star :)
"I've been going here since it opened - always a good meal and even better margaritas. Yesterday, Scott (manager) was exceptionally helpful with a takeout order. My wife is allergic to gluten and I needed to bring an order back(because I forgot to let them know..my bad). Scott was incredibly accommodating and comped me a margarita while I waited at the bar for the food. Great food AND great service - even at the height of an evening rush - thanks, Scott."
"Veggie Burger. Veggie Burger. Veggie Burger. It's pink, which is kind of confusing cuz I normally don't eat pink foods... or like... ever eat pink foods... cuz what foods are pink? But it's made with beets and it comes with shoestring french fries and that's why it is amazing."
"Bandera has a limited menu, but what they have is fantastic; macho salad and chicken sandwich (substitute) are amazing. The atmosphere is awesome, and the window-seat people-watching cannot be beat! A table by the window is a must, the scene after a snow fall is extraordinary."
"Lovely ambiance, gorgeous wait staff, and  tasty appetizers--loved the Mac and cheese, salads, and Oreo cookie dessert. I give it a three because the main courses aren't super exciting and $17 is a lot for a hamburger. The cornbread in the cast iron skillet looks heavenly. This is a great place to plop on a stool at the bar by yourself or with a friend for a good drink and delicious live jazz music."
"nice ambiance, excellent service and very good food - this quiet restaurant above the ""magnificent mile"" was a welcome lunch retreat - i read about the big macho salad (or whatever it was called) and it was really really good - my only complaint was the fries - while nice and hot, i think the grease was a bit old and there was a burnt flavor on them - like the grease had been used too long - that said i would go back -"
"I really thought this place was going to be super touristy based on it's location - and being that we had a friend in from out of town and were walking the Mag Mile tyring not to starve to death, I decided to give it a shot anyway.Seriously, Ms-Hostess-Lady was the best.  Normally we get seated in the back corner near the kitchen.  I'm not sure why.  But this super wonderful lady seated us in the front corner at the window, just to the side of the quiet (but good) live jazz.  What a way to let us show off the city to someone who has never been here before!  Thank you!The drinks were decent, but the food was really great.  My SO and I both had the specials - he had the special soy steak and I had the crabcakes.  Our friend had the pork chops.  WOW.  The pork chops were an inch and a half thick and looked cooked to perfection.  The crabcakes were almost completely crab - no filler or stale breadcrumbs to muck it up.  They were excellent.  But, I really was jealous of my SO's soy steak.  He was sad that they were out of the steak entree he ordered and got this as a backup.  After we were done eating, he said that he thought it should be a staple on the menu because it was so good.We had really attentive service, where they fill your water glass after ever sip and bring you an extra napkin once you've dropped yours before you have the chance to ask.I'd definitely go back and not just with someone from out of town."
"Took my daughter here for dinner on 10/13/11.  We had an awesome experience!  Even though it was crowded, we only waited 25 minutes for a table!  We ordered an appetizer and was not rushed for our dinner order.  I had a fillet for dinner (one of the best I've eaten) and my daughter had a veggie burger - she said it was the best veggies burger she's ever had, and even took home a doggie bag!  The live jazz was delightful.  Overall it was just a really nice evening.  I would highly recommend!!"
Bland and expensive.
"Love the service and professionalism of this well run restaurant conglomerate in California. But hate to say this location in Chicago, based on my call experience today on 11/20 at 7.30 CT...to reserve a table or tables for a party of 10 people, wasnt very accomodating to my request for a dinner party this size. I was put on hold three times while the gal was getting other calls (I presume) only to be told that we cannot take more than a party of six. I asked if we can make two reservations for two tables of 5 and unfortunately it couldnt work out (even a month + in advance of the reservation date). So I called Morton's Steakhouse and...............no problemo. YES, thanks to Mortons, they'll be getting our $600 + check!"
"instead of 4 stars im actually giving them 5 because of the decor and some of the rare taste they have. It's definitely not a fusion but their taste is so unique. It is bit pricy but not $$$$. I get this bread thing as a starter and they taste GREAT. Their food, I'd give them 4. I think it is must try place if you are living around the loop."
"The prices here aren't that bad in regards to location. First time I went, I had the ribeye special. Very tasty, but it was only a special. My second time around, I got the roasted chicken. Yikes. That was incredible. Wish I had that both times. Oh, and the cornbread. You don't walk out of here without trying some of that cornbread."
"Been here many many times. Great food, good service. Highlights:Hacked chicken salad is awesome.Fish of the day sandwich is huge and perfectky cooked every time.Cornbread skillet is unique and a must.The peanut cole slaw is surprisingly filling and delicious.The place is not cheap, but has a nice atmosphere and is consistently good. Very hard to get in for lunch between noon and 12:45. Either show up right before noon or at about 1 pm and you wiill be set for a great lunch experience!"
"As we walked into Bandera last night I had nothing on my mind but their fabulous Veggie burger, then my husband pointed out the Butternut and White Cheddar Enchilada.  Holy smokes - what a great meal.  Paired with Mexican rice and I subbed braised red cabbage with goat cheese for the standard escabeche, I can't wait to go back and have that meal again."
"Looking back I cant say that I have had too many bad eating experiences in the Chi...I guess asking 25 ppl on the street where you can find the best of ""anything"" everytime you go is a sure fire way of making sure you eat very, very well.I ate at Bandera based on the recommendation of a friend who said they had the best veggie burgers in the world.  I had never had a veggie burger, and quite frankly wasnt looking forward to it.  Vegetables? Made like a burger?  Huh...oh hells to the naw!My first time going to Bandera I didnt order the Veggie burger, but I did get a quick sample, and that sample was enough to let me know that I the next time I came back, I HAD to have my own.The veggie burgers here are amazing....amazing enough that a carnivore like myself that cant imagine living life without meat, really did seriously entertain the thought for at least a week.From what I understand, that burger is one of the best you are going to get, so I cant say what it might be like if the quality goes down....but I can say Bandera is a top rate eatery in Chicago.  Sitting atop Michigan Avenue on the second floor of some random store/bldg, you get a great view of the city (mich ave).  I can only imagine how this place looks at night...I am sure simply beautiful.Additionally the spinach dip is pretty darn good as well.  Its been a minute, but I remember the bread being pretty tasty here.Also, they do a mexican tortilla soup that works well prior to that veggie burger!!!Bandera is A-1!  You must try the veggie burger---Signing off,  Scott-- carnivore facing a quarter life vegetarian crisis."
"I heart this restaurant!  Their attentive staff went above and beyond during the many times I've visited.  Their food is always perfect, cornbread is the best and the garbage salad and don't get me started with their prime rib and BBQ pork ribs.  I could go on and on about all the food we love b/c it's practically the whole menu.  Ambience is perfect, overlooking the bustling crowds of Chicago on Michigan Ave.  Always try to request a table near the window...unless I'm there and want my own window-side table!Jazz is a wonderful compliment, only sometimes it gets loud so just be aware if you want conversation or live music.  If you want to talk, I'd recommend further away from the entertainment.  Reservations are a must for dinner."
"I think this is a chain owned by Hillstone (houston's, etc)... which is why i was surprised that the prime rib was so bland and no so good. I am also not a fan of the mashed potatoes that were served - they had a lot of onions in them.  My fiance had the macho salad, which was actually better than my prime rib. This is the only time in my life i have claimed that a salad trumps prime rib.  The live piano player was a nice touch.Fast seating, friendly server. I think there are better offerings in the area though."
"Just as most others said, you have to get the macho salad. You won't be disappointed!Something has changed at Bandera but maybe it's the economy. I remember a time that if you tried to eat there over the noon lunch hour, getting a table without waiting was unheard of.  My friend and I walked right in today at 12:30pm and were seated immediately - no complaints here! Just an observation."
Amazing food. Had the mac and cheese and cornbread for appitizers. Then ordered the french dip and the butternut squash and cheddar enchilada. Amazing. Wish they had a better draft beer selection tho.
"The hubby and I enjoyed a nice dinner at Bandera yesterday!  We appreciate all the reviews by fellow Yelpers and must agree: the rotisserie chicken and Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert were fantastic!  The hubs dubbed the chicken the best he's ever had.  We enjoyed the cornbread and foccacia as a starter.  We weren't sure what to expect, but it was seriously YUM!  Great homemade cornbread and foccacia with guacamole.  Next, he had the rotisserie chicken and I took our server's suggestion and had the Macho Salad, which was also great.  Then we finished with the Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert.  The meal was great and we really enjoyed the live jazz.  We'll go again!!"
"This place is great - come here often when in Chicago.  The decor is great, food is always good.. plus a busy bar and live jazz band.  Service has always been excellent for me.Definitely get a table by the window overlooking Michigan Ave if you can."
The reviews were right--- handmade oreos were orgasmic! PLEASE PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE OUT!!!!
Bandera's prime rib french dip sandwich was the single best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  All other food has grown bland and tasteless in comparison.  I could have written a poem about it.
"Great place, perfect for first dates.  I have had several bad first dates here - but always Bandera is worthy of another.  Seriously the ambiance, food quality, it's great.  My bff and I always consider this ""our place"""
"Saw the name Bandera sitting on top of the awning but never knew exactly what to think until searching for the name via google. Saw the menu online and still wasn't super impressed. For a vegetarian, had options where I did not have to make up a menu selection myself. Got the veggie burger and it was phenomenal. Fresh ingredients and just enough! Not the heavy gross feeling you get from eating certain foods.  I substituted the roasted peanut slaw - for fries. *fry addict* perhaps should have stayed with the slaw. Fries were whatever."
"Last night I went to Bandera on Michigan Avenue for the first time and was so surprised at what I'd been missing! It was pretty busy, but it was also a Friday night so I'd expected that. What I did not expect was the hostess asking if I would like to dine at the ""counter."" What an awesome experience! I sat at the counter which offers views of the kitchen so I got to see all of the dishes prepared right before my eyes. The atmosphere was really great; the kitchen staff was very friendly and the servers and managers worked effortlessly to get the food out to the tables quickly. I really felt like I was part of the action at the counter and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to foodies like me. Even though I was practically sitting in the kitchen, I could still hear and enjoy the jazz band playing in the front of the restaurant, which created a really sophisticated ambience. My server was really friendly and very fast and helped me choose the Spinach and Chicken Enchiladas (YUM!). She also helped me choose a beer I'd never tried before called Victoria, and told me that they just started selling this delicious Mexican beer in the states. All in all, the experience I had at Bandera was terrific; definitely go there and sit at the counter and try something new! I will definitely be going back soon!"
"The bar crowd at this location is much better than the one in CDM. Not as many cougars, or old dudes thinking they are 20 something. TNA (Tony, Natalie, and Ambrose) are all super cool, and make the time there worthwhile. The new chicken salad is amazing. And of course, the enchilada is as good as it gets!"
"Looking for huge portions guaranteed to keep you full for the next 3 days?Head to Bandera.  The food is delicious, the service is friendly, and the location is absolutely perfect for taking a break from downtown shopping.  I will say that the place is pretty dark.  I felt like I needed to break out my cell phone to read the menu, and we went in for lunch."
"This has become one of my favorite Chicago restaurants. Atmosphere is great, amazing view of Michigan avenue with low lights that put you in a great mood at any time of the day. The food is excellent and priced very well considering the quality. Their soup of the day is superb. I had the black bean chilly. The macho salad is a beautiful combination of greens, dates, goat cheese and other goodies dressed with a wonderful vinaigrette. Roasted chicken is what they are famous for, but if you feel like having a steak, ribs or a cheeseburger you will find some of the best here. No meal is complete without Bandera's famous cornbread served in it's own pan right out of the oven. Great staff, fast and efficient service make this a Chicago favorite."
"Bandera has such a warm atmosphere. A dark room with a piano/drum/bass trio playing jazz as good as that I've heard at Andy's.  Spot lighting at each table permits patrons to read the menu while maintaining the dark warmth of the place.  When I ask a server to help me choose between three glasses of Pinot Noir, I'm usually told ""they're all good"" or ""it depends on what you like"" or ""this one's from California!"".  By contrast, my server knew all of the wines and provided excellent advise.  Also, she was friendly and attentive without being overly watchful.Based on yelp, had the macho salad and a side order of cornbread.  The warm dense cornbread was especially comforting.  The salad was fine, not especially haute cuisine, but filling and inventive."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago simply for the Center-Cut Filet with Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Spinach. It's delicious. ( And when I'm feeling really gluttonous, the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches for dessert. Heavenly. )They have live jazz musicians playing on the weekend and I enjoy the candle lit tables. It is on the pricey side - but it's worth it.  It's conveniently located across the street from the 600 N. Michigan movie theater so my friends and I often make it a part of our ""Dinner and Movie"" plans.The only downside is that they don't take reservations so you could end up waiting for a table on weekend evenings during peek hours."
"My fiance ate here on a business lunch and something truly unforgivable happened, in my opinion. The men finished their lunch and my fiance's business associate paid the check. A few minutes later, the manager came out and asked if everything was okay. She launched into a speech about how waiters at Bandera try to take care of their guests and how the guests need to then ""take care of"" their server. Basically, she was chastising a businessman for not leaving a big enough tip. I worked in food service for 10 years and yes, bad tippers stink. But to give a lecture about a subjectively bad tip to a businessman when he may or may not be conducting important business over lunch is unacceptable. I haven't been to Bandera and I certainly won't go now. Etiquette is not dead and I'd rather not eat in a place that has managers who feel the need to school their patrons in the art of handing over their money."
"I visited here in March based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The cornbread was as fantastic as raved about and the location rather enjoyable overall. Piano inside the main seating area suggested a romantic night atmosphere, but I had a great time with girlfriends for lunch as well! Worth trying. :)"
"We stopped in after a long day on Michigan Ave. Pretty and intimate setting in case anyone is looking for a date night. Portions are pretty big and you could easily share or take home. We had a nice window table that overlooked Michigan Ave.  We tried their burgers and steak sandwich, all of which was excellent. The chicken seemed to be the thing to try as it did look good on the pit when you walked in. We also had the cornbread which was absolutely awesome. Very soft and moist and even someone in our group who didnt care for cornbread devoured most of it. Make reservations or plan on waiting. Casual Nice attire to dressy. Pretty pricey entrees."
"I came here after work with my team and it was just ok.  The meal was good, but it was a little overpriced.  I found the service to be good but the ambience was a little weird.  It was very dark, almost night club-ish, which seemed inappropriate since we were there at 5 in the afternoon.  I wouldn't pick this place but if I had to go back I am sure the meal would be ok.  Not very memorable."
"Bandera is a fantastic restaurant, with a great location, excellent food, and very good service. The specialty is rotasserie roasted chicken and chops (don't miss the huge rotasserie on the right when you walk in), but they also have good steaks and (as erinklema notes!) great burgers. I can also recommend the macho salad. The restaurant overlooks Michigan Avenue, and is kind of dark and cozy. The last time I was there (for dinner) there was live music (piano, drums, bass) that was very enjoyable. Don't miss Bandera!"
"Great view of Michigan Avenue.I ate here after finishing the Chicago marathon last fall, and a few times after that. After the marathon I was able to fully enjoy every bite of my food.Queso dip is great. Great burgers. Lots of cheese. I love cheese. Had a side of Mac n' cheese and it is delish. The breadcrumbs on top, make it amazing.Great view of Michigan Avenue. Highly recommend bringing out-of-town guests here for the great view, along with ""normal"" food. I've had problems taking out of towners to food that is just to upscale or fancied up. Bring people here for great rotisserie chicken and burgers and fries and mac and cheese.Upscale comfort food says it best. Oh yes...the cornbread is great too!"
"Bandera, a good stop for my first time in Chicago. There were many franchise chain restaurants in this windy city and I'm glad to have landed upon this very delicious restaurant!I suggest a reservation be made in advance to avoid the wait, especially when you know there is a convention of some sort in town, cause it gets busy! But if you like to be spontaneous there is shopping around the corner you can do while waiting, and a Citibank and Bank of America right by it if you need some cash money money. We had a 40 minute wait for a walk-in on a Monday night. You can also get the full menu at the bar if you don't want to wait.The portions were large and worth the money. If you're on a budget you can get an appetizer and share the entree and still be able to enjoy wonderful food. I got a pork dish that came with two large pork chops. they were thick and yummy, the sauce on it was what made it delicious. My friend got the roasted chicken and it came with breast leg thigh almost half a chicken! Sides need to be ordered separately like most fancy restaurants so if you want to include some veggies in this meal better order it on the side.It was a bit too dark in the place I couldn't even see the band and had to sit at a certain angle to read the menu.Live music playing is awesome, very jazzy and fun. Service was great but when i asked for extra sauce she gave me maple syrup and insisted that it was the sauce....... when i insisted back that there was apricot in the sauce.They don't take discover card, so no bonus points for me. I hate having my cards rejected its embarrassing Overall I had a good experience, you can see a glance of the kitchen and the food was delicious and reasonably priced for the portion. Good location right in the heart of shopping and good for tourist since its where you'd be hanging out! 5 stars =]"
I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I feel like some of the restaurants on the mag mile are hit or miss but this place was definitely a hit.  The atmosphere is comfortable and laid back.  I had the macho salad - incredible and really filling.  It's a great lunch spot when friends are in town or during a long day of shopping.
"I like coming here for lunch - just not on the weekends when it gets far too crowded.  There's usually a wait, but I always manage to find space at the bar.  It's great that it's off the street, and the dark/men's club atmosphere is calming.  Food's always good.  I usually go for the burger or lamb sandwich, but have had the grilled artichokes often, and all my friends rave about their salads.  Good service, and even though it can get crowded, you never have to scream at your dining partners."
Came here for a business lunch one time and was quite impressed. This place reminds me of J Alexander but done better. I don't usually like cornbread but the cornbread here served in a cast iron is awesome!
Love this place! Friendly staff. Great food
"I miss this place!The macho chicken salad, the famous cheeseburger and I really miss the queso dip appetizer.  This is the best appetizer in all of Chicago. So good its totally worth walking through all the tourists to get to.  The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because the last time I was there I ordered a drink which was missing the vodka (they comped us later ;) and ordered the burrata (a seasonal cheese), which just tasted like soft mozzarella...we still doubt it was really burrata..."
"I ate here when I was in Chicago on business. I really liked the atmosphere with the intimate setting and live music. I had the salmon dish which was really good. My coworker had the filet and although he liked it, he thought the mashed potatoes could have been better. I would recommend this restaurant!"
Great atmosphere and view.  Big portions of good food.
"While visiting Chicago we heard that Bandera was a great place.I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of my meal here.  We had the queso and the corn bread as an appetizer and both were amazing.  The queso is served cold and had the perfect amount of kick to it.  The corn bread was also great, had jalapenos in it.  For a meal, I got the roasted pork chops and they were soo good!  I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes because they were loaded with green onions and I'm not an onion fan.  My boyfriend got the ribs and the meat was falling off the bone, so moist and the sauce was great!Our waitress was very nice, attentive.  We had plenty of wine and she brought us over a few samples for us to try out.Bandera is owned by Hillstone Group.  They also own Houston's in Boston which I've been to but wasn't as much of a fan of Houston's as I am of Bandera."
"OH Macho salad.  I don't know why I don't really think of loving you in Newport, but its only in Chicago that I want to call upon you with your chicken, goat cheese, dates, corn and deeeelish dressing (on the side of course).  And then the cornbread croutons. These could be an appetizer all by themselves.  Would that be so wrong?  Our service was on point. Almost too aggressive with refilling at every moment.  Let me just TALK to the person that I am enjoying my lunch with. Geeze. Your iced tea woke me up all day!  I rarely have to use a packet of splenda at all, let alone a whole one....but I did here!  Tis OK, I'll be back for the salad.  I just love it since its the perfect boyfriend when I am in the 312."
"I've been coming to Bandera for years because the food and drinks are incredibly yummy. However, the service is only adequate until your check comes. The food comes so fast that you barely have time to talk to your dinner companion(s). Then, no more water for you! When you ask for more water after you have already paid, the wait staff will sigh and begrudgingly pour you more. In fact, they may take your glass away! This has happened to me.I've never tempted it, but if I stay 5 minutes after my check is paid, they may have security escort me out."
"My wife & I ate here on a Saturday early evening after arriving late in town. This place absolutely hit the spot. We had a drink at the bar before being seated and then enjoyed the Roasted chicken, ribs with peanut coleslaw. Good sized portions and good value."
"Oh my god - the Macho Salad is amazing!  Perfect mix of sweet (dates, cornbread croutons, dressing) and salty (goat cheese).  When it arrived, I thought, wow, this is huge!  I'll never be able to eat it all!  But, then I did.  It was addicting.And yes, cornbread croutons.  Who'd have thought?The only thing was that there was so many people waiting on me, I was totally confused!"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Poke tuna!  the Macho salad is another favorite of mine!"
"had no idea that this was owned by the same folks who own gulfstream and houstons. who would've guessed? and this is a chain? a chain that was truly an unforgettable experience (maybe because i was in chicago) but i say this because i usually like to go to a restaurant that is either authentic or not to be.a southwestern/american restaurant ... extremely tasty!!! their enchilada dish was off the hook, and not to mention their veggie burger ... i normally never order a dish outside of a given cuisine, since bandera does advertise itself as an american restaurant, but i was in for a surprise! the veggies and the rice on the side was definitely delightful... for app? we ordered spinach dip, which could've used a lil more flavor... but i'm not complaining, considering the fact that most of the other places ive tried out in chicago was SALLLTTTTYYY!!! :*(the restaurant overlooks mag mile, so make sure to get a window seat as one can never get TOO bored people watching... bandera also has a nice touch, with dim lights and candles in almost every corner. not to mention, their interior, such comfy smooth booths! me likey! felt like an evening date, even in the day time... a cozy, dark, yet a private restaurant where you can actually HEAR your date.. you walk in and you're simply facing the kitchen...TIP: if you're a jazzy lover, then i hear this place is the place to be in the evening... in conclusion, i must say, great service,great food, and great prices (remember, we ARE in chicago!)"
"I've seen this place passing by Michigan Avenut but I never really felt like trying it. Maybe it's bc it's in a really touristy area, and I try to avoid that. I finally did come here, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty romantic setting too. I tried a few good dishes, including the side of the cornbread."
"The lone missing star here is only because of the atmosphere - it's a bit suit-and-tie power-lunchy, but don't let that deter you.The food is GREAT. Their specialty is roasted chicken, which you can see being spit-roasted all the time, and is always delicious.They have a Southwestern flair - try the yummy enchiladas.This is the perfect place for a more refined weekday lunch experience. It's not dirt cheap (but it's worth it), so try to put it on the company card.  ;-)"
"I have been here for lunch twice as it is across from my office.  This place is fantastic.  and packed.  Both times I had to sit at the bar since they were so crowded.  Both times I ate here, I ordered the Macho Salad, it was so good the first time that I had to go back for more.  The service is very attentive and the scene is pretty cool.  It is a bit pricey, but deffo worth it."
"Cool atmosphere, though very dark for lunch I thought.  The food was great- mac and cheese and rotisserie chicken were both awesome choices.  Service was super friendly.  Not a huge menu, but a good menu."
"One of my favorite places to go out for lunch when downtown.The Macho Salad is the main reason. My favorite salad. Tasty and substantial, it will hold me over well into dinner.The room is very elegant, nice booths. and tables by the window overlooking Michigan Ave. Even during peak times, the wait is never long for a table. And I've always had a good table or booth. The waiters are all very professional, white shirt black pants. White tablecloths, but not too fancy. I've never been for dinner though. That fact that you can't get any delivery service and pickup only during certain times makes it even more desirable.Also, be sure to get either cornbread or the bread plate. It's awesome.I have also had the prime rib sandwich. Very good."
"Houstons this is not....but a nice subsitute.  I've eaten here many times but I thought I'd leave a review this time.  My problem with this place is not the food but the waitstaff.  Most of the waiters/waitresses have the facade of a Spiaggia's waiter but they have the couth of Applebees' waitstaff.  I have a hard time wrapping my brain around this one.  They are indifferent, inattentive, and non deserving of the any of the tip percentages listed, so kindly, on the bill.  They've got one more visit out of me just for the holidays and then I'll just travel to the nearest Houstons via airbus."
"This is a place you can go to on a date, with your family, with friends, or even colleagues.  It's great for lunch or dinner.  I recommend making a reservation to get a spot by the window for during the day - a great view of bustling Michigan Ave!  Or a nice cozy booth in the evening on a Friday to enjoy the live jazz.  The interior is really cozy and mod with dark cherry woods. It's not too easy to find.  I've met a couple of people here and they have somewhat of hard time finding it as you have to enter a retail building and take an escalator.  It's a great place to even just sit at the bar as they have a nice wine and cocktail selection (however a bit pricey).  Definitely an older crowd. Onto the food... The cornbread skillet is a must order!  It is the cornbread that I compare every other cornbread to.  It's cheesy and has jalapenos in it which is sooo good.  I really love their burgers and their rotisserie chicken.  Their rotisserie chicken is so perfect and juicy.  And I love their skinny shoe string sized fries. If there's room after their generous portions I devour their Oreo cookie sandwich."
"At Bandera you could throw a dart at the menu and be sure to hit something delightful. I've had sandwiches, fish, salads... The menu is short, but every dish is well-designed (great colors, textures, and balanced flavors) and executed (fresh, fresh, fresh). I've never been less than thrilled with my meal. I mean, the chicken Caesar salad has rotisserie chicken in it, for chrissakes! Without having read the Yelp reviews, I ordered the macho salad last night. Fantastic. Fresh avocado, dates, goat cheese, rotisserie chicken... and the cornbread croutons. I mean seriously, who makes cornbread croutons? Man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.There are plenty of tables by the front window from which you get a good view of Michigan Avenue -- not quite as charming as it was before The Gap and its brethren jacked Michigan, but what the hell, it's better that the view at Billy Goat's. During busy lunches, you can also sit at one of the few seats by the open kitchen, which actually protrudes out into the room. Very cool to watch the process up close if you're a foodie. The bar is a fine place to eat but, oddly, none of the bar tenders seems to know how to tap a beer. I've never had a pint that had less than an inch of head. I mean, if I wanted head, I'd... never mind. If you sit on the northwest side of the bar at night you'll not only get a front-row seat for the live jazz, you'll get to hang with the band between sets.I've had mostly really outstanding service here, though last night was just ho-hum (I sat at the bar).And for what what you get and where it's located, this place is stupid-cheap."
more like a gastropub or at least the food was.
"The food is amazing, very comfort food. Their roasted chicken, steaks, salads are all delicious; but the best is their mashed potatos. Although the restuarant is pretty small the large mirror covered wall creates an openness through out the room; plus if you're seated next to the mirror you can check if you have anything stuck in your teeth haha  just kidding. But seriously the whole decor is very romantic and elegant but there is also a live band playing jazz which is a plus and minus due to it creating a hip downtown feeling but it's hard to hold a conversation due to it being a small room with tons of people on top of that live music. However, there was i believe the kitchen or some type of oven area where the food was plated and it was nice to be able to see the food being plated and served. I recommend this place for a date but not for large groups."
Well.... if you're looking to be a modern Don Draper... look no further. Love Bandera's. Come when they're playing live jazz... super swanky. One of my favorite Chicago restaurants. Nothing I've tried here disappointed me. Traditional American menu.
"I don't know if this place is really good or if I was just shocked to find a decent place on Michigan avenue;  so i went back.  It was good.  I went back again, good.  So, I like this place.If you can get a spot by the window take it...people watching...but the cozy horseshoe boothes in the back are great.Food is good.  Not stellar, but solid.  I've liked everything I've had, although nothing stands out, even as I write this.It's just nice to know it's there so I can avoid the Cheesecake Factory and his more expensive sister the Grand Luxe Cafe when I'm down on Michigan Avenue.P.S.  WARNING!!!  Arianna Furs is in the same building...whether you like it or not you will walk in and out of the building with that arianna furs jingle in your head....it's a bitch to get out"
"Food was great, same with service.  Very friendly atmosphere, met a few interesting people resulting in great conversations. The rotisserie chicken is highly recommended.  Will definitely go here again."
"Stellar service, very good food but overpriced."
All about location right on Michigan Ave. Food is a-ok.
"The Macho Salad is awesome - roasted chicken, avocado, almonds, dates and goat cheese - whaaaaaaat?  Will definitely check them out on another visit to Chitown."
"Visited in Nov '10 while downtown for mi esposa cunple anos.  It was a great time.  Bar was packed there was not enough room.  We managed.  Light ""classical salsa"" music playing in the background set a good tone.  I had cucumber martini and Susy a pomegranate martini it was not limited to one, ""it felt so good on the lips""!  I love when a kitchen is right out in the open!  It's entertaining and now with all the shows it's a quasi contact sport.  Roasted chicken with spanish rice was excellent.  Service was prompt as was food.  Only one drawback, the martinis were $15, which look were out and about for her birthday and I didn't really care, but it's just stupid to charge a high price for just being able to do it.  Cheers!"
I had dinner here with some girlfriends last night and really enjoyed myself.  I had the roasted chicken with Spanish rice and it was delicious.  My margarita was also very good.  The atmosphere is nice (classy but not snooty) and the piano-and-upright-bass combo playing near the bar was a nice touch.  The service was good.  I'll be coming back to try other things on the menu.
"Came here last Friday night with my boyfriend on a whim. I have been wanting to try it out just based on the fact that I like the Hillstone restaurant group restaurants. I was a regular at Houston's in Austin and in Boston so I thought if this is anything like that I will like it. This place is nothing like any of the other sister restaurants. It's terrible.First, we ordered two drinks at the bar while we waited for a table, both of which were overly sweet and mostly like sour mix. Then we sat down and our server came over, who was very enthusiastic and polite (my complain is definitely all about the food here). She told us the specials, one of which was a sea bass. My boyfriend ordered that and I had the chicken and spinach enchiladas. Our food came both of which were served with the exact same sides, which lack a little creativity in my mind. The enchilada was ok, nothing great. The sea bass might have been the most overcooked piece of fish I have ever seen. I am not a great chef, but it wouldn't have taken much to cook that fish better than this person did. Overcooked fish at a nice restaurant is a huge no no. All in all I left $85 poorer and completely unsatisfied. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again. I am actually really upset I went in the first place."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants to bring out of town people when we are shopping on Michigan Ave.  It's right in the heart of Michigan Ave. and it sits above the shops, so there's a decent view.  I've been for dinner a couple of times too and it's solid for dinner as well.  I would definitely not hesitate suggesting this to an out of towner since it has something for everyone and good drinks.  I usually always get the cornbread....yummy!  and their Macho salad (I think that's the name).  It's got chicken, goat cheese, dates...it's delicious and very filling.  I've had a fish entree here and a couple other things as well and they were good.  The service has always been good.A solid choice, especially for lunch on the Mag. Mile."
"I went there on Friday night in my quest to try one new restaurant each month. Based on the Yelp reviews, Bandera was the restaurant choice of the month. The food was mediocre, but the service and ambiance was very reminiscent of the old days of Houston's. I started with the spinach dip and it was just too bland, salt was added and it still lacked flavor. The entree chosen was the roasted chicken with spanish rice and although the chicken was flavored and very moist, the sauce that came with it had way too much chili spice for my taste. The spice was over bearing and after a while it just became unappealing. The oreo cookie dessert was probably the best part of the meal. If this review was based on the service, Bandera would have received four stars because they were outstanding. I never had to wait for anything, it was a team effort. If there was something that needed to be done it was taken care of by whomever was passing my table at that moment. It was very much ""Houston's"". I don't think I will be going back, but I will recommend it to others based on the service alone."
"If asked about this place I'd have to say it's an all around good experience. The atmosphere is great, the food was excellent, the drinks were quick, and they have nightly jazz. This was a great first experience especially with the added bonus of looking over the ""Mag Mile"" decorated for Christmas."
"Been here a couple of times. Additional tidbits  - the place follows a similar layout as Houston's as one friend pointed out. Indeed, the same holding company runs both. Bumped up to 5 stars, due to consistently good service. Cornbread is compelling and they do bring more chips (if asked) for the spinach and artichoke dip. The meat worth craving a visit has been consistently the chicken based ones. Though the prime NY strip is excellent, I would recommend a classic Chicago steak house for the experience and the price is a bit rich. Overall, a bit pricey for lunch though dinner is reasonable given the location, view and overall service."
"I have been to this place numerous times over the years and I just went again today.   I wouldn't really call it a chain and I understand some of the criticisms on here but this place consistently puts out good food.  Thats pretty good for a restaurant in my book.  It is the same owners or management I believe as Houston's in Dallas and Scottsdale (which also has a Bandera's).  I went in Phoenix years and years ago and had the spinach and artichoke dip before it was in the frozen food aisle in a TGIF box.  It is still excellent and I give them credit for popularizing the dish nationwide.   Probably wrong but self delusion like this keeps things interesting in everyone's world, right?? Prime rib sandwich is awesome.  Ribs are great.  Salads are great.  It can be counted on for something to make most people happy so a good place to take a group.   Its not trendy or hot but take your Mom and sisters here for lunch and they will love it.   I don't think it is a place for your foodie (is that a word?) or serious critic or for the seriously beautiful (you know who you are).   Thumbs up from me.  Its nothing so unique that you should drive across town but if you're in the area shopping/working its a good bet for good food."
"Bandera has a very hip atmosphere, complete with a live band, but the food is nothing to write home about."
"Strangely, this is one of my favorite places to dine in downtown Chicago. I say that because I feel there are much more sophisticated, interesting, trendy places to consider a favorite, but I've always walked out of Bandera feeling completely satisfied. The food is simple and well prepared. After 8pm, a small jazz combo plays. When making a reservation, you can request a window seat for a great, third-story view of Mich Ave. While you might wait 10-15 min for the window seat, even with a reservation, it's worth the wait, and you can grab a drink at the bar. The staff has always been top-notch and attentive without being obtrusive. Great wine selection. Just try it already!"
"Love Bandera!!My girlfriend and I go here for happy hour atleast once per month.  On Tuesdays they sell a bottle of Vueve Cliquot for the exact same price you get it in the grocery store or Costco!!We always sit at the plush bar and share the tuna poke and the cheese dip - which usually fills us up.  If we're feeling especially bad, we'll split their cheeseburger, which is totally decadent and yummy!!  The atmosphere here is your average business professionals and out of towners.  The jazz does get a bit noisy- but I really like this place.  Don't go here if you're looking for someplace hip."
"On the way to our table, I could have sworn we stepped into some kind of crosstown worm hole and ended up at J. Alexander's on Clybourn. Or Houston's in some other city. That's not necessarily bad, because I love J. Alexander's and Houston's. But if you've seen one you've kind of seen them all. Super-dim lighting, small and overpriced but solid menu, that funny little sugar canister that looks like a robot.I definitely recommend the macho salad. Can't get enough goat cheese!"
"Great restaurant right on The Mile.  Jazz band was playing when I showed up and the place was packed on a wed night.  We ate at the bar as the wait for a table for 2 was ""at least 50 minutes.""  Food was definitely above average.  Wouldn't put it on my ""must go"" places but if you need a good restaurant downtown and are stuck - this is a good choice.I had BBQ salmon and it was pretty good.  The menu was a bit limiting - not too much to choose from.  that is the only reason for 3 stars instead of 4.  Food was worth 4!Oh yeah - ITS UPSTAIRS - and easy to miss."
"Divinely delicious in the ""brick"" city. This was our first meal out in the city . As we slipped in through the glass department store double doors, we were immediately whisked away up a escalator paved mirrored hallway flanked with heavy 80s chundering right out of a episode of Knots Landing. Amber lighting, dark shudders and rotisserie chicken proved to be the proper antidote for an evening of table side jazz. Sneak a piece of homemade corn bread before they pop the check"
"Ok, yes, this place is FULL of tourists.  If you try to go during lunch you will have to wait even if you have a reservation.  It is right off of Michigan Avenue, so what can you expect.  I try not to go that often because of the tourists, but I crave their beef ribs!!!  OMG!  They are fall off the bone perfectly flavored juicy mouth watering.  The order is really big, so if you are a lighter eater or if you don't feel like having leftovers, I recommend getting one order and splitting it and each getting a small salad.  They do charge you $5 if you ask for the plate to be split, but if you are a friend of the person who you are splitting it with, just ask for an extra plate and share!It can be a little pricey, but it's good and there is a good view of michigan avenue if you sit by the windows.  They even have life jazz music on certain nights."
"For lunch at least, this place is as good as it gets.  Though be sure to get there by 11:30 if you want to be sure you will be seated at a table.  Though the bar is always a good option.  The service here is phenomenal.  The servers collaborate impeccably.I have been going to this place for lunch for years, the food is fabulous.  Favorites are the queso dip and tortilla chips for a starter.  Their queso is a great mixture of pimento cheese and jalapenos served at room temp with delicious tortilla strips.  For lunch the Macho Salas can not be beat.   A cold crisp salad chuck full of lettuce, tomato, dates, almonds, goat cheese, corn bread croutons, corn, and topped with a light dressing.  The best thing I have ever had for lunch!Other wonderful selections include: Seared Sashimi Tuna Salad, Bandera-Style Roasted Chicken, Cornbread, Escabéche.  Also try the salmon when it is on the menu, delicious!This place is easy to overlook, being on the second floor, but I suggest you get up there an eat lunch!"
"I actually found out about this restaurant when I visited their Scottsdale location back in 2004 and was I happy when our waiter let us know there was one here. I am a rib guy and the ribs are great.  It's all about the taste and how tender the meat is and Bandera is as close to perfection as you can find.  Make sure you substitute the fries for the mashed potatoes...yummy.For dessert, the Banana Cream Pie w Caramel and Crushed Chocolate is absolutely delicious."
"So this place is actually really great. First of all, it has great service. I don't care where you dine, if the food sucks and the service is great, you usually end up leaving in an OK mood. That said, the food is good. So, great service + good food = a nice place to dine.Furthermore, this place has a view of Michigan Ave. that competes with the best. View not enough to persuade? How about a rockin' jazz trio? Yeah, they got that too. And they're good. And cool looking. You know what I'm talking about. Tussled hair, loosened ties like they just got off their day job and Coltrane is their nightcap.Bandera may be a chain restaurant, but it's got some chops."
"Bandera is pretty touristy, is it on Mich Ave, so the wait is kinda long, we actually at at the bar, my boyfriend loves the prime rib french dip sandwich!I had the veggie burger which was pretty good, it was fresh not frozen!The fries were really good!I love shoestring french fries!editWent there again 10/27/07 for lunch and sat at a table this time, again had the veggie burger which is really good! the fries are handcut, they are delicious!The service was ok, it would have been nice if the waitress refilled my water...."
"I am a vegetarian and dont have too many choices, but their vegetarian burger is one of the best I have had. The peanut salad is very tasty."
"Amazing veggie burger and excellent service. A great view of the Mag Mile as well! Love the live jazz music as well. Its a bit pricey, but a great spot to take people from out of town."
I have to say that this place has the best veg burger. I sat on the opposite side of the window still was very comfortable dinning.Service was good. I went during the day and it wasn't dark cause I guess the windows brought enough light. I love the booth seating .It wasn't crowded at all.As for the price it's worth it better then a very expensive restaurant.
"Bandera loses a star with me because I don't want to have anything else but appetizers there ever again.  The poke and queso dip are still great, but I just can't (pardon the expression) get it up for anything else there.  My fish sandwich was mundane at best.  Sloppy to eat, with a fish portion that was barely half the size of the roll.  The service is great however, and the view can't be beat."
"Bandera is a nice lunch place escape from your typical Mich Ave haunts and it won't break the bank.  I always go for the Hacked Chicken Salad which has a nice little Asian flair.  I've had colleagues rave over the french dip, chicken sandwich and burger.  Quick and prompt service typically, as they are trying to turn over tables and they know a lot of folks are headed back to the office.  I don't get the tourist vibe as much here as I do when I dine at Lux Cafe or other monstrosity menu venues..  Atmosphere is good....but it's almost like walking into the Sprockets video from SNL.  (No, I won't touch your monkey!)  And the servers have to be some of the most attractive in the city....not that there's anything wrong with that. :) For lunch, get there 15 minutes before noon or expect to wait for 20-30 minutes."
"Well, I don't have tons to rave about, but no complaints either.  Lots of peanuts used in creative ways that actually tasted good.  Had a fab-Cab wine and my friends veggie burger was pretty amazing.  I had the ""hacked"" chicken salad and scarfed the whole thing done.Worth stopping in if you're passing by - but would not necessarily go out of my way!"
"Service: prompt and professional. Water always full, food out fast.Food: Tasty, fresh, great presentation.Pricing: Too expensive to be a regular lunch spot for me, but worth it in a splurge. Someone treated me today  :) Lose a star for rushing us the heck out of there. I understand that this is a fairly busy place, but literally the minute I set my fork down, they came by and swooped up our plates. Our server was by no less than 30 seconds later to give us the check, then after my friend and I chatted for a few minutes (literally 3-4 min), she came by again and wiped down our table, took our napkins and asked if we needed anything else. This would be great if this was a business luncheon, but may not be ideal if you are going to lunch for a social occasion, they want you out as soon as you're done."
"I was just here over the weekend, and I too had the Macho salad, and loved it!  I am NOT a salad eater (should be!) so like lots of junk in my salads.  This one was full of stuff and I was completely full and satisfied when I left.  Nice ambience as well, with lots of business people coming and going during a Friday lunch.  Would go back, just for that dang salad!"
"Martinis, men and ...well, post mortem of SATC - Bandera was a great gathering spot post-movie to dine and dwell on all things deep and shallow, Big and Carrie!Was pleasantly surprised to be seated quite quickly on a perfect weekend night, when the entire city seems to swarm into Mich Avenue. The cornbread-foccacia was every bit as good as promised and the purported best veggie burger in town didn't disappoint either.It was a somewhat expensive burger dinner obviously, but hardly unexpected for the location and the ambiance.A comfortable booth with a view of the entire interior space completed a positive experience and Bandera makes it to my 4-star list in the city."
"Food was amazingly good! Service was excellent and friendly. Definitely a great place to visit, just make sure you do not use cell phone while you are there...wait staff gets really mad."
"Man do they know how to cook some meat!  Love this restaurant.  I tried their Macho salad, where they included their infamous corn bread as the croutons!  Geeeeenious.  Not just any regular boring salad because it was full of flavor and very tasty.  I also tried their rotisserie chicken enchiladas.....awesome.   And then moved on to the prime rib french dip......incredible!  I left there having the feeling that everything on the menu had to be delicious."
The salad with chicken and corn (name escapes me) may well have been the best I've ever had. Good wine choices.
"My husband would probably give it 5 stars as this is one of his favorite places. I like it a lot especially when you get a table by the window overlooking Michigan Ave. The menu could change every once in a while though. I eat chicken all week long (since my cooking skills are limited) so on the weekends, I want to try a few different things.... not something blah as a rotisserie chicken."
This used to be  one of our favorites.  The food was still fair but  the service was not as great and the prices seemed to have increased.  The martinis seemed weaker and smaller.The trio jazz band was still a nice touch.
Really good service and I have never waited a long time to get seated. The Veggie burger is simply the best
I loved this place.  The food was great and music was very nice.  I will definately be back.
"We came here for a work lunch and came around 11:40... they don't take reservations, so if you are trying to squeeze in a work lunch, it's best to come before noon. Thank God we did!  We were seated immediately by the window, overseeing Mich Ave. It's great ppl watching - both inside the restaurant, and overlooking the unsuspecting pedestrians (and tourists) strolling down Mich ave.I mean, who would've thought the restaurant above Adrianna Furs was worth going to? So, I did go with the Yelp recos and got the cornbread for apps and the Macho salad.  They are known for their cornbread, and I was impressed with it! It had cheese and onions in it, and was really good!  The Macho salad (which consisted of almonds, goat cheese, etc.) was really good, and you can choose if you want white and/or dark meat.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, and you are greeted by a huge oven of it upon walking in -- I was impressed with the chicken, esp. since I'm not a huge poultry fan. They tend to overdress their salad, so I recommend getting the dressing on the side.One co-worker got the Caesar salad, and noted that it was too 'anchovie' -- something you don't want... and ended up making multiple trips to the bathroom (albeit she was hungover).  Some other orders included the veggie burger and chicken breast burger (which was HUGE and looked really good).  It was accompanied with fries, and I was a fan of them frittes -- thin, crispy, and non-greasy.. just the way I like it.Next time I go back, I'd try the veggie burger or the chicken sandwich.P.S. the napkins here are super adorable.  There is a button hole (which may seem odd), but it's meant to be buttoned to one's shirt and/or necklace, to function like a bib - HOW CUTE!!! Hope that design is trademarked!"
Had the roasted chicken and green rice for lunch.  One of the best roasted chickens I've ever had!
"Who likes good service and good food? I do! And Bandera has both. Their staff explains dishes impeccably, and is always kind and courteous. I like their menu because its not huge, but has a little bit of everything- it's unique american fare. I'm a huge fan of their salads and the veggie burger..or was it a turkey burger...I can't remember, but whatever burger it is, it is very delicious. They also always have tempting specials. Great for a late dinner, or for lunch while shopping on michigan ave. They have a full bar and music on weekend nights- piano and jazz. Also go for the view, especially during the Christmas months because the lights along Michigan will make your dining experience even better."
"I have always loved Bandara's food. Fresh, tasty, and always right out of the oven. I enjoy seeing the prep/kitchen area. Keeps them on their toes ;) Service is good, prices are high, but with the location and quality of their food, it's worth it. However, coming here on a Saturday evening, I felt rushed. We were sat and given our bill within forty minutes. That is with ordering drinks, appetizer and entrees. I am all for fast service, and I appreciate the promptness. But for the price? Let me enjoy the time, atmosphere, and live music. Now I know we could have sat there awhile longer, but the bill is the sign saying 'get out.' My experience here was not a good one."
"The wait was longer than expected on a Sunday night, about an hour for just two of us.  However, the beef ribs were pretty good and the fries as well.  Personally I might have enjoyed dessert more than the meal, the homeade oreo ice cream sandwich is served in a light chocolate sauce and finished the meal perfectly. The view of Michigan from the dining room is very nice at night so sitting against the back window is a must."
"I went to Bandera on the Saturday of the St. Patrick's Day parade (2008).  My friend suggested the restaurant, for he had been there before and really liked their cheeseburger.  I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical - after all you are eating at a restaurant in the heart of the Magnificent Mile - I figured it would be a tourist trap.  I am glad that I was wrong.The atmosphere at Bandera is great.  It is dark, and very comfortable.  If you get a table near the windows, then you have an awesome view of Michigan Avenue.  The service was also good, but I have one small gripe... We had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table.  The total was 13.75 for our two beers, and the bartender brought me back a one, a five, and a quarter.  I can never understand why servers do this - I either have to wait and ask her to break the five or I have to leave a lousy tip.  We were called to the table just as the bartender brought the change, so I am sorry to say that she got a lousy tip ($1.25).  Once we were seated we had good, efficient service.  The food was quite good.  I had the Macho salad that everyone has been raving about on Yelp, and it really is very good.  I would follow the advice from other reviewers and ask for the dressing on the side, though.  My friend ordered a cheeseburger (again), and he claims it is his favorite cheeseburger in Chicago.  (He has only lived here six months, but that's still quite a compliment.)  The reason I give Bandera three stars, and not the four that I would give the food and service, is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  The Macho salad is $16, and the cheeseburger was $13.  I don't know if you can get a beer for under $6, but we ordered ""good"" beer and it certainly wasn't under $6.  The prices aren't outrageous for the location:  The window seats give you some of the best people watching in the city, but if you are just looking for good food at a reasonable price then this probably isn't a great choice.  I will definitely go back, though."
"Bandera...we came here after checking out the shoe sale at Nordstroms..nice sale...: )  We had a short wait of 15-20min. We grabbed a drink at the bar.  Live jazz music. Great atmosphere. Cozy nice seating. Great wine. We got the fresh tuna, avocado, shrimp appetizer along with ""Bandera Chicken with Spanish Rice"" and ""Bandera Lamb and Escebera"". Our server and the whole experience was just simply lovely. Can't wait to go again. Thanks Bandera! Next time I would love to people watch and sit by the window. : )"
"Based on other's recommendations a friend and I split the Macho salad and the veggie burger.  Both were delicious!  Love the peanut coleslaw!  Love the barbeque flavor in the veggie burger!  Love the goat cheese, dates and other inspired flavors in the salad! Love the atmosphere, especially with the jazz band.  I will definitely return!"
Everything about this restaurant was great!  Food was delicious.  Service was excellent.  Live music was nice.  Can't wait to return!
"I don't like too many traditional American restaurants. They all have the same kind of menus and all taste the same; burgers, burgers, and more burgers. But, when I went to BANDERA, I was impressed. With their chicken, that is. They have the cozy rotisserie fire near the entrance with lines of chicken slowly spinning; their juices hugging their entire bodies, slowly caramelizing the skin. On your dinner plate, the chicken is not smothered with spices to hide the taste of the flesh but slightly seasoned so you can taste the goodness of the meat. I had the Macho salad and it was genuinely good. Lunch can get crowded. The crowd is mostly business men/women and yuppy-type people. I can see it being a romantic restaurant, if not a bit rowdy. But, when you're on the Mag Mile and want something nice but not too pricey, this is my recommendation :)"
Nice bar to meet for drinks. Great place for out of town guests or clients. The lamb sandwich is delish.
"You know, anyone who regularly reads my reviews would not think this is my kind of place.  But, I love, love, love Bandera.Bandera is comfort food for me, it's like going home.  I lived in Phoenix for 9 years and there're less restaurants to choose from there - Bandera became my place.  All kinds of important events have taken place for me at B - I came out of the closet to my best friend, multiple first dates (some good and some bad), multiple last dates (if you gotta bite the bullet, might as well chase it with a good steak) and it became a frequent stop when friends visited the blue desert skies seeking refuge from whatever cold climate they were escaping.I think the service is wonderful, I've never had a complaint in frequenting this establishment for 10 years.I recommend:Tuna AppMacho SaladThe FilletPork TipsWhatever fish they are servingThe cole slaw is to friggin' die forand, certainly, indulge in...Homemade Oreo Ice Cream CookieHope you enjoy as much as I.Oh, and if you go in Chicago, try to get a window seat - beautiful Michigan Ave views."
"A friend and I went here one Saturday recently.  I had heard it had great salads, plus I heard it was not crazy busy and full of Summer Chicago tourists on the weekend.  It was not crazy busy AND the food was fantastic.  I had the prime rib sandwich with the thai peanut cole slaw.  Delicious.  The slaw was quite possibly the best slaw I have ever tasted--and I am from the South--home of the picnic, so I know slaw.  Not to brag or anything-HA.The service at Bandera was great, the food was excellent, the location is superb is you are out shopping (right across from the big Nordstrom on Michigan Ave).  The price is right and it was not busy.  What more does a hungry shopper want in Chicago?Give it a try--you will not be sorry."
I came here for my birthday with some friends.  With reservations we did not have to wait too long on a Saturday night.  Loved the Macho Salad and the Bandera Chicken (you can see it on the rotisserie when you walk in).  Chicken comes with a yummy rice too.  Not a huge cornbread person but the appetizer is good and big enough for all of us to try.    Though I did not get a table with a view all 6 of us left happy and full!
"One of the best veggie burgers in the city- if only it wasn't stuck down in the void of downtown.  The also have a powerhouse app with raw tuna and avocado that's hard to top and a pan of cornbread that is actually enjoyable to eat, corn bread being one of those ""foods"" that usually require quotes to denote inedible dry and crumbly bread product."
"Yes, it can be touristy considering it's right in the thick of MI Ave, but this is a standard stop whenever I'm in the area. Perfect place to rest your feet while taking in the city. Great concrete bar with a decent wine list and appetizers to pick from. The fact that the door can be a little hard to find is actually a plus to me. Heck, I know how to get in... good enough."
"We ordered the cornbread and spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer. Cornbread tasted stale and awful. The dip was like the frozen kind that you get from the grocery store. Eww. For entrees we got the enchilada and steak and the crab cakes. Both were so mediocre that after our first bite we both said, ""wow, doesn't this taste like Applebees....?"" It was one of the worst meals we've had in this tasty city ;("
"Best crab cakes this side of Baltimore, best veggie burger on earth.  Spectacular blue cheese stuffed olive martinis, fresh-squeezed grapefruit greyhounds and a punchy red Zinfandel round out the drink list.  Go for the tuna poke, charred artichoke or foccacia bread plate to start.  Finish with the Oreo Mocha Pie dessert (or any other dessert) to finish.  You really can't go wrong here.  The enchilada solo plate could make a very satisfying light lunch.  Helpful waitstaff, calm and elegant ambiance, always delicious food and drink, and a convenient location make Bandera my go-to restaurant for downtown dining.I've been to Bandera well over 50 times, and I'm looking forward to the next 50."
"good place to spend time with  your friends or  family, nice music, delicious food, we ordered salad, salmon and steak and we loved it. we also ordered banana pie? (im not exactly sure about the name) as a desert, and it was good too.."
"I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants, but I like this place. I actually didn't know Bandera was a chain until I'd already eaten here 5 or 6 times. Now maybe I'm clueless, but you're ugly. But let's not fight -- the point here is that the food at Bandera is pretty good. Try the Bandera roasted chicken. The ""moo and cluck"" -- beef ribs and roasted chicken -- is not on the menu, but it's another great option for those in the know. And when they have it, the chicken tortilla soup is so hearty you'd think the recipe came from Donovan McNabb's mom. Oh yeah, the oreo cookie dessert is excellent for those auditioning for ""The Biggest Loser.""I also like the atmosphere here. Live jazz at night, and it's on the second floor above Michigan Ave (across from Nordstrom's) with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the street.  It's especially nice in December, when Michigan Ave is all lit up for Christmas."
"This was the first of many good restaurants during our recent trip to the Windy city. ( Which I found out has nothing to do with the actual wind...another story for another time).  My wife and I had 7:00 reservations although the place was very busy, we were seated promptly.  The service here definitely out shined the food.  Although that is not to say that the food was not good.  Our waitress was great and the food came out so quickly, we were very impressed.  Now onto the food, we started out with two appetizers the Mac and cheese and the bread plate. First off just get the full corn bread plate, the other bread was forgettable.  The mac and cheese I could have probably made in my kitchen, seemed blah...no real flavor.  Our entrees were good, I had the lamb which was so tender and perfect.  A side note is that the sauce that they put over it lacked any kick, just left you with a smoky taste. would've preferred something else.. But the lamb itself was great. My wife got the infamous macho salad and was very impressed.  Overall 4 stars for service, the waitress was just so attentive, but 3 for the food. Oh and just to mention the the live Jazz is great, however if its just you a lady friend asked to be seated a little further away, it makes it hard o talk at a reasonable tone."
"Oh, the Roasted Chicken is off the chain!   Marry that chicken with those mashed potatoes and you got some good eating for sure.   The live music is great and the seating is quite spacious.  Thumbs up to Bandera."
"I came here with my friend while visiting her in Chicago and loved it! I love the location (not far from Pop's Champage) and of course you know that they love their chicken based on the huge wall of the rotisserie. I can't say that I remembered what I ate, but I know that it had a great vibe, a jazz band played and that the drinks went down well. I don't think that this is a touristy place but I could see during the afternoons or early evenings that this would be a very corporate place to go to."
"The food was amazing. Everything we had was good. The service was decent, but between six of us we had to make six substitutions. It's not a huge menu, and I understand running out of 1 or 2 dishes, but 6 changes for a table! 1st choice dinner: pork (gone)2nd choice: lamb (gone)3rd choice: bbq salmon (ok!)15 minutes later4th choice: filet (finally!) The smoky-spicy queso dip, the peanut coleslaw, ribs, cornbread were all awesome. Everything else was good too. They comped an extra app for the table and our dessert, but shouldn't the fillet have been the item comped? I've worked in the restaurant industry, I was disappointed by the manager's/kitchen's ability to 1) tell us what was gone BEFORE we ordered and 2) come up with something for us when 1/4 of the menu was off-limits at 7:30 on a sunday night. And, I don't mind getting carded, but our waitress ID'd (and scanned the ids of) the entire table of 28-33 year olds. A few too many security cameras on the ceiling too- slightly odd for a ""classy"" restaurant. Yes, I'll go back, but with reservations (mental, not table)."
"This is a fun restaurant to visit when you're downtown. The views of Michigan Avenue are wonderful!Although the menu is short, the food here is really good. As you've heard, the corn bread is absolutely delicious. The aged prime rib is also wonderful, and the mashed potatoes are sooo sinfully good. As a cheap graduate student, I personally recommend splitting the entrees. They are huge, so there will be plenty of food.As a heads up, Bandera can get REALLY crowded on weekend evenings, so be prepared to wait for an hour or two. They have live music on weekend nights, which is awesome. However, they stop playing at like 9:00pm, two hours before the place closes!! It was very disappointing to wait 90 minutes for a table, only to finally get seated right as the awesome musicians were leaving."
"I lived right around the corner from this place for 5 years and it was a staple for lunch. My winning pick here is the Crescent City Fish Sandwich made with tilapia.  Love this thing so much I've eaten at least 50 or 60 of them. I also dig their décor- although I kinda feel like Hilfiger or Abercrombie ripped them off.  As for the staff, they have always been friendly, so no complaints. Net, net... A solid stop during any Magnificent Mile shopping spree."
"I've passed this place so many times off of Michigan Ave and never had an urge to go in. Of course its only when a friend out of town suggested it that I thought to try it out. First- love the live jazz music (it was on Sunday night when I went) really set the vibe. Felt a little under dressed but it was a freakin hot day and all we wanted was a great meal and AC! We started off with the Mac & Cheese with walnut cornbread crumbles which was lovely! The variety of  cheeses had enough gooeyness that definitely set the tone for a great meal. My buddy had Aged Prime Rib Slow Roasted on the Bone served with Mashed Potatoes & I had Seared Sashimi Tuna Salad with Mixed Greens, Avocado and Mango. The mango was not ripe but the avocados were and cut just the sized. My salad was a perfect compliment to the hot day and I was ready for the  House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches. Yes, I could have made this easily at home but boy oh boy this was a great kick at the end. Enough for two to share and not an overload in sweets or oreos. Great place, a tax pricey but reasonable and I would definitely go back."
"The food was good. The service was adequate. The champagne was warm. Overall, not that impressed."
"I had a scrumptious dinner here and caught up with some old friends.  My roasted pork with cornbread stuffing and apricot glaze was really delicious.All our portions were larger than necessary and the staff was SO friendly.  Really, it was quite shocking how friendly everyone was.  Am I just a jaded San Franciscan?"
"This place has one of my favorite salads of all time - the Macho salad! It is just the right portion, and just the right sweetness and savouriness to it; it is usually what I order for main course whenever I visit.I have had their other appetizers and fish dishes as well, and they are pretty good as well. They have standard American food with a twist and you really cannot go wrong, they are not crazy or out of the way, the food tastes pretty much how you would expect it to taste.I like the ambiance for the most part, except that its a little too dark inside. Even in the day time, it is really dim inside, which I don't prefer most of the time, but I keep going back for the Macho salad!They have live music playing on an off, jazz I believe, and they aren't too bad or loud.Definitely a good place to pop in for a casual lunch or dinner if you are in the area. They are never too crowded or have a wait and they are quick to bring the food out too!"
"Prices were reasonable.  Food was very good.  Love that they have banana cream and key lime pie for dessert options.  However, we were seated right next to the band and it was kinda loud.  But, the music was pretty good."
"Awesome view of the ever busy Michigan Avenue, especially during the summer. I went with a group of 7, with no reservations and the wait was not that long. We hung out at the bar and enjoyed the tunes. This place has the best prime rib of beef sandwich ever! Every guy at the table was amazed that my 5 ft self could demolish this sandwich like I did. My mouth is watering thinking about it. Definitely give this place a go."
"I went here for my birthday and loved it. It was easy to get a table even for mid-day on a Sunday. Great food, but what I liked the most about Bandera is they have a really nice atmosphere (dimmed lighting and quiet, gives it an intimate feel). I had a burger, which was delicious, and the service was friendly and efficient."
"amazing. I have to agree with Jenn, the center cut filet with mashed potatoes and spinach is the best! The restaurant has good views, the waiters are nice and the food is moderately-priced. Their cheeseburgers are extremely good as well, and my mom always gets the macho salad which she adores."
"GREAT Drinks!!!! Ok food, dark as hell inside, love the atmosphere though...."
"Hearty dinner salads and nice atmosphere.  But beyond that, not much on the menu that's very exciting.  It gets extremely crowded during lunch on weekdays as it's a popular buziness lunch spot to bring clients for an informal chat."
"Went here with my Mom for lunch when she was in town.  It was a great lunch spot, since we got a window view overlooking Michigan.  My burger was HUGE and very good and the conbread was outstanding.Service was eh.  Prolly wouldn't ever go for dinner, but I liked it as a Michigan Avenue lunch spot."
"I really wanted to like this place because the location is great so I gave it two tries.  Terrible both times.  Had the rotisserie chicken which is almost impossible to pass up since the smell of it roasting hits you as soon as you walk in.  Came out cold and bland.  Also had the prime rib sandwich with au jus.  Also nothing special.  And, I had the worst bloody mary I've had in my life.  Just terrible.  Llike drinking  a glass of cocktail sauce (like for shrimp) I could actually feel chunks of horseradish going down my throat, and I usually like horseradish."
"This is such a great spot to stop in for a drink, and to take in the big city below.  I can't comment on the food too much, seeing as though the drinks take center stage here.  My boyfriend and I will meet up here quite often since I work at NMH, and this place is just a stones throw away for a drink after work.  Fancy little spot, with a great atmosphere."
"Just like all the reviews I read before I went to Bandera.........good location, not so good food.I ordered the center cut filet, wanted it cooked medium and it came medium well.  I like steak at Outback Steakhouse better.......I'm NOT lying!!!Boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken, which Bandera is known for and he really seemed to like it.I don't think I'll be returning to Bandera."
Went here for lunch on a Monday.  I had the lamb sandwich--which is very good.  My girlfriend had a rather bland salad.  Service was a little slow.
"Went here on Sunday night for dinner. Before I went I read a lot of the yelp users reviews, which always helps. I was a little nervous about going here because of some the the bad reviews but I still chose to go to Bandera.I met my previous boss and some co-workers here. We went late night for dinner. Were sat at 10:00 p.m. I was a little bit nervous about coming so late, because working in the industry I know how frustrating to have last minute customers on a Sunday. But the staff were great. Our server Julie was excellent. She gave us some suggestions. We split the queso dip & a hamburger for the appetizer. I really think that they have one of the best hamburgers in the city. It is topped with pickles, lettuce, tomato & a zangy ranch dressing. YUMM! The queso dip was interesting. It was cold & chucky. Looked terrible, but it tasted great. For dinner we ordered the Salmon, which was really great. Cooked perfectly. Served with a mixed cold vegetable salad, and rice. Pork chops with apricot chutney & corn bread was out of this world. The pork was cooked perfectly. The sauce made me want more! The ribs were so soft, they fell right off the bone. I couldn't be happier. For dessert the keylime pie was great. The only reason why Bandera isn't getting 5 stars is because they aren't orginal in their dessert selections. The keylime pie is the same as Houston's. For me--copying your sister restaurants menu is a bit cheating. There are so many great desserts you can come up with so I was a bit dissapointed. It looked like the banana pudding was the same as Houston's. Oh well--but it was great. Our view really made out dining experience better. Seeing Michigan Ave. on a cool crisp night was outstanding. I will be coming back to Bandera as long as they have the Pork Chop entree."
"This place is delicious, and the wait is never too long. I love the ambience, with live jazz and a view of the Mag Mile. Their skillet cornbread is yummy, and the other food is always good. Some highlights: rotisserie anything, and the veggie apps and side dishes (or the veggie platter which combines them all). There's a little ""chef's table"" counter where you get to watch the cooks and the servers at the finishing station, and you can see how much care they put into putting out a nice place."
"This place is a phenom. I love it for lunch, for drinks, for dinner, for late night music and drinks.. you can't go wrong. The salads are amazing- which I find to be rare in the Chi town meat and potato culture.. The drinks are strong and delicious. Meat is tender and perfect. You can eat tons here (which I always do) and never feel overfull or ill, as the ingredients are fresh, healthy, and delicately combined."
"I work near Bandera but I've avoided eating there because I assumed it'd be a tourist trap restaurant (like Grand Lux Cafe) or it would be filled to the brim with corporate suit types.  I finally went with some co-workers, and voila, I was proven wrong.  It's a little funny to ride up an escalator to a nice restaurant but what they hey.  You can ogle the little fur shop on the way up.  Once in, you immediately see the small bar to the left, the hostess stand in front of you, and the grill in the back.  The restaurant is kind of small, but it boasts a nice front-row view of Michigan Avenue and has a nice fireplace woodsy kind of atmosphere.  I wouldn't say it's casual -- it'd be odd to wear shorts and tank tops in here, but it wouldn't be awful if you showed up in nice jeans.  It's more dressy casual - business.  Customers comprise of a few tourists, lotsa business people, and some friends.  Anyway let's talk about the important stuff -- the food.  Oh my god.  The macho salad.  Ding!  The roasted chicken.  Ding!  The grilled fish sandwich.  Ding!  Salads are good, burgers are good, steaks excellent.  Interesting menu (not extensive, but still quite diverse).  I have never had dessert there, but I'm told it's sumptuous.  Best to avoid it during lunch time during the weekdays because it tends to get SUPERCROWDED.  But it ain't a bad thing if you end up eating at the bar, because service is quite efficient there.  Also, no reservations unless you have a party of 4 or more.  I don't think it's a good place for kids, more of an adult restaurant."
"Bandera has been on my 'to do' list since I saw them on the 'Best I Ever Ate' food network show.  The celebrity chef specifically gave a banana cream pie shout out.  I'm not a banana cream pie kinda girl, but I tried it anyway.  I have to say that the homemade whipped cream and the buttery crust was good.  The banana filling just didn't make my toes curl like the food network chef said it would.  I would not get it again and my $8 could be spent elsewhere.  Now on the other hand, when I listened to the reviews on YELP and got the Macho Salad with Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Dates, Almonds and Goat Cheese for $17 - I was a HAPPY girl !!!!  The salad was one of the best entree salads that I have had.  I absolutely liked everything on the salad..... hmm hmmm good ! Now the only downside was the $17 price tag.  For $17 bucks, I think it should have been jammed packed with roasted chicken and it wasn't.    I would absolutely make a return visit to Bandera."
"Excelente!A Monday night, wandering out of the Movie theatres on Michigan, someone in our group suggested Bandera for drinks. We all agree. I had never noticed the restaurant to be honest. But the location is actually pretty great. Right on Michigan Avenue...  So we walk over... walk in. Theres no wait, which is always nice. Swanky place. Tasteful decor. Music being played in the background. Definitely a nice laid back place... Now on to the food- We originally came in just for drinks, but then ended up ordering food.. Among the entrees on our table, was the Tuna salad, the Prime Rib, and the Steak and Enchilada platter. Every plate got two thumbs up. I wasnt very hungry so I shared with a friend and ordered the #1 Tuna Poke with Shrimp & Avocado. Sooo good! Loved it!! I wanted to eat it all myself. Ha. Next time...We went through two bottles of Mi Sueno Cabergnet. So tasty... Definitely a very comfie and pleasant dinner... Bandera is a must try!"
"This place is killer! If you don't like it you don't deserve to live in this city! Think about this all you fat-free, afraid to lavish yourself once in a while, scaredy-cats....Grilled, salted artichokes with spinach sauce (and of course, additional drawn butter). My lady friend and i always get an order each (for a warm up) with lottsa napkins.Next, any one of their great big beautiful salads to split.Then for her, an order of grilled, melt off the bone beef ribs with a BBQ sauce that beats any baby back pork ribs anywhere.  For me, a medium rare fillet to dip piece by piece in drawn butter before inhalation. Both served with buttered, garlic mashed potatoes.Finally, a huge slice of banana cream pie to complete a great meal and finish setting us up for our heart attacks. What the hell, we're on borrowed time anyways at 65 so what's the difference? We'll both die  early, fat, dumb and happy and that will leave more money in social security for all of the withered up old health freaks."
"Among the things I miss most about not living within walking distance of Ohio and Michigan is Bandera.  But, luckily, it's still only a 4 mile drive to the best ribs in the city (if you like the fall-off-the-bone-with-no-effort type), an outstanding ahi salad, its unique ceasar, always a great burger, and dreamy oreo cake ice cream thing dessert.  If you are seated overlooking Michigan Avenue, it's a really top experience. I was heartbroken when Houston's (Bandera's first cousin) closed a few years ago, but relieved to know that Bandera seems to be plugging along just fine.  Luckily there are plenty of Houston's still around in other cities.....One reviewer has already noted that for a chain, Bandera doesn't attract the same touristy crowd that other Mag Mile places do, which is perhaps more of a function to its location (few don't seem to be looking up at the big Bandera sign, and if you blink you'll miss the entry door), so it's usually a much more local/professional feel.  Like Houston's used to be.  May it rest in peace.  Sniff."
Finding the entrance is a little trickey but its not brain surgery. The atmosphere is very classy with live jazz and a great view of michigan ave.  Service is fast and friendly.  Shared the Macho Salad and Rotisserie Sandwich which were very tasty!  Rotisserie sandwich came with dipping sauce and shoe string fries which were perfect.  Would definitely go back.
If I didn't rate this a 5 I'd be a hypocrite for going so often. We went to this place nearly weekly. Wait can be long if you don't call a head... but if you get to know the staff this can be fudged (I know it's wrong but it was nice ;-) ) Start of with a nice martini at the bar. The get the chips and queso (unfortunately the cornbread's gone). For the main course the salmon and the ribs are amazing (beef ribs that are fall off the bone eat with a fork and knife). Couldn't tell you about desert cause I was always to stiffed to eat it. Macho salad is excellent and large if other entree's are to manly for your (Ravi). Decor is dark and the music jazzy. nice for a date or just a dinner with the guys/gals
O MY GOD....  it was soooo  Good.  Live jazz band playing  I Patted my right foot as I tasted my food.  I had the BEEF RIBS  and  the pan CORN BREAD.  Oh  the service...  was excellent.
"Ok so it's a decent place for meats, rotisserie and otherwise.  But I can't get THAT excited about it.  It's your typical meat & potatoes & different-types-of-grilled-meats-on-salads type place.   Decent, but nothing to freak out about.Am I that hard to impress? I don't think so!"
The place was tucked away above Michigan Avenue. I was a nice retreat from the bustling street. The food was pretty good. I had the prime rib French dip and just an FYI specify how you want the prime rib cooked! It was still pretty awesome though aside from the rarity of the prime rib. The best part was there was no wait on a holiday weekend.
"This restaurant had come highly recommended plus it was close by my hotel so I set out to try it. First of all, I have definitely inherited my mother's sense of direction because I walked several blocks in the wrong direction before I realized the numbers were getting bigger instead of smaller. I turned around and headed back the correct direction but when I got to the address there was a private condo. I walked passed it and double checked the address. I went back and stood in front of the condo again and finally went in and asked the concierge, turns out there was more than one 535. I go back 2 doors and there is still no sign but 2 skinny doors leading to an escalator and a fur company. At the top of the stairs I finally find Bandera and decide they are going to for the chic word of mouth thing and not counting on people just popping in. I sit down at the bar as a jazz band starts playing behind me. I was surprised when the burger came out because I have never had a burger cut into 3 pieces before. It was sweet and tasty, I almost expected it to be a horror movie and them to come out and tell me I was eating Aunt Sue or something. It was tasty and enjoyable and the atmosphere made me feel like I was a hip big city girl."
"This is a consistently fantastic place to eat. Everything is prepared with fresh ingredients and using simple cooking methods allowing food to shine. Speciality cocktails are a unique twist on old favorites. Service can be a bit mechanical at times with a ""get em in, get em out"" rhythem."
"I wouldn't call Bandera hip or trendy.  It seems to be mostly suit and tie clientele for business lunches or after dinner lunches.  Nothing says unhip like a room full of suited people.  I've been here a handful of times on business lunches, in fact, because this is what they mainly cater to (and for that purpose, it works).I rarely end up here for dinner, and after one experience, I wouldn't again on purpose.We ordered the artichoke for an appetizer.  While it was very good, I was annoyed when the waitor came by 3 minutes after we received it to explain how to eat it, as if I had never eaten artichoke before.  Its not like we were just staring blankly at it not sure what to do with it.We were further annoyed when the expeditor came and dropped off our entrees 2 minutes later (so in total no more than 5 minutes after we got our appetizer).    Hello, can't you tell we're not even half way done with our appetizer?  This to me is absolutely unacceptable and probably one of the worst things a restaurant can do.  10 minutes later (eating a giant artichoke is fairly time consuming) we were ready to eat our barely warm entrees.  It's not like we could even complain, because the server never came back to ask how everything was until we were clearly ready for more drinks and/or our check.   When he did finally come back, we were finally able to ask for water in addition to our drinks.  Just about EVERY entree on the menu is loaded and glazed with sugar.  The night I went all of the specials came with your choice of maple syrup glazed carrots OR braised cabbage.  Thinking the braised cabbage was the smarter choice health-wise, my dining partner and I both picked it.  The cabbage came and was more like caramelized cabbage than braised.  It tasted like it was braised in corn syrup and vinegar, not just wine or whatever one might expect.  My pork entree-which mentioned nothing of a glaze--came and was glazed in some sort of thick honey sauce.   It reminded me of something they'd serve at Applebees.Outside of the very simply prepared artichoke, the food itself wasn't anything spectacular.  To me any restaurant that needs to drench everything in thick sauces (a la TGIFs) is trying to cover up poorly prepared dishes.As soon as the check was about to be delivered, the waitor started being very attentive and tried to make us forget that everything up until then was pretty mediocre (even though we never actually told him, since by the time he really came back it was too late anyway).This place has live jazz music every night.  Just make sure that when getting a table, you aren't seated directly next to the quartet, or you'll be lucky to hear yourself cough.  I'm not complaining about the live music--its great--but for dining its a little loud.Honestly, I wouldn't expect service at TGIF's to be this lacking. At over $100 for 2 entrees, one appetizer, and 2-3 drinks (total, not per person), the place isn't the cheapest place in the world for what it is, either.  Go to Bandera if you go out every night of your life and haven't tried it, but certainly don't go there hoping to have a nice date or something."
"I really adore Bandera!  When you walk into this elegant restaurant, with it's crisp white linen, dark wood panels, and sharply dressed servers, you feel so money.  The ribs are some of the best I've ever tasted.  The veggie burger and the roasted chicken are great as well.  Even the coleslaw is interesting - it has peanuts and cilantro for an unexpected yet delicious bite.  If you love chocolate, you'll die over the Oreo dessert.  Another non-food related plus: when you go for lunch, the service is very quick and efficient (yet everyone remains polite).  When I want an out-of-town visitor to get a great impression of Chicago, I take them to Bandera."
Went here the 1st time last night! The food amazing! I got the veggie burger because I had read the reviews on it and it was the best!. I seriously thought they brought a BBQ sandwich. It was so good! I can't wait to go back and the peanut coleslaw another hit!!! Thanks for the great food.
"My friend's parents took us out here a few weeks ago. I'd blocked out how much I didn't enjoy it since it was a free meal, but now I'm coming clean. I thought the food was forgettable and the jalapeno/cheddar cornbread that everyone raved about was raw on the inside. It was packed with your typical lot of on-Michigan tourist diners which was pretty annoying."
"I guess this place is Casual as the yelp listing says?  But when we sat down, the waitress said to me that people are asked to take their hats off in the dining room.  Oh well, I complied and took my baseball cap off.  I have this thing though about wanting to wear my hat, even indoors.  I know some people have this as a major no-no in their list of things on how to act in society, but for me, its a hair accessory, just like a women's head band or pony tail holder might be.  When it's windy out, or humid, my hair puffs out and I look a little crazy :)  Oh well, that's fine.  But then we get carded for drinks.  Which is fine too, but then the card actually needs to be carried somewhere else in the restaurant for ""approval"".  So that was a little odd.  The food was fine.  We got this artichoke appetizer that is a whole artichoke.  I liked it, but my complaint is, there is a technique to eating a whole artichoke that I wasn't familiar with.  Our dinner companions hooked us up with the proper way to eat this thing, but the place might just want to ask people if they have had it before and know what they are doing?  Because this doesn't seem like common knowledge that I'm supposed to be scraping the meat of the artichoke leaf off with my teeth like I live on some island with the survivors of Lost.  My main course was delicious.  A steak sandwich.  It was cooked perfectly, and the fries were tasty.  But when I ordered the thing, the waitress asked if I wanted horseradish.  Hell yes I do.  I love that stuff.  But when our food came, delivered by like 10 different people, who none of them seemed to be our waitress, I had no horseradish.  And it took another 10-15 minutes to see our waitress again, to get it.  But still, I liked the food, and my martini. Uggh, but then after the check came, we waited for at least 15 minutes for someone to actually ring the credit card up.  The bill and credit card just sat there and the end of the table, and we were just ignored.  My friend even tried to flag someone down and was rebuffed.  I might go here again, if we are close by.  And I'm not wearing a hat.  :)"
"I've been to Bandera several times and consistently have a good meal.  I like the dark, woodsey atmosphere, which goes well with their menu options.  The roasted chicken falls right off the bone - mmmmm, delish.The service is always really good and everyone is very friendly.  It's good for lunch or dinner and if you happen to go during lunch, you can eat in an hour."
"A long time ago, when the earth was green, there was a little restaurant called Houston's where you could often find me at the bar, sipping grapefruit greyhounds, dipping into classic Chicago spinach-artichoke dip and even ordering up dinner of grilled and roasted meat and perfect mashed potatoes with napkins on the bar as tablecloth and the bartender juicing grapefruits by hand for drinks as circuses. The salad days, I like to call them. I was working on Michigan Avenue in a perfectly respectable position at a high-end sportswear store and life seemed nothing less the keen.Then, one day, a new venue opened above Citibank, Bandera. It's decidedly clubby atmosphere and 360º bar, wall of rotisserie chickens and open kitchen caught and kept the eye and nose of meat being grilled and roasted and it made my head swim. I soon forgot the bread and circuses at Houston's and found myself sitting at the bar without the fresh grapefruit squeezing show, or the napkin as tablecloth, instead, I was sitting in over-stuffed leather booths and enjoying the unique ambience, the Über-friendly and efficient service and new items like classic Chicago spinach-artichoke dip, #1 tuna poke, and impossibly juicy chicken and perfect mashed potatoes and crack-tastic skillet cornbread. Then I read the news Houston's was closing. At the time I learned that the same organization [Hillstone] owned both venues. No wonder things seemed so familiar. I felt like I and I alone had caused the closure of Houston's, but I felt ok with that since Bandera felt like it had real staying power, just as it has proven to date.Bandera is the place to take a business associate, or a co-worker for lunch. Bandera is the place to go for a very delicious comfort food dinner. Bandera is the neighborhood place to go after work for a drink with friends. Bandera is the place to call ahead and say ""I need two roast chicken dinners for pick up"" and where said chicken dinners will be awaiting you.Bandera is the place."
Stupidly good.  There is nothing you could go wrong with at this place.  I want to live there.Perfect meal there is:-Pint of 312-any appetizer-another Pint of 312-French Dip Sandwich (oh dang)-Banana Cream Pie
"This is one of our favorite places to dine downtown. The prices are very reasonable and everything we have had there is fantastic. I highly recommend the French Dip. (i prefer it not to be pink so I have to ask for it to be cooked a little longer). Delicious! Salads are great too. Rotisserie chickens are cooking when you walk in the door and they taste as good as they look! Best of all the customer service is top notch. They welcome you as soon as you walk in the door and the wait staff are very attentive. On the weekends there is a pianist and sometimes a person playing the cello. Highly recommend if your downtown. Only 1 downfall... they do not take reservations (to our knowledge) If your going on a weekend, go early unless you don't mind a little wait."
"One of my favorite places to eat downtown. The prices are on the ""high"" moderate side, but your portions reflect that.Favorites: The seared sashimi tuna, the Macho Chicken Salad, the queso dip and chips and the CORNBREAD!"
"Nice surprise after a long walk in the city. Great atmosphere and a small jazz band in the evenings. Food was great, try the corn bread it was wonderful. We will be back for dinner."
"I have eaten here several times. Every time I walk in, I'm not sure if I'm under or over dressed. As a regular dining spot, it almost feels too fancy for its own good. It's like a detached, modern mood restaurant without the personality. The service is so relaxed and detached. With that being said, the food is pretty good. The beet burger is very good, but it tends to fall apart like a sloppy joe. And beet's are definitely messy, so you're gonna need all of that napkin. On the side, I get the peanut coleslaw which is seriously better than the burger itself. It'd be worth it to go just for that. I have not tried anything else thruout all of my visits. For me, Bandera is pretty good, and is does have the upscale feel, but the other factors such as price and weird atmosphere make my visits merely occasional. But it's nice to have some ""pretty good"" and reliable spots, too."
"It is on Michigan Avenue ... in the busy tourist portion, which makes me fear walking over there.  However, the Macho Salad and well made bloody mary's made it worth it for me this weekend.I was with my boyfriend and we were both surprised by how much we enjoyed the meal having forgotten about it for a long time.  Great for a stop in after shopping at Nordstroms and before heading back to the reality of Chicago on weekends and I would think this would be a wonderful lunch spot (although I never made it here even when working two blocks down).Macho Salad has chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of goodness!"
"I am torn.  I always bring visitors here cause it's a nice place, there's live jazz, and the seating next to the window is cool and looks out over Michigan Ave.  Had a couple romantic dates here.  The jalapeno cornbread in a skillet is awesome, and the Macho Salad is one of the few salads I eat voluntarily.  But nothing else I've eaten here sticks out in my mind, which is a problem cause it's pretty expensive.  And the place gets a little too crowded most nights I would want to go.  Service is great.  It would be 3.5 stars if that were an option."
"So while visiting Chicago ...my friend suggested we try out Bandera..she said they were known for their Rotisserie chicken....now now I have to admit...I was doubtful..the first thing that popped into my head was the rotisserie chickens you get at the grocery store and I was like ehhhh...but was like okk lets try this place out :) soo we ordered the special apps...it was a cheese dip and a guacamole dip with home made nachos..can I just say I was in heaveeennn...the cheese dip had a kick to it and the nacho chips were hott and perfectly seasoned... So of course I ordered the rotisserie chicken with the green rice....all white meat (of course).....it was soo tender and juicy....It was amazing!!!! literally I had to stop myself from eating before I threw up from over eating...TMI?? lol...but seriously, it was the best meal I had in Chitown!!! The best part of the restaurant it faces the Magnificent mile (Michigan Avenue)....so it makes for great viewing pleasure or even a great place to bring a date ;) I will def go back for some more..and I def recommend anyone going to chicago..to try it out :) Its awesome!!!! Ohh I did not get to try the wines out..but they had a whole selections of wines....soo for you wine lovers...def a must place to be!!!"
Dark and Mysterious.  Salad was great.
Vegetarian food in Chicago! I couldn't believe it when I had 3 main course options at Bandera for dinner. Decent wine selection with yummy Central Coast wines being represented. The location is great too. I was plotting an attack on Nordstrom (across the street) as I ate my tasty mixed veggie plate. Usually those plates are half-hearted attempts to accommodate vegetarians but it was great here. Very tasty.
"The best place for a salmon! Served with mashed potatoes.. I hardly ever order anything else. LOVE IT! The corn bread is also very good for an appetizer.They also have tomato juice (about 80% don't). Very professional, friendly, very quick and super tasty. Never had a bad experience, been to the place at least a dozen times. If you'll get a window table you can enjoy a Michigan ave view while digesting your food. P.S. parking is a bit far, no valet..."
"Six ""Bobbin Buddie's"" on a fabulous weekend in Chicago chose Bandera's to dine before going to the theatre. What a FANTASTIC choice. Our entrees included  center cut filet, beef back ribs, prime rib, macho salad, and butternut and white cheddar enchilada.  Each one of us totally enjoyed our meal. I had the macho salad and it was so good!  We sat at a table for 6 that overlooked the street below with sparkling lights on all the trees. The band was playing and it was such a nice atmosphere. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a nice night out and not very expensive either."
This place is tasty! The food is pricey but you get large portions so bring your appetite. Wait staff is friendly but my only issue is that they don't take reservations so you end up waiting for hours for a table.
"I always avoided eating at Bandera because of my fear that anything on the Magnificent Mile would be horrible. First The Purple Pig proved that wrong and now Bandera. My wife and I took my parents here and we had a great time. The atmosphere has a late night club feel and that fits very well with the live jazz music they have playing (which is quite good). You are also visited with a giant rotisserie right when you walk in which I think has defeated the lobster tub as my new favorite item at a restaurant. Our server was very good. Nice, pleasant, knowledgeable on the menu and best of all - helpful with suggestions. I unfortunately cannot remember what everyone else ordered, I went with the ribs and chicken dish. A half slab of beef, yes beef, ribs and a half of a rotisserie chicken. Both were excellent and at a very reasonable price point. Make sure to get the corn bread as well, you won't be disappointed."
"Great Veggie Burger!!!!  ........ in adddition we had the ""Macho Salad"".  The place was casual but great food, and enjoyed the live Jazz (7 nights a week).   Had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated, but they were very professional and remembered my name when I went back up to the Hostess.  We will definitely go back!"
"This is the 3rd Bandera I have been to (Corona Del Mar and Brentwood).  Hands down the best location, on Michigan Ave next to Nordstroms on the 2nd floor.  Walked in and I was home.  Piano playing and a great dark bar.  Food was great, had the usual house margarita.  Overall a great experience."
"Never knew this place even existed on Michigan Avenue, but it's a nice place to escape to. They have really good corn bread. I had a pork dish and it was very moist and tender. The tuna poke was not bad. Everything they serve looks interesting plated. Not to mention the view is pretty nice if you want to see Michigan Ave. There was a long wait, so reservations are recommended for dining at night. I bet it gets packed on weekends too."
"I had just flown back to Chicago and I was tired and hungry, and it was late, and of course, it was Bandera that came to my rescue! Located a few blocks from my apartment and open late, it was perfect. I walked in, it was full, but I was seated within minutes, and I was brought my drink right away. I ordered my food, the rotisserie chicken with Spanish rice about 5 minutes later, and after another 5 minutes, I see my awesome waitress bringing my food, crazy! Now that is quick service! The chicken was well done, fresh and tender not mention impeccably seasoned and the rice complemented the chicken's flavors well. I do wish they had a few more options though, since it was a surprisingly limited menu."
"Good food. Pretty loud. Good service. Nice vibe and view if you sit by window. Not so cheap for lunch, but dinner cost is about what you'd expect."
"Decent spot tucked away on Michigan avenue that specializes in rotisserie chicken.  I came here with some clients, and it definitely has a sort of ""place to take clients for lunch"" kind of vibe.  The chicken sandwich was quite good, the service was prompt though the wait for a table at lunch was very long (unsurprisingly).  Didn't have any drinks as I was on good behavior for work stuff.  Overall I would say it is a pretty good place, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Here's how to have a 5 star lunch at Bandera-- 1) wear a sweater, it's always cold in there 2) go early to avoid tourists 3) order the cornbread in a skillet--it's super moist, a little sweet, and just delicious 4) order the macho salad-- avocados, rotisserie chicken pieces, cornbread croutons, almonds and dates make this the best  salad ever 5) if you're a small eater, split the above and then you won't feel bad wasting half of the best salad ever."
Classy and masculine - excellent.
"I've been seeing this place every time I passed by but never got in before. This time I decided to take the plunge. From outside it's above the ground so you have no idea what to expect. But this place is awesome. You walk in and it's a dim and elegant atmosphere. On saturdays there is live Jazz and the group that was playing when I was there (not sure if they change up) was great. As I was looking through reviews and tips on Foursquare I realized that people like their cornbread A LOT and decided to try it. OMG! It's SOO GOOD! Then I had their signature salad, the one with dates and avocado in it, and it was delicious. I don't live in Chicago therefore my perception on cheap/expensive may be misleading but it's a upper scale menu, so you make your own judgement on that. I sat by the windows and watched the Michigan Avenue the entire time. To me, even when you are alone, it's a great time... Would I go back? Yes but not a lot with those prices :) I hear their burgers are great too. Whether you are alone or with a date, it's a great place to be. Service was very friendly and prompt as well."
"I went to this restaurant Sunday night with my family and the customer service was possibly the most disturbing and disgusting , not really sure how they are in business because if they treat all their patrons as they us they shouldn't be around . The food was ok but nothing to write home about . It all started when after spending a wonderful day with my nephew and girlfriend , we were to meet my sister and husband their for dinner , we arrived and their were to be 2 tables well ours was not ready but my sister had gotten hers already so we walked to her table to say hi and there was a empty table beside hers we sat to say hi quirky and were ordered to move that second and told to wait outside, so we did then when seated at the table beside my sister after a long wait they were done eating . Well my party ate and my sister was still waiting in her bill and moved her chair to our table well you would have thought we had declared war because then the waitress asked my sister and husband to leave our table because it was against fire code which is nuts because we had five in total and table beside us had 6 . Long story short my sister finally got her bill paid her 300.00 bill and we paid ours and left. What a horrible experience ."
"My wife and I have been coming here for years because we love the food (queso dip, roasted chicken, tenderloin, hacked chicken salad), service (it's very good and very consistent), and the ambiance (love the live jazz music). The only advice I would give is to make reservations! You can easily be stuck waiting for an hour or longer on a Friday or Saturday night if you do not."
"They didn't have vegetarian options and waiter scoffed when I asked to have something without meat. I went awhile ago, but haven't been back. The atmosphere was a bit stuffy, and food overpriced. Not recommended."
Great place to take clients for lunch. Terrific burgers and thin fries.  Macho salad is also very good. I love sitting by the window overlooking Michigan avenue.
"Overall good food, great atmosphtere.  We had to wait two hours, that's what we get for going out on a Friday night!  There was a live jazz band and a couple that decided to get up and take advantage of the music and dance.  Not alot of menu choices, but still tasty.  Mostly just cool atmosthere w/ the windows facing out on Michigan Ave. and listening to the live music."
"Bandera is great. Just back from lunch there with my cousins from Hawaii, and they loved it too.  The second-floor view over Michigan Avenue is an excellent Chicago experience, and the food is really tasty. (I've had the Macho Salad the last couple times--chicken, dates, avocado, lettuce, tomato, great dressing.) Go there at night to hear mellow jazz and watch Michigan Avenue light up.  And, hey, all you 97 people who have viewed my profile--only 12 useful, 5 funny, and 4 cool?  Yike!"
"Excellent food, service, and drinks. The wait was about 40 minutes, but grab a drink at the bar and it won't matter. The enchiladas are a must have.  Prices are good for the amount of food that you get. A definite must go to!"
"I went here with my husband after watching a show at Millennium park. It was an absolute disaster and we should have never stepped foot in the place. Aside from the fact I couldn't tell what the hell this place was trying to be thanks to a random menu and music selection -  My gripe is with a few things - price, portion size, hygiene and damage control. First off, they charge $13 for a caesar salad that based on the size of this thing should be more like $8. There is no way this should be considered an entree size. A complete rip off. Secondly, we ordered a side of asparagus and when it came out, there was hair in it. I can't say for sure but it looked like pubic hair. I sent it back disgusted not even wanting to finish my salad let alone get a redone side of asparagus. After this, the apparent manager came over and apologized asking if she could bring something out on them. To that I said no. Frankly, I wasn't interested in eating anything else that came out of their kitchen. I expected them to take something off the bill considering we ordered a salad and bowl of soup which cost next to nothing to produce. But no. They comped nothing. We left $35 poorer. Yes that's right folks, $35 for a salad, bowl of soup and one beer, I will NEVER go back. Had I known they wouldn't have comped anything, I would have taken the manager up on her offer and asked for a steak then have them wrap it up to bring to my dog (which I don't have)."
"i had the french dip which was phenomenal and a fresh sqeezed orange juice and vodka. I also ordered the artichoke which was delicious. I ate some of my girlfriends macho salad which was awesome, the cornbread croutons....mmmm good!!!"
"wowza.i love this place. ive eaten here twice and ordered the same thing - center cut filet with mashed potatoes and spinach with a nice glass of red. its delicious, but definitely pricey. i especially enjoy the view of michigan ave from the dining room. so all around: great location/view, fun piano music, superb service, certainly romantic, excellent food/drinks and neither time did we wait very long. we ordered drinks at the bar and they had a table ready for us before we had a few sips! they did seat two mom's with their children right across from us, but they were a riot. definitely an entertaining portion of the evening (but im a pediatric nurse - i love kids). others may not find that as entertaining."
"Modern, well-lit restaurant with jazz band, unoriginal menu with $25 entrees, $10 wine, and a bar with no scene. Nice 2d floor view of Michigan Ave. Good place to chill out, read a book, sip a $9 Jack, and listen to unobtrusive  music. Good date place if you don't want to impress your date."
"There's really no difference between burgers @ Houston's & Bandera...they're both deeelicious, dare I say...the BEST burger in town.   And the cast iron skillet cornbread?  To die for...I didn't even like cornbread before trying Bandera's version.  Because it's got windows that overlook Michigan & live jazz on certain nights...Bandera's also a nice first date restaurant or place to bring folks visiting the city.  Two thumbs way up."
"Hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten in my life.  If it wouldn't cause me to weigh 300lbs, I'd eat it daily.  It's so good I can't even express it in words.  In fact, I liked it so much that it's all I've ever ordered.  That's sad, because friends have told me that the rotisserie chicken is just as good, and that the salads are wonderful.  I tried a spoonful of my husband's tortilla soup - so good.  I love tortilla soup, and they have a great version.  I've never been there for dinner, but lunch fairly often."
"I've only been here for lunch numerous times.  Their salads have been filing and have some flair to them.  I've yet to order a non-salad dish, but the prices do jump a lot from lunch to dinner.Also, the waitstaff at the bar are incredibly friendly."
"As I was having a meeting at the InterContinental Hotel, I thought an early dinner at Bandera would work out well.  It is just two doors down the street from this classic hotel.  Bandera has been serving good quality food for many years.  The restaurant overlooks Michigan avenue from its perch on the second floor.  The large rotisserie is clearly visible as soon as you walk in the door.  I generally recommend guests have something from the rotisserie as they are well-known for these foods.  I particularly like the chicken and the pork.  A colleague had the thin slices of roasted leg-of-lamb which were also reported to be quite good.  The restaurant is relatively dark and most always busy.  The tables are dark wood and are not covered for your meal.  There usually a three piece band playing, which makes for a nice background during your dinner and with the low lighting, gives the place a nice atmosphere.  While it's not fine dining (you often find meatloaf as the dinner special; try the banana cream pie for dessert), the food is good quality, All-American food.  I took clients here for dinner who seemed to enjoy it.  If you are in the city shopping for the day, consider Bandera to finish out a lovely afternoon on the avenue."
"Stopped in the other day to have lunch with a friend, and I have to say I was very impressed.  Great service by our waiter, Jermaine, who was quick to refill our waters when they got low.  I had the lamb sandwich, which came with a delicious au jus dipping sauce.  My friend had the macho salad, which I tried and it was very good.  Oh and did I mention the cornbread???  Amazing.  Definitely coming back here again for a date or bring the parents when they come in town next month.  Very reasonably priced for being downtown."
"I still love to eat here, but I still hate the blinds.New window blinds ruin an old favorite. Obscuring the view doesn't warm-up the space - it makes it feel like a prison.  If it ain't broke...Normally I would give Bandera a 5-star review. I have been coming to the Michigan Ave 2nd floor location for many years. The food is great, the service is friendly and efficient, and both are consistent from visit to visit. There are skilled bartenders and live jazz nightly. The atmosphere is warm and inviting for lunch, but the place really shines (or rather doesn't) for dinner. For dinner Bandera puts on a different face with dimmed lights grazing the dark interior finishes, copper and wood glint here and there, and of course that live jazz. The best tables in the house were (emphasis on 'were') always at the window - and they were worth the wait. This brings me back to the reason 3 stars are subtracted from this review. Last night when I dined at Bandera I chose to wait an hour for a window table, even though my guests were hungry and there were banquets a plenty on this Wednesday evening. When I got to my window seat  I was stunned by the addition of wood blinds blocking my view. I tried to rationalize the addition: The windows face West, but generous exterior awnings and the high-rises of Michigan Ave block direct sun. And it's 9pm. And the blinds don't open - there are no cords to raise them.  (see prison comment above)With no obvious explanation coming to me, I  complained incessantly to the patient and sympathetic staff. Everyone from the runner to the GM gave me the same explanation: An edict from HQ to ""warm-up"" the space. Really? I mean I get it, Hillstone is based in the West - the other Bandera restaurants look out on not-much-of-anything. However, this isn't Sacramento. The Hillstone people should put a little bit of trust in their local leadership and take some time to learn about the different markets they serve.  It right there on the main Yelp page: 35 reviewers on yelp cite the ""..great view of Michigan Avenue..."" I'm not done. A trip to the restroom revealed another misguided effort. I don't miss the monitors over the urinals, however the thin, cheap-looking oak plywood is no improvement. You can't cut the material around the fixtures and expect it to look good. The engaging and ever-patient GM assured me that the finished product would be presentable - but I have my doubts.Other than my complete and utter disappointment in the heavy-handed changes coming down the corporate pipe, it was a typical evening at Bandera with great food and great service."
"Bandera is one of those places that feels a lot classier than its price range. Even though it's ""casual"", if I dress down, I feel wrong. The live jazz, the location, and the sleek vibe all bump up the coolness factor. And then there's the food: oh mercy. Talk about ""yum"". There's a whole lot of comfort food disguised as fancy entrees with long, artful names. Each time I've been here, there were only about one or two vegetarian selections, but they've never disappointed. It's also a snazzy date place."
"Spectacular!! Here for a vacation/buisness trip and this was a great find. The Macho salad is a MUST have. In fact it is so good I had to go back a second time for another helping of it. Brought a co-worker with me this time around for the must have and she said "" this is the best salad I have ever had"" ""French Dip is a yummy choice"" said one of our other dining companions. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. The service is friendly and quick ( a great deal for lunch in between meetings or tourist attractions) Kudos to the bartender for great desert service late night and the    waitress Samantha. Bon Appetito...."
"The rotisserie chicken is solid, but I can get a chicken just as good at Chicken Planet downtown for a lot less.  The burgers are decent, and the fries are good.  I was disappointed with the wine list.  It was very heavily weighted with California selections, which is probably fine for a lot of people, but it's not my thing.  I had a viognier from the region, and it just wasn't that special, certainly not worth the $10 they charged me.  The hidden bargain at this place is a glass of Taylor Fladgate 20 year tawny for only $8.  That is an absolute steal, as most restaurants that have port offer their run of the mill ports at that price.  A 20 year tawny generally runs at least $50 a bottle at a liquor store.  I agree with others that the service is very good, also."
"We had the roasted chicken and ahi tuna ""poke"" - quite good. Style is informal and a number of people seemed to be eating dinner at the bar. Although it took a while to get a table (without reservation on a Fri eve in Aug - place was packed), once we did the service was attentive and pleasant. For the first part of our dinner a jazz trio played, which was great. Overall, looked like a combination of locals and tourists - very nice."
"This was again another choice made based on the fact that we were cold, tired, and lazy.  The interior of this place was dim and cozy.  The food was okay, but nothing particularly special.  Our waitress was nice.  There was a live jazz band playing which I guess is cool if you like jazz."
"There are probably a few better restaurants in Chicago.  But few have cuisine that ""hits the spot"" as well as Bandera.  I've heard  their menu referred to as ""Contemporary American Comfort Food"", and I'd say that's accurate.  Everything was very flavorful, the sides were extremely fresh and complimented the meal very well.  The jazz was even good, and I am not a jazz lover.  I really liked the decor as well."
"This place has been around a for a long time....They keep doing there style of food well and it is a good locaton.,,Service is slow but des that really matter?  Not really but when you are in the area stop by and try"
Very nice bar! My burger was fantastic! Just a great semi casual place for a nice dinner. Great view of Mich Ave!
I went there around 12:30 and the restaurant was packed with a 25min wait. I had the macho salad. It was good and plentiful. Great place to have lunch.
This was one of my favorite restaurants and now its gone down hill. The food was cold when we did receive it. Our waitress was no where to be found except when it was time to pay the bill and honestly they need to update the menu. I have just moved back to Chicago after being gone for two years you would think they would have change a bit. NOPE!!! The only thing I love is the grilled artichoke with jalapeno dipping sauce its so delicious.
"Truly one of the better 4 star restaurants Ive eaten at.  The food is really good, but not great.  They got a live band, but I wasnt really moved by the beat.  Waitresses and hostesses were really friendly.  A little bit more expensive, but thats because this aint a family restaurant.  Bottom line, this place doesnt disappoint at all, but I wish there was more that would want me to give it 5 stars.  So come here if your in town for a few nights and you want to burn your per diem, because thats what I do."
"Bandera's roasted chicken is amazing!  That alone is worth 5 stars!  I have never tried any of the other entrees.  Their corn bread is also really good, so is the grilled jumbo artichoke.  The restaurant also has a nice view of Michigan Avenue, and I love the live jazz.  Space wise, the mirrors along one wall make it seem larger than it really is."
"My wife and I went for dinner.  The atmosphere is very nice and the music was great.  Everyone was very friendly but the service was a little lacking for the prices that they charge.  I warned the bus boy that I drink a lot of water but couldn't find him twice when my glass went dry.  Disappointed that they do not serve bread before the meal, unless you pay for it.  My wife's Prime Rib was very good, I ordered the Beef Ribs and was disappointed with the amount of meat on the bones.  I mentioned it to the waitress, she apologized and came back and said that I could order extra ribs for $4.00 each.  I consider that to be classless.  Would I go back, maybe?"
"Sometimes simple traditional food is underrated.  I always get the prime rib or the french dip and mashed potatos and it's perfect.  I am also not one to get dessert, but their banana cream pie is awesome."
sudden rain ruined our plans to watch the MIN vs GB game at a bar in the area. so randomly went to Bandera for cover. sat by the bar. v dim lit. kind of uppity vibe. and had live jazz music. which was nice. and not overly loud. to distract me from the game. ordered the macaroni & cheese plate. YUM. and a bargain. for just 5 dollars i think. and we shared the corn bread & foccacia plate. the blob of guacamole. that came plated with it. was the BEST. can definitely tell it was just made fresh. with the chunks of avocados. not the regular mush that comes as dip. also had the 312. this chicago beer. is everywhere. it's just okay for my liking. but did love the super cold frosty glass the bartender poured it in. my friend loved her red wine she ordered. pinot noir?
"Ahhh God, this place rocks.  It smells great, the waitstaff is on top of their game, the wine is good, and the veggie burger is one tasty treat.  I love getting a window seat here; it always seems to facilitate the best conversations with whomever I'm dining with."
"After hearing great things about Bandera, my friend and I stopped in here for lunch while shopping on Michigan Ave.  We weren't starving so we decided to split the queso dip appetizer and each got a side salad.  The queso dip isn't really queso dip -- we got a blob of cold, kind of chunky, jalapeno cheese on a plate.  It definitely was not what we were expecting when we ordered queso and we were actually pretty disappointed with it.  However, the salad was really good.  Avocado and goat cheese both on a side salad - I'm sold!  And I can't forget the cornbread croutons.  I dont even like croutons, but these were a bit sweet and very yummy!  After reading the reviews (I should have done that before going) I may have to give Bandera another chance and order more of a real meal and not just an appetizer.  I'll let ya know!"
"Had lunch there last week and the food is really good.  had the salad with Sushimi and it was perfect, not a lot of dressing.  The service was speedy which was good foro lunch and the bill was reasonable....always going there when looking for a good Michigan Avenue lunch.  The wait can be rough sometimes so settle in for a drink at the bar while waiting!"
"This place is one of the greatest gems on the mag mile.  Very cozy and not excessively loud.  If you're lucky enough to get a table  overlooking the 'ave' it's quite an experience.  I take my visitors here... they've got great cocktails, a decent wine list and great food.  Salmon is only ok, but the steaks rock!! My favorite app is the pricey tuna/avocado thing... it's so yummy.  They also have really good salads... this place is perfect to catch a drink, have a nice lunch or enjoy a nice casual dinner."
"Best restaurant on the Ave...hands down! Tuna Poke, hacked chicken salad, and French dip are out of this world. Gotta try the banana cream pie!!!! Amazing!!!"
"I don't know how they train their cooks, but Bandera has the most consistent food I have ever had. It is always exactly the same: delicious!!! The macho salad and veggie burger are quite good like everyone else has mentioned. The atmosphere is dark and cozy, and the staff is friendly and not pretentious at all. This place is run perfectly. Highly recommended."
Can never get a good seat but the food is amazing.
"Went here for lunch today and I might of had the best veggie burger ever! As some of the other yelpers have said and I have to agree - it is amazing. It nearly melts in your mouth when you are eating it. I thought about getting the Macho salad since I have heard so many great things, maybe next time."
"This place was amazing.  The ambiance was great, and the hostess and waitress provided great service.  We sat next to the live jazz band, they were so passionate about the music that the drummer and bass player kept their eyes closed as they belted out a beautiful melody.  I had a burger which was terrific and the hubby had a salad.  The cabernet was great, the merlot was ok.  Great experience overall."
"Love love love this place.  Macho Salad is so yummy along with the corn bread!  Recently tried an appetizer I think it was poke something or another.  Fresh tuna, shrimp, avocado and mango salad drizzled with a special dressing.  Was so fresh and light...so delish.The atmosphere is also warm and welcoming.  Perfect for a lunch or dinner date....Enjoy!"
My wife and I love the Macho salad here.  Great window seats.
"We love Bandera - thanks to KC showing us the light!  The range of selections are great, the wine list is accessible, and the staff is great.  Good for after work events, casual dinners overlooking Michigan Avenue, or a special occasion to celebrate with friends.  The best value on the menu is the seared tuna with salad - awesome tastes!"
"I'm giving Bandera 5 stars because I believe it is a very underestimated restaurant, especially for atmosphere and value.All the food I've had here has been good, especially their steaks and rotisserie meats.  Their Jumbo Artichoke appetizer is awesome and a must have at any meal.The atmosphere is dark and cozy.  The booths against the far wall set a good date mood and the track lighting directly above the tables ensures that you can see your food just fine.  There's been live instrumental music all of the times I've gone.Important note: I do not believe there is valet parking so use a cab."
"Hey I totally forgot I ate here!  No seriously I was cleaning my desk off and found the receipt to the place (sort of how I remember to review things) and thought ""oh yeah I better write a review on Bandera!""  The problem is I can't remember what I ordered.  Was it some sort of sandwich?  That would make sense because it was lunch.  I mean I do remember being there.. the interior of the place was fairly cool, and it had a view I think... of something.  I don't really remember what.  Was my experience good, was it bad?  I guess my memory could just be failing me or maybe it just wasn't that remarkable one way or another to remember anything.  I think I'll go with that."
"The atmosphere was really cozy and we were right next to a live jazz band which added to the whole feel of the restaurant.  The food was really filling - the cornbread has a little bit of jalapeno in it which makes it really good; I really like their ribs and chicken, too.  And their salads are HUGE which makes me feel like I'm eating a very healthy meal."
"I personally found Bandera to be a bit pricey-but the food was delicious. We strolled in for an early lunch on Sunday. We did not realize that this place was a bit swanky-swanky in a good way. It definitely was not so swanky that we felt out of place. The service was excellent; the view was great and the food delicious. The bf had the burger-which was excellent. I had the sashimi tuna salad, also great. But, 17 bucks for a salad...really? A bit too pricey for me. We sat right by the windows, which was great people watching. I would take out of town guests here...but for an everyday lunch, I would pass."
"I love this place.  Cozy booths, great view of Michigan Avenue and fantastic food.   You can see all the chicken roasting over fire when you come in.  Yummy.  Hands down they serve the best corn bread in the City.  No kidding... comes piping hot in a cast iron pan.  Delish.  They make a wonderful salad  called the Macho Chicken salad with avacado, chopped dates and GOAT cheese for $15!   - not exactly low cal but that's what makes it wonderful I suppose.  Chain or not.. good food and service.  Highly recommended."
"I ate here a few months back and had the fish, one of the daily specials.  It was very fresh there were no prices, I was a bit surprised at the $30 price tag but decided overall it was worth it.  Everything is moderately priced and a la carte.  I hear the chicken is amazing but no one ordered it, I will be back some day to try it out."
"I felt the need to give five stars to make up for Mary M and her moronic review. Bandera has great food, and it's in the best interest of the manager to know why a lousy tip was left.  Most bad tips are the result of poor service, and if a waiter / waitress gives me bad service, I would love the manager to come over and ask why, and potentially rectify the situation.  If the bad tip is a result of some jerk who doesn't think he needs to tip, then not only should that guest NOT go out to eat, but the manager should know that the guy is just a loser, so that the waiter / waitress doesn't take the heat for it.C'mon, tipping has been around for over 40 years.  If you're so crotchety and grumpy and still refuse to tip, don't go out to eat.  Paying the wait staff $2/hour allows food costs to be lower, so tips are a part of their income.   I hope Mary M's fiance was humiliated and his feeling's were hurt, because imagine how the waitress would've felt if the manager assumed she did a bad job.  THAT is why they come over and ask, to ensure that the meal was top notch and there were no problems.  It's not to embarrass deadbeats.  That is just a bonus.Stay inside and eat your Hungry Man, you freaking slug."
"Mmm Mmm Cornbread.This is a great restaurant to go to reps with.  Pretty quick service (even though last time we waiting about an hour, arg)."
"Ate here tonight on a recommendation from a co-worker.  I read a few reviews before heading over and the rotis. chicken looked like a favorite among other things.  I had the chicken; got a half chicken, and substituted their home made fries instead of the rice .  Fries are skinny, not regular fat ones and were excellent.  The chicken was also excellent and I would order it again but without the southwest sauce it was placed on.  I'm glad they didn't cover the chicken in the sauce so I could eat around it.  Ambiance is excellent with a live 2 piece band (piano and bass player).  Service was fast, food arrived fast, and everyone was very pleasant and friendly.  I was too full to try the deserts.   I highly recommend it."
Delicious meal. Wonderful staff. When you first walk in the smells are divine. Best meal I had in Chicago. Great since it was on the last day!
