Cafecito
"There aren't too many awesome, hidden gem restaurants in the heart of downtown, but my goodness, this is definitely one of them. Thank you for being close to my work and apartment.The steak chimichurri pressed sandwich is mouth-watering and highly recommended. I've ordered it three times now, and it never disappoints. The plantains are great too (just expensive at $2.50/small container).The restaurant is small, and it gets reallllly crowded during lunch hour on weekdays. There aren't many tables at all, so it's best to just do carry-out if you're going during that time. There is a small station in the corner at the back of the restaurant for hot sauces. The containers suck though because it's a little difficult to put the lids on them. Three types of hot sauces are available. They are all good, but they are all VERY hot (at least for my taste buds). My eyes were tearing from the spiciness. So, dip and pour with caution!***NOTE: Go to their website to print out a coupon for a completely free house coffee***"
"I've been here another time and the sammiches are delicious. This time around I ordered the Cubano, which had roasted pork, ham, swiss, mustard, and pickles. The Cubano was amazing. Super crispy and pressed. I wish the sandwiches were bigger, but then again, I do eat a lot. The line is always out the door, but then again, I feel like their order system could be fine-tuned better, versus the shouting of the name and hoping the customer hears it.Overall, tasty sandwiches, without having to go to Cuba."
"Looking for a decent lunch place and I found this awesome Cuban spot.They offer primarily sandwiches.I had the tilapia sandwich with pesto sauce and some veggies.  The sandwich tasted very flavorful and not fishy.  Price for most sandwiches is under $10, quite reasonable.Customer sandwich was fantastic.  I got back to the office and found they gave me the wrong sandwich. When I went back, the lady remembered exactly what I ordered and immediately gave me the right one.  Be mindful that I don't order what is on the menu, usually it's this minus this and that because I'm a picky person.  The lady apologized too.  Decent lunch spot and I would go back knowing they will make sure I am happy and get what I want."
"Cafecito! 5 stars for food, -1 star due to location. So let's sum up how cafecito worked for me. Let's say this is your first time going there. There's a line (literally) out the door, you're right under the L, the L is going by constantly. They ask to take your order....wait, what? Where's the menu? Where's the, you know, options? Excuse me while I try to decide on food that I can't even see what's listed.In addition to that generally being a pain in the ass, it's simply too loud to enjoy the food here. Is the food awesome? Yes. My sandwich was great/awesome, inexpensive, and I can see why this place is popular. Was the soup awesome? Yes, delicious black bean soup is delicious. I had to actually walk away from cafecito to have an actual conversation because it was so fn loud. I guess I'm not used to that part of downtown busy life yet. If I come back here, it'll be orders to go only. I'm sure I will actually come back, because the food itself is definitely top notch. The food choices for vegetarians are a bit limited, however."
"Fantastic lunch spot! Get here early the place will have a long line by 12:00 noon. One of the best cubano sandwiches I've ever had, cooked perfectly, each ingredient was proportioned perfectly so as not to overpower the other. The black bean soup not so good or hot! Looking forward to my next visit!"
"Delicious food! As other reviewers have said, be prepared to wait. I got there around 11:30. There was a line, but it doubled by the time I got my food! I had the salad/sandwich combo - cubano and pasta salad. Both were really great! This was my first time, so next time I know that a sandwich would probably be plenty of food. Despite the line, service was steady. The people behind the counter were bickering a bit, but they kept the line under control."
"Pretty good...not what we were expecting though!!We had yelped HARD in advance to find what we hoped would be something new and different...and Cuban! I'm no expert on Cuban food, but what I have had in the past has been distinctly flavorful and tasty. I ordered the jardin, and my husband (on recommendation from the lady at the register who rung us up) ordered the jerk because it was supposed to be spicy and savory. We got our sandwiches after a bit of a wait...while my jardin was very, very fresh and clearly great quality, it tasted like a veggie panini that I could have ordered anywhere. My husband was pretty disappointed with his jerk sandwich because he couldn't taste much spice at all, and thought the chicken seemed like plain grilled chicken. The pressed bread was very nice, but again...just not what we were expecting!!I'd be happy to try something else or try again, because this place gets such great reviews!! Maybe they ran out of herbs/spices that day??"
"Just follow the bike messengers, they know where the fuel is. Tiny. A-OK.Out of some plates already at 1:45, we wanted the lechon or palomilla, out of both. The 3rd choice ropa vieja was surprisingly good, more of a short grain ""pulled pork"" style skirt steak nearly stew, lots of onions, excellent slo-cooked flavors. Beans and yummy buttered garlic rice, very good black bean soup, no salt bombs. Not a big fan of the mushy not crisply fried plantains we received, ick.The cubano is fairly priced for $6 but nothing thick or memorable in there, no habanero aioli that's for sure. Nice fresh panini bread toasts well for the cubano and dips nicely in the bean soup. Go to Dario's in Palatine for an $8 cubano with THICK pork, ham, cheese and pickles you can find, and a sandwich you can split for two. Get the plates here if you have time, nothing that special about their cubano imo, still tasty, a cubano beats most sandwiches.  Looking forward to trying breakfast and the shakes, particularly Guava.Solid strong coffee. N0 bathrooms-Does the staff have to go to Arbies too?Be prepared to wait for a place to sit (seats 20?), or be ready to head out. No outdoor seating at this location. Good road food and coffee. 3.5"
One of my favorite sandwich shops in the city.Great sandwiches at a great price.Never been disappointed.
This place has some amazing sandwiches! I try to go there about twice a month. :)
"Speaking on behalf of every Filipino in Chicago, lechon has a special, particular meeting for me. Cafecito's lechon doesn't have the crunchy pig skin of the Filipino version, but at four very good tasting ingredients, it's the best sandwich I've had in Chicago.At its best lechon is a fully roasted pig, exterior skin crackly crisp but still with tender, moist and rich meat on the inside. The meat on this sandwich was definitely moist rich, with a hint of a variety of spices to help things along. The arugula (at least, I think it was arugula), tomato and grilled onions kept the inside part of the sandwich moist but leaving the outside part thin and grill-pressed.After having a coffee on the way into the Loop, I decided to get an alfajor from a local bakery, and was rewarded with a pastry that was cookie-sized, very chocolatey and all the right kinds of crumbly on the inside.The next time I'm here (and don't have to worry about an interview) I'm going to wait in line as long as it takes to get a cubano sandwich. Cafecito is an awesome, cheap place to eat in the Loop."
"Overall: Good sized delicious cubanos. Just be ready to wait!The good: Good tasting sandwiches. Not the best I've had by a long shot, but for the price the sizes and tastes are good. They have plenty of other options, salads, etc., but let's be real here...The bad: The wait was looonngg at prime time (noon). Waited probably 20 minutes as the line went out the door. Not much room to wait once you order. If you do decide to eat there, there's like 2 tables, and you wouldn't want to with all the people waiting.Atmosphere: 7/10Service: 8/10Food: 8/10"
"One of my primary lunch or take home dinners when I work in the loop.  I have tried just about every Cuban sandwich joint in the city and this by far is my favorite.  The classic Cubano is delicious, but I tend to favor the Jerk for it's spice.  Mind you this is the one place that I will break my normal no mayo based condiment rule.Another big plus, other places bread tends to get soft during travel.  Cafecito's bread maintains that fresh from the press crisp from the loop to Logan.  There is a popular place not even a mile from my place in Logan that can't even do that.  If you want a great Cuban sandwich this should be on your must do list."
"I really miss having a good cubano and double cafecito. So when I have a chance to head to the city I usually go to 90 miles cafe. Today I was in the loop and have this a go. The crazy long line was a good sign that this place is legit. The line went quick, I got my double cafecito, sat by the window and enjoyed my drink. Sweet and strong, just like.... insert some double entendre here.Too bad I had lunch at home, otherwise I'd also have one of my favorite sandwiches"
"nice selection of Cuban style sandwiches.  We had the Lechon sando and it was tasty. It was made quickly. Right near Grant park. I left wanting a little bigger portion. Good quick meal.Whoops, I selected the wrong location."
"Good food. Terrible delivery service. I recommend this place to my boss for our annual 5 hour team meeting; 4 very simple orders, just a couple miles away. He placed the call at 9AM for a noon delivery-- we got our food at 2PM! They forgot our drinks, extra pickles in my sandwich, we got hummus with no chips and a non-apologetic delivery woman. It's really a shame, we could've recommended the business to so many other departments."
"The fact that today was my first Cafecito experience is a true shame, this place is AMAZING. I ordered the Ropa Vieja sandwich and it was delicious - bursting with Cuban flavor, juicy, and plentiful in steak. I shamelessly scarfed it down as I navigated the loop lunch crowd. The fact that my hands and lips were being stained red with every bite was no deterrent for a sandwich this tasty. Do not fear the crowds in this tiny little cafe. It took me only a few minutes to order, and no longer than 10-15 minutes to have my sandwich safely in my hands, ready to tear it apart. For a mere $7-ish, I can confidently say that, Cafecito, I will be back for more!"
"2015 is the year I discovered my love for Cuban sandwiches thanks to Cafecito. Cafecito is my favorite place in the loop. It's fast, it's cheap, and it is seriously delicious. I'm pretty picky about my sandwiches and I love this place. Definitely get the Cubano sandwich, but also come back and try the other sandwiches they have. I recommend the Jerk Chicken or the Steak chimichurri. They're all amazing and they all have tasty and unique topping and sauces on them. The bread is awesome, soft but still crunchy on the outside. The meat is so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Today I tried the special, called the Borracho sandwich. It had shrimp, chipotle aioli, jalapenos, and jicama slaw. Honestly, it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! And this might be super dumb to say, but I felt like I was on vacation when I ate this sandwich, not in Chicago. Amazing!"
Great local breakfast spot. Cuban style breakfast. I was there early so it wasn't crowded. I got the huevos con chorizo. It was great. Great price too. Loved it. Would definitely go back.
"I was really pleased with my Cubano sandwich. It's not the best sandwich I've ever had, but for the price, it is a really good deal.I had heard about the long lines around lunch time, so I planned for a late lunch after 1 p.m. When I got there, the line was still out the door. The line moves pretty fast though, and I got my sandwich just minutes after I ordered it. I ate my sandwich inside, but it is really crowded around lunch time. Next time, I'll just take it to go."
"Got the food to go last night.  Ropa Vieja was just ok and the Pollo Chimichurri had a decent flavor, but was dry and meat was cold. The rice tasted like its been sitting a while.  Dry and clumpy. The plantain's tasted good.  I think they buy the flan from a bakery (had the name of a bakery on the bottom of the package), and if they do, they should get them to maybe cook the flan a little longer.  It seemed like they were under cooked. It tasted more like a custard until you actually mixed it with the caramel and then the caramel kind of hid the flavor of the flan.Most of the reviews here are for the sandwiches, so maybe next time ill try their sandwich instead..."
"The food at Cafecito was delicious. I got the Jerk sandwich- filled with moist jerk chicken, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a creamy habanero lime dressing that really pulled the whole sandwich together. It was filling and pretty inexpensive! Definitely will be returning for lunch in the future."
"I saw that ""vegetarians go nuts for this place,"" but looking at the menu it didn't made a lot of sense.  But, I followed my heart and ordered the sandwich with the sort of fried cheese on it. So flavorful and the texture of it ALL is perfect.  And now, as a vegetarian, I go nuts for this place."
"Not as great as I expected. The line was pretty long, so my hopes were high. I had the Jerk sandwich, but it really wasn't that spicy. However it's a decent lunch for the price."
"Ugggh I can tell I'm going to really start going to this place, but with the grease soaking through the sandwich wrap I'm skeptical of it being healthy. lol. I came here for lunch yesterday and the line was out the door. I had plenty of time to review the menu. I think their most popular sandwich is the Cubano, but i decided to go with the Steak Chimchurri. The flavor and seasoning are excellent and the press bread is delicious. I may update my review to 5 stars once I try more menu items, especially the dessert. I was eyeing the key line pie, but decided to be good. Oh they have churros!! :)"
"I would definitely recommend the Cubano sandwich, but the Jerk was only okay. The jerk had a unique flavor of spices, but the chicken was pretty dry. Although the line can get long, the service is quick. If you've never tried a Cubano sandwich, it's a must go!"
"The Cuban was so good that I almost ate my fingers trying to ensure I consumed every bite. It is the smallest establishment ever with a seriously long line. If you are pressed for time or impatient, this is not the place for you. If you like panini like sandwiches at a competitive price, this should be on your checklist. Took an outing with several colleagues who put this place in heavy rotation. They insisted we had to get there by 11:45a to avoid a long wait in the 10 degree temps. This alone was almost a deterrent but I decided to see what all the hype was about. Cafecito delivered. It was tasty, pretty cheap and very close to the office.  I can see why this is a favorite join for many. It is just that good."
Yum yum yum. I've had Cuban sandwiches in Miami that are not as good as this place. The Cuban milkshake with the guava flavor is scrumptious. My only complaint is that b/c it gets so packed in a small place it is really HOT and there is no where to stand. Maybe some outdoor tables or a better way to control the line and people waiting to get their food would be helpful.
"One bite and you'll know why... It took me 30 mins from leaving my desk, walking 2 blocks and coming back but it was worth it. I arrived to a line out the door, which makes sense since it is a small place with seating for 8-10 if that. I got a Cortadito (Cuban coffee with a little milk) while I waited. Best coffee I have had since my trip to the Bahamas.. makes me wonder why I have been settling for the free stuff at work. I got the Chipotle press and I began my review after my first bite. I am literally still working on it! - I did find it a bit salty after I got to finishing it, they can tone that down and its still good!-  I will be stopping by for Coffee on the walk to work, and definitely need to try the Margharita and their grilled cheese. They also have a whole variety of sides like pasta salad, salads, blackbean and corn.. and a bunch of sweet treats for you sweet toothed yelpers! Let me know if you're going.. I'll buy if you fly!"
Love the cafe con leche here. Cuban espresso with a teaspoon of sugar added to steamed milk.
"I've been to this location multiple times for lunch and have eaten most of their sandwiches. My favorite is the traditional cubano, roasted pork, ham, swiss, pickles and mustard. They offer larger plates of food and side dishes, although I haven't tried these options.Inside is quite small and can get crowded during lunch hour. I usually order a sandwich to go. For quick, tasty hot pressed sandwiches give them a try."
"GREAT coffee, maybe my favorite in the city.So why only 4 stars?Line is long and seating can be scarce, especially during lunch time.  Normally I don't fault a restaurant for this, but there's no real waiting area so it feels cramped and disorganized.  Still, the great coffee makes it worth the inconvenience."
"The best cafe con leche I could find in Chicago. I dont understand how people go to the starbucks in front. If you value good coffee and good bread, its the place to go! And the staff is super friendly"
"I feel like I'm echoing everyone else in saying this is one of my favorite lunch places. You get a big yummy sandwich for a good price and they're pretty quick. I always get a Cubano because I'm a creature of habit.Sign up for the text offers! It's usually around 10%-15% off your bill but hey, it's something. Like everyone else has mentioned, don't plan on eating there because there's like 2 little tables inside. If you want to avoid the really long line, go before noon (like 11:40) or closer to 1."
The exotica salad is awesome! The plantains and side salads are delicious. I usually get the hearts of palm and artichoke salads.
"No frills, fast, yummy and fairly-priced Cuban sandwich. Seating is limited and the space is small so plan to be in and out. I'd be here more if I worked nearby!Grab 'n go lunch spot."
"This is my go to lunch place since it is so close to the financial district but I would have this everyday if I could. Delicious ! Try the Chivito or Pollo Chipotle! Also the cafe con leche - large for only $2.75. Can't beat that.The sandwiches are very flavorful and very reasonably priced. The people are always friendly and although a tiny place, the line moves rather quickly"
"People were not exaggerating this is the best sandwich bite you could have in the loop, if not in all Chicago. I can't get over the fact that I have been living so close for a year and never tried it."
"I'm thinking that their meat sandwiches might be better than their vegetarian options.  I've had the Timba (guava, swiss cheese) and the Elveez (peanut butter, guava jam, sweet plantains), and both were good but seemed a little plain.  Their salads and sides look amazing, but the palm heart salad I ate was too vinegary.  I'm going to keep going and trying other options because the food looks so good; maybe I'll find a star yet.By the way, this location is way less inviting than the one on Congress: this one on Wells has a few small tables and stools, while the location on Congress is much bigger and a place you might actually want to stay a while."
I never had cuban food before and I came upon this area taking a differnt route walking to work so I decided to check it out with two other friends.It's a small restaurant and the line was long but the delicious food was worth it. I ordered the steak chimichuri sandwich while my other two friends had the cubano and chipotle sandwich. Deliciousness in every bite! I am definitely going back to taste the other dishes and to try some cuban coffee.
The long line is a good sign! And it moves fast! Best sandwiches I have ever had. The Jerk is full of flavorful spice. Great price and quick service! Only criticism is I feel that they should have a larger space for seating! Seems like they have plenty of loyal customers and are extremely busy during the work week. This is my favorite lunch spot in the loop! Great job!!
"I'm hesitant to write a review because I'm afraid I'll have to wait 3 hours outside to get a sandwich.  This place is so good and I want it for myself, but I can't be that selfish.  Great authentic Cuban cuisine (not that I've been to Cuba, but it sure seems authentic).  Try the Cubano.  Delicious!"
"Truly this place can't make anything bad.  I went out on a limb and got the Elveez cause i was craving something sweet and savory, that wasn't a cake or pastry item.  That paired with my cortadito is out of this world.  The Elveez is a twist on the classic Elvis Sandwich.  I think what really ties it together is the guava spread.  Not too sweet yet with a hint of tang brings this sandwich to a whole-another level.  If you're allergic to peanut butter, I'm sorry.  I can't recommend you to risk your life to try this... but I can recommend you other delicious sandwiches on their menu!!!  Breakfast sandwich favorite: the chorizo and egg.  Lunch Sandwich Favorite: The Jerk  They are so filling and satisfying that you don't need chips or sides.  The breakfast sandwich would literally carry you over til Dinner.  And their cortaditos is the energy jolt that you need to get your morning (or mid afternoon) going.  I always ask for half sugar because full sugar is way too much for me.  But you can decide for yourself how you sweet you like your espresso with milk."
"My god, this place is good. I went there for the cafe con leche because I heard it is simply the best. Let me tell you, it is delicious. Its sweet and creamy, and very addicting. I have also gotten the pollo chipotle sandwich and it is also very, very good. There's a nice flavorful kick. This place takes a while to get into during the lunch rush (I was there for 30 minutes before I got my food) but it is worth it."
"Amazing Cuban food! I had the Ropa Vieja which was among st the best in Chicago. Nice juicy skirt steak along with caramelized plantains in a pressed french bread. This place gets super busy during lunch so you may have to get here slightly before lunch if possible. Good dessert options with flan, tres leches cake and dulce de leche cheesecake. All in all. A winner all the way. Will be coming here again for sure!"
"I got the Pollo with Chimichuri sauce.  Fantastic!  Big flavors.  The chicken was a tad on the dry side.  The service was awesome though, even though I went during crowded lunch hour, the cashier happily made a substitution of salad for the rice and beans.  He even asked if there was any specific salad I wanted."
The food is great and the staff is super friendly. Breakfast is just as great as lunch
I've found my favorite sandwich place in the loop. The sandwiches are so good. I time my lunch either early or late to avoid the lines. Because I'm not the only one who appreciates these sandwiches.
Best lunch spot! Always a line out the door at noon so order ahead and pick up. Everything is tasty -- especially the plantains.
"Heard great things about this place, and although it was tasty, it didn't meet my expectations. I got the guava-Q with pulled pork, pineapple, caramelized onions and guava sauce. It was an okay sandwich. The description didn't mention the pineapple so I was surprised when I started eating. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered it (not a fan of putting pineapple on savory dishes).The sandwich is greasy and heavy, like most cuban sandwiches. Not sure if I'd come back for lunch, too heavy for me.It was very fast service, in and out. Although, I've seen times where the line was out the door (obviously around lunch rush hour during the weekdays. 12-1). I came around 1 and there were only 3 people in line."
"Called 30 minutes early to order for a pickup--as did my office mate at the same time.  My friend Oscar's order was ready in 10--mine took 37, and only after I paid, and demanded they make my sandwich, three times.  A (small) ham and cheese sandwich (overpriced at six bucks) took them 37 minutes. Last time for our office."
"I have not yet tried the South Loop location, but I don't think I will, as I will never have to! This location is right by my office and suits me just fine. Cafecito is hands-down the best spot to grab a take-out lunch in the Loop. Each sandwich I have tried is absolutely delicious. The meat portions are fresh and large, the sauces are zesty, and the veggies are crispy! Not to mention the people who work here are always super nice and patient. On my birthday they comped my lunch and threw in some delicious cookies! Don't let the daunting line zooming out the door intimidate you. It is most certainly worth the wait and moves quickly."
"I was looking for a quick, cheaper place to grab lunch in the Loop that wasn't your typical chain and stumbled across a review for Cafecito. It sounded good so I popped over there for lunch today. I met someone there at 1:00 and the line was most definitely still out the door. It does move fast, as other reviewers have noted. I'd say the from the time I got in line to the time I got my sandwich was about 15 minutes. We were able to snag bar stools before our sandwiches came out, but most people weren't that lucky or were already getting their food to go. He got the traditional cubano sandwich while I got the chivito. Both were incredibly tasty. Mine was a little messy, but that's what I get for picking a sandwich with steak, ham, bacon, AND fried egg. I definitely want to come back and try more, since there was some other sandwiches that sounded amazing. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the incredibly small space. It makes for a slightly uncomfortable dining-in experience having people constantly bump into you while you're eating. Other than that, this is one of the best choices for lunch in the Loop!"
"Been longing for a change for lunch ... Tired of Pret, Subway, Corner Bakery, etc. I noticed the line of people waiting outside and returned next day - early. The Exotica salad is fresh, different and delicious! Grilled Shrimp, spinach, corn, avocado, etc.  Mmmmmm, I plan to return to try their sandwiches. I'll let you know if theirs is better than CB's panini with the dried out chicken and hard, inedible bread. Oh, wait!  The prices are not outrageously high either."
"Stopped by for a post-work quick-hit dinner on a Tuesday; fantastic.  Perfectly-cooked bread topped all three of the sandwiches our group got (the Cubano, the Proveletta and the Choripan); prices were fair for the size and they came out in about 10 minutes.  I'm sure this place gets crushed during the lunch hour but for the last hour of their day (they close at 6), it's easy to slide in and get a table.  Make sure to get something with that chimichurri sauce...mmmmm!!"
"When you read 4.5 stars you expect the best of the best, sadly I beg to differ, this is a solid 3 star restaurant at most. Maybe it's more of a sandwich place, because their sandwich selection is very extensive; so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We ordered a wonderful entree of Lechon (roast pork) and rice and beans. The pork came out in thin slices like a turkey breast would. The flavor was Delicious, it had a great cilantro and chopped onion topping to pull it altogether too. And was the clear winner of the night.Sadly I was highly disappointed with my second entree of palomilla (sirloin steak). It was a nice piece of meat, and was cooked well, but sadly was doused in cheap Goya mojo sauce to the point of rendering it inedible. Both plates came with lots of white rice, but sadly not enough beans. Overall, the restaurant is a little hole in the wall, the service was friendly from the young lady behind the counter, but nothing particularly stood out. Growing up in an area full of delicious Cuban food, has clearly made me a total food snob."
Its an amazing Cuban place. For vegetarians I would recommend the Provaletta. I love it and I was shocked because I'm picky
I've been going to Cafecito since 2010 and it can't be beat. It is easily the best sandwiches in the city. The hummus is phenomenal also.
"This place did not disappointed me, worth the price, I mean, delicious but cost low~I love the crispy bread crust outside, 像传统的烧饼，或者是刚出炉的千层饼，""老板，来三块钱的"""
Everything I have had here has been excellent. Best cubano downtown. The jerk chicken sandwich is my personal favorite.  And you can't go wrong with their breakfast sandwiches and coffees. I love this place.
"This place is jam packed, warmer than it needs to be with, and has a small amount of places to sit. That being said, service was efficient which is a must have for a lunch spot.Two stars is for the food - the jerk sandwich was below expectations. There was too much mayo and the chicken was sub-par quality. I might have to come back to try the other sandwiches but wasn't generally impressed by this place."
"I love this place! The coffee is excellent; better than Starbucks, love their Ropa vieja and Cuban sandwich! I would give this place _5 stars,  but they took waaayyy too long to serve my coffee. The sandwich was made faster than the Coffee due to the one who was preparing the coffee was more focused on turning on the music rather than serving the long line of customers."
"Just solid, delicious cuban food. Ordered it twice during my stay in Chicago. Try the guava and cheese dessert. It is flaky deliciousness :)."
"The Ropa Vieja sandwich is delicious, so is the Chivito Their bread is sooo good. Everything I've tried here I've liked. They occasionally have caldo gallego, which I highly recommend, specially in a chilly day.They also have really good coffee. One of the thing I miss most from home (Puerto Rico) is a really good espresso, and Cafecito is one of the best places to get one.The one issue I have is that they don't open late or on the weekends, so I have to go all the way to their south loop location. Also they should consider expanding, you can't eat there during lunchtime. Coming back? All the time!"
The line is forever long - because the food is awesome! Very worth the wait. Pollo Chipotle and Carmel Latte was my meal of choice - 5 stars all around. It wasn't a terribly long wait considering the line length.
"Stopped in here for lunch during my lunch hour based on previous reviews and this place does not disappoint. I ordered the Jerk with Plantain chips and it was about $8. Chicken had a great flavor to it and the mayo and vegetables complimented it very nicely. Sandwich is about the size of a ""regular"" size at Potbellys. Would order this again  in a heartbeat! Plantain chips were very very good and you god a large quantity of them. Plan on visiting this place many more times for lunch and the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because I want to get a few more eating experiences here under my belt!"
"Come here anytime from 11am to 3pm and there will most likely be a line. My lunch buddies and I arrived at 1pm to find the line extended through and out the door. Our line dissected the sidewalk but fortunately, the line moved quick enough to not have caused a nuisance. Two of us ordered the Cubano while the other had the Chivito. A pressed Cuban sandwich is approximately seven inches long and four inches wide. The thickness was perhaps three-quarters of an inch. It's flat and the bread is toasted.The Cubano has roasted pork, ham, Swiss, pickles, and mustard. The mustard is extremely subtle. The sandwich does not have a lot of sauce either. It's not messy and it's great for take-out. The place does not have a lot of seats but most patrons don't linger. We were fortunate enough to grab three seats along the window after waiting for a few minutes."
"The cubano sandwich is so good for lunch. Also, Cafecito is my favorite breakfast spot in the loop. I usually get the Huevos Completo or Bistec con huevos for breakfast! Service is always super fast."
"This is the kind of place that you will eat at more than once a day!The coffee is fantastic here and the cortadito is a perfect way to start the day. Ask for half sugar so that you taste the Cuban espresso. The breakfast sandwiches are fantastic as well; the eggs are always done just right. Try the chorizo, it's a bit spicy but not overpowering. If you're more of just a pastry person, they have a guava jam pastry that's tasty.Come back for lunch! You won't find a better Cuban sandwich in town. The bread has just enough crisp and chew from being pressed. They layer the meats, cheese, pickles and mustard just right, every time. The Guava-Q is a great sandwich if you enjoy having a bit of sweetness with your savory flavors. If you're looking for a side, they have great prepared salads. The eggplant salad is a standout with a nice vinegar bite.There are too many chain coffee places and not enough Cafecitos in this city. Please go enjoy fantastic coffee and amazing sandwiches."
Delicious steak chimichurri pressed sandwich.  Beware of the strong garlic.  Perfect portion for lunch and no major food coma afterwards.  Get the hot sauce.  It's so packed you may not get to sit down so take it to go.
"Cuban sandwiches are delicious, great for lunch, always so busy. They play Cuban music so your bopping awAy standing in line. The service is fast but always with a smile."
"This place is a good 10 minute walk away from my office and I make the trip every time I am in Chicago - sometime even twice! Absolutely love their double cortaditos! I usually get the cubano ( ask them to add some jalapeños for an extra kick!) but others like jerk chicken, chimichurri steak are good too.All this at an amazing price point! It's super crowded during the peak lunch hour - so plan your visit!"
"Great sandwich lunch spot in the Loop - for ~$8 you can get a drink, chips and one of their pressed sandwiches, which is a relative steal in comparison to some other choices. It's a smallish joint, so perhaps don't expect to find a seat, but the food is great. Hard to go away from the Cubano, but also check out the Pavo (turkey + bacon + avocado). Will be back!"
"I came here after having a great experience at the other Cafecito a couple of blocks away, only to find out it was closed (it closes at 6pm). Other than that, it's a great lunch place with amazing sandwiches at a good price."
Anyone in favor of the embargo obviously hasn't had an authentic Cuban caffe con leche.
"Love this place. Right next to Chicago's Hostel International location, it's a cute little place right off the street painted in cheerful colours with FIFA playing on the flatscreen. Because of the international scene, the ambience is quite vibrant. Many of the Cuban sandwiches are vegetarian friendly, though many of them will also staisfy the carnivore in your friend group. I got the Margarita, a tomato, basil and mozzarella combo slathered in balsamic that will melt in your mouth. Plus, their array of hot sauces make sure to add just the kick you need to any of the sandwiches you like. The coffee is also fantastic, though I do recommend if you want a milkshake in the summer to get there early. They ran out of every flavor by the time I got there!"
The best time to go after 2pm when there isn't a long line for lunch. They have the most delicious cafe con leche in the area.
"Delicious Cuban sandwiches that will not disappoint. Chimichurri (with Steak or Chicken) is fantastic. The bread is not too thick, not too thin, and perfectly crunchy. The meat is juicy. The Chimichurri sauce (olive oil, parsley, and garlic I suspect) goes great with the sandwich.  Also good is the Cubano. I tried it at their other location and it was great."
"Dump the Subways. Dump the Jimmy Johns and Jersey Mikes. Dump the Pot Belly's, the Corner Bakery, and the Panera. If you want the best sandwich for your Loop lunch break, head on over to Cafecito. These guys are serving up delicious pressed sandwiches, with better ingredients and for less than all their more well known competitors in the area. Try the Cubano sandwich. It is pork perfection. The jerk chicken sandwich will defenitely have you coming back for more.Lines can get long but they move people in and out quick. This is the perfect lunch option for those looking to grab something quick and cheap and eat it back at the office. Cafecito is 100% a work lunch gem. Thanks to Cafecito lunchtime sandwiches have never been better."
I've gone back a few times - Jerk chicken & Proveleta are both great as is the black bean soup. Continued satisfaction!
"The delicious Cubano here will cheer me up any day when its 30 degrees in April in Chitown. Filled with tender roasted flavorful pork and melty cheese, it is perfectly soft and crunchy at the same time. Although, I think they could amp up the mustard a little and the pickles could add a little more flavor. One of the great sandwiches in the loop!Also tried one of the thin danish-looking pastries that was filled with guava and topped with powdered sugar. It was muy tasty and I liked the tinge of sourness from the guava. For my drank I had a yerba mate soda and it was really good, but loaded with sugar, oh well. Tip: Seating is limited in this tiny place. The line starts getting long around 11:30 but it does move pretty fast. Tip 2: They serve breakfast! I haven't tried it but you can get a tasty sounding sandwich for around $3-4"
Yum yum yum! Love this place. As a person from Miami it is hard to find good cuban in Chicago. Cafecito hits the spot with amazing cafe con leche and cortaditos! All the sandwiches are delicious as well.
"Had the Jardin sandwich the second time around and that was much more of what I expected. Less Italian and more Cuban, I guess. It was a good sandwich. Things are relative, but I had just had another ethnic sandwich the day before which was excellent, so relatively at that level."
Authentic cheap sandwiches. Decent spot to grab something more flavorful and interesting than the typical subway sandwich. Not much other than sandwiches though which is a let down.
"Call ahead and place your order (5 minutes or so before your pickup) to avoid super long lines during the lunch hour. You can just line up, pay, pickup, and leave.The sandwiches are great, though I'm not sure I'd recommend the Jardin -- something about the eggplant smelled a little off. Other than that I've loved the steak chimichurri, ropa vieja. Call now, and get your Cuban on (:Bon appetit! Oh wait, that's French."
This place has awesome sandwiches. I work nearby and always saw a line so I never wanted to wait in line to try it out. Two weeks ago I didn't see nearly as long a line so I waited in line to get the Cubano sandwich...it was worth the wait. Since then I've been back 3 times getting different sandwiches like jerk chicken and guava chicken and I'll keep coming back because they were also delicious. They also have breakfast and coffees and salads so I'll try those out later. Prices are very reasonable for being downtown. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the place is very small with VERY limited seating and even if u get a seat u feel scrunched because so many people are hovering waiting for their food. Service is really friendly and not that fast but not slow either.  It is definitely fast enough for a quick bite to eat.  Try to get there before 11:30 if u want to beat the lunch line.
"Excellent hot sandwiches and salad. I normally don't like sandwiches much, but this place is awesome!  I've had the cubano, chimichurri steak, and jerk chicken sandwiches and also the exotica salad. All are very fresh, tasty, and good prices. Service is efficient and organized. Location is very close to my office. I really can't ask for more."
"When you walk by, you would never guess this place has nearly the best sandwich menu in the city, breakfast and lunch.  I have done lunch at this place a few times, always a line, sometimes one, other times a few to many.  I went for breakfast, standard oatmeal wasn't going to cut it today, the huevo con corizzo was perfect.  Some people swear by the coffee beverages, still need to try myself.  Loved the breakfast so much this morning went back for lunch.  This place never disappoints!"
"The food is not only alive with flavor, but there is variety, so if you're vegan, or you just don't feel like meat, they have something for you too.  The cubano is ham and marinated pork and is the best pressed sandwich I've ever had. I used to think a cubano was just a ham sammich with a spanish name... I've been enlightened.  I've also had their chorizo and egg breakfast sandwich.  I'm a chorizo fiend and have had a lot of different varieties, but this chorizo is one of the better ones: not drippy/fatty, great seasoning and the sandwich has the right mix of chorizo and egg.I heard good things about their coffee too, so I tried a cup.  Again, their rep holds up.Portions are just right and service is quick and friendly enough. Keep in mind, it's a small downtown cafe, so plan on getting your stuff to go, unless you go during off-peak hours.  There is always a line and for good reason."
"I don't write many reviews, but I love this place. They have dozens of great Cuban / Caribbean sandwiches, each one as good as the next. It's such a nice break from the boring options of Jimmy John's, Potbelly, and many of the other normal Loop sandwich shops. The place is really small (I'd recommend carry out only) but they're extremely efficient and do a great job getting through the line. Often times the one guy will ask what he can get started for you while you're in line and it'll be ready right after you pay. Having said all that, please don't go here, I prefer it stay a hidden gem. Thank you."
The cafe con leche reminds me of my grandma's cafe con leche. I can have that all day. I also had the cubano sandwich which was less than okay for me. I have had better ones in Chicago.
We tried 4 different items and they were all delicious. The best were the cuban sandwich and the ropa vieja. The mamey m milk shake and the caldo gallegow were also excellent. Parking is a problem.
"I really like eating at Cafecito.  They have really good sandwiches and salads.  However, some of the food can be a bit greasy and heavy which isn't ideal when you are working.  Also, the lines can be a bit long sometimes.  To avoid the lines, I recommend using Grubhub to order ahead of time."
"Cafecito... what a place. Of course, the cuban is impeccable and fresh, but every other sandwich I've had is awesome as well. I recommend anything with their chimichurri, or the chivito. AND THE CAFECITO - don't forget that they're named after an excellent expresso drink! Super sweet espresso treat. Everything is at a great price as well."
"Cozy location. Nice staff. The Proveletta is amazing and a great vegetarian dish! Comes with grilled provolone, roasted red peppers and the famous Chimichurri sauce on toasty bread. Yum yum! Hands down, best cafe con leche in town!"
Great place with long lines that's how you know it's going
I had the Tilapia Criolla and the Cubano. I also tried the potato salad and the pasta salad. The tilapia was very good. I really enjoyed it and that's saying something since I usually find it to be very plain and not exciting in the least. But the real star was the Cubano. It was a flavor explosion. I could've eaten three.The sides were both very forgettable. Not gross but I prolly wouldn't ever order a side if I ever go back (Since I don't live in Chicago I prolly won't). Service was on point. They were quick and courteous.The sandwiches were a bit small. But all in all it was a good meal. If I worked near here I'd prolly eat this twice a month or so.
Delicious sandwiches at a decent price. It's a small place usually with a bit of line but it moves fast and I have always been lucky enough to find a seat.Recommend: Cubano and Guava-Q!
"More of a 3.5. Waited in line for about 5 minutes and additional 7 minutes for my sandwich. It was rather packed in there and can be uncomfortable, but we quickly got a seat.I had the jerk chicken sandwich. It was pretty good and tasty. However, it didn't remind me anything of 'jerk' at all. The seasonings and spices were rather mild. The habanero lime mayo virtually had no kick to it. It was still good but disappointed, as I was hoping for something spicier. The red onions were also lacking, as I noticed only a few very thin and tiny slices. The chicken itself was juicy and fresh. The bread was nice and crispy. It was nice that they have an assortment of baked goods and a coupon online for free coffee or soft drink. Overall, pretty good portion for the price, and nice flavor, though I'm not sure it is that authentic. Maybe my expectations were too high but I do not find myself needing to go back, but wouldn't mind trying some other sandwiches there."
"This Puerto Rican girl was in heaven here with the rice and beans (which reminded me of my childhood), Cuban sandwich and jerk chicken sandwich that we tried while we were visiting here. My husband still can't stop talking about the Cuban coffee and how smooth and delicious it was. We were in and out quickly but it was worth the stop."
"I was not expecting there to be good vegetarian options at a cuban sandwich place, but there were many, and I definitely want to try them all! My first brush with the greatness of Cafecito was the provolone, red pepper and chimichurri sandwich. This was beyond delicious -- melty cheese, warm crispy bread, spicy chimichurri (a little oily, not too oily). Perfection.  My omnivore coworkers raved about their ropa vieja and classic cubano. Go early or late to avoid long lines at peak lunch times. This location is also less than ideal for dining in (due to limited space and being very bustling at lunch). You're better off taking your sandwich to go."
"This is another one of those places with a cult following, which always intrigues me and makes me want to see if they live up to the hype. I will say this much, the sandwiches are good, some better than others, but I'm not sure it meets cult following status in my foodie book. I went here in the beginning to check out the Cubano. One of my all-time favorite sandwiches. I was disappointed. To be fair I have not found a Cubano in Chicago that blows me away (yet). I've forgiven them for the lackluster Cuban sandwich and moved on to the tilapia, jerk and guava-Q (so far). The Guava-Q wins for me. It is a simple and delectable 3 ingredient sandwich - roasted pork, bbq and caramelized onions. It's a beautiful thing. I would rank the jerk sandwich right up there. And the Cuban and tilapia are well, eh. I say go, it's worth a trip."
Always packed whenever I go but I'm happy to wait. Cuban coffee is delicious and the Chimichurri sauce is also very good. A solid lunch spot. No complaints.
"You know the food is worth waiting for when you see a line outside day after day.  My personal favorite combo is the Elveez with a side of black beans and rice.  All vegan and all yum, yum crave-able.  And friends and coworkers I have taken there (none have even been vegetarian so they have tried lots of options) have thanked me.  Seating is limited so I always take mine to-go."
"Real Cuban sandwich.. Something that is hard to find anywhere. The meats were delicious and the bread nice and crusty. Coffee is amazing! My first trip today, but won't be my last."
Their Exotica salad is amaaZing  you need to have it with both. Shrimp and chicken. I would say one of the best salads I've ever had. I would definetly go again. Also people are great and fast service. Freaky fast lol
"While frequenting my favorite Starbucks (shout out to the Madison/Wells location, you guys are the best) I noticed Cafecito. The things I've had so far have made me want to try everything on the menu. Cubano sandwich, perfection. Ropa Vieja sandwich, it's like the skirt steak melts in your mouth. There is ALWAYS a line...but I like lines...it means the food is good! The service is quick and really friendly. This place is amazing!"
"This is a take out place with a small seating selection.  It is worth the wait in line.  Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.  Don't forget they have breakfast.  Prices are also reasonable."
"Sandwich quality = 5 stars (I recommend the Ropa Vieja, Chivito, Jerk, Chimichurri or Tilapia). Double cafecito and guava pastry for breakfast or snack = 5 stars. The space is very small even by Loop standards, but the coffee and sandwich punch cards are a nice perk for the regulars. The line gets very long at lunch so order online to avoid the wait. Enjoy!"
"Great food - quick service!  I love the chicken chimichurri, red potato salad, and (of course) the Cubano sandwiches.  Entrees come with a generous portion of rice, beans, and plantains.I order online to pick up, so I have never waited more than a few minutes for my order.  I'm looking forward to trying the Ropa Vieja.Awesome place to pick up dinner if it's on your way home."
"I've visited both locations and yes, I have to admit that I am a fan. I've only ordered two sandwiches (Jerk chicken and the one with roasted red peppers). I don't even like mayo and I loved the mayo that came with the jerk chicken. I found myself dunking the sandwich in the little sauce cup several times. The roasted red peppers sandwich was a bit bland. It could have used some more chimichurri sauce. I've never eaten inside but these sandwiches are a perfect escape from places like Panera, Chipotle, etc."
"I've heard about this place for a while and decided to try their coffee. For only 2.39 (small) and 2.59 + tax (large), you can get an awesome cafe con leche. I'm addicted. They serve other traditional Cuban coffee drinks as well as more traditional lattes, cappuccinos, etc. Great coffee and great prices. I will have to go back and try their food!"
"Great place, small space, large menu.  Like the coffee & deli offerings in addition to the Jardin sandwich.  Long line, but fast service.  Can't wait to try more."
"If you're sick of all the regular, boring sandwich places, try a bit of Cuban flair. Cafecito has a handful of mouth-watering choices that have ingredients like chimichurri sauce, avocado mayo and guava BBQ sauce. The ""Cubano"" is their most popular sandwich so I had to try it--roasted pork, ham, Swiss, pickles, mustard--add a little hot sauce and it's delicious. My friend and I also shared the ""Jardin"" (with eggplant, roasted peppers, mozzarella, mushroom, arugula, jalepeno hummus) and the heart of palm salad--both delicious.Though the sandwiches look small, they're filling. As the other reviews have mentioned, very limited seating (about 4-5 tables) and long lines during peak times, but the line moves fast. You can also sign up to get discounts via text. There's a hot sauce cabinet on the wall in the back if you're looking to add some more kick to your sandwich. I'll have to go back to try their breakfast sandwiches and some Cuban coffee."
Just left there and although there was a mixup with my order and I ended up waiting over 25min the girl at the front counter was really nice and gave me a free cookie and slice of cake. Sandwich was delicious and the price was verrrry reasonable for the loop. Definitely coming back
Everytime I come here I'm more satisfied than the previous visit.  Must get their cafe con leche- perfection.I've tried about half of the item on their menu and all are excellent. You can't go wrong.But what you cannot miss is their tres leches cake. OMG. Excellent quick spot if you want good food.  You just have to wait for a table- space is limited and tables are small.
"thanking the cafecito gods for dropping this little guy right across the street from my client. the carbon copy of their big brother in the south loop. expect the same quality, style, and TLC you get from the south loop location. the only difference here is the size (of the location, not the portions. relax. ha.). it's teeeny tiny. but size doesn't matter, right?..the chivito is my go to for lunch (ham & fried egg). i'll usually head back there around 3pm for my daily cortadito (cuban espresso w milk) and mexican wedding cookie (my favorite cookie in the whole wide world). the line is cray at noon, so plan accordingly. owner and manager are wonderful, so too is everything on the menu. you just don't ever lose when you come here."
"I went here based on a friends recommendation, and damn is it good.  This is a lunch spot in the loop so you can expect a crowd, and its not open on the weekends, since nothing else in this hood is open weekends.  I went for the ropa vieja, and they had just ran out after a busy lunch rush.  I settled for the steak chimchuri which was awesome, and mos definitely going back for the Ropa.Also the cafe con leche is off the hook."
A little sandwich shop with a lot of flavor. The decor has a cut Cuban flair. The chimichurri is on point! There was a line out the door and for good reason. If you are looking for a authentic Cuban sandwich shop at lunch- this is your place.
"I love this place.Double cafecito with a breakfast sandwich.  The large Cuban black bean soup with the tilapia sandwich.  You can't go wrong.If you like lines and people watching awesome business people being awesome and wearing collared shirts, come at noon.  Otherwise come at 3, order right away, listen to a little Juanes and dream a little dream of Castro."
"If you work in the loop, you have to try cafecito.  you just have to.  and after discovering this fine cuban sandwich establishment and adding it to your weekly lunch routine, you will take me there and buy me my lunch because you will be soo happy that i directed you there.kidding (ehhh) aside, this place is a great spot to add to the lunch mix for people in the loop and surrounding area.  It's fantastically cheap for the quality of food.  Something different than just the same 10 stops I normally go to.be warned, there is usually a big line during lunch time, so go before or after the rush unless you have time to wait."
"Have you been to the other Cafecito in the south end of the Loop? If not, read one of the hundreds of reviews for that location to get an idea of the food here. It's pretty much the exact same menu, which is definitely a good thing. I got my favorite combination, the classic Cuban sandwich and the heart of palm salad and was very satisfied.The big difference between this and the original location is the size of it. Whereas the Congress location is a great place to relax, there's not really much space here. There are a few tables, but it's not worth really sitting at them when you have all your personal space taken away by a large line of hungry people.Of course, that just speaks to how good the food is here. If you haven't been to a Cafecito yet and you work downtown, put this next on your to-try list. Just try to not come right at noon."
"I can't put my finger on what's meh, other than after giving this place 4 opportunities, I've experienced so much better elsewhere in the order of Cuban sandwiches and Cuban food. Granted, these other places aren't in Chicago. However, locales aside, Cafecito seems more like a pedestrian Panini joint than a Cuban hole-in-the-wall. . First of all, if this is authentic Cuban, my many visits to Little Havana (Miami) must be merely dreams, as I'm not seeing or tasting the similarities. Cuban style aside, the too much mayonnaise in their tuna, or overbearing salt in their Cuban sandwiches, makes for an overpriced lunch that leaves an I can do better dining elsewhere feel."
"Went during the lunch hour, the line was out the door. With good reason too! The price is right and the food was great.I got the steak chimichuri, and I totally spelled that wrong, but it was delicious. The steak was tender and the bread was perfectly toasted on the outside, with a little extra sauce on the inside of the sandwich. The sauce was a lot like a pesto, except it had almost a hint of horseradish to it, which was a pleasant surprise.I'll be back again without fail, hopefully bringing coworkers here too, to share in this quaint little cuban sandwich shop."
"Great sandwiches.  We went there for dinner last night and we loved the Cubano, had a great combination of meats, pickle, mustard and very tasty bread grilled to perfection!My daughter had their mango shake, it was a hit and we all kept 'stealing' sips of hers, it was soooo good.  ;)"
"Well done sir! I said to myself for picking this place for lunch.As with many other places in the loop, it's packed for lunch.  But it's a small place so you do notice.  Nevertheless they do a good job of making the line move.  It was probably 10 minutes in and out.I opted for the cubano, due to it supposedly being the best they have on offer.  Since the sandwiches looked a bit smallish I went for a side of Cuban black bean soup.Very nice on both counts, especially the soup.  Interesting spice.  For sure, Cafecito has pot bellies beat in the sando and side soup category.  You'll pay about a buck more but it's worth it.Apparently there's another Cafecito towards Michigan. so this isn't their first location like I originally thought.  I'll go out on a limb a guess they'll be a third soon."
"This is definitely a 5-star worthy place, but it was negative 1 star right off the bat because when we arrived, they had no record of the order we had called in less than 5 minutes early.  In a place this tiny and busy, the amount of disorganization we encountered could really ruin an experience.  In addition to them losing our phoned in order the first girl we asked (who was passing out orders as they came up) told us just to get in line.  Another group came in right after us and went right to the cashier for their phone order so we did the same which is when we discovered they had no record of our order being phoned in.  The cashier did take our order immediately upon dicsovering it has been lost, and the food (5 sandwiches) came up pretty quickly thereafter.  Nonetheless it was irritating to have to wait around when we phoned in and order specifically to avoiding having to stand around waiting in the showbox sized restaurant.That said, the food was totally worth the minor irritation.  I had the Ropa Vieja which was skirt steak with sweet plantaines and black beans.  The plantaines were well cooked and their sweetness was a nice balance to the mild spice of the marinated steak.  The steak was deliciously tender and juicy."
"Snaps to my coworkers for pointing this place out to me. Yes, it's busy. Yes, it's small. Yes, it's delicious.I had the Guava-Q Chicken sandwich, sans-onions. Really freaking delicious. For $6 you get a good-sized sandwich, which in my opinion is a pretty good deal in this area at lunch. I didn't get any of the sides, but I did treat myself to a slice of Tres Leches cake for dessert. Each one of my coworkers was raving about their choices, ranging from sandwiches to coffee to the platters. I can't recommend Cafecito enough, they were fast & efficient, and the sandwiches were great."
"This place is incredible. Wait can get long at lunch time, but one of the better sandwiches I've ever had. The prices are really low and the quality is really high."
"Came in on a whim looking for something to eat and could not have been more pleased. Quick service, cheap prices and delicious food. I'll definitely be back. CAFECITO!"
"I've had a Cubano in Miami and I've had a Cubano in Colorado but I've never had a Chivito in Chicago until 10 minutes ago. I think I just found what I've been missing in my life. (Other than millions and a rich, hot husband)"
"I was excited to hear that a Cuban place would be opening nearby for another lunch option.  We tried it Friday, and it will definitely have a regular place in our lunch rotation.  I got the Cubano and the Lechon w/ rice and beans platter.  Someone else got the Ropas platter and said it was very good.  My pork was excellent.  I was a bit disappointed with the rice and beans by itself, but when mixed with the pork and a couple splashes of Melinda's hot sauce, it was very good.  The Cubano was a bit dry and could have used either more mustard or more pickles (next time I'll order with extra pickles), but the quality was excellent, and I'd try it again for sure.  I'm looking forward to trying many of their sandwich choices - there are a lot.Interesting observation by the guy who likes to run and get lunch for us (always him and me, sometimes others in the office):  he said this is the only place he's seen downtown that had a line at 11:00am, and the line was longer when he was walking out.  I'd call that a good sign."
"I was prepared for a crowd especially as I came at the cusp of lunch rush during a warm day. The line moved very quickly, and I was able to scope out the menu/other people's dishes while I waited for my order to be taken. After seeing the movie The Chef, I had a Cuban sandwich monkey on my back. All sandwiches are made to order; I went with the Cubano - roasted pork, ham, Swiss, pickles and mustard. According to the takeout menu, this sandwich is rated #1 in Chicago, so I decided this would be a good introduction. The bulletin board outside swayed me into adding on an iced coffee. The coffee was good and strong, not bitter like Starbucks and with a better ice-to-coffee ratio to boot. At some point I would like to return to try the eponymous Cafecito (Cuban espresso with a teaspoon of sugar). I highly recommend the sandwich that I ordered, and found it to be a welcome change from my usual Potbelly and Subway fare. The bread was perfectly crisp and the meat tender. I decided to eat in, and had no problem finding a perch at the counter, especially since most of the customers were getting their items to go. The presentation was excellent, even for takeout, as I am always partial to sandwiches cut on the diagonal. Even though the spot is tiny the flow makes sense, and I did not feel jostled or hemmed in at all. I can definitely see coming here mid-morning, for a pick-me-up of churros and Cuban Coffee. Tip: be sure to grab a take-out menu from the counter for coupons off to use on the next visit."
"It's delicious.  I had the Ropa Viejo and would come back again and again there are so many yummy things on the menu to try. The sides dishes look good, and if you have a sweet tooth - this is your place.  Key Lime pie and about a dozen other sweet treats on display in the case.  Try it.  You'll like it."
Pretty good. Cheap and Fast. Order at the counter and they bring it out to you. I had the cubano and it was delicious. They also have free refills which is nice. Wouldnt mind going back here if I was in the area.
"Just mih. Not authentic Cuban food, just a ""take"" on Cuban food. The bread is French bread and the beans are from a can and overly seasoned with what tastes like cheap Goya mojo. Not good at all. On a side note, hummus side in a Cuban place but no tostones?! Plus the consistently high ratings have given the staff there an ego because what I can only guess is the owner or manager was jerky as hell. Disappointed."
"I went in this morning very hungry but came out a bit disappointed. So I ordered the ""Timba"" it's the guava and swiss cheese sandwich. I was expecting to bite into something very delicious but it fell short due to not enough guava jam it was barely in there.... For $3.99 it was NOT worth it!Second I ordered a small decaf ice coffee. She suggested she can make me a decaf americano. I said fine. However, they made me a large ice coffee and charged me for 2 espresso shots which I did not ask for! I let the large size go but when I got to the office and looked at the receipt they ripped me off a whole extra $1 for something I didn't want. I am hoping this is truly decaf because I am pregnant and if I get the shakes from this I will be calling them!I might give them another try for lunch one day and I am hoping that it might be a better experience..."
"For  a lunch place in the loop: definitely five stars. Probably one of the only places I'll actually eat at downtown. So many of the other options are just plain bad. But cafecito has great sandwiches (tried them all) and I highly recommend it as a break from chains. Be sure to call ahead with your order to skip the lines if you want jump in and out. If your fine with waiting 15 minutes, just pop in and bob awkwardly to the tango music with all of the other white business people. Definitely recommend."
This is what you need to do: Find a lunch date for this place and get there around 11:30 so you have time to talk while waiting in line. Order your sandwiches and find a sunny place nearby to enjoy them. I recommend the Jerk Chicken which is fantastic. Get a medium side of the Assorted Olives which are spicy but very fun to eat. End the lunch date by making out with someone that will have just as spicy as lips as you from those olives.
"The El Veez was a next level PB&J sandwich with sweet, hot, thick plaintains, guava jam, and peanut butter. the crunchy bread added texture"
"This place is great with flavorful and filling sandwiches. However, my favorite thing from here is their Cafe con Leche, which is a mix of their ""cafecito"" cuban espresso with sugar and milk. Although I don't want to further lengthen the lines in the morning for their coffee and breakfast sandwiches, I highly recommend."
"Wow.. i just had my first cafecito sandwich.  AMAZING.  I had to order the pollo chipotle because they ran out of ropa viejo (oh well , just a nother reason to come back again).  Walked in wanting to order ropa vieja, not knowing I would walk out ordering my newly corwnd favorite chicken sandwich ever. For sandwiches in general, Cafecito has what truly is the epitome of a perfect sandwich.  Forget that double decker nonsense.  You can fit the whole sandwich in your mouth and have the perfect bite of ingredients through out your whole sandwich experience, AND without a mess!  Fresh, not too cheesy, mayoey -JUST RIGHT.The pollo chipotle has mozzerella, basil, chipotle mayo, chicken, and i added onions.  The chicken was perfectly marinated and grilled. Not just thrown on a grill bare, but with a little citrus and some other flavors.  I hate when sandwiches have too thick, or crispy of bread you can't even bite into it- ANNOYING.  Cafecito's bread is what you think of when i think of  'perfect sandwich bread'.  Its the perfect thickness (or thinness, shall I say), warm and chewy, with a perfectly light crisp! The freshness and crispness of the basil with the citrus from the chicken hit so contrastingly wonderful against the savory and creamy chipotle mayo. I will be back. I was so full and tried to force feed myself the entrire sandwich it was so good.Another bonus!  Service and staff are great.  It is a busy spot for lunch, and normally these type of places try to move you out quickly and rudely and you just take it because you know its a busy place.  However, HERE, Staff was accomodating and friendly even though there was a huge rush.  Even gave me some menu suggestions.There are only two locations, but this needs to change.  They need to open up multiple locations and replace all the potbellys.  This needs to be the official sandwich shop of chicago."
"Overall, I was pleased with the sandwich, but I was not pleased with the shot of cafecito (Cuban espresso).  Sandwich:  I got the Chimichurri.  For the price, I expected the meat to be dry and tough.  Surprisingly, the meat was tender and flavorful!  I would definitely get a bag of chips on the side in the future, though. Cuban espresso:  Needs improvement.  After spending time in Miami, I know what Cuban espresso/colada/cafecito should taste like.  I got my Cuban espresso in Brickell in Miami, and I'm not sure there is more authentic Cuban coffee outside of Havana.  The cuban espresso at Cafecito wasn't quite right.   Cuban coffee should be made with raw sugar and have a molasses-sweet flavor.  When I bought a shot of Cuban espresso at the shop on Wells, it tasted like a shot of espresso with white sugar added at the end.  Something just didn't taste right.  Nutshell:  Food is tasty and a GREAT value.  Cuban espresso needs improvement.  Then again, after having Cuban coffee in Miami, I might have overly high expectations."
I heard about this place from a few people so I decided to check it out and all I can say is amazing. I use to live in Miami and this place reminded me of the Cuban coffee I use to get everyday. Best coffee in Chicago. The food was amazing as well. I had a chimmicurri steak sandwich and it was unbelievable. I can't wait to go back.
Tried the chicken chimichurri sandwich here ! The chimichurri sauce was a delight! Definitely going back here :)
"Love this place!  Who would have thought a place in the loop of Chicago within a hostel would have this great food?  Love their sammies and customers.  Great diverse group of folks chowing down on pretty authentic Cuban sammies (heck, I'm not Cuban but they seemed delish and pretty authentic to me).  It gets crowded at lunch.  Lots of Columbia College and DePaul kids hit this place up.  I usually get my sammie to go.  They also have the real Cuban coffee if you like that stuff.  Too strong for me but some folks I work with love it.  I freakin love this place!"
Wow!!!!  Best cubano sandwich I've had in Chicago. The bread makes the sandwich and they have that right. The Cuban black bean soup is by far the best I have ever had. The pesto and pork sandwich is amazing. Price and portion is great. This is a Jen in the city. Go at 11:30 or after1:00 to avoid the 1/2 block long line at lunchtime.
"Eeh... I LOVE Cuban sandwiches and I was really happy to hear about this place.  However, this really didn't live up to my expectations.  There were some pros, the ingredients on the sandwich were correct.  This is important because most of the Cuban sandwiches I've tried in chicago do not have the correct ingredients.  What I had an issue with was the exterior of the bread.  It didn't have that yummy crunchy, buttery goodness that you're supposed to get.  Oh well, the search for a good Cuban sandwich in Chicago continues...."
"Just had the coffee yesterday. For a place called Little Coffee, I thought it was their specialty.  It wasn't very good and the service could be better. Can't speak for the food but the coffee was bad. I'll pass next time."
"Great coffee (café con leche) Food is alright. I wouldn't call it authentic but it isn't bad. I rarely will eat the food here, but always grab coffee."
"Have had the real deal in Miami and nothing I've had since has really compared, but this place is close.  The cuban sandwich here was well done, tasty and will definitely bring me back.  The menu had other offerings I would like to try one day as well."
Service is quick and the employees are friendly ! Coffee and breakfast sandwiches are delicious ! Only down side is that they are small ! Should def expand !
"Absolutely, incredibly, mind-blown, delicious! Ok---I may be overstating (it's just a sandwich) but I really was blown away by this place. This is a gem and deserves to be on Triple D. I had the Jerk chicken which actually had (gasp!) real, juicy, house-rubbed, chicken breasts grilled in house from actual fresh chicken (gasp!). I think I got about 1.5-2 chicken breasts cut into thick chunks topped with an incredibly light yet zesty habenero-lime mayo. The bread was fresh and incredibly flavorful! This place puts Potbelly, Subway (not even in the same universe), and especially that abomination Pret A Manger to shame. Oh---and did I mention the sandwich is $5.89? This place is going to blow up when word starts spreading so I hope quality doesn't go down. Let's say it was so good I was basically on my way out for another one for dinner as soon as I finished lunch...My highest recommendation for what is the best sandwich for under $6 you can get in Chicago."
"I love it here! Everything is delicious, and reasonably priced. The Jerk Chicken is probably my favorite, I love the Guava Q as well. The black beans and rice are a yummy side, and a Mexican Wedding cookie for dessert is perfect. I want to try their whole menu."
"I've only been here a couple of times, so I'm still a little bit limited on what they have.  But I can say this much, they make tasty sandwiches of different styles, and their coffees are great.  Also they have some good blended fruit drinks which are great at lunch.The place itself is kinda tiny, making it crowded at lunchtime, but I haven't had a problem finding a table - they seem to have a lot of pick-up customers vs sit-in.  Service is fast, and so far reliable, no issues with my non-oniony requests! I know I'm going to be coming back here again, and I'll probably update this review with more detail as I go along.  Until proven otherwise (and hopefully not!), this place is going to stay in my list of lunch spots in the loop to recommend."
"Maybe I ordered the wrong sandwich or had massively high expectations, but I felt a little underwhelmed with my lunch here!  I'm not calling it quits, mind you, but I was hoping for a little more...magic?Line out the door at 1 pm, but it moves pretty fast.  There were a few tables inside, but it's crowded because of everyone waiting in line so I'd take your sandwich outside or back to your desk.  Girl behind the counter was efficient but friendly and calling everyone ""sweetie.""  I was beyond torn between the Chimichurri, the Jerk, and the Guava-Q but finally settled for the Jerk hoping for something spicy.  Only set me back around $6, probably the cheapest Loop lunch I've had so far!  My sandwich was up fast, and I took it to the outdoor seating at Au Bon Pan down the street - bwahahaha.  I love mooching on other restaurants' patios.I eagerly tore into my sandwich and found it...pretty ordinary!  Whaaaat??  I mean it has good qualities - bread has perfect light-crisp texture, and chicken was clearly fresh grilled.  There was also lots and lots of chicken, so you're getting a lot of bang for your buck.  But the sandwich was really lacking in the flavor department.  It needed salt, and more than anything else it needed spice!  If I read ""habanero-lime mayo"" on a menu, I expect some lip-tingling action.  I know this is 'Murrica and we don't like things as spicy as in other countries, but I mean, this is a Cuban restaurant.  Give me the habanero.  Maybe some people would find it spicy (though I can't fathom who has such sensitive taste buds) but I didn't.  It just tasted like mayonnaise.  I really thought it was just plain mayonnaise.  Bummer!  The chicken was juicy and well-grilled but I also didn't get much ""jerk"" flavor from it.  Uncool!I don't know, the reviews here are so good that I'm willing to give them another chance.  I'll have to try something else next time.  Maybe they screwed up and put plain mayo on it?  I guess my recommendation would be to order the most ingredient-full, flavor-packed sounding stuff on the menu.  My sandwich erred too much toward bland, and I have to hope it was just a one time fluke!"
"I just want to start by saying that I am only giving it 4 stars because I used to go to the one in the South Loop and it is much more spacious. That's the ONLY reason.I have been going to Cafecito since I started at Columbia College so probably like 6 years. The food is unbelievable. The bread is warm and soft, but not too soft. It still has a nice crustiness about it that Cuban bread is supposed to have.I love the desserts. There is usually a variety but I love the Tres Leches and the Mexican wedding cookies. And you can't go wrong with Flan.I'm vegetarian so I have never gotten the Cuban Sandwich but people rave about it and say it's the best thing they have put in their mouth!! I like the Elvez and the mozzarella, basil and tomato sandwich. I'm a huge coffee drinker. I can drink it all day, everyday. And if I don't I'm a dick to people. But one time I went with a classmate and he said.. ""have you ever had their hot chocolate?"".. I thought... ""How strange to want hot chocolate as an adult""but then...I took a sip of his and I understood. The cinnamon and the milkiness and the perfect amount of chocolate. Seriously.. do yourself a favor and get the hot chocolate.Then get coffee after if you really need to, because their cortaditos are perfect also.Please, Cafecito owner, please open a location in Noble Square. There is nothing like that in that area. Please!"
"Reasonably priced, good food that's close to my office!  The lunch line is long but they're efficient and get your order taken in advance."
"This is my new favorite lunch spot! There is always a line out the door during the lunch rush, mostly because the space itself is very, very small (albeit cute). I love sandwiches and Cafecito's have the most flavor for this price range I've ever come across! I always wondered how I could so easily get bored of Potbelly's or Subway or Quizno's, and then I started coming here and each sandwich had its own unique flavor profile and they're all absolutely delicious. My favorites are the Jerk and the Cubano. Filling, flavorful, cheap...what more could you want?"
"The food was very good. A bit too crowded and disorganized to get food, but nothing out of the ordinary for the area. The soup was great, and their sandwiches are very good. Some of the best Cuban food I have had in the city."
